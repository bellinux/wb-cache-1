Based on our finding that <b>cobalt</b> metalloporphyrin <b>catalyzes</b> dioxygen reduction near 0 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), the electrocatalytic kinetics of oxygen reduction {{has been studied}} by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk voltammetric methods. A possible reaction mechanism is suggested for the observed catalysis. In the presence of cyanide, the electrocatalytic reductive current for dioxygen is decreased due to the strong binding of cyanide ions to the cobalt metal center. A simplified model is proposed to describe this poisoning effect based on the Koutecky-Levich theory and coordination equilibrium between cyanide and the electrocatalyst. The model is well supported by the experimental results. The poisoning effect {{can be used for}} highly sensitive cyanide detection. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Several <b>cobalt</b> {{complexes}} <b>catalyze</b> {{the evolution}} of hydrogen from acidic solutions, both homogeneously and at electrodes. The detailed molecular mechanisms of these transformations remain unresolved, largely owing {{to the fact that}} key reactive intermediates have eluded detection. One method of stabilizing reactive intermediates involves minimizing the overall reaction free-energy change. Here, we report a new cobalt(I) complex that reacts with tosylic acid to evolve hydrogen with a driving force of just 30 meV∕Co. Protonation of Co^I produces a transient Co^(IIII) -H complex that was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The Co^(IIII) -H intermediate decays by second-order kinetics with an inverse dependence on acid concentration. Analysis of the kinetics suggests that Co^(IIII) -H produces hydrogen by two competing pathways: a slower homolytic route involving two Co^(IIII) -H species and a dominant heterolytic channel in which a highly reactive Co^(II) -H transient is generated by Co^I reduction of Co^(IIII) -H...|$|R
40|$|Allyl {{propargyl}} ethers undergo cobalt-mediated cycloisomerization {{reactions to}} form dihydrofurans in good yield and with excellent diastereoselectivity. The reaction is proposed to proceed {{by way of}} an allylic C-H activation and a formal 5 -endo-dig cyclization. The reaction works {{with a range of}} allylpropargyl ether substrates. 1, 6 -Enynes and allyl propargyl ethers undergo a cobalt-catalyzed formal 5 -endo-dig cyclization to form vinyl cyclopentenes and dihydrofurans, respectively. The use of equimolar amounts of dicobalt octacarbonyl and trimethyl phosphite affords optimum yields and improved selectivity for cycloisomerization vs. alkene isomerization. The utility of the cycloisomerization reaction is exemplified through the synthesis of the bis-tetrahydrofuran core of the annonaceous acetogenins. A key feature of the approach centers on the cycloisomerization reaction for the installation of two of the four stereocenters found in the THF-subunit. An approach towards the total synthesis of Stolonoxide C is described.

40|$|The hydrodynamics {{and mass}} {{transfer}} {{characteristics of a}} loop-venturi reactor have been investigated using a downflow liquid jet ejector. The specific interfacial area of the ejector and the main holding vessel were determined separately. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> sulfite oxidation {{was used as a}} model system. The measured values of the interfacial area were in the range of 40, 000 to 70, 000 m 2 /m 3 in the ejector and 500 to 2500 in the total system. From this it can be concluded that the Loop-venturi reactor is particularly suitable for very fast reactions, in which the liquid phase mass transfer is the reaction limiting step of the process. Further it was demonstrated that the f low regime in the ejector has a huge influence on the mass transfer characteristics of the total system. From the results it is concluded that for a proper design of a loop-venturi reactor, the ejector and the main holding vessel should be considered as two reactors in series, which require individual modeling...|$|E
40|$|To sustain our {{demand for}} the various {{products}} obtained through catalysis, it is desirable to move from precious metals (such as palladium, platinum, iridium, etc.) to base metals (cobalt, iron, manganese, etc.). The efficient use of base-metals is, however, associated with new challenges due to their preferred one-electron reactivity. Metallo-enzymes are well known for performing effective radical reactions, which has inspired several scientists to also develop efficient and selective synthetic catalysts that operate via radical-type mechanisms. Cobalt porphyrin catalysts, for example, {{have been used to}} achieve a wide variety of selective radical transformations including challenging C–H and C=C bond activations. In addition to the ligands directly connected to the metal center, the second coordination sphere plays a significant role in tuning the reactivity of metallo-enzymes. In order to functionally mimic this second coordination sphere supramolecular cages have been developed. Examples have been shown in which bimolecular decomposition pathways, frequently encountered in metallo-radical catalysis, are already suppressed by partial encapsulation. In this Thesis full encapsulation of catalysts in a cubic supramolecular cage is investigated to completely avoid bimetallic decomposition pathway. Furthermore, supramolecular cages enable pre-organization of the substrate and induce selectivity for specific substrates and products in competitive reactions. In addition, the development of a protocol for <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> formation of N-heterocycles from aliphatic azides, and a detailed mechanistic study regarding this reaction, are also described in this Thesis...|$|E

40|$|Hard metal alloys (or {{cemented}} carbides) {{are made}} of a mixture of tungsten carbide particles (WC, more than 80 %) cemented in cobalt metal powder (Co, 5 - 10 %). The inhalation of hard metal particles may cause an interstitial pulmonary disease, the mechanism of which involves an interaction between Co and WC particles. Some epidemiological data also suggest that hard metal dust can induce lung cancer in workers. In a macrophage culture model, butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mM) protected from the cytotoxicity of hard metal particles, suggesting a possible involvement of lipid peroxidation in the toxicity of these powders. In a biochemical system, a mixture of Co and WC particles, but not Co or WC alone, stimulated the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances from arachidonic acid. Using a spin trapping system applied to aqueous particulate suspensions and electrochemical techniques, we present experimental evidence that the association of Co and carbide particles represents a specific toxic entity producing large amounts of activated oxygen species. The mechanism of this interaction proceeds through the oxidation of <b>cobalt</b> metal <b>catalyzed</b> at the surface of carbide particles and resulting in the reduction of dissolved oxygen. This physicochemical property of hard metal particles provides a new basis for interpreting their inflammatory action and their possible carcinogenic effect on the lung...|$|R
40|$|The Mukaiyama {{oxidative}} cyclization {{has been}} a major area of study within the Pagenkopf group and within the field of THF containing natural products. This document contains a brief discussion of the major divisions of THF synthesis; SN 2, cycloadditions, and transition mediated strategies. The development of the Mukaiyama cyclization is described from the earliest applications of cobalt acac type ligand in Mukaiyama’s work to the initial discovery of the cyclization reactivity. Initial finding from the Mukaiyama group is shown, accompanied by its applications to the synthesis of mucosin, aplysiallene, and bullatacin. Previous attempts at improved catalyst design are presented with characterization via x-ray crystallography. The development of a novel (Z) - 2 -hydroxy- 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -(4 -methyl- 1 -piperazinyl) - 2 -Hexene- 1, 4 -dione, water-soluble, ligand system for the Mukaiyama oxidative cyclization {{has been a}}ccomplished in an efficient and reproducible fashion. The ligand was utilized in <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> oxidative cyclizations of trans-tetrahydrofuran rings. Improved catalyst performance was discovered including; greater catalyst stability, higher product yield and simplified purification. Increased catalyst performance also allowed for an increased substrate scope as compared to earlier generations of the catalyst. Substrate scope exploration demonstrated that oxidizable positions were tolerated by the new catalyst. Discussion of subsequent applications of the Co(nmp) 2 in total synthesis is also included. Previous catalyst systems for the Mukaiyama cyclization proved unable to cyclize more highly substituted THF precursors. Under the cyclize conditions with Co(nmp) 2,various substrates were able to be cyclized to achieve new THF and oxime products. 2, 2, 5 tetrahydrofuran substitution patterns were explored and were accessible in moderate yields.

40|$|Transition {{states are}} the gate keepers of {{chemical}} reactions. The free energies associated with transition states determine everything {{of interest in}} a chemical reaction, namely the rate and product distribution. Attempts to categorize the repulsive and attractive forces that dictate structural and energetic features of transition states dominate mechanistic organic chemistry. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) provide a direct quantitative probe into transition structure because they report directly upon changes in bond strength. Furthermore, KIEs provide a satisfying means of comparison with computational efforts. However, KIE methods are almost exclusively applied to spot to spot reactions with only a single product. The information provided by studying these somewhat rare, well-behaved reactions, can be helpful, but more versatile methods are needed to investigate reactions that yield more than one product. In this dissertation, product-specific KIE, a new method developed in the lab which can simultaneously measure the KIE of all pathways in a multi-product reaction, will be introduced. In principle, the product-specific KIE methodology is able to reveal the energetic landscape of all pathways by analysis of the isotopic fractionation which records the bonding changes that occur along a reaction pathway. The information provided can be illuminating to discover the branching events in chemo-, regio- and stereo-selective reactions. Secondly, the mechanisms of two transition-metal catalyzed multi-product reactions have been discussed as examples {{for the application of}} this method with both natural abundance 13 C and deuterium KIE experiments. One of them is <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> [2 + 2] and Alder-ene reaction, where a common intermediate was found before it branches to two different products. In another case, a dirhodium tetraacetate catalyzed C-H insertion was found to proceed via an initial hydride transfer transition state, followed by formation of two interconverting zwitterion intermediates before the formation of two diastereomers. Product-specific KIEs have the potential to address mechanistic questions in reactions under development and provide a basic understanding of the key transition state features necessary to develop more selective catalysis...|$|E
40|$|With rising {{crude oil}} prices and outlook of declining crude oil production, {{conversion}} of natural gas into liquid fuels is gaining worldwide interest. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is an important tool in achieving this conversion of natural gas, producing long-chained hydrocarbon products. These may be further processed into automotive fuel and other demanded products. Ever since Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was invented in the 1920 's, much effort has been put into development and improvement of all aspects regarding the process. Although cobalt {{has been found to}} be the most viable catalyst for natural gas conversion today, much resources are put in to optimize the catalyst with regards to promoters and support materials. Usual support materials for <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and TiO 2. This thesis has investigated SiC as support material. Seven different SiC-support samples were obtained from commercial manufacturer SICAT, and impregnated using the incipient wetness impregnation method with 12. 5 wt. % cobalt loading. Characterization methods applied were volumetric adsorption, volumetric chemi-sorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, electron microscopy and steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. All SiC-supported catalysts tested were reduced at lower temperatures than Al 2 O 3 -supported Co- and CoRe-catalysts. Volumetric chemisorption showed poor dispersion of cobalt metal (2 - 3 %) on the SiC-supported catalysts. In total, seven SiC-supported catalysts and one Al 2 O 3 -supported reference catalyst, were run in an experimental Fisher-Tropsch synthesis rig to obtain activity and selectivity results. The SiC-supported catalysts showed varying activity results, and were all less active than the Al 2 O 3 -supported reference catalyst. However, at the same CO conversion level, SiC-supported catalysts yielded an increased C 5 + hydrocarbon selectivity compared to the reference catalyst. The decreased activity, and increased C 5 + selectivity observed for the SiC-supported catalysts, were suspected to be caused by alkali and alkaline earth metal impurities in the support samples. After the first batch of catalysts were tested and found little active, SICAT supplied a second set of purer support samples. However, the results suggested that there were still enough impurities present to cause significant loss of activity compared to the reference catalyst...|$|E

It comprises a Li conductive organic polymer electrolyte membrane sandwiched {{by a thin}} Li metal foil anode, and a thin carbon composite electrode on which oxygen, the electroactive cath-ode material, accessed from the environment, is reduced during discharge to generate electric power. It features an all solid state design in which electrode and electrolyte layers are laminated to form a 200 to 300 p. m thick battery cell.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTPP) {{yielded a}} passivating polymeric film at an {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) electrode. Coating ITO with a nanoscale sol–gel film with a mesoporous structure was shown to change the pathway of the chemical reaction coupled to the electron transfer. The sol–gel film was deposited by an electrochemically assisted process, and the mesoporosity was imparted by including generation- 4 poly(amidoamine) dendrimer in the precursor solution. The dendrimer was removed subsequently with an atmospheric oxygen plasma. This electrode remained active during cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis of 5 -HTPP, which was attributed to dimer, rather than polymer, formation from the oxidation product. Mass spectrometry confirmed this hypothesis. The anodic current was limited by the electron-transfer kinetics.

40|$|In this work, {{inorganic}} membranes {{with highly}} dispersed metallic catalysts on macroporous titania-washcoated alumina supports were produced, characterized and {{tested in a}} catalytic membrane reactor. The reactor, operated as a contactor in the forced pore-flow-through mode, {{was used for the}} conversion of synthesis gas (H 2 + CO) into mixed alcohols and hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Carbon monoxide conversions of 78 % and 90 % at near atmospheric pressure (300 kPa) and 493 K were recorded over cobalt and bimetallic Co-Mn membranes respectively. The membranes also allowed for the conversion of carbon dioxide, thus eliminating the need for a CO 2 separation interphase between synthesis gas production and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Catalytic tests conducted with the membrane reactor with different operating conditions (of temperature, pressure and feed flow rate) on cobalt-based membranes gave very high selectivity to specific products, mostly higher alcohols (C 2 – C 8) and paraffins within the gasoline range, thereby making superfluous any further upgrading of products to fuel grade other than simple dehydration. Manganese-promoted cobalt membranes were found not only to give better Fischer-Tropsch activity, but also to promote isomerization of paraffins, which is good for boosting the octane number of the products, with the presence of higher alcohols improving the energy density. The membrane reactor concept also enhanced the ability of <b>cobalt</b> to <b>catalyze</b> synthesis gas conversions, giving an activation energy Ea of 59. 5 kJ/mol. K compared with 86. 9 – 170 kJ/mol. K recorded in other reactors. Efficient heat transfer was observed because of the open channel morphology of the porous membranes.

40|$|Incorporation of probe {{molecules}} {{has been}} widely used in elucidation of the mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reaction. In this study, we used acetylenic molecules, including 1 -hexyne, 2 -hexyne, 4 -phenyl- 1 -butyne, and 1 -phenyl- 1 -propyne as well as acetylene as probes with cobalt and iron catalysts. Experiments were carried out in a tubular microreactor of 3 / 8 inch diameter. Long chain alkynes were added via a saturator or a syringe pump. Acetylene was introduced from a cylinder containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen plus 1 % of acetylene. We found that acetylenic compounds can initiate the F-T synthesis at temperatures more than 100 oC lower than those at which normal F-T reactions are carried out. Since products obtained from linear alkyne-initiated F-T and those from normal F-T synthesis are indistinguishable, we used phenyl-substituted acetylenes as probes to distinguish the alkyne initiated products from normal F-T products. At low temperatures, only alkyne-initiated F-T reactions take place; at normal F-T temperatures, both alkyne initiated reactions and normal initiated F-T reactions occur. Although the degree of incorporation of internal alkynes is much {{less than that of}} the terminal alkynes, they can also initiate F-T chain growth to form mostly branched products. Under the same reaction conditions, internal olefins have little effect on the F-T reaction. When an acetylenic probe molecule is added to <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> F-T reactions, aldehydes or alcohols with one carbon more than the added probe molecule are the only oxygenates formed, perhaps by a hydroformylation type of reaction. Incorporation of alkynes (with carbon number n) on iron catalysts increased the rate of formation of Cn+ 1 + oxygenates, via Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. The F-T synthesis is a complex process in which a large number of hydrocarbon and oxygenated species are present on the catalyst surface. The nature of these adsorbates and how they react differ as reaction conditions {{and the nature of the}} catalyst changes. This work, combined with results of experiments on incorporation of ethylene, lends credence to the postulation that unsaturated two-carbon entity, possibly vinylidenes or ethylidynes, may be involved in initiation of the F-T synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Metalloporphyrins {{have been}} shown to {{catalyze}} many fundamental and practically important chemical transformations, some of which represent the first demonstrations of these catalytic processes. The most notable examples include an assortment of atom/group transfer reactions, such as oxene, nitrene, and carbene transfers. Atom/group transfer reactions allow for the direct conversion of abundant and inexpensive alkenes and alkanes into value-added functional molecules. Previous reports from our group have shown that cobalt-porphyrin based carbene and nitrene transfer reactions {{are some of the most}} selective and practical catalytic systems developed for cyclopropanation and aziridination. Backed by a family of D 2 -symmetric chiral cobalt porphyrins our group continues the development of stereoselective carbene and nitrene transfer reactions. Metal-catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins with diazo reagents has attracted great research interest because of its fundamental and practical importance. The resulting cyclopropyl units are recurrent motifs in biologically important molecules and can serve as versatile precursors in organic synthesis. Supported by a family of D 2 -symmetric chiral cobalt porphyrins, we have demonstrated the use of succimidyl diazoacetate as carbene source for a highly diastereo- and enantioselective cyclopropanation process. The resulting cyclopropyl succinimdyl esters are highly reactive and serve as valuable synthons for generating cyclopropylcarboxamides. We have also developed the first cobalt-porphyrin based intramolecular cyclopropanation, which is able to produce the resulting bicyclic lactones in high yields and enantioselectivity. Nitrene transfer reactions are also an attractive route to produce biologically and synthetically important molecules such as amines and aziridines. Although much progress has been made in nitrene transfer reactions utilizing [N-(p-toluenesulfonyl) imino]phenyliodinane (PhI=NTs) the nitrene source suffers from several drawbacks. Consequently, there has been growing interest in developing catalytic nitrene transfer reactions using alternate nitrene sources. To this end, we have utilized arylsulfonyl azides as nitrene source to explore their use in the development of a cobalt-porphyrin catalyzed enantioselective aziridination system. The <b>cobalt</b> <b>catalyzed</b> process can proceed under mild and neutral conditions in low catalyst loading without the need of other reagents, while generating nitrogen gas as the only byproduct. We have also explored the use of arylsulfonyl azides as nitrene source in a cobalt-catalyzed intramolecular C-H amination process...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of chemical}} intermediates out of fossil and renewable hydrocarbon sources is experiencing significant changes. C 4 hydrocarbons are essential intermediates {{in the manufacturing}} of solvents, plasticizers, polymers and fuels. A C 4 fraction in petrochemical industry comprises the valuable alkenes including 1 - and cis- and trans- 2 -butenes and isobutene next to the less valuable alkanes, being iso- and n-butane. Butadienes and specifically 1, 3 -butadiene find specific applications in the synthesis of several (co) polymers. The largest single use of butadiene is the use as building block in styrene-butadiene rubbers (SBR) which is the main basic polymer in the manufacturing of tires. In butene oligomerization processes the presence of poly-enes is problematic for catalysts since it induces coke formation. Valorization of C 4 streams is complicated because of its complex composition. The catalytic chemistry already has seen significant progress over the past 35 years but major challenges with respect to catalyst robustness and resistance to poisons remain. In this work new pathways are explored in the valorization of butenes and butadienes. The elimination of one double bond in butadiene molecule to obtain a butene would greatly enhance its economic value. Although the more obvious approach would be partial hydrogenation, we opted for a more challenging approach via intramolecular hydrogen transfer from an alkane. The overall conversion of an alkadiene and an alkane into two alkenes would enhance the economic value of two alkenes at once. In this work, a series of acid catalysts are tested in their ability of hydride transfer reactions from n-hexane to butadiene. Butenes are commercialized in oligomerization processes mainly. The dimers and trimers of butenes are the targeted molecules. Butene oligomerization can be performed over transition metal based catalysts as well as over heterogeneous acid catalysts. The reaction mechanism on acid zeolites proceeds via alkylcarbenium ion chemistry. The reaction products typically are multibranched, limiting their reactivity in subsequent hydroformylation processes. Oligomerization over transition metals proceeds via coordination chemistry leading {{to the formation of}} linear and weakly branched oligomers. Such isomers are suitable for hydroformylation to yield superior alcohols and plasticizer products. Transition metal based catalysts mostly are based on nickel and cobalt. Nickel can be applied in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalytic processes. Ni catalysts are popular in catalytic processes serving the synthesis of quasi linear oligomers, but they are very sensitive to poisons and especially traces of sulfur compounds present in commercial butene feedstocks. Poisoned heterogeneous Ni based catalysts are difficult to regenerate. Compared to nickel, cobalt catalysts are much more robust but presently they exist as homogeneous catalysts only. Heterogeneous catalysts offer the advantage of easy separation from the reaction products and operation in fixed bed continuous processes. Heterogeneous cobalt based catalysts did not exist. In this work the first heterogeneous Co based catalyst for n-butene oligomerization was developed. The presence of acid sites next to cobalt was found to be detrimental in ZSM- 57 zeolites. Therefore, the experience on the positioning of cations in basic faujasite zeolites was exploited in order to generate under coordinated Co 2 + cations in supercages of Ca-X and Ca-Y type zeolites. The new catalysts display all features of homogneneous catalysts. In an induction period under hydrocarbon stream cobalt hydride species are generated which coordinate butene molecules. Reaction mechanisms involving insertion and ß-elimination explain the formation of linear, monobranched and dibranched octenes, with overall branchiness index of 1. 1 similar to homogeneous cobalt catalysts.

40|$|Since the {{prebiotic}} {{atmosphere was}} anaerobic, if not reducing, a useful function of primordial photosynthesis {{would have been}} to photooxidize reduced substrates such as Fe(+ 2), S(- 2) or reduced organic molecules and to emit hydrogen. Experiments have shown that the early biogenic pigments uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin do photooxidize organic compounds and emit hydrogen {{in the presence of a}} platinum catalyst. These experiments were carried out in dilute aqueous solution near neutral pH under anaerobic atmosphere, and quantum yields near 10 - 2 were obtained. Thus relevant prebiotic conditions were maintained. Rather then to further optimize conditions, attempts were made to replace the platinum catalyst by a more prebiotically suitable catalyst. Trials with an Fe 4 S 4 (SR) 4 cluster, in analogy to the present hydrogenase and nitrogenase, were not successful. However, experiments using <b>cobalt</b> complexes to <b>catalyze</b> the formation of hydrogen are promising. In analogy with biological photosynthetic systems which group pigments, electron transfer molecules and enzymes in clusters for efficiency, it was found that binding the biogenic porphyrins to the polyvinyl alcohol used to support the platinum catalyst did increase the quantum yield of the reaction. It was also found that ultraviolet light can serve to photo-oxidize porphyrinogens to porphyrins under anaerobic conditions. Thus the formation of the colorless porphyriogens by the extraordinarily simple biosynthetic pathway would not be a problem because of the prevalence of UV light in the prebiotic, anoxic atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{transformation}} {{of carbon dioxide}} into useful organic compounds has attracted much attention due to its economic and environmental benefits. In addition, other reasons are also taken into account, such as the possible utilization of CO 2 as a renewable source chemical and the growing concern of the greenhouse effect. CO 2 is an abundant, cheap, and safe C 1 building block in organic synthesis. However, due to the inert nature of CO 2, efficient catalytic processes of its chemical fixation remain a significant challenge. In this work, we have studied a possible pathway for practical utilization of CO 2. The reaction of CO 2 with epoxides giving cyclic carbonates, has been investigated. New catalyst systems based on <b>cobalt</b> capable of <b>catalyzing</b> the chemical {{transformation of}} carbon dioxide are described in detail. Oxygen is a cheap, readily available and environmentally friendly natural oxidant. The catalytic activation of molecular oxygen has great potential {{in a variety of}} applications. Catalysis and reactions, which are based on molecular oxygen, can also be considered to be ecologically benign processes. Moreover, catalytic reactions in water are highly desirable in terms of green chemistry. In this context, our purpose was to develop an environmentally friendly catalytic systems, suitable for oxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen in water solution. In this part of the work, efficient catalysts, based on copper complexes have been synthesized and studied in the presence of TEMPO for the oxidation of benzyl and aliphatic alcohols with molecular oxygen in aqueous and nonaqueous medium...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide {{was shown}} to be the {{substrate}} of cobaltochelatase, an enzyme that <b>catalyzes</b> <b>cobalt</b> insertion in the corrin ring during the biosynthesis of coenzyme B 12 in Pseudomonas denitrificans. Cobaltochelatase was demonstrated to be a complex enzyme composed of two different components of M(r) 140, 000 and 450, 000, which were purified to homogeneity. The 140, 000 -M(r) component {{was shown to}} be coded by cobN, whereas the 450, 000 -M(r) component was composed of two polypeptides specified by cobS and cobT. Each component was inactive by itself, but cobaltochelatase activity was reconstituted upon mixing CobN and CobST. The reaction was ATP dependent, and the Km values for hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, Co 2 +, and ATP were 0. 085 +/- 0. 015, 4. 2 +/- 0. 2, and 220 +/- 36 microM, respectively. Spectroscopic data revealed that the reaction product was cob(II) yrinic acid a,c-diamide, and experiments with a coupled-enzyme incubation system containing both cobaltochelatase and cob(II) yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase (F. Blanche, L. Maton, L. Debussche, and D. Thibaut, J. Bacteriol. 174 : 7452 - 7454, 1992) confirmed this result. This report not only provides the first evidence that hydrogenobyrinic acid and its a,c-diamide derivative are indeed precursors of adenosylcobalamin but also demonstrates that precorrin- 6 x, precorrin- 6 y, and precorrin- 8 x, three established precursors of hydrogenobyrinic acid (D. Thibaut, M. Couder, A. Famechon, L. Debussche, B. Cameron, J. Crouzet, and F. Blanche, J. Bacteriol. 174 : 1043 - 1049, 1992), {{are also on the}} pathway to cobalamin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation was to develop an intrinsic UV and luminescence cure monitoring technique and to provide insight in understanding the cure chemistry of polycyanate resins. UV-visible spectrum of a bisphenol A dicyanate ester (BPADCY) monomer during the cure reaction supported that the cyclotrimerization of cyanate esters to form triazine rings is the principal reaction. ^ A very strong luminescence emission was found during the cure reaction of BPADCY monomer. As the cure reaction proceeded, the fluorescence emission intensity around 420 nm first increased and then decreased accompanied by a small bathochromic shift. Eleven cure related model compounds representing reactants, intermediates and products were chosen, and their UV-Visible and fluorescence behaviors were characterized in solution and in the solid state. Fluorescence behavior during cyclotrimerization of a monofunctional cyanate ester was also characterized. The model compound study indicated that the aromatic substituted triazines formed during the cure reaction and their inner filter effect {{were responsible for the}} emission around 420 nm and the observed trend in intensity. Fluorescence emission intensity of polycyanate resins heavily depended upon the measurement temperatures. Both bisphenol A as an impurity in monomer and cobalt acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol catalysts did not interfere with the emission at 420 nm. In situ fluorescence characterization was attempted for the cure reaction of <b>cobalt</b> acetylacetonate/nonyl phenol <b>catalyzed</b> BPADCY system. The phosphorescence emission wavelength of polycyanate resins appeared at about 20 nm longer than that of fluorescence. Phosphorescence lifetime was found to be about 20 ms at room temperature and remained relatively unchanged throughout the cure reaction. ^ FTIR in situ cure kinetics of BPADCY monomer indicated that the cure reaction in air was a little faster than in argon. A linear relationship was found between the consumption rate of cyanate ester groups and the formation rate of substituted triazine rings. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} hydrolysis {{of the native}} zinc and metal substituted Bacillus cereus (BcII) metallo [...] lactamase have been investigated. The pH and metal ion dependence of kcat and kcat/Km, determined under steady-state conditions, for the <b>cobalt</b> substituted BcII <b>catalyzed</b> hydrolysis of cefoxitin, cephaloridine, and cephalexin indicate that an enzyme residue of apparent pKa 6. 3 ± 0. 1 is required in its deprotonated form for metal ion binding and catalysis. The kcat/Km for cefoxitin and cephalexin with cadmium substituted BcII is dependent on two ionizing groups on the enzyme: one of pKa 1 = 8. 7 ± 0. 1 required in its deprotonated form and the other of pKa 2 = 9. 3 ± 0. 1 required in its protonated form for activity. The pH dependence of the competitive inhibition constant, Ki, for CdBcII with L-captopril indicates that pKa 1 = 8. 7 ± 0. 1 corresponds to the cadmium-bound water. For the manganese substituted BcII, the pH dependence of kcat/Km for benzylpenicillin, cephalexin, and cefoxitin similarly indicated the importance of two catalytic groups: one of pKa 1 = 8. 5 ± 0. 1 which needs to be deprotonated and the other of pKa 2 = 9. 4 ± 0. 1 which needs to be protonated for catalysis; the pKa 1 {{was assigned to the}} manganese-bound water. The rate was metal ion concentration dependent at the highest manganese concentrations used (10 - 3 M). The metal substituted species have similar or higher catalytic activities compared with the zinc enzyme, albeit at pHs above 7. Interestingly, with cefoxitin, a very poor substrate for ZnBcII, both kcat and kcat/Km increase with increasing pKa of the metal-bound water, in the order Zn < Co < Mn < Cd. A higher pKa for the metal-bound water for cadmium and manganese BCII leads to more reactive enzymes than the native zinc BcII, suggesting that the role of the metal ion is predominantly to provide the nucleophilic hydroxide, rather than to act as a Lewis acid to polarize the carbonyl group and stabilize the oxyanion tetrahedral intermediat...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{preparation}} and characterization of two carbon nanostructures: graphene magnetoresistance device (EMR) and 0. 4 nm carbon nanotubes grown in the linear channels of AFI zeolite crystal. The second part is my focus. On the first part, graphene EMR devices have shown excellent magnetoresistance effect for potential applications. The MR effect arises from the geometric arrangements of the metallic parts on graphene, together with the placing of the electrodes. It follows that geometric parameters must {{play an important role}} in determining the performance of the EMR device. In order to achieve larger MR and to investigate the effect of the size of EMR deveic, I have fabricated several devices with sizes ranging from 1 ~ 3 μm and with different metals. Simulations have also been carried out to compare with the measured data. Comparison showed excellent agreement between the experiments and simulations. By using the ideal mobility of graphene, simulation has predicted an MR magnitude as high as 100, 000 %. After fine tuning, our graphene EMR device has exhibited a MR effect up to 85, 000 %, close to the prediction. The 4 Angstrom SWNTs@AFI have exhibited superconductivity. To prepare better samples for transport measurements, I have devoted much effort to improve the sample quality. Different parameters were tested, and it is found that: (1) Neither low temperature nor very high temperature is good for the growth of CNTs; while in the range of 600 ~ 650 ℃, temperature does not have a significant effect on the sample quality. (2) The heating time is not too critical. Four to eight hours should be a good choice. (3) The pressure has an obvious effect on the quality as well as the quantity of carbon in the AFI pores. At low pressure, the RBM signal is clearly seen in the Raman spectra, but the TG analysis shows the carbon content to be on the low side; while at high pressure up to 3 atm, the RBM signal is hard to be seen because of the high intensity of the background PL. The absolute value of G band is stronger under high pressure, indicating that there is more carbon in the AFI channels. The TG analysis has verified our expectation that the higher pressure condition should yield a higher carbon content. More carbon content, but smaller RBM/G ratio, is likely to be indicative of two types of carbon co-existing in the pores of AFI crystals: the 0. 4 nm CNTs and the byproducts from the decomposition of ethylene. Since the environmental pressure is high, it would be difficult for the byproducts to be dispersed from the channels. I have also tested the use of catalyst for the growth of 4 -Angstrom CNTs. Cobalt carbonyl was introduced as a vapor <b>cobalt</b> source for <b>catalyzing</b> the growth of CNTs. From the Raman data, some positive results have been observed, but it is not as effective as we have expected, mainly due to the fact that no Co, or very little Co, is in the channels to catalyze the CNT growth. As catalyst may be the most promising way to improve the quatliy as well as the quantity of 4 -Angstrom CNTs, further tests on catalyzing the growth of CNTs will be carried out...|$|R
