40|$|New {{results are}} shown on carbon {{deposition}} and mixed layer formation <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> Surfaces in TEXTOR test limiter experiments by varying surface {{conditions such as}} surface toughness (R-a: 10 nm- 1 mu m), temperature (300 - 900 degrees C) and initial surface carbon concentration (0 - 60 %). {{it is found that}} surface roughness significantly affected C deposition for both W and graphite substrates such as increase in the C deposition and extension of the C deposition area. Not only the surface roughness parameter R-a but also detailed surface morphology closely relate to C deposition <b>on</b> <b>tungsten.</b> Carbon deposition hardly occurred at least above similar to 520 degrees C <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> under TEXTOR edge plasma conditions. Carbon behavior <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> at 770 - 930 degrees C depends on the incident carbon ion energy. Although tungsten and carbon mixing layers affected C deposition, their effect is less than the roughness effect. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed-UV-laser surface {{ablation}} {{has been}} applied in substrate pretreatment {{in order to obtain}} good adhesion of diamond coating grown <b>on</b> cobalt-cemented <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal. The dependence of diamond coating's adhesion on different shots of pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment has been studied experimentally. The results were compared with diamond coating deposited by using traditional acid-etching substrate pretreatment. It was shown that adhesion of diamond coating grown <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal has been greatly improved by using pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment. The corresponding laser pretreatment condition for the optimal adhesion of diamond coatings was finally obtained. It has been demonstrated that pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment should be a feasible and effective method for improving adhesion of diamond coating <b>on</b> cobalt-cemented <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal. It is the characteristic surface morphology produced by pulsed-UV-laser surface ablation that subsequently results in this improved adhesion of diamond coating grown <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal. The number of laser shots being used in substrate pretreatment has a great influence to the adhesion of diamond coating deposited <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal. One should always apply proper number of laser shots in pulsed-UV-laser substrate pretreatment when seeking for the optimal adhesion of diamond coating <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide hardmetal. In this work, the corresponding number of laser shots for the optimal adhesion of diamond coating has found to be 300 laser shots...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 13 CH 4 was {{injected}} through graphite and tungsten spherical limiters in reproducible TEXTOR discharges. These {{materials were}} chosen, as {{they represent the}} actual compromise for the plasma facing components in the ITER divertor. 13 C was used in order to distinguish injected and intrinsic carbon in the layer deposited on the limiter surface. Shot-by-shot video recordings show a continuous growth of the deposit near the injection hole. A pronounced difference in the 13 C deposition pattern on the graphite and tungsten limiters was observed. Post-mortem surface analysis showed that the ratios of the locally deposited to the injected amount of carbon are 4 % for graphite and 0. 3 % for tungsten. The margins of the carbon layer deposited <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> are significantly steeper {{in comparison to the}} graphite limiter case. The large difference in the 13 C deposition efficiency can be explained by direct reflection of carbon from tungsten and enhanced sputtering of carbon <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> substrate. Nucleation is suggested to be an important mechanism for carbon deposition <b>on</b> <b>tungsten.</b> Monte Carlo impurity transport calculations by the ERO code reproduce reasonably the experimental results for the graphite limiter...|$|R

40|$|Pretreatment <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide (WC-Co) {{surface is}} {{critical}} for obtaining perfectly adherent diamond coatings by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The carbide surface should have high roughness to facilitate diamond nucleation and adhesion. The presence of cobalt—common binder for tungsten carbide—on the surface to be coated should be made minimum since it has negative influence on the diamond deposition process. In this study, surface pretreatment <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> carbide using sulfuric acid was evaluated {{in terms of the}} resulted cobalt removal and the surface roughening. The variables included were acid concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The resulted surface roughness was 29 % higher than initial, averaged at 1. 07 µm.

40|$|Carbon {{deposition}} <b>on</b> <b>tungsten</b> between ELMs {{was investigated}} in DIII-D in semi-attached/detached H-mode plasma conditions using fixed outer strike point (OSP) positions. Carbon deposition during plasma exposure of tungsten was monitored in-situ by measuring the reflectivity of the tungsten sample surface. No significant carbon deposition, i. e., without strong variations of the reflectivity, was observed during these experiments including discharges at high densities. In contrast, ERO modeling predicts a significant carbon deposition <b>on</b> the <b>tungsten</b> surface for those high density plasma conditions. The surface reflectivity decreases with methane injection, consistent with increased carbon coverage, as expected. The sweeping of OSP leads to a pronounced increase of the surface reflectivity, suggesting that the strike point sweeping may provide an effective means to remove carbon coating from tungsten surface. The ERO modeling however predicts again a regime of carbon deposition for these experiments. The discrepancies between carbon deposition regime predicted by the ERO model and the experimental observations suggest that carbon erosion during ELMs may significantly affect carbon deposition <b>on</b> <b>tungsten...</b>|$|R
