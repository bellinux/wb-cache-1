40|$|This study {{investigated}} the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> behavior in Standardbred racehorses. A population of 41 currently racing Standardbred racehorses was observed twice daily {{for a period of}} two months to determine if there was a relationship between pawing and sex, gait or time of day. Twenty-four of the 41, or 58. 5 percent of observed horses showed pawing behavior at the time of observation. The group of horses which showed the <b>pawing</b> behavior consisted <b>of</b> eight females and 16 males. Observations <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> ranged from 0. 83 percent to 31. 4 percent of total observations with the average percentage <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> observations at 10. 6 percent of total observations. The majority <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> observations were recorded in the afternoon with an average number of 79. 8 percent occurring in the afternoon, while an average of 20. 2 percent <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> observations occurred in the morning. These findings indicate that greater than half of the observed population <b>of</b> Standardbreds exhibited <b>pawing</b> behavior, and within the pawing group the majority showed significantly more pawing behavior during the afternoon observation (P< 0. 05).

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesHistamine receptors mediate {{nociceptive}} pathways, {{especially in}} the central nervous system. Some studies have demonstrated the analgesic effects of histamine receptor antagonists in the peripheral nervous system. It {{is not clear whether}} the local analgesic effect is class-specific or drug-specific. MethodsTo answer this question, we used three different H 1 receptor antagonists (pyrilamine, promethazine, and cetirizine) administered directly in the <b>paw</b> <b>of</b> the rat, intraperitoneally, or in peripheral nerve blockade in the formalin-induced pain model. The effects of the drugs on the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations were observed. ResultsIn phase I, the local administration of pyrilamine caused a dose-dependent reduction on the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations; in the highest dose, the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations was reduced by 97. 8 %. Promethazine decreased it by 92 %, while cetirizine decreased by 23. 9 %. In phase II, pyrilamine decreased the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations by 93. 5 %, promethazine by 78. 2 %, and cetirizine by 80. 1 %. Intraperitoneal administration of drugs did not change painful behavior. When used in peripheral nerve block, in phase I pyrilamine reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations by 96. 7 %, promethazine by 73. 3 %, and cetirizine by 23. 9 %. In phase II, pyrilamine reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> elevations by 86. 6 %, promethazine by 64. 4 %, and cetirizine by 19. 9 %. ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that H 1 receptor antagonists have local analgesic effects, different from the systemic effects, one of them an anti-inflammatory and class-specific effect and the other similarly to the local anesthetic effect, specific for promethazine and pyrilamin...|$|R

40|$|Lateralization <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> usage in the {{laboratory}} mouse may be a useful model system in which to assess the genetic and developmental cause of asymmetry of hand usage. With a set number <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> reaches from a centrally placed food tube, individual mice from an inbred strain will exhibit a reliable number of left and right paw reaches. For a single inbred strain, there are approximately equal numbers of left-pawed and right-pawed mice, but strain differences {{have been reported in}} the degree <b>of</b> lateralization <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> preference, We reported a preliminary strain survey in which the strains appeared to fall into two groups of highly lateralized and weakly lateralized paw preference (Biddle et al., 1993). We review here our expanded survey of genetically different strains and stocks of {{the laboratory}} mouse, including different species and subspecies. The major genetic trait is the degree <b>of</b> lateralization <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> preference and the strain differences appear to fall into three major classes of highly lateralized, weakly lateralized, and ambilateral pref-erence. The trait exhibits both additivity and dominance in preliminary reciprocal crosses, depending on which strain pairs are used. The wide difference between strains that have highly lateralized and ambilateral paw preference suggests pecific genetic tools that could be used to begin a genetic dissection of the causes of this trait. Preliminary as-sessment of the size of the corpus callosum in three strains with significantly different degrees of lateralization suggests that genetically determined eficiencies and absence of this structure are not the direct cause of the strain differences in the trait of degree of lateralization. In the expanded survey, some strains appear to exhibit a directional de-viation from equal numbers of mice with left and right paw usage. Therefore, direction <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> usage may not be a genetically neutral trait, but replicate assessments and genetic tests are needed to confirm this.

50|$|Though {{settlement}} in present-day Paw Paw began during the 1830s, by 1847 {{there were probably}} no more than 50 people in the village. The name Paw Paw was derived from a nearby grove of Pawpaw trees {{on the edge of}} a 2000 acre forest. American general Winfield Scott is credited with being the first person of European ancestry to discover the area. The area that Paw Paw is located in was home to more than one stand <b>of</b> <b>Paw</b> Paw trees, thus more than one settlement took the name Paw Paw. To avoid confusion the townspeople renamed the village Wyoming Township. The new name came from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, where many <b>of</b> <b>Paw</b> Paw's earliest settlers originated. The Wyoming Valley was the scene of a massacre during the American Revolution in which over 300 American settlers were killed by Native Americans allied with the British. Many <b>of</b> <b>Paw</b> Paw's early settlers shared surnames with those who are listed as having been involved in the fighting and massacre.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> behavior in a population of Standardbred racehorses and the relationship <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> frequency to time of day. Standardbreds (n= 41) were observed using instantaneous scan sampling twice daily, in the morning before training and in the afternoon after training. A majority of the horses, twenty-four (58. 5 %) of the 41 horses showed pawing behavior at least once (median= 7, interquartile range= 2 – 15). After training, there were a median of 4 (interquartile range 1 – 11) observations <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> or 11. 2 % of total observations. In the morning, before training, there were 3 (0 – 3. 25) pawing observations, or 9. 1 % of total observations. There was a significantly greater frequency <b>of</b> <b>pawing</b> in the afternoon (P= 0. 0005). They pawed less on Sunday afternoons when they had not trained.

40|$|Pedestrian Access Ways (PAWs) have {{presented}} {{a significant and}} unresolved challenge to transport planners in local and State government. The result has been piecemeal local government and State government approaches that have frequently resulted in tensions between civic constituencies, high levels of administrative cost, adverse publicity, reduced transport functionality and compromises to the policy intentions {{of a range of}} government agencies. In part, this has been due to a gap between the intrinsic complexity <b>of</b> <b>PAW</b> eco-systems and the oversimplification of this complexity in ways that ignores issues of multiple uses, purposes, user interests, user groups, functionality, ownership, control and agency and the ways these vary across the day, week, seasons, years and planning fashions. In short, local interests and incomplete understanding the situation have limited the development of best practice in management <b>of</b> <b>PAWs,</b> have generated unnecessary problems, and in particular have prevented an integrated government approach.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw washing, face washing, and body washing.

A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> washing and body washing decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on face washing, however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>paw</b> washing but no increase in face washing. It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw washing and body washing may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing.
