50|$|An oval gear meter is a {{positive}} displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate {{at right angles to}} one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes {{through the center of the}} meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid is metered through alternating measurement chambers. Permanent magnets in the rotating gears can transmit a signal to an electric reed switch or <b>current</b> <b>transducer</b> for flow measurement. Though claims for high performance are made, they are generally not as precise as the sliding vane design.|$|E
5000|$|When partial {{discharge}} is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave {{goes through the}} zero crossing. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a [...] "high frequency" [...] <b>current</b> <b>transducer</b> which is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested. The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval {{between the end of}} a burst {{and the beginning of the}} next burst. As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2 ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure. The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded. It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring resistor in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an oscilloscope via a matched coaxial cable.|$|E

An expression for the evaluation of the power error in distorted conditions was developed which can be easily utilized in the case of linear <b>current</b> <b>transducers.</b> It is shown how CTs cannot be considered linear transducers and how the higher the absolute value of the CT phase angle error is, the higher becomes the harmonic power error. The harmonic power error reaches maximum value when the phase shift between the voltage and current harmonic nears +- 90 °.
