40|$|The {{standard}} {{analysis of}} the optimal international tax policy of a small country typically assumes that the country either imports or <b>exports</b> <b>capital,</b> but does not do both. This paper considers {{the situation in which}} a small country both <b>exports</b> and imports <b>capital</b> and can alter its tax on one or the other, but not both. In each case, a 'seesaw' relationship is identified, in which the optimal tax on the income from <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> (imports) is inversely related to the given tax rate on income from <b>capital</b> imports (<b>exports).</b> The standard results for optimal taxation of <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> and imports are shown to be special cases of the more general seesaw principle. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the welfare of}} a <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> or source country and a capital importing or host country under tax credit and tax deduction systems for the international taxation of capital. Because the two tax systems may create quite different strategic incentives for the countries, the authors compare the equilibria in the tax-setting game played by the two countries under each system. They find that the tax credits system introduces an antitrade bias into the equilibrium, contrary to initial impressions, and that both <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> and <b>capital</b> importing countries will prefer the tax-deductions scheme to tax credits.

40|$|The {{world economy}} {{experienced}} extensive international economic {{integration in the}} second half of the nineteenth century. This period was also the era of imperial expansion and massive <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> from Britain to the rest of the world. One of the destinations for these gigantic <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> was the British Empire. During this first wave of globalization Britain pioneered and sustained free trade quite successfully–at least in its empire. ^ The purpose of this research is twofold. First, this dissertation seeks to learn whether the impact of free trade in the British Empire on both Britain and her major overseas possessions was beneficial or not. In particular, the first chapter analyzes the impact of colonial exports on colonial growth in the six main British overseas territories that were the greatest recipients of British capital exports: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Egypt and South Africa. The results are inconclusive. In India, we find no relationship between exports and growth. GDP growth seems to be export led in Australia and New Zealand. A positive correlation between GDP growth and export growth was found in Canada, South Africa and Egypt, yet the direction of this relationship and the mechanism of how exports impact GDP are less clear. ^ The second chapter examines whether colonial trade was beneficial for Britain. In essence, the study assesses whether colonial imports contributed to the growth of the British economy. We find that colonial trade via imports was growth enhancing for Britain. ^ Second, this dissertation seeks to learn how British imperialism influenced institutional development in the colonies. More specifically, the third chapter examines whether British <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> promoted institutional development in places where they were absorbed. In this regard, two questions are addressed: first, whether colonial institutions improved or became worse under British rule, and second, whether the institutional gap between Britain and a given colony under investigation narrowed or widened. ^ The results are striking. First, they indicate that good institutions followed <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> in the British Empire. Second, they show that colonial institutions in places which absorbed British <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> were improving at a faster pace than institutions in Britain itself Third, we find that, in some instances, colonial institutions were better than coinciding institutions in Britain. ...|$|R

Marx (volume III of “Das Kapital”) mentions <b>capital</b> <b>export</b> as a countervailing tendency for the tendency of the profit rate to fall.

The question of whether a return to the pre-crisis equilibrium is likely is of prime importance for the country.

As DTAs shift taxing rights from capital importing to <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> countries, the prior would incur a loss.

In the case of an asymmetric DTA, this requires compensation from the <b>capital</b> <b>exporting</b> country to the capital importing country.

50|$|Economic {{competition}} is a political-economic concept {{that emerged in}} trade and policy discussions in the last decades of the 20th century. Competition theory posits that while protectionist measures may provide short-term remedies to economic problems caused by imports, firms and nations must adapt their production processes {{in the long term}} to produce the best products at the lowest price. In this way, even without protectionism, their manufactured goods are able to compete successfully against foreign products both in domestic markets and in foreign markets. Competition emphasizes the use of comparative advantage to decrease trade deficits by exporting larger quantities of goods that a particular nation excels at producing, while simultaneously importing minimal amounts of goods that are relatively difficult or expensive to manufacture. Trade Policy can be used to establish unilaterally and multilaterally negotiated rule of law agreements protecting fair and open global markets. While trade policy is important to the economic success of nations, competitiveness embodies the need to address all aspects affecting the production of goods that will be successful in the global market, including but not limited to managerial decision making, labor, capital, and transportation costs, reinvestment decisions, the acquisition and availability of human <b>capital,</b> <b>export</b> promotion and financing, and increasing labor productivity.|$|E
5000|$|Each item {{a member}} country {{exported}} would add bancors to its ICB account, and each item it imported would subtract bancors. Limits would {{be imposed on}} the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought, and {{on the amount of}} bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold. This was to stop countries building up excessive surpluses or deficits. Each country's limits would be proportional to its share of world trade ... Once initial limits had been breached, deficit countries would be allowed to depreciate, and surplus countries to appreciate, their currencies. This would make deficit country goods cheaper, and surplus country goods more expensive, with the aim of stimulating a rebalancing of trade. Further bancor debit or credit position breaches would trigger mandatory action. For chronic debtors, this would include oligatory currency depreciation, rising interest payments to the ICB Reserve Fund, forced gold sales, and <b>capital</b> <b>export</b> restrictions. For chronic creditors, it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits, rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits, to the ICB's Reserve Fund.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{patterns}} of foreign investment of two large capital-exporting countries before 1914 - Great Britain and Germany. An original database of German <b>capital</b> <b>exports,</b> comparable to Stone's (1999) data for British capital flows was compiled for the period 1883 - 1913. Three classes of variables were tested as determinants of capital flows: political conditions in recipient countries, long-term prospects of growth, and institutional characteristics. The empirical analysis supports the view that German capital flows responded to long-term prospects of growth of recipient countries ("fundamentals") as much as British investment. This conclusion is robust after controlling for political affiliation and suggests that the sharp distinction in the literature between "developmental" and "revenue" finances is probably a figment {{of the absence of}} detailed data on <b>capital</b> <b>exports</b> outside of Britain...|$|R
