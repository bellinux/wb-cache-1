50|$|<b>Camazepam,</b> {{like others}} benzodiazepines, produce {{a variety of}} {{therapeutic}} and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating {{the function of the}} GABA receptor, the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of <b>camazepam</b> on the nervous system.Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has reduced side effects such as impaired cognition, reaction times and coordination. which makes it best suited as an anxiolytic because of these reduced sides effects.Animal studies have shown <b>camazepam</b> and its active metabolites possess anticonvulsant properties.Unlike other benzodiazepines it does not disrupt normal sleep patterns. <b>Camazepam</b> has been shown in animal experiments to have a very low affinity for benzodiazepine receptors compared to other benzodiazepines. Compared to temazepam, <b>camazepam</b> has shown roughly equal anxiolytic properties, and less anticonvulsant, sedative and motor-impairing properties.|$|E

50|$|<b>Camazepam</b> is a {{benzodiazepine}} psychoactive drug, marketed {{under the}} brand names Albego, Limpidon and Paxor. It is the dimethyl carbamate ester of temazepam, a metabolite of diazepam. While it possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties it differs from other benzodiazepines in that its anxiolytic properties are particularly prominent but has comparatively limited anticonvulsant, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} several 1, 4 -benzodiazepine and azirino[1, 2 -d][1, 4]benzodiazepine (ABDZ) derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal (IP) administration in DBA/ 2 mice (a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and in Swiss mice. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked {{by means of}} auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12 - 16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome or on seizures induced by administration of pentylenetetrazole. The 1, 4 -benzodiazepines were generally more potent than the related ABDZ derivatives. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was flunitrazepam > diazepam > pinazepam > ABDZ 5 > ABDZ 4 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ 1 > ABDZ 3 > <b>camazepam</b> > ABDZ 6 > ABDZ 2. The impairment of locomotor performance following IP administration of these derivatives was also evaluated {{by means of the}} rotarod test. The rank order of potency for impairment of coordinated motor movements was pinazepam > flunitrazepam > diazepam > ABDZ 5 > prazepam > halazepam > ABDZ 4 > ABDZ 3 > ABDZ 1 > <b>camazepam</b> > ABDZ 2 = ABDZ 6. The potency of various 1, 4 -benzodiazepines and ABDZs as inhibitors of specific [3 H]flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, ABDZs were active as anticonvulsants and inhibited [3 H]flumazenil binding in the micromolar range. Radioligand binding studies carried out in stable cell lines demonstrated that none of the ABDZs tested showed a particular subtype specificity. The pharmacological actions of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5, which appeared to be the most potent ABDZs as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (8. 24 mumol/kg IP), suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. The anticonvulsant activity of ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 was also evaluated against seizures induced in DBA/ 2 mice by two beta-carbolines: methyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl- 6, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (DMCM). Both ABDZ 4 and ABDZ 5 give better protection against seizures induced by beta-CCM than DMCM, suggesting a preferential action on the benzodiazepine receptor subtype BDZ 1...|$|E
