40|$|When {{designing}} a complex Cyber-Physical System {{it is often}} impossible to foresee all potential situations in advance and prepare corresponding tactics {{to adapt to the}} changes in dynamic environment. This greatly hurts the system's resilience and dependability. All kinds of trouble can rise from situations that lie beyond the expected "envelope of adaptability" from malfunction of one component to failure of the whole system. Self-adaptation approaches are typically limited in choosing a tactic from a fixed set of tactics. Meta-adaptation strategies extend the limits of system's inherent adaptation by creating new tactics at runtime.

While Common-Mode reception can mitigate part of the colored noise, the major drawback of CM transmission is the egress caused to other lines. The use of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) binder allows to further use a differential signal between two common modes referred to as Phantom Mode (PM) tranmission causing no significant egress to other lines. PM transmission increases the capacity by a factor (2 N- 1) /N (N the number of differential lines). In this paper we study three types of algorithms for optimal power allocation in MIMO systems with colored noise using PM transmission under practical implementation (per-modem total power constraints and non-zero SNR gap). First, the two-sided <b>coordination</b> <b>case</b> is studied leading to a SVD-based algorithm. Then, one-sided algorithms for Multiple Access Channels (MAC) and Broadcast Channels (BC) are investigated. Finally, we compare these Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) level- 3 algorithm with a DSM level- 2 algorithm for Interference Channels (IC). The three types of algorithms are compared in the simulation results applying a VDSL 2 scenario. Index Terms — MIMO systems, Optimization methods I...|$|E

40|$|Binary {{decisions}} of agents coupled in networks {{can often be}} classified into two types: “coordination,” where an agent takes an action if enough neighbors are using that action, as in the spread of social norms, innovations, and viral epidemics, and “anticoordination,” where too many neighbors taking a particular action causes an agent to take the opposite action, as in traffic congestion, crowd dispersion, and division of labor. Both of these cases can be modeled using linear-threshold–based dynamics, and a fundamental {{question is whether the}} individuals in such networks are likely to reach decisions with which they are satisfied. We show that, in the <b>coordination</b> <b>case,</b> and perhaps more surprisingly, also in the anticoordination case, the agents will indeed always tend to reach satisfactory decisions, that is, the network will almost surely reach an equilibrium state. This holds for every network topology and every distribution of thresholds, for both asynchronous and partially synchronous decision-making updates. These results reveal that irregular network topology, population heterogeneity, and partial synchrony are not sufficient to cause cycles or nonconvergence in linear-threshold dynamics; rather, other factors such as imitation or the coexistence of coordinating and anticoordinating agents must play a role...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-level supply chain consisting of single-buyer single-supplier under deterministic conditions and constant demand rate. The main {{objective is to}} find optimal lot-sizing decisions and inventory policies, which derive from Net Present Value (NPV) framework. We study the models in two cases; individual and coordination decisions. In the individual case the buyer and the supplier act independently to optimise their profits or costs; while in the <b>coordination</b> <b>case</b> both actors are considered to determine the optimal variables to achieve profit (or cost) functions. The classic single-buyer single-supplier inventory model is applied in the individual model and Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) strategies are applied in the coordination models where the supplier is authorized to manage the buyer’s inventory and make all the replenishment decisions. The experimental results {{have shown that the}} optimal solution is given from a coordinated VMI approach derived from NPV framework.

Aim To adapt a US model of primary care-based case management for people with dementia and test it in general practice. Design and setting Mixed-methodology case studies of case management implementation in four general practices: one rural, one inner-city, and two urban practices. Practice nurses undertook the case manager role in the rural and inner-city practices, and were allocated one session per week for case management by their practices. A seconded social worker worked full time for the two urban practices. Method Participants were community-dwelling patients with dementia who were living at home with a family carer, and who were not receiving specialist care <b>coordination.</b> <b>Case</b> study methods included analysis of case loads and interviews with patients, carers, local NHS and other stakeholders, and case managers.

No practice achieved its recruitment target. Researchers identified more unmet needs than case managers. The practice nurse case managers reported lack of time and found research documentation burdensome.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{perspective}} on the marketing-RD interface by modelling firms that develop new products in a duopolistic market. Design/methodology/approach - By using a game-theoretic modelling approach, this study examines strategic delegation, through which the marketing and RD managers of each firm are given authority over pricing and new products&# 39; quality levels. Findings - Interestingly, the study finds that the case where two managers with conflicting incentives negotiate (the horizontal <b>coordination</b> <b>case)</b> might produce a better financial outcome than when the managers&# 39; decisions are perfectly coordinated by a profit-maximizing CEO (the vertical control case). In addition, the study identifies several conditions that guarantee horizontal coordination&# 39;s generation of higher profit, such as high (or low) sensitivity to the quality (or price) of a new product. The paper further shows that two competing firms may select horizontal coordination as a Nash equilibrium. Practical implications - These findings provide new insights into the role of marketing-RD interaction under strategic delegation, which may allow rival firms to "spend smart" on RD, avoid excessive (and unnecessary) quality competition, and thus enhance the profitability of new products. Such insights would be useful for any firms under budget constraints. Originality/value - To the authors&# 39; knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to analyze how delegation interacts with the conflicting incentives of marketing and RD managers, which in turn affects the quality investment decisions, competitive intensity, and, ultimately, the financial outcomes of new products developed competing firms.

30|$|Previous studies about {{resource}} allocation in network MIMO OFDMA systems have mainly {{focused on the}} global network MIMO case [18 – 20], or on the single cluster case without considering inter-cluster interference [21 – 23]. Recently, research has shifted towards the limited <b>coordination</b> <b>case</b> with different cluster formation models, that is, {{resource allocation}} with dynamic clustering [24, 25] or resource allocation with static clustering [14]. In [24], an inter-cluster interference canceler performing linear processing on the downlink transmission signals is proposed for multi-user MIMO distributed antenna systems. However, a central unit (CU) is needed to collect the global CSI of all users {{in the system and}} to calculate the transmission weight vectors for each cluster. Notice that this centralized framework requires an enormous amount of feedback and backhaul overhead. In [25], a centralized multi-cell network scheduling algorithm is proposed to minimize the inter-cluster interference by performing clustering from the user's point of view, which also needs a CU for global network scheduling. For a system with a large number of cells and a large number of users, a high computational burden will be caused in the CU. In [14], the authors instead consider a more realistic system model, where the network is divided into a number of disjoint static clusters, and limited inter-cluster coordination is used to pre-cancel interference for the users at the edge of neighboring clusters. In this approach, perfect CSI is available at the cluster side for both the cluster users and edge users in the neighboring clusters. Hence, each cluster can help the edge users in the neighboring clusters by taking these users into account when designing the precoding matrices. However, with a large number of users in each cluster, in order to serve a cluster-edge user, all the neighboring clusters need to provide a given number of degrees of freedom by dropping some scheduled users of their own, which leaves fewer degrees of freedom to serve their own users. In addition, a joint scheduling across clusters is needed for the whole network, which requires inter-cluster communication and increases the complexity of the resource allocation design.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{resilience}} is critical when {{addressing the issue}} of natural hazards. The role of an urban planner is to analyze the territorial system, consisting of several functional sub-systems (housing, education, health, etc [...] ) and its vulnerability. In {{order to have a}} specific knowledge of the territory in question, before the occurrence of a disaster it would be necessary, for each functional system, analyze various aspects and define risk simulations. In a city, in fact, there are strategic elements that should not lose functionality during or following a natural event; the definition of specific scenarios could put structures exposed to risk on safety in order not to compromise the system. In this paper I report a specific experience of research carried out within the hospital system that, in case of occurrence of a natural event, is often simultaneously exposed, and therefore need of rescue, and it is a dispenser of rescue. It’s considered strategic because it has to ensure the functionality of its service regardless of the occurrence of external events, such as natural ones; its functionality must be ensured in the continuum. In today is not very thorough the scientific literature about the analysis of the hospital system in respect of such events. Given the importance of the theme there are several initiatives, also promoted by The Italian Civil Protection, in particular the drafting of hospital emergency plans, which cover issues such as fire, road accidents, floods, [...] . Interesting was the collaboration between the Italian Civil Protection Department with Applied Technology Council for the planning of a background paper intended for the preparation of earthquake emergency plans, within which there are also aspects of prevention such as the evaluation of seismic vulnerability of hospitals themselves. The described methodology has allowed the definition of risk simulations for the hospital system, starting from the determination of qualitative and quantitative indices of hazard, vulnerability and exposure in support of plan emergency hospital. Specific focus was directed to the exposure, determined dynamically, going to know how the situation changes in the hospital complex, depending on the passing of hours a day. In these scenarios we introduced the parameter “time”, concept of the time policies (actions for the quality of the urban conditions of life of its citizens, acting on the aspects of urban functions and times of their <b>coordination).</b> <b>Case</b> study is the town of Cuneo and the considered event is the earthquake.

40|$|Abstract—Rapid {{increases}} in mobile data demand and inher-ently limited RF spectrum motivate {{the use of}} dynamic spectrum sharing between different radio technologies such as WiFi and LTE, most notably in small cell (HetNet) scenarios. This paper provides a analytical framework for interference characterization of WiFi and LTE for dense deployment scenarios with spatially overlapping coverage. The first model developed is for single LTE and single WiFi access points separated by a specified distance. Results obtained for that model demonstrate the fact that WiFi is significantly degraded by a nearby LTE system, while LTE degradation is minimal {{as long as the}} WiFi system is within carrier sense range. A second model for multiple WiFi and multiple LTE systems further demonstrates the fact that LTE causes significant degradation to WiFi and that overall system throughput first increases and then decreases with growing density. Intra- and inter- system channel coordination schemes are considered as a means of improving system performance, and results are presented showing 4 - 5 x gains in system capacity over comparable no <b>coordination</b> <b>cases.</b> Index Terms—WiFi, LTE, HetNet, dynamic spectrum access, inter-network coordination, distributed CSMA I...|$|R

40|$|When interdependent {{conditions}} {{exist among}} decision units, safety results {{in part from}} coordination. Safety analysis methods should correspondingly address coordination. However, state-of-the-art safety analysis methods have limited guidance for analytical inquiry into coordination between interdependent decision systems. This thesis presents theoretical and applied research to address the knowledge gap by extending STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) -based analysis methods STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) and CAST (Causal Analysis based on STAMP). This thesis contributes to knowledge by introducing: 1) a coordination framework for use in analysis, 2) STPA-Coordination and CAST-Coordination, which extend STPA and CAST to analyze coordination, and 3) flawed coordination analysis guidance {{for use in the}} extensions. The coordination framework provides explanatory power for observation of and analysis of coordination in sociotechnical systems. The coordination framework includes perspectives for use in the evaluation of coordination, which are used to operationalize the framework for analysis. STPA-Coordination extends STPA with additional steps for analysis of how coordination can lead to unsafe controls (i. e. hazards). In part, STPA-Coordination uses analysis guidance introduced in this thesis that consists of four unique flawed <b>coordination</b> <b>cases</b> and nine <b>coordination</b> elements. CAST-Coordination extends CAST with additional steps to investigate accident causation influences from flawed <b>coordination.</b> Two <b>case</b> studies evaluate the utility of extensions, flawed coordination guidance, and the framework. One case study investigates the application of STPA-Coordination to a current and significant sociotechnical system challenge-unmanned aircraft systems integration into military and civil flight operations. Results are compared to official functional hazard analysis and requirements results. The comparison shows that STPA-Coordination provides additional insights into identifying hazardous coordination scenarios and recommendations. Another case study applies CAST-Coordination to investigate a Patriot missile friendly fire (2003) during Operation Iraqi Freedom, which is a relevant concern today. CAST-Coordination is successfully applied to the friendly-fire coordination problem. When compared to official government accident investigation reports, CAST-Coordination shows benefits in identifying accident influences and generating recommendations to address the coordination and safety problem. Both case study quantitative and qualitative results are promising and suggest STPA- and CAST-Coordination and the coordination framework are useful. by Kip Edward Johnson. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Abstract. Typically, {{supply chain}} members are {{dependent}} on each other to manage various resources and information. The conflicting objectives and lack of coordination between supply chain members may often cause uncertainties in supply and demand. The basic elements of coordination theory like interdepen-dency, coherency and mutuality may help in effective flow of information and material between the dependent supply chain members. Supply chain contract {{can be an effective}} coordination mechanism to motivate all the members {{to be a part of}} the entire supply chain. There are different types of supply chain contracts such as buy back and quantity flexibility contracts. Supply chain performance may be substantially improved by properly designing the contracts to share risks and rewards. The objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of coordination elements through an analytical model in three-level (Manufacturer–distributor– retailer) serial supply chains using contracts. The model evaluates the impact of supply chain contracts on various performance measures. The impact of some con-tract may be on some specific performance measure only, which helps managers to choose the type of contract if there is an objective of improving certain perfor-mance measure before hand. In three-level supply chains, the contracts are designed at two distinct interfaces: Manufacturer–distributor and distributor–retailer. The model demonstrates the complexity in evaluating the decision variables of three level supply chains. The proposed model is a novel approach to apply coordination theory at various levels of supply chain. The model also presents how the coordi-nation elements are related to each other in various <b>coordination</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R
