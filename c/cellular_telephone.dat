5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|Edwin H. Armstrong {{installed}} an FM-broadcasting {{station on}} the top of Mount Washington in 1937. The station included the original broadcast tower, the Yankee Building, which housed the crew and transmitter equipment, and the first power house building. The station stopped operating in 1948, due to excessive maintenance costs. The original Armstrong tower still stands today. The Yankee Building also remains and continues to serve as a communications facility, housing equipment for numerous tenants including <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> providers and public safety agencies. The only building no longer standing from Armstrong's original station is the original power house which was destroyed by fire in 2003 when a fire spread to it that had started in a neighboring building. In 1954 a TV tower and transmitters were installed for WMTW, Channel8, licensed to Poland Spring, Maine. The station continuously broadcast until 2002 {{from the top of the}} mountain, including local forecasts by (now retired) WMTW transmitter engineer Marty Engstrom.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, BART {{became the}} first transit system in the United States to offer <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> {{communication}} to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground. Service was made available for customers of Verizon Wireless, Sprint/Nextel, AT Mobility, and T-Mobile in and between the four San Francisco Market Street stations from Civic Center to Embarcadero. In 2009, service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube, thus providing continuous cellular coverage between West Oakland and Balboa Park. In 2010, service was expanded to all underground stations in Oakland (19th Street, 12th Street/Oakland City Center, and Lake Merritt). Uninterrupted cellular coverage of the entire BART system is a goal. As of 2012 passengers in both the Berkeley Hills tunnel and the Berkeley subway (Ashby, Downtown and North Berkeley) received cell service. The only section still not covered by cell service is a short tunnel that leads to Walnut Creek BART, and San Mateo County subway stations (including service to SFO and Millbrae).|$|E

A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland.

Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E

The question on the capability of the FDTD method to correctly predict the radiated electromagnetic fields of today’s structurally complex mobile telephones is addressed. Two commercially available <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> equipped with two different antennas (one helix and one helix monopole) have been considered and the radiation patterns have been measured and FDTD computed with and without the human head. The FDTD computed and measured radiation patterns show good agreement. This verifies that numerical techniques are suitable for accurately modeling radiation patterns of realistic <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> and, more importantly, that the FDTD method is a valid alternative to measurements {{in the design of}} new <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones.</b> Index Terms—Cellular telephones, dosimetry, FDTD, mobile antennas, radiation patterns...|$|R

40|$|Context. A {{relative}} paucity of data {{exist on the}} possible health effects of using <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones.</b> Objective. To test the hypothesis that using handheld <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> {{is related to the}} risk of primary brain cancer. Design and Setting. Case-control study conducted in 5 US academic medical centers between 1994 and 1998 using a structured questionnaire. Patients. A total of 469 men and women aged 18 to 80 years with primary brain cancer and 422 matched controls without brain cancer. Main Outcome Measure. Risk of brain cancer compared by use of handheld <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones,</b> in hours per month and years of use. Results. The median monthly hours of use were 2. 5 for cases and 2. 2 for controls. Compared with patients who never used handheld <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones,</b> the multivariate odds ratio (OR) associated with regular past or current use was 0. 85 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 6 - 1. 2). The OR for infrequent users (10. 1 h/mo) was 0. 7 (95 % CI, 0. 3 - 1. 4). The mean duration of use was 2. 8 years for cases and 2. 7 years for controls; no association with brain cancer was observed according to duration of use (P=. 54). In cases, cerebral tumors occurred more frequently {{on the same side of}} the head where <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> had been used (26 vs 15 cases; P=. 06), but in the cases with temporal lobe cancer a greater proportion of tumors occurred in the contralateral than ipsilateral side (9 vs 5 cases; P=. 33). The OR was less than 1. 0 for all histologic categories of brain cancer except for uncommon neuroepitheliomatous cancers (OR, 2. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 9 - 4. 7). Conclusions. Our data suggest that use of handheld <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> is not associated with risk of brain cancer, but further studies are needed to account for longer induction periods, especially for slow-growing tumors wit...|$|R

25|$|There are {{currently}} three CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) available.

The Dexcom System is another system, available in two different generations in the US, the G4 and the G5. (1Q 2016). It is a hypodermic probe with a small transmitter. The receiver {{is about the size of}} a cell phone and can operate up to twenty feet from the transmitter. The Dexcom G4 transmits via radio frequency and requires a dedicated receiver. The G5 version utilizes Bluetooth low energy for data transmission, and can transmit data directly to a compatible <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone.</b> Currently, only Apple's iPhone can be used as a receiver, but Dexcom is in the process of getting an Android version approved, and anticipates availability in the second half of 2016. Aside from a two-hour calibration period, monitoring is logged at five-minute intervals for up to 1 week. The user can set the high and low glucose alarms.

500|$|Sometimes, {{telecommunication}} {{systems are}} [...] "duplex" [...] (two-way systems) {{with a single}} box of electronics working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a transceiver. For example, a <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> is a transceiver. The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily {{explained by the fact}} that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in watts or kilowatts, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the microwatts or nanowatts. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.|$|E
