5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
25|$|A {{recumbent}} bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat that some riders find more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> a saddle, especially riders {{who suffer from}} certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat steering.|$|E
25|$|Ballet flats, {{known in}} the UK as ballerinas, ballet pumps or skimmers, are shoes with a very low heel and a {{relatively}} short vamp, exposing much of the instep. They are popular for warm-weather wear, and {{may be seen as}} more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> shoes with a higher heel.|$|E

25|$|Greswell's next {{appearance}} in important cricket was for Ceylon, {{again in a}} one-day match with an England side {{on its way to}} Australia. The 1924–25 team's stopover in Colombo was no more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> their predecessors in 1920 had been: a virtually full Test side was dismissed for a total of 73, and Greswell took eight wickets for 38 runs.|$|E
25|$|In one variant, {{the woman}} may lift and {{slightly}} bend her legs, resting her {{feet flat on}} the mattress. This shortens the distance between the vagina and cervix, and may apply more friction to the area termed the G-Spot. The woman may find this more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the standard position, and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.|$|E
25|$|The riding {{position}} {{places the}} feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, {{so that the}} spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist {{the force of the}} wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability {{due to a lack of}} ground clearance.|$|E

25|$|Officers' camps accommodated, in {{addition}} to their officer-prisoners, a smaller number of other ranks prisoners known as orderlies, whose role was to act as servants to the officers and to perform menial tasks around the camp. Orderlies appreciated that their situation was safer and more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> that of their counterparts in soldiers' camps, and so, even when offered the opportunity, they generally did not try to escape, knowing that if recaptured they would be sent to far worse conditions.|$|E
25|$|The wealthier suburbs west of {{the city}} are located at {{slightly}} higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, Córdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined to a lower humidity {{and the possibility of}} fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> in the capital.|$|E
25|$|At 29, McQueen got a {{significant}} break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis, Jr., {{from the film}} Never So Few after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> when driving at high speed—in this case in a jeep—or handling a switchblade or a tommy gun.|$|E

25|$|Egyptians {{looked at}} the afterlife as a {{continuation}} of this life, and believed {{that they would be}} able to enjoy many of the same activities. They also held the belief that {{they would be able to}} maintain the same social hierarchy. Egyptians, especially upper class Egyptians, were very preoccupied with making sure their life to come would be as comfortable, if not more <b>comfortable,</b> <b>than</b> their life on earth. They took every precautionary measure to ensure that they would enjoy the same comforts. Excavated tombs were found to contain food, painted murals, statues, jewelry, and various other items.|$|E
25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} of the Il-18 was made on 18 August 1946, in a sixty-passenger configuration, even though the turbosuperchargers for its engines had not been fitted. To save time Sergey Ilyushin gave the order to {{commence}} flight tests without them. However, this proved to be in vain because the manufacturer's flight tests were not concluded until 30 July 1947 as the turbo-superchargers were not delivered in a timely manner. Other problems were the short time between overhauls for the ASh-73TKs, initially only 25 hours, and the disintegration of one engine on 25 June 1947. Flight characteristics were docile and the passenger cabin proved {{to be far more}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> those of the Lisunov Li-2, the C-47 Skytrain or the Il-12. It had a comfortable margin of power that allowed it to continue to cruise if one or even two engines weren't running. Its engines were in short supply as they were needed to power the Tupolev Tu-4 and they were not yet reliable enough for economical use so the aircraft was canceled.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{conversion}} to a troopship in 1851, a forecastle and poop deck {{were added to the}} Birkenhead to increase her accommodation, and a third mast added, to change her sail plan to a barquentine. [...] Although she never served as a warship, she was faster and more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> any of the wooden sail-driven troopships of the time, making the trip from the Cape in 37days in October 1850.|$|E
500|$|She then landed {{her first}} major film role as Stephanie Zinone in Grease 2 (1982), {{the sequel to}} the smash-hit musical Grease (1978). The film was a {{critical}} and commercial failure, and Pfeiffer's single release of [...] "Cool Rider" [...] from the film's soundtrack on PolyGram failed to dent the music charts. Nevertheless, Pfeiffer received some positive attention for her performance, notably from The New York Times, which said [...] "although she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> {{anyone else in the}} cast". Despite escaping the critical mauling, Pfeiffer's agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that [...] "she couldn't get any jobs. Nobody wanted to hire her".|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares {{noted that}} [...] "Scars" [...] {{exemplified}} Cyrus' equating of [...] "grown-up with joyless", {{adding that the}} track fails to find the [...] "emotional depth" [...] Cyrus was likely intending. She also described [...] "Take Me Along" [...] {{as one of the}} more [...] "overwrought ballads" [...] where Cyrus' delivery seemed more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> others on the record. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "Robot" [...] highlighted the theme of defiance and rebellion seen throughout Can't Be Tamed, specifically noting the lyrics [...] "Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark / I would scream but I'm just this hollow shell". The record closes with the twelfth track [...] "My Heart Beats for Love", which according to Ham, describes [...] "the more universal ideal of love for all"; Greenblatt also recognized the integration of organ instrumentation.|$|E
5000|$|... ārāma: a more {{permanent}} and more <b>comfortable</b> arrangement <b>than</b> the avasa. This property was generally donated and maintained by a wealthy citizen. This was more lavish (as {{suggested by the}} name - Araama means both pleasant and park). It generally consisted of residences within orchards or parks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fan {{will be so}} much {{warmer and}} more <b>comfortable</b> here <b>than</b> {{at the top of}} the house," [...] she remarked to Rosie, as if she too had a little malice in her disposition, and was able to take {{pleasure}} in sprinkling powder on a raw sore.|$|R
60|$|Dave was now {{helpless}} {{and if the}} truth must be told the fall had more than half dazed him, for his head came down on a spot that was far from soft and <b>comfortable.</b> More <b>than</b> this, with an empty gun he could do but little to defend himself.|$|R
500|$|In July 1966, {{he began}} a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, a {{traditional}} rite of passage in his family. He arrived in Le Havre, where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions. Rules against drinking, smoking, and dating were strictly enforced. Most individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception: he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission. He initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when [...] "most of what I {{was trying to do}} was rejected." [...] He soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted. He was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the digs he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Those who yelled at him and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve.|$|E
500|$|The Northern Stand {{holds the}} most season ticket-holders. It is a single-tier {{terracing}} section, with railing in various places across the stand for security and comfort. It can {{hold up to}} 100 wheelchair users and their companions in a dedicated section. The stand also houses conference facilities with views of the pitch, {{as well as the}} 2,000-capacity [...] "Restaurang 1910" [...] in the inside area, behind the terraced area of the stand, and a health club run by Friskis & Svettis. Malmö FF's official souvenir shop is {{on the outside of the}} stand, alongside an O'Learys sports bar, which holds up to 250 guests. The Eastern and Western Stands house 54 VIP boxes between them, which is more than any other football stadium in Sweden. Including all sports, is the second most after the multi-purpose indoor arena Malmö Arena, which has 72 boxes. The Eastern and Western Stands [...] also have 2,000 club seats along their upper tiers. These seats are more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> the regular seats, and come with half-time meals and snacks in [...] "Restaurang 1910". The Western Stand includes seating for the press, as well as a large press room inside the stand. The president's box, which holds up to 60 people, is also in the Western Stand.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, under {{pressure}} from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Castle Seeon. The Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia. During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell {{out of her hand}} and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a [...] "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more <b>comfortable</b> <b>than</b> any alternative.|$|E

50|$|When Talleyrand became French {{ambassador}} in London in 1830, she accompanied him and felt more <b>comfortable</b> there <b>than</b> in Paris, which she detested {{and where the}} whole Faubourg Saint-Germain made her feel she was a foreigner. This was a theme throughout her life: in Prussia she was seen as too French, in Paris as too German.|$|R
