The Mauch team noticed that closed-cell foams, which trap gas within their structure, expand when outside pressure is lowered.

5000|$|In {{people who}} do not have a {{diagnosis}} of high blood pressure, drinking 2-3 liters of fluid a day and taking 10 grams of salt can improve symptoms, by maximizing the amount of fluid in the bloodstream. Another strategy is keeping the head of the bed slightly elevated. This reduces the return of fluid from the limbs to the kidneys at night, thereby reducing nighttime urine production and maintaining fluid in the circulation. Various measures can be used to improve the return of blood to the heart: the wearing of compression stockings and exercises ("physical <b>counterpressure</b> manoeuvres" [...] or PCMs) that can be undertaken just before standing up (e.g., leg crossing and squatting).|$|E
50|$|Skintight suits, {{also known}} as {{mechanical}} <b>counterpressure</b> suits or space activity suits, are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body. The head is in a pressurized helmet, {{but the rest of}} the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit. This eliminates the constant volume problem, reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit. When not worn, the elastic garments' may appear to be that of clothing for a small child. These suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure. Most proposals use the body's natural perspiration to keep cool. Sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may desublime or deposit on objects nearby: optics, sensors, the astronaut's visor, and other surfaces. The icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance.|$|E

The aesthetic qualities of a sleek, form-fitting space activity suit also contrast the traditional image of rigid, diving-suit-style spacesuits, lending a futuristic look to costumes.

50|$|Following the war, the Cold War caused {{continued}} {{funding of}} aviation development, which included high altitude, high speed research such as NACA's X-1. James Henry of the University of Southern California devised a {{partial pressure suit}} using an oxygen mask to provide pressurised oxygen, with gas pressure also inflating rubber tubes called capstans to tighten the suit and provide sufficient mechanical <b>counterpressure</b> to just balance the breathing pressure necessary to prevent hypoxia at a particular altitude. The David Clark Company supplied technical support and resources, and a prototype suit was tested to a simulated 90,000 feet at Wright Field in 1946. Henry's design was subsequently developed by the David Clark Company into the S-1 and T-1 flight suit used by X-1 pilots. The X-1 was succeeded by the Douglas Skyrocket, whose objective was to exceed Mach 2, and an improved pressure suit was required. David Clark won the contract in 1951 with their first full pressure suit, the Model 4 Full Pressure Suit; it was first flown in 1953 by USMC aviator Marion E.

40|$|Measurements of {{the surface}} tension of {{supercooled}} water down to - 25 °C have been reported recently (Hrubý et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2014, 5, 425 – 428). These experiments did not show any anomalous temperature dependence {{of the surface}} tension of supercooled water reported by some earlier measurements and molecular simulations. In the present work, this finding is confirmed using a <b>counterpressure</b> capillary rise method (the <b>counterpressure</b> method) {{as well as through}} the use of the classical capillary rise method (the height method). In the <b>counterpressure</b> method, the liquid meniscus inside the vertical capillary tube was kept at a fixed position with an in-house developed helium distribution setup. A preset <b>counterpressure</b> was applied to the liquid meniscus when its temperature changed from a reference temperature (30 °C) to the temperature of interest. The magnitude of the <b>counterpressure</b> was adjusted such that the meniscus remained at the same height, thus compensating the change of the surface tension. One advantage of the <b>counterpressure</b> method over the height method consists of avoiding the uncertainty due to a possible variation of the capillary diameter along its length. A second advantage is that the equilibration time due to the capillary flow of the highly viscous supercooled water can be shortened. For both the <b>counterpressure</b> method and the height method, the actual results are relative values of surface tension with respect to the surface tension of water at the reference temperature. The combined relative standard uncertainty of the relative surface tensions is {{less than or equal to}} 0. 18 %. The new data between - 26 and + 30 °C lie close to the IAPWS correlation for the surface tension of ordinary water extrapolated below 0. 01 °C and do not exhibit any anomalous features...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Objective: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the role of transthoracic pressure in decompression lung injuries and the effectiveness of <b>counterpressure</b> to the thoracic surface. Methods: Thirty-six rabbits were randomly divided into one slow decompression group(S), five rapid decompression groups (R 1 -R 5). <b>Counterpressure</b> thoracic vests were used in the one rapid decompression group (R 5). Rabbit mortality was recorded and the surface damages of the lungs were measured. The damage tissue was also analyzed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscope. Results: The transthoracic pressure applied to the slow decompression and 5 rapid decompression groups were 0 kPa (S), 7. 52 kPa (R 1), 9. 77 kPa (R 2), 11. 89 kPa (R 3), 13. 62 kPa (R 4) and 13. 07 kPa (R 5), respectively. There were no obvious lung injuries in S group. Minor injuries were observed in R 1 group. With the increase of transthoracic pressure, the degree of severity of pulmonary congestion and edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lung rupture increased. The use of <b>counterpressure</b> thoracic vests prevented the lung injuries caused by high transthoracic pressure. Conclusions: Transthoracic pressure {{plays an important role in}} decompression lung injuries. The decompression lung injuries worsen with the increase of transthoracic pressure. <b>Counterpressure</b> thoracic vests can prevent the decompression lung injuries.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial, which included 223 patients age 38. 6 (+/- 15. 4) years with recurrent vasovagal syncope and recognizable prodromal symptoms. One hundred and seventeen patients were randomized to standardized conventional therapy alone, and 106 patients received conventional therapy plus training in PCM. RESULTS: The median yearly syncope burden during follow-up was significantly lower in the group trained in PCM than in the control group (p = 0. 004). During a mean follow-up period of 14 months, overall 50. 9 % of the patients with conventional treatment and 31. 6 % of the patients trained in PCM experienced a syncopal recurrence (p = 0. 005).

40|$|The article {{presents}} an analysis and formalization of existing methods for calculating {{the performance of}} different equipment for mechanical processing of raw materials with screw working body (grinders, mixers, pumps). It is noted that these methods do not consider the presence of <b>counterpressure</b> at the exit, where the reverse flow of the processed raw material is observed. Thus, the calculation of performance (e. g. grinders and pumps) is carried out more simply {{through the use of}} single empirical coefficient linking the design parameters, structural and mechanical properties of raw materials and the value of <b>counterpressure</b> with performance. It is shown that the existing calculation methods are developed for a homogeneous medium using Newtonian isothermal models and that their adjustment to experimental data was carried out by introducing the relevant empirical coefficients. These recommendations are widely used, but they do not allow the calculation of performance based on the <b>counterpressure.</b> The study was conducted mathematically by the method based on the technique of «deployment of the screw channel» {{in the form of a}} rectangle covered by plate (wall of the working cylinder) and moving at a constant speed. The main attention is drawn to the assumption that the screw channel has the form of a rectangle, one side of which is equal to the depth of thread and the second side is equal to the pitch of thread. The equation linking volumetric performance with the geometric parameters of the screw, the formula for determining the volumetric performance of the reverse flow and the equation linking the actual performance of the screw with its geometrical parameters, rotation speed, <b>counterpressure</b> and the rheological characteristics of raw materials are developed. The value of performance loss for the screw press is calculated considering reverse flow of meat through the gap.

40|$|A {{method for}} the in-line preconcentration and enantioseparation of {{clenbuterol}} by transient isotachophoresis-capillary zone electrophoresis-UV absorbance detection (transient ITP-CZE-UV) has been developed. It implies {{the use of}} dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin as chiral selector {{and the application of}} a hydrodynamic counterflow during the ITP step. ITP is used to focus the sample constituents prior to CE whereas a <b>counterpressure</b> counterbalances the electrophoretic migration of the compounds. The sample is then focused and kept stationary in the proximity of the capillary inlet before CZE separation, leading to an extended-volume ITP-CZE system. A new strategy for the fast optimization of the <b>counterpressure</b> has been developed which implies the measurement of the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic velocities of the analyte during ITP. The in-line preconcentration and enantioseparation of clenbuterol selected as model compound was optimized using this method.
