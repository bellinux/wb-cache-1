In contrast to traditional query processing scenarios, in which each relation is stored in the same primary database and in which completeness of answers is expected by users, data integration scenarios involve handling relations that are stored across multiple and potentially overlapping sources and dealing with conflicting objectives in terms of what coverage of answers users want and how much execution cost they are willing to bear for achieving the desired coverage.

30|$|In case of RS <b>coverage</b> <b>overlap,</b> {{the user}} {{association}} can {{be introduced to}} optimize {{the quality of the}} RS service, i.e., to let each MS register at certain RS to maximize the overall network service quality. Such a user association problem can be formulated as a stochastic combinational optimization problem. Solving such a problem is extremely difficult in case that the profiles of the RSs, e.g., their resource limitations and the channel conditions, are not identical. We first develop a model to describe the relationship between the user association and the rejection probability, based on a queueing model and a Markov chain model. Using this model, the original stochastic optimization problem is converted to a deterministic combinational optimization problem. To solve the problem, a local search method is proposed to balance the performance and the complexity. Specifically, the user association specifies the RS assigned to each MS for relaying service in the subsequent time slots, which is static over certain period and updated by the proposed algorithm when a new MS enters/leaves the BS’s coverage area or the profile of some MS changes. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Coverage path {{planning}} {{is the problem}} of moving an effector (e. g. a robot, a sensor) over all points in a given region. In marine robotics, a number of applications require to cover a region on the seafloor while navigating above it at a constant depth. This is the case of Autonomous Surface Vehicles, that always navigate at the water surface level, but also of several Autonomous Underwater Vehicle tasks as well. Most existing coverage algorithms sweep the free space in the target region using lawnmower-like back-and-forth motions, and the inter-lap spacing between these back-and-forth laps is determined by the robot’s sensor coverage range. However, while covering the seafloor surface by navigating above it at a constant depth, the sensor’s field of view varies depending on the seafloor height. Therefore, to ensure full coverage one would need to use the inter-lap spacing determined by the shallowest point on the target surface, resulting in undesired <b>coverage</b> <b>overlapping</b> among the back-and-forth laps. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate a coverage path that completely covers a surface of interest on the seafloor by navigating in a constant-depth plane above it. The proposed method uses environment information to minimize the <b>coverage</b> <b>overlapping</b> by segmenting the target surface in regions of similar depth features and addressing them as individual cov-erage {{path planning}} problems. A cell decomposition coverage method is applied to each region. The surface gradient is used to determine the best sweep orientation in each cell, and the inter-lap spacing in the lawnmower-like paths used to cover each cell is maximized on a lap-by-lap basis, hence obtaining a shorter, more efficient coverage path. The proposal is validated in simulation experiments conducted with a real-world bathymetric dataset that show a significant increase on path efficiency in comparison with a standard boustrophedon coverage path.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} deployment method to guarantee optimal monitoring quality {{is one of}} the key topics in underwater sensor networks. At present, a realistic approach of deployment involves adjusting the depths of nodes in water. One of the typical algorithms used in such process is the self-deployment depth adjustment algorithm (SDDA). This algorithm mainly focuses on maximizing network coverage by constantly adjusting node depths to reduce <b>coverage</b> <b>overlaps</b> between two neighboring nodes, and thus, achieves good performance. However, the connectivity performance of SDDA is irresolute. In this paper, we propose a depth adjustment algorithm based on connected tree (CTDA). In CTDA, the sink node is used as the first root node to start building a connected tree. Finally, the network can be organized as a forest to maintain network connectivity. <b>Coverage</b> <b>overlaps</b> between the parent node and the child node are then reduced within each sub-tree to optimize coverage. The hierarchical strategy is used to adjust the distance between the parent node and the child node to reduce node movement. Furthermore, the silent mode is adopted to reduce communication cost. Simulations show that compared with SDDA, CTDA can achieve high connectivity with various communication ranges and different numbers of nodes. Moreover, it can realize coverage as high as that of SDDA with various sensing ranges and numbers of nodes but with less energy consumption. Simulations under sparse environments show that the connectivity and energy consumption performances of CTDA are considerably better than those of SDDA. Meanwhile, the connectivity and coverage performances of CTDA are close to those depth adjustment algorithms base on connected dominating set (CDA), which is an algorithm similar to CTDA. However, the energy consumption of CTDA is less than that of CDA, particularly in sparse underwater environments...|$|R

Results indicate that suitable RAT selection is tightly dependent on: the ratio between the different offered traffic loads (or service-mix), the contention (if any) for radio resources by different services in particular RATs, and the identification of access-constrained RATs due to lack of coverage and/or terminal capability. In this paper we provide specific guidelines and rules concerning resource allocation for the utmost utilization of radio resources, in terms of Erlang capacity, and enhanced perceived quality by the users, in terms of achievable throughput.
