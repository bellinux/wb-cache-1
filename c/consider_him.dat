5|$|Bede's {{extensive}} use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> {{a more or less}} reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.|$|E
5|$|A semi-legendary figure, Laozi {{was usually}} {{portrayed as a}} 6th-centuryBCE {{contemporary}} of Confucius, but most modern historians <b>consider</b> <b>him,</b> assuming he existed, to have lived during the Warring States period of the 5th or 4thcenturyBCE. A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements as well as Chinese Legalism.|$|E
5|$|A. Bjarne Riis has {{admitted}} to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The {{organizers of the}} Tour de France have stated {{that they no longer}} <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> to be the winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due to the amount of time passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.|$|E
60|$|Lord Julian <b>considered</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>considering</b> <b>him</b> his {{expression}} softened.|$|R
2500|$|Both Theravada and Mahayana traditions {{accept the}} Buddha as the founder, Theravada <b>considers</b> <b>him</b> unique, but Mahayana <b>considers</b> <b>him</b> {{one of many}} Buddhas ...|$|R
50|$|During August, 1864, Poindexter {{was forced}} to leave his home fearing both the wrath of Unionists who <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> a bushwacker and Southern sympathizers who <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> a traitor. He sought the {{protection}} of Union authorities from both threats.|$|R
5|$|After {{his escape}} from Detroit, Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty oath to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> an exception to the pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|From May 1684, the King's illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, {{lived in}} the Netherlands, where he was fêted by William and Mary. Monmouth {{was viewed as a}} rival to the Duke of York, and as a {{potential}} Protestant heir who could supplant James in the line of succession. William, however, did not <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> a viable alternative and correctly assumed that Monmouth had insufficient support.|$|E
5|$|I <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> {{to be one}} of my {{best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to {{communicate}} through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
50|$|Sam <b>considers</b> <b>him</b> a cheater.|$|R
50|$|The scholar Karl Otfried Müller <b>considers</b> <b>him</b> {{a mythical}} person.|$|R
60|$|The King's {{green eyes}} <b>considered</b> <b>him,</b> his lips curling grimly.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, {{in spite}} of his lack of {{experience}} in dramatic roles, Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik to appear in the film Chopper (2000), a biographical film based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read. Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> for the part.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Näslund {{was drafted}} 16th {{overall in the}} 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team's general manager, Craig Patrick, hailed Näslund and Forsberg as the draft's top two {{prospects}} behind first-overall selection Eric Lindros. He compared Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings' Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, {{although he did not}} <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he was a more natural goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba is {{believed}} to be a kadak (fierce) deity, who causes troubles if not propitiated properly as per the family duties. Khandoba is worshipped with Turmeric (Bhandār), Bel fruit-leaves, onions and other vegetables. The deity is offered puran poli - a sweet or a simpler dish called bharit rodga of onion and brinjal. Mostly a vegetarian naivedya (offering of food) is offered to Khandoba in the temples, though most devotees <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> a non-vegetarian and a goat flesh is offered to the deity outside the temple.|$|E
60|$|Benham, {{upon the}} {{hearthrug}} before the empty fireplace, <b>considered</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{instead of}} boxing his ears, she <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> in earnest.|$|R
50|$|His unorthodox non-message {{philosophy}} and the often uncompromising, direct style of its presentation, generated {{a measure of}} notoriety and sharply-divided opinions. At the extremes, some people <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> enlightened, while others <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> {{nothing more than a}} charlatan. The clamour increased as books and articles about Krishnamurti and his newly expounded philosophy continued appearing.|$|R
5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} and nationalist politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow took for granted rumors that he was an agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters caused them to <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long to catch up with him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of clues that enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E
5000|$|General Galtieri <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> [...] "the best {{general of}} the Argentine army".|$|R
5000|$|Professor Charles A. Moore <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> the [...] "greatest philosopher of China." ...|$|R
60|$|Ruthven's blood-injected eyes <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> stonily {{out of a}} livid, gleaming face.|$|R
5|$|The White Sox {{brought on}} new manager Jack Onslow {{to begin the}} 1949 Chicago White Sox season. He {{had a problem with}} Seerey, who arrived {{overweight}} to spring training, and did not <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> worthy of practicing with the other players until he got the weight back down. After playing in four games for the Sox, his last coming on May 7, Seerey was sent to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, ending his major league career. He played for four minor league teams in 1949: Los Angeles, the Newark Bears, the Kansas City Blues, and the San Antonio Missions.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from the war, Porto Alegre resumed his {{political}} career. He became an active advocate for {{the abolition of slavery}} and a patron in the fields of literature and science. His death came on 18 July 1875 while again serving in Parliament. He was highly esteemed until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. Regarded as too closely associated with the fallen regime, Porto Alegre slipped into obscurity. His reputation was eventually rehabilitated to a certain degree by historians, some of whom <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> to be among Brazil's greatest military figures.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{reasonable}} doubt that McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> {{a suspect in the}} Cooper case because of significant mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and credible evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas {{on the day of the}} Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.|$|E
60|$|M. de Rivarol <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> {{with a faint}} lift of the eyebrows.|$|R
2500|$|However, Kierkegaard also <b>considered</b> <b>him,</b> a most {{dangerous}} sign {{of things to}} come: ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{a friend}} of Hermann Schrader, who <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> a musical genius.|$|R
5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running mate {{in the presidential election}} that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to <b>consider</b> <b>him,</b> telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was too old. Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now <b>consider</b> <b>him</b> among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
50|$|His petty {{officers}} <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> to {{have been}} too old for his job.|$|R
50|$|He likes Harry Crane, but <b>considers</b> <b>him</b> {{a bit of}} a Boy Scout.|$|R
50|$|Gustav Naan was despised by {{many who}} <b>considered</b> <b>him</b> a careerist and schemer.|$|R
