It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a price index to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.A sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of gross output or value-added output.

40|$|When {{reporting}} on {{the current state of}} the economy, the business press gives considerable attention to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> investment. The reason for the media attention appears to be related to three issues. First, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> investment apparently account for a substantial fraction of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> gross domestic product (GDP). Second, current <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> investment are assumed to convey useful information about the nearterm future of the economy. Third, there is a view that the inherent dynamics of inventory investment are destabilizing the economy. In this article I review some of the empirical regularities of inventory investment over the business cycle taking the first issue as a starting point. 1 The empirical regularities I choose to study are to some extent determined by particular theories of inventory investment, but any theory of inventory investment should be consistent with these regularities. The argument that inventory investment is important for the business cycle is often based on the close relationship between <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>inventory</b> investment and GDP during recessions. For example, Blinder (1981) and Blinder and Maccini (1991) argue that, in a typical U. S. recession, declining inventory investment accounts for most of the decline in GDP. In support of this claim, Table 1 documents the peak-to-trough decline of GDP and inventory investment during postwar U. S. recessions.
