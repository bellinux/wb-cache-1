40|$|Abstract — <b>Command</b> Processing Logic is <b>command</b> {{execution}} in spacecraft. The <b>commands</b> and the clock extracted from incoming signal {{are sent to}} the <b>command</b> processing logic. The <b>commands</b> are transmitted with redundancy and with encoding. Each <b>command</b> is transmitted four times. To detect error in <b>commands</b> encoding is used. The <b>command</b> processing logic should take care of redundancy and also should extract the correct <b>command</b> bit from the incoming bit stream. Ones correct <b>command</b> is detected the <b>command</b> processing logic produce an authentic pulse. With the rising edge of the authentic pulse, the <b>commands</b> are stored in an auxiliary register. The <b>command</b> processing logic also contains the logic to produce pulse <b>commands.</b> <b>Command</b> Decoding Logic the <b>command</b> decoder extracts the <b>command</b> information, the message bits and stores it in auxiliary resister which can be read using CPU. The <b>command</b> decoder then checks for the <b>command</b> bits and produce the pulse <b>commands...</b>|$|R
