40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{was formally}} identified among injecting drug users (IDUs) in 1981, {{and research on}} preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among drug injectors began shortly thereafter. At the time this research was begun, {{there was a general}} assumption that drug user (who were called drug abusers at that time) were too self-destructive and their behavior too chaotic for them to change their behavior to avoid infection with HIV. This chapter reviews the history of research on implementation of programs for prevention of HIV infection among IDUs. METHODS: Reviews of both research and program implementation research were conducted. <b>Consultative</b> <b>discussions</b> of issues and findings were conducted with researcher in the United States and other countries. RESULTS: An extremely large amount of useful information has accumulated during the pat 15 years. We now know that the great majority of IDUs will change their injecting behavior in response to the threat of AIDS and that these behavior changes are effective in reducing HIV transmission among drug injectors. Additional insight is needed regarding the apparent insufficiency of some prevention programs to control HIV, the transmission dynamics of rapid HIV spread, and the persistence of moderate to high incidence of HIV infection in high seroprevalence populations. Despite the current research knowledge base, implementation of effective prevention programs in may countries is nonexistent to incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: The most important barrier to reducing HIV transmission among drug injectors is not a lack of knowledge but the failure to implement effective prevention programs in may parts of the world...|$|R
40|$|ICMR 2013 was {{organised}} by Cranfield University on the 19 - 20 September 2013. The conference {{focuses on}} any aspects of product development, manufacturing technology, manufacturing systems, information systems and digital technologies. It {{provides an excellent}} avenue for researchers to present state-of-the-art multidisciplinary manufacturing research and exchange ideas. In addition to the four keynote speeches from Airbus and Rolls-Royce and three invited presentations, there are 108 papers in these proceedings. These papers are split into 24 technical sessions. The International Conference on Manufacturing Research is a major event for academics and industrialists engaged in manufacturing research. Held annually in the UK since the late 1970 s, the conference is renowned as a friendly and inclusive environment that brings together a broad community of researchers who share a common goal; developing and managing the technologies and operations that are key to sustaining the success of manufacturing businesses. For over two decades, ICMR has been the main manufacturing research conference organised in the UK, successfully bringing researchers, academics and industrialists together to share their knowledge and experiences. Initiated a National Conference by the Consortium of UK University Manufacturing Engineering Heads (COMEH), it became an International Conference in 2003. COMEH is an independent body established in 1978. Its main aim is to promote manufacturing engineering education, training and research. To achieve this, the Consortium maintains a close liaison with government bodies concerned with the training and continuing development of professional engineers, while responding to the appropriate <b>consultative</b> and <b>discussion</b> documents and other initiatives. COMEH is represented on the Engineering Professor’s council (EPC) and it organises and supports national manufacturing engineering education research conferences and symposia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an interpretive {{research}} project which examines {{the feasibility of}} implementing social audit within the general medical practice setting. The study aims to communicate patients' voices to aid evaluation of the potential contribution of social audit to the public health sector and also addresses particular conceptual problems which arise when attempting to implement social audit within this environment. The fieldwork focuses on one general health practice in Lanarkshire (in southern central Scotland). <b>Consultative</b> focus group <b>discussions</b> and individual interviews were carried out {{with a sample of}} twenty two patients. Patients were most concerned with health service organisational and delivery issues. Overall, the results suggest patients are enthusiastic about the ideas and process of the social audit. Patients were able to demonstrate a capacity for grasping accountability issues and balanced reasoning. There was an acute awareness of the constraints which exist in the public services. Patients addressed the broad rights and responsibilities issues, and highlighted the possible pitfalls of relying on a representational mechanism for ensuring their voices were heard. The study concludes that an involved and negotiative dialogue process of implementing social audit could provide beneficial understanding and ideas to the organisation which may be further researched...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background International {{codes of}} ethics play an {{important}} role in guiding professional practice in developing countries. In the occupational health setting, codes developed by international agencies have substantial import on protecting working populations from harm. This is particularly so under globalisation which has transformed processes of production in fundamental ways across the globe. As part of the process of revising the Ethical Code of the International Commission on Occupational Health, an Africa Working Group addressed key challenges for the relevance and cogency of an ethical code in occupational health for an African context through an iterative <b>consultative</b> process. <b>Discussion</b> Firstly, even in the absence of strong legal systems of enforcement, and notwithstanding the value of legal institutionalisation of ethical codes, guidelines alone may offer advantageous routes to enhancing ethical practice in occupational health. Secondly, globalisation has particularly impacted on health and safety at workplaces in Africa, challenging occupational health professionals to be sensitive to, and actively redress imbalance of power. Thirdly, the different ways in which vulnerability is exemplified in the workplace in Africa often places the occupational health professional in invidious positions of Dual Loyalty. Fourth, the particular cultural emphasis in traditional African societies on collective responsibilities within the community impacts directly on how consent should be sought in occupational health practice, and how stigma should be dealt with, balancing individual autonomy with ideas of personhood that are more collective as in the African philosophy of ubuntu. To address stigma, practitioners need to be additionally sensitive to how power imbalances at the workplace intersect with traditional cultural norms related to solidarity. Lastly, particularly in the African context, the inseparability of workplace and community means that efforts to address workplace hazards demand that actions for occupational health extend beyond just the workplace. Summary A stronger articulation of occupational health practice with advocacy for prevention should be an ethical norm. Ethical codes should ideally harmonize and balance individual and community needs so as to provide stronger moral authority guidelines. There is a need to consider an African Charter on Bioethics as complementary and strengthening of existing codes for the region...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{several decades}} of research, {{diseases}} remain a major constraint to sorghum product ion throughout the world. That {{was the reason}} ICRISAT and Texas A &M University cosponsored the first international workshop on sorghum diseases, hosted by ICRISAT at Hyderabad, India, in December 1978. It was also the reason for a second major international effort exact ly 5 years later, by INTSORMIL and ICRISAT, to gain more understand ing for better control of these diseases. This {{took the form of}} a highly specialized consul tants' group meeting to make recommendat ions on the research needs and strategies for control of sorghum root and stalk rots. Root and stalk rots are a group of diseases that reduce crop stands in the emergence and seedling stages, or most commonly cause stalk lodging in the postf lowering and grain-filling stages of plant development. The improved high-yieldpotential varieties and hybrids under good management tend to be particularly suscept ible to Iodging i nduced by root and stalk rot. Al though good progress has been made against other diseases of sorghum, research for control of root and stalk rots has been painfully slow. This is due to the complexi ty of the diseases themselves and the pauci ty of intensive interdisciplinary research on them. ICRISAT and INTSORMIL are commi t ted to supporting and conduct ing research that will provide the technology necessary for farmers to improve sorghum yields and help meet world food needs. Their joint ponsorship of the <b>Consultative</b> Group <b>Discussion</b> on Research Needs and Strategies for Control of Sorghum Root and Stalk Rot Diseases and the publication of these proceedings are important steps toward this objective. The contents of the background papers, the discussions, and the recommendat ions contained in this book represent the combined exper ience and knowledge of 27 scientists in the disciplines of breeding, physiology, and pathology. We feel certain that if national, international, and other sorghum improvement programs follow the various strategies and recommendat ions, significant progress will be made in this field. ICRISAT expresses special appreciat ion to the scientists who participated in this meet ing, to INTSORMIL for its help in funding the conference, and to the Rockefeller Foundation for hosting the meeting at its Study and Conference Center at Bellagio, Italy...|$|R
40|$|Various {{models and}} {{strategies}} {{have been implemented}} {{over the years in}} different parts of the world to improve maternal and newborn health (MNH) in conflict affected areas. These strategies are based on specific needs and acceptability of local communities. This paper has undertaken a systematic review of global and local (Pakistan) information from conflict areas on platforms of health service provision in the last 10  years and information on acceptability from local stakeholders on effective models of service delivery; and drafted key recommendations for improving coverage of health services in conflict affected areas. The literature search revealed ten studies that described MNH service delivery platforms. The results from the systematic review showed that with utilisation of community outreach services, the greatest impacts were observed in skilled birth attendance and antenatal consultation rates. Facility level services, on the other hand, showed that labour room services for an internally displaced population (IDP) improved antenatal care coverage, contraceptive prevalence rate and maternal mortality. <b>Consultative</b> meetings and <b>discussions</b> conducted in Quetta and Peshawar (capitals of conflict affected provinces) with relevant stakeholders revealed that no systematic models of MNH service delivery, especially tailored for conflict areas, are available. During conflict, even previously available services and infrastructure suffered due to various barriers specific to times of conflict and unrest. A number of barriers that hinder MNH services were discussed. Suggestions for improving MNH services in conflict areas were also laid down by participants. The review identified some important steps that can be undertaken to mitigate the effects of conflict on MNH services, which include: improve provision and access to infrastructure and equipment; development and training of healthcare providers; and advocacy at different levels for free access to healthcare services and for the introduction of the programme model in existing healthcare system. The obligation is enormous, however, for a sustainable programme, it is important to work closely with both the IDP and host community, and collaborating with the government and non-government organisations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The study {{investigated}} the effect of family group consultation. Specific hypotheses to be examined were: 1. Family group consultation is productive in helping individuals move toward more effective behavior {{as measured by the}} increase in correlation between self sort and the ideal sort at the end of consultation. 2. An individual will have accomplished greater congruence between self and ideal self indicating the likelihood of more effective behavior after eight weeks of participation than after twelve weeks in family group consultation. 3. As family group consultation progresses the goals of the individual family members become more congruent with the goals of the counselors. The subjects included two groups, one of which was made up of families who had been referred to the counseling staff at Portland Center. Families who were having difficulties because of faulty communication were accepted. In all cases the identified reason for referral was an adolescent in the family who was having difficulty in school. Twenty persons participated in the experimental group. The comparison group was made up of family members who had sought help at two other agencies in the Portland metropolitan area. There were sixteen persons in this group. The counselors who were involved with the experimental group subjects were of similar academic background, with the emphasis in psychology and education. The staff members of the agencies where the comparison group was located, had had academic emphasis in psychology and had had clinical training. Family group consultation was described to the family members who participated in the experimental group as a way of consulting {{with each other and with}} professional counselors. They were told that two or three families would meet together once a week for two hours. It was explained to them that they would be given an opportunity to relate to one another during the session and the counselor tried to prepare them for the openness and involvement expected of them. The first session was used to get acquainted and to gathering information. During the first hour, parents and children were seen together. The second hour the parents were seen in one group while the children were seen in another. During the second session the members were encouraged to describe family events. By the third session the individual family members were evaluating their own behavior, and the consultative process was engaged in by other families' members. The fourth session found the counselor involved in events in the group. The fifth session was devoted to encouraging the members to use the skills learned, to look at their individual behavior and to examine what messages were sent and received. The sessions from the fifth to the twelfth were a reiteration of what went before: information gathering, identification of issues, description of events, continuation of the <b>consultative</b> process, and <b>discussion</b> of alternative ways of behaving. The last session was used by the group to summarize the process of consultation. Data gathering involved the administration of an 80 -item Q-sort designed to measure self-concept. Rogers' definition of the self-concept was used. The family is seen to have profound effect on the self-concept of its members. Therefore, it was in the family that change was sought through family group consultation. The data were gathered to find out if family group consultation results in change. The instrument was administered three times and comparisons were made between self-sorts, ideal sorts, and the experts' sorts. Since the experimental and the comparison groups were not taken from the same population a nonparametric statistic had to be used. A contingency table and a test of probabilities were computed directly. There was no significant change in the experimental group. The limitations of the study were a consequence of the error in research design. The study should be replicated using a larger sample from the same population. The need for evaluating family group consultation has not been met by this study. However, the methodology described represents a departure from that which has been used and may be considered a worthy contribution to the literature...|$|R
