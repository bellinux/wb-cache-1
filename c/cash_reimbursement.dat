One allowable form of transit benefit is providing employees with transit passes, including farecards, tokens, vouchers, or passes which entitle {{a person to}} the use of a transit service or to purchase a transit pass. The employer can also use <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> in certain circumstances where a voucher or similar instrument is not [...] "readily available" [...] as defined by statute.

50|$|Actual federal {{assistance}} provided to states and their designated agencies {{are in the}} form of <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for meals served, and any other donation by the USDA to provide such meals. Program funds are provided to states through letters of credit issued under the FNS Agency Financial Management System. The states, in turn, use the funds to reimburse institutions for costs of actual operations (e.g., providing meals), as well as to support state administrative expenses. Generally, a state’s claim to <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> from the USDA is computed by first determining the number of meals served (by category and type), and multiplying the amount of service by a per-unit payment rate, also known as the “reimbursement rate.” The “type” of meal refers to the kind of meal service for which the institution seeks reimbursement, such as breakfasts, lunches, snacks, supplements, and dinners served. The “category” refers to the type of economic need of the child or adult to whom a meal is served, which can be categorized as “paid,” “reduced price,” or “free” meals.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the support provided to schools participating in the program {{comes in the form}} of a <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for each meal served. Schools are also entitled to receive commodity foods and additional commodities as they are available from surplus agricultural stocks. The National School Lunch Program serves 30.5 million children each day at a cost of $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2007. Most participants are also eligible for food during the summer through the Summer Food Service Program.|$|E
50|$|Qualified {{transportation}} {{fringe benefits}} allowed under section 132(f) include reimbursement {{for the cost}} of transportation in commuter highway vehicles (vanpooling), transit passes, and qualified commuter parking expenses.

Commuter benefits are not governed under the same rules and regulations as Flexible spending account (FSA) arrangements and are treated differently for tax and reporting purposes.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Honda Civics were notorious for rusting {{in less than}} three years from purchase where salt was used in the winter. The U.S. importer, American Honda Motor Company, signed a final consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission that provided owners of 1975-1978 Civics with rusted fenders the right to receive replacements or <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursements.</b> In the end, almost 1 million Honda owners were notified that their fenders could be repaired or replaced by the automaker at no charge. About 10% of all Hondas sold were to be inspected by a dealer, and the automaker had 180 days to replace front fenders and supporting parts that showed rust within {{the first three years of}} use.|$|R

50|$|In other {{surgical}} suites, in contrast, {{management decisions}} have patients {{as the first}} priority. Facilities performing elective cosmetic procedures for <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> are an example. Due to the patient being able to choose where they have plastic surgery, patients expect special circumstances such as first-rate customer service. Additionally, if a patient is one hour late for surgery the patient will most likely {{still be able to}} undergo surgery. This concept is in contrast to a large academic hospital, for example, where a patient who misses their check-in window for elective surgery is often removed from the surgery schedule to make room for re-shuffled elective and emergency cases.|$|E
50|$|On February 26, 2012, {{further details}} emerged {{regarding}} the cash gifts that Wulff received in December 2007. According to Wulff, he received 1,000 euro as {{a birthday present}} and a Christmas present of 2,500 euro from his mother-in-law to his wife Bettina. Six days after receipt of the birthday gift, the Wulffs left for a Sylt vacation in December 2007. Regarding the Sylt trip in August 2008, the district attorney's office {{said that they had}} questioned Wulff's <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> explanation because there was an eight-month gap between the Christmas gift in December and the Sylt vacation in August 2008 and because Wulff's bank account was in the red by more than 10,000 euro in July 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of Bike Week has caused cities to do major overhauls {{in respect to}} city planning. Things like smooth bicycle lanes and better bicycle laws are being demanded by citizens and the pressure is causing change. Many cities that hold annual Bike Weeks have committees who push {{for the improvement of}} city regulation. Cleveland Bikes has a committee that is about to contact city governments to advocate for better (safer and more fair) local ordinances covering bicycle operation. We have rated the ordinances ... Only one city, Brook Park, has excellent ordinances (rated A). About half (32) are mediocre (rating of C) and the rest are D's and F's (some even F-).Furthermore, the recent Bicycle Commuter Act of 2009 [...] extends transportation benefits to bicycle commuters. Commuters are defined as one who:(I) regularly uses a bicycle for {{a substantial portion of the}} travel between his residence and his place of employment, and (II) does not receive any other qualified transportation benefit for such as transit, and parking.The legislation provides a tax benefit to employers who offer <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursements</b> to an employee who commutes by bicycle, while helping defray the costs of commuting for the bicyclist.|$|R
5000|$|The School Breakfast Program {{provides}} federally subsidized breakfasts {{to children}} at schools {{and child care}} facilities in the United States. The program began as a 2 year pilot in 1966. The program was supposed to serve schools in poor neighborhoods and in areas where kids had to travel a long distance {{in order to make}} it to school. To get schools to participate Congress allowed for higher payments to schools that were defined as being in [...] "severe need". In its first year, the SBP spent US$573,000 serving about 80,000 children. In 1971 Congress modified the program, making it available to schools who needed to improve the nutrition and dietary needs of children in low income families and with working parents. They also changed the way funding was reimbursed, from categorical grant reimbursement to per-meal reimbursement. The SBP was permanently authorized in 1975 for all schools who needed to provide better nutrition for their students and for higher reimbursement of the school. Federal funding is provided in the form of <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursements</b> for each breakfast served, varied in amount by the family income of the participating child.|$|R

50|$|One {{other major}} change in the {{interpretation}} of the commuter benefit law occurred in late 2006 concerning the growing use of debit cards for transit benefits, an issue not addressed in the statute or in previous regulations. In response to the growing use of debit and credit cards (and other electronic media) for purchases for transit passes, the IRS issued a new set of guidelines to take effect beginning January 1, 2010. The new ruling states that a debit card (or other electronic media) used to provide transit benefits must be restricted for use only at those points of sale where only transit fare media, tickets, and passes are sold (terminal limited debit cards) to qualify as self-substantiating so that they could be categorized as transit passes. Debit cards that are not terminal limited are considered <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and require substantiation.|$|E
40|$|The National School Meals Programs {{affect the}} lives of almost all school {{children}} in the United States today. The National School Lunch Program, available in 99 % of US public schools and 83 % of private and public schools combined, serves over 31 million school children on a typical school day—nearly 64 % of school-age children. The total federal cost of the School Meals Programs was $ 14. 9 billion in 2012, {{and most of the}} funding is provided to school districts through federal reimbursement for free and reduced-price meals, with cash payments for the National School Lunch Program representing about 70 % of the total federal funding for the school food programs. Children from households with incomes at or below 130 % of poverty can receive a “free” lunch and those from households with incomes between 130 % and 185 % of poverty can receive a “reduced-price” lunch. During the 2013 – 2014 school year, the basic <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for lunch is set at $ 2. 93 for free lunches, $ 2. 53 for reduced-price lunches, and $ 0. 28 for other qualifying lunches. In addition, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program receive USDA Foods (“entitlement” foods) valued at 22. 75 cents in school year 2013 for each lunch served...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The federal government spends about $ 10 billion each year to provide meals to over 30 million students through the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs. However, a 2007 study estimated that of this amount, $ 860 million (8. 6 percent) in school year 2005 - 2006 was paid improperly because of errors {{in the number of}} meals counted and claimed for reimbursement. These programs are administered by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) through state agencies that, in turn, oversee local school food authorities (SFA). SFAs that participate in the lunch and breakfast programs receive federal <b>cash</b> <b>reimbursements</b> through the state agency for each meal served, and in the lunch program they also receive USDA commodity donations {{based on the number of}} meals served. In return, SFAs must serve meals that meet federal nutrition requirements and offer meals free or at a reduced price to students whose family's income falls below certain thresholds. While most of the roughly 13, 700 SFAs in traditional public school districts in the United States manage their own programs, about 13 percent choose to contract with private companies known as food service management companies (FSMC). FSMC involvement in food service activities varies among SFAs, depending on the duties specified in the contract, but these duties may include meal-counting and -claiming activities. Regardless of the duties specified in the contract, however, FNS guidance states that SFAs remain responsible for the overall operation of the school meal programs, including overall financial responsibility. SFAs are also required to ensure the accuracy of lunch claims through effective internal controls...|$|R
