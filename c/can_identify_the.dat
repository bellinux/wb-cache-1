5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

Sputum Gram staining and culture can also reveal the causative microorganism. In severe cases, bronchoscopy can collect fluid for culture. Special tests {{can be performed}} if an uncommon microorganism is suspected, such as urinalysis for Legionella antigen in Legionnaires' disease.|$|E

A picture has recently surfaced of known Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and a man who closely resembles the composite sketch, formed based on eyewitness' descriptions, of the Zodiac Killer. Police believe the photo was taken in San Francisco in the middle of 1966 or 1967. Police hope someone <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> man in the photo.|$|E

25|$|Fiercely {{territorial}} as some Indios fans are, {{a common}} practice {{for many of them}} is to turn the volume down on television broadcasts featuring the Indios, and turning a radio set on to the official Indios radio broadcast, which is aired on station WYEL-AM (600kHz) and streamcasted over the Internet. Soto's vocal inflections are so well recognized by fans that by just listening to his voice many <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> difference between a pop-up fly and a hit before the ball actually lands.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, {{published}} in 2008, {{claims to have}} replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization {{on the part of}} participants. The authors believe that their method <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.|$|E
25|$|Zircon {{has played}} an {{important}} role during the evolution of radiometric dating. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 ppm up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like erosion, transport, even high-grade metamorphism, they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by uranium-lead (U-Pb), fission-track, cathodoluminescence, and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the cathodoluminescence emission from fast electrons {{can be used as a}} prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscope. Zircons in sedimentary rock <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> sediment source.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work is twofold: First, to {{characterize}} the artifacts occurring in helical 4 D-CT imaging; second, to propose a method that <b>can</b> automatically <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> artifacts in 4 D-CT images. The authors have designed a process that <b>can</b> automatically <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> artifacts in 4 D-CT images, which may be invaluable in quantifying the quality of 4 D-CT images and reducing the artifacts from the reconstructed images on a large dataset...|$|R
25|$|Linguists have {{compared}} the many translations and even {{editions of the}} same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of The Little Prince in Korean, {{and there are also}} about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled Prince From a Star, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of The Little Prince. By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{other form}} of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown (which {{may or may not}} be {{distinct}} from the master's gown depending on the university; if it is, it usually is trimmed with lace, braid or other subtle indicators of rank) worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; there are fewer applications for the undress gown in normal university life. However, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn. At Cambridge, each doctor has its own undress gown, each trimmed differently, meaning one <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> degree of the wearer without the hood (the same is also the case for bachelors and masters gowns at Cambridge).|$|E
25|$|Tender soon {{learns that}} he {{has become one of}} the last two {{survivors}} of the Creedish Church. The caseworker has him go over photos of dead Creedish to see if he <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> other survivor, but he already knows it to be his brother Adam. He begins receiving phone calls from journalists and agents wanting his story. The caseworker manages to suffocate on a chemical solution of ammonia and chlorine that she was using to clean the fireplace, which had been secretly mixed together by Adam, and whose intended target was Tender. Adam steals the caseworker's files on the Creedish suicides immediately after the murder. The police suspect Tender, but he claims innocence and slips away. Tender, meanwhile, calls an agent and takes a flight to New York that very night. Thus begins his road to stardom.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore what it might be worth.|$|E
25|$|In the CII schema, each pigment has {{a generic}} index number that {{identifies}} it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN {{has been known}} {{by a variety of}} generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. Colour Index International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color index number as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure that produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.|$|E
25|$|Lucario is a canid-like Pokémon {{that is a}} bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws, {{while its}} chest and the {{exterior}} of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, thighs shaped like baggy shorts, and four small appendages {{on the back of}} its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur that is slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. Lucario has the ability to sense and manipulate , a form of energy emitted by all living things, and is able to understand human speech. As a result, Lucario can read the thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, {{to the point that it}} can even see otherwise invisible foes. When properly trained, it <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> feelings of others even if they are over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, a baby Pokémon that is also able to sense Aura. Compared to Lucario, Riolu is a pure Fighting-type Pokémon, rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon, and it cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario.|$|E

500|$|Spiders {{reproduce}} sexually and fertilization is internal but indirect, {{in other}} words the sperm is not inserted into the female's body by the male's genitals but by an intermediate stage. Unlike many land-living arthropods, male spiders do not produce ready-made spermatophores (packages of sperm), but spin small sperm webs on to which they ejaculate and then transfer the sperm to special syringe-like structures, palpal bulbs or palpal organs, borne on {{the tips of the}} pedipalps of mature males. When a male detects signs of a female nearby he checks whether she is of the same species and whether she is ready to mate; for example in species that produce webs or [...] "safety ropes", the male <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> species and sex of these objects by [...] "smell".|$|E
500|$|In 1858 Texas, the Speck brothers, Ace and Dicky, drive a {{group of}} black slaves on foot. [...] Among the {{shackled}} slaves is Django, sold off and separated from his wife, [...] von Shaft. The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from Düsseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, {{a group of}} outlaws for whom Dr. Schultz is carrying a warrant. When Ace becomes suspicious, Dr. Schultz, a superior gunslinger, kills Ace with a fast draw, then shoots Dicky's horse, pinning Dicky to the ground and crushing his leg. Dr. Schultz insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him {{at the mercy of the}} newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> Brittle brothers, Dr. Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the accident, [...] (Robert Picardo) {{develops}} a contemporary equivalent to barium sulfate (BaSO) radiocontrasting using a custom radioisotope with which he <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> disparate DNAs of the two original crewmen and use the transporter to disentangle the two. [...] Tuvix denounces the procedure however. [...] He argues that he has rights and that he doesn't want to die, for to restore the two lost crewmen would require his execution. [...] After discussing the situation with Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Kes, and Tuvix himself, Janeway ultimately decides {{to proceed with the}} separation, acting in absentia {{to protect the rights of}} the two original men. [...] Tuvix makes a final emotive plea for support from the crew, but finds no supporters. [...] After the Doctor refuses to take Tuvix's life in compliance with the medical precept of doing no harm, Janeway performs the procedure herself and succeeds in restoring both Tuvok and Neelix.|$|E
