25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{much of the}} growing American paper {{industry}} was based along the Hudson River {{in and around the}} cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking. To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier paper machine developed early in the century, which could make <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> {{began to}} {{disappear}} from the consumer market in the 1990s as desktop publishing, and WYSIWYG document generation became more popular and widespread. Consumers {{were willing to pay}} more to get a laser printer or inkjet printer that could produce near-typeset-quality documents. These printers accept standard size cut sheets (letter, legal or A4) of paper and do not require <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper.</b> <b>Continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> continues to be used in specialty commercial and industrial markets and, as of 2017, is still available from large retailers of office supplies such as OfficeMax and Staples.|$|R
50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while feed rollers grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> then advances into the feed rollers to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} are:low purchase cost, {{can handle}} multipart forms, cheap to operate, only needs fresh ribbons, rugged, low repair cost {{and the ability}} to print on <b>continuous</b> <b>paper.</b> This makes it possible to print long banners that span across several sheets of paper.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{extremely}} precise alignment required for dot alignment between NLQ passes, typically the paper {{needed to be}} held somewhat taut in the tractor feed sprockets, and the <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> stack must be perfectly aligned behind or below the printer. Loosely held paper or skewed supply paper could cause misalignments between passes, rendering the NLQ text illegible.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1766, {{the son of a}} paper maker and stationer, and {{grandson}} of the engraver Paul Fourdrinier, 1698-1758, elsewhere mistakenly named Pierre Fourdrinier. With his brother, Sealy, he commissioned the development of the Fourdrinier machine, a papermaking machine that could make <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> (rolls). A patent was granted on July 24, 1806, for a machine that could make any size of paper, very quickly.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry. In 1799, Louis-Nicolas Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> making machine. At the time Robert was working for Saint-Léger Didot, with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of {{the invention}}. Didot thought that England was {{a better place to}} develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the French Revolution, he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801.|$|E
50|$|While using {{high-pressure}} {{water for}} erosion dates {{back as far}} as the mid-1800s with hydraulic mining, {{it was not until the}} 1930s that narrow jets of water started to appear as an industrial cutting device. In 1933, the Paper Patents Company in Wisconsin developed a paper metering, cutting, and reeling machine that used a diagonally moving waterjet nozzle to cut a horizontally moving sheet of <b>continuous</b> <b>paper.</b> These early applications were at a low pressure and restricted to soft materials like paper.|$|E

5000|$|Paper {{honeycomb}} {{is still}} used in structural {{applications such as}} inner doors, separation walls and furniture (kitchen cabinets). Door companies incorporated high-speed production lines with <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> honeycomb {{and are able to}} produce up to 10,000 doors a week. In Switzerland and Germany, paper honeycomb has become an important material in home construction. The use of paper honeycomb as a cost-effective way to provide temporary housing units has been explored but despite high interest levels has not become the standard for temporary shelter.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{papermaking}} {{machines are}} based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a specially woven plastic fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a wire as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> web. After the forming section the wet web passes through a press section to squeeze out excess water, then the pressed web passes through a heated drying section.|$|E

50|$|After {{printing}} the separated sheets {{can be held}} in binders {{by using}} the sprocket holes when simply required as a record. Alternatively some types of <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> also have longitudinal perforations along each edge inside the engagement holes, allowing the strips with sprocket holes to be torn off the printed page.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{grade of}} <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> uses a heavy bond weight similar to typing paper. Perforations {{are very small}} and close together, {{referred}} to as microperforations or microperf, to allow the sheets to be separated and the sprocket hole strip torn off leaving a very smooth edge almost as if guillotine-cut.|$|R

50|$|Machine-made <b>continuous</b> <b>paper,</b> just invented, {{was not yet}} commercially {{available}} when Dufour undertook his project. Instead, small rectangular handmade sheets were joined at the edges to form long rolls, which were later cut to the desired length (approximately 24 by 98 inches or 61 × 249 cm). A toned, water-based ground layer was then applied by brush to the entire panel {{to act as an}} undercoat for subsequent printing. This light blue layer also served as the sky tone in unprinted areas. Designs for each color were carved on separate blocks, and as many as sixty were required to print a single panel. The design was then enhanced with stenciled hand-painted gouache.|$|E
50|$|Dot matrix printers, {{like any}} impact printer, can print on {{multi-part}} stationery or make carbon-copies. Impact printers {{have one of}} the lowest printing costs per page. As the ink is running out, the printout gradually fades rather than suddenly stopping partway through a job. They are able to use <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> rather than requiring individual sheets, making them useful for data logging. They are good, reliable workhorses ideal for use in situations where low printing cost is more important than quality. The ink ribbon also does not easily dry out, including both the ribbon stored in the casing as well as the portion that is stretched in front of the print head; this unique property allows the dot-matrix printer to be used in environments where printer duty can be rare, for instance, as with a Fire Alarm Control Panel's output.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the <b>continuous</b> <b>paper.</b> Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> {{is used in}} some of {{the fastest}} types of {{printing}} systems, some of which print text at a rate of 20,000 lpm (lines per minute). This will produce about 400 pages per minute, using about 8-11 large boxes of paper for every hour of printing (affected by character density, and other details such as paper weight).|$|R
5000|$|The {{cheapest}} {{grade of}} <b>continuous</b> form <b>paper</b> is often preprinted with bars of light green lines across its width, to facilitate following {{a line of}} information across the page, a type {{commonly referred to as}} green bar, music [...] or music-ruled paper. It is a very lightweight bond, usually without slit perforations to remove the engagement hole strips.|$|R

50|$|It {{was in the}} 18th century, that Lousã {{transformed}} from modest village to a town, with roads lined with new edifices, housing the Portuguese nobility. With {{the creation of the}} paper industry, the Engenho de Papel do Penedo, produced goods of exquisite quality that, in 1716, it received the (then) prestigious typographic seal of the Society of Jesus of Coimbra, later followed by the Tipografia Académica, founded by the Marquis of Pombal and the Casa da Moeda. Other companies would install themselves with the municipality's borders. In 1868, the Fábrica do Boque was founded in Serpins, it operated the first machine to produce <b>continuous</b> <b>paper</b> in Portugal at the time. The Fábrica do Casal de Ermio, which operated between 1853 and 1890, later acquired by the Fábrica do Penedo and transformed into a power plant. Other industries provided wiring, namely the Foz de Arouce and produced energy. Mills, liqueurs, saw-milling, carpentry and other diverse industries, allowed the municipality to transform from agricultural to manufacturing services.|$|E
