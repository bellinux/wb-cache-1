It has found numerous applications {{in various parts}} of mathematics, most prominently in representation theory. This volume develops the theory of ind-coherent sheaves in the context of derived algebraic geometry. Ind-coherent sheaves are a "renormalization" of quasi-coherent sheaves and provide a natural setting for Grothendieck-Serre duality as well as geometric incarnations <b>of</b> numerous <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> interest in representation theory. This volume consists of three parts and an appendix. The first part is a survey of homotopical algebra in the setting of ∞-categories and the basics of derived algebraic geometry. The second part builds the theory of ind-coherent sheaves as a functor out <b>of</b> the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> and studies the relationship between ind-coherent and quasi-coherent sheaves. The third part sets up the general machinery of the (∞, 2) -category <b>of</b> <b>correspondences</b> needed for the second part.

40|$|An exotic crossed {{product is}} a way of associating a C*-algebra to each C*-dynamical system that generalizes the {{well-known}} universal and reduced crossed products. Exotic crossed products provide natural generalizations of, and tools to study, exotic group C*-algebras as recently considered by Brown-Guentner and others. They also form an essential part of a recent program to reformulate the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients so as to mollify the counterexamples caused by failures of exactness. In this paper, we survey some constructions of exotic group algebras and exotic crossed products. Summarising our earlier work, we single out a large class of crossed products [...] - the correspondence functors [...] - that have many properties known for the maximal and reduced crossed products: for example, they extend to <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> equivariant <b>correspondences,</b> and have a compatible descent morphism in KK-theory.

40|$|The <b>correspondence</b> <b>of</b> {{qualifications}} gained {{and those}} actually required constitutes an important research subject in many respects. It can amongst other things provide contributions to research into inequality, mobility, status inconsistency, and transformation and not least contributions to training and labour market policy. The {{study of the}} adequacy of training and education therefore follows the present discussion regarding the attractiveness of the dual training system compared with higher education. Some of the questions are as follows: Are workers with vocational qualifications or those with university educations {{more likely to be}} able to use their skills and knowledge at their place of work these days? To what extent does the German system of initial and further training provide qualifications which are needed on the labour market? To what extent is occupational knowledge acquired in the former German Democratic Republic usable in the 'new' Federal Republic of Germany? What effect does it have on remuneration when the activity corresponds or does not correspond with the training or education? Are the corresponding 'investments' in training and education at all worthwhile if the skills and knowledge acquired are hardly used or not at all used in the end? In the empirical examination of the adequacy of training and education the operationalisation of the same plays a decisive role. In this article it is proposed to differentiate in this respect not only according to the qualification level but particularly also according to the type of qualification. For this six <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> are distinguished: 1) correspondence: no trai-ning/ education; 2) correspondence: training/education; 3) different occupation; 4) overquali-fied: occupation trained in; 5) overqualified: different occupation; 6) underqualified. The analyses carried out on the basis of the socio-economic panel for 1993 show clear discrepancies both for western Germans and for eastern Germans between their training or education and the requirements of their jobs. Workers with vocational qualifications claim more frequently to be overqualified than graduates of higher education do. In western Germany in particular older workers with vocational training are employed below the level of their training, in eastern Germany this affects the younger workers. Most of the overqualified workers have hardly any opportunity to use the knowledge and skills they have gained. Adisparity between the qualifizations gained and those required is an important cause of income inequalities. Although overqualified workers do earn more than adequately trained workers in the same job - so their additional knowledge and skills are not entirely worthless - they receive far less than workers with similar training or education who are adequately employed. Eastern Germans who are overqualified have to accept higher losses than western Germany. The same is true of woman compared with men.

40|$|We {{apply the}} yoga of {{classical}} homotopy theory to classification problems of G-extensions of fusion and braided fusion categories, where G is a finite group. Namely, we reduce such problems to classification (up to homotopy) of maps from BG to classifiying spaces of certain higher groupoids. In particular, to every fusion category C we attach the 3 -groupoid BrPic(C) <b>of</b> invertible C-bimodule <b>categories,</b> called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that equivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes of maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). This {{gives rise to}} an explicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and the data parametrizing them; we work these out both topologically and algebraically. One of the central results of the paper is that the 2 -truncation of BrPic(C) is canonically the 2 -groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld center Z(C) of C. In particular, this implies that the Brauer-Picard group BrPic(C) (i. e., the group of equivalence classes <b>of</b> invertible C-bimodule <b>categories)</b> is naturally isomorphic {{to the group of}} braided autoequivalences of Z(C). Thus, if C=Vec(A), where A is a finite abelian group, then BrPic(C) is the orthogonal group O(A+A^*).
