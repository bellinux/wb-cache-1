5|$|Most lunar {{scientists}} will acknowledge that transient {{events such as}} outgassing and impact <b>cratering</b> do occur over geologic time: the controversy lies {{in the frequency of}} such events.|$|E
5|$|Comparison of {{high-resolution}} images {{obtained by}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary <b>cratering</b> process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Impact <b>cratering</b> is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} on many Solar System bodies. Much of Enceladus' surface is covered with craters at various densities and levels of degradation. This subdivision of cratered terrains {{on the basis of}} crater density (and thus surface age) suggests that Enceladus has been resurfaced in multiple stages.|$|E
5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact <b>cratering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} ages of {{the different}} surface units on Callisto can be determined from the density of impact craters on them. The older the surface, the denser the crater population. Absolute dating has not been carried out, but based on theoretical considerations, the cratered plains {{are thought to be}} ~4.5billion years old, dating back almost to the formation of the Solar System. The ages of multi-ring structures and impact craters depend on chosen background <b>cratering</b> rates and are estimated by different authors to vary between 1 and 4billion years.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the <b>cratering</b> still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's <b>cratering</b> record must come from plume deposits.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of <b>cratering.</b> The plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact <b>cratering,</b> fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E
25|$|Despite Barringer's {{findings}} and other excavations {{in the early}} 20th century, geologists' skepticism continued until the 1950s when planetary science gained in maturity and understanding of <b>cratering</b> processes increased. Professor Herman Leroy Fairchild, an early promoter of impact <b>cratering,</b> argued Barringer's case {{in an article in}} Science in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Determine what {{geologic}} processes {{have shaped}} the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and <b>cratering.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the projects directly associated with the ship evaluation program, various other projects were supported. These dealt with seismological effects, underwater acoustics, radio communications, <b>cratering</b> phenomena, free field air blast measurements, fireball generation, cloud growth and electromagnetic effects.|$|E
25|$|Lofn {{is one of}} the {{youngest}} impact craters on Callisto. All its geological units contain much less small impact craters than the surrounding crater plains. The age of Lofn is estimated at 1.393.88 billion years depending on the assumed <b>cratering</b> rate in the past.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} of shock-metamorphic features, Carlyle S. Beals and colleagues at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and Wolf von Engelhardt of the University of Tübingen in Germany began a methodical search for impact craters. By 1970, they had tentatively identified more than 50. Although their work was controversial, the American Apollo Moon landings, which were in progress at the time, provided supportive evidence by recognizing the rate of impact <b>cratering</b> on the Moon. Because the processes of erosion on the Moon are minimal, craters persist almost indefinitely. Since the Earth could be expected to have roughly the same <b>cratering</b> rate as the Moon, {{it became clear that the}} Earth had suffered far more impacts than could be seen by counting evident craters.|$|E
25|$|Later <b>cratering</b> history records a {{decreasing}} impact flux: of craters {{larger than}} 50km diameter, 42 are classed as c3; 19 craters {{are assigned to}} c4; and 9 craters are c5. There is also {{a decrease in the}} size of the largest crater or basin formed in each age class from c2 to c5.|$|E
25|$|Five periods were {{postulated}} by Murray {{and others}} (1975) to constitute {{the history of}} Mercury’s surface: (1) accretion and differentiation; (2) terminal bombardment; (3) formation of the Caloris Basin; (4) flooding of that basin and other areas; and (5) light <b>cratering</b> on the smooth plains. Only the periods following accretion are directly interpretable within the Borealis region.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} impact <b>cratering</b> {{remained}} {{more or less}} speculative until the 1960s. At that time a number of researchers, most notably Eugene Shoemaker, (co-discoverer of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9), conducted detailed studies {{of a number of}} craters and recognized clear evidence that they had been created by impacts, specifically identifying the shock-metamorphic effects uniquely associated with impact events, of which the most familiar is shocked quartz.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Barringer (1860–1929) {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{identify}} an impact crater, Meteor Crater in Arizona; to crater specialists the site is referred to as Barringer Crater in his honor. Initially Barringer's ideas were not widely accepted, and even when the origin of Meteor Crater was finally acknowledged, the wider implications for impact <b>cratering</b> as a significant geological process on Earth were not.|$|E
25|$|Impact breccia may be {{identified}} by its occurrence in or around a known impact crater, and/or an association with other products of impact <b>cratering</b> such as shatter cones, impact glass, shocked minerals, and chemical and isotopic evidence of contamination with extraterrestrial material (e.g. iridium and osmium anomalies). An example of an impact breccia is the Neugrund breccia, which was formed in the Neugrund impact.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk 200 has 11 {{external}} store points with four underwing pylons, an under-fuselage pylon, and wingtip air-to-air missile stations. The range of {{external store}}s which the aircraft can carry includes air-to-air missiles (AAM), anti ship missiles (AShM), torpedoes, a gunpod, rocket launchers, reconnaissance pod, retarded and free-fall bombs up to , runway <b>cratering,</b> anti-personnel and light armour bombs, cluster bombs (meanwhile prohibited), practice bomb and rocket carriers and external fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cratering</b> rate {{declined}} {{rapidly as}} the c3, c4 and c5 craters were produced. Regolith production continues {{to the present}} day on all units. If the geologic history of the Moon is a guide, most of the events discussed were essentially complete within the first 1.5 to 2.0 billion years of Mercury’s history (Murray and others, 1975). A summary of global mercurian geology may be found in Guest and O’Donnell (1977) and Strom.|$|E
25|$|Gaspra's surface lacks {{unambiguous}} craters {{of a size}} {{comparable to}} its radius, like those seen for example on 253 Mathilde. A probable {{reason is that the}} collision that produced the Flora family and Gaspra was relatively recent on an astronomical timescale, so that Gaspra has not yet had the opportunity to acquire many large craters since. Analysis of <b>cratering</b> rates suggests the age of the surface is between about 20 to 300 million years.|$|E
25|$|Storax Sedan was {{a shallow}} {{underground}} nuclear test conducted in Area 10 of Yucca Flat at the Nevada National Security Site on July 6, 1962 {{as part of}} Operation Plowshare, a program to investigate {{the use of nuclear}} weapons for mining, <b>cratering,</b> and other civilian purposes. The radioactive fallout from the test contaminated more US residents than any other nuclear test. The Sedan Crater is the largest man-made crater in the United States, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Impact breccias {{are thought}} to be {{diagnostic}} of an impact event such as an asteroid or comet striking the Earth and are normally found at impact craters. Impact breccia, a type of impactite, forms during the process of impact <b>cratering</b> when large meteorites or comets impact with the Earth or other rocky planets or asteroids. Breccia of this type may be present on or beneath the floor of the crater, in the rim, or in the ejecta expelled beyond the crater.|$|E
25|$|The first {{underground}} {{nuclear test}} {{was conducted on}} 29 November 1951. This was the 1.2 kiloton Buster-Jangle Uncle, which detonated 5.2m (17ft) beneath ground level. The test {{was designed as a}} scaled-down investigation of the effects of a 23 kiloton ground penetrating gun-type device that was then being considered for use as a <b>cratering</b> and bunker-buster weapon. The explosion resulted in a cloud that rose to 3,500 m (11,500ft), and deposited fallout to the north and north-northeast. The resulting crater was 79m (260ft) wide and 16m (53ft) deep.|$|E
25|$|In August 1963, Lair {{received}} {{an order to}} cut Route 7 between the Plain of Jars and the Vietnamese border. After Lair's training, PARU troopers, accompanying and directing 12 platoons of Hmong from their Special Guerrilla Units, infiltrated to a portion of Route 7 that ran along steep cliffs. The saboteurs planted double <b>cratering</b> charges in each of 120 demolition pits they dug, and exfiltrated. When the explosions blew {{in the middle of}} the night, two sections of clifftop road migrated downwards. Once again, Lair let Pop Buell claim credit. The Route 7 communist supply line would remain cut until November.|$|E
25|$|Impact <b>cratering</b> is {{the most}} notable {{geological}} process on the Moon. The craters are formed when a solid body, such as an asteroid or comet, collides with the surface at a high velocity (mean impact velocities for the Moon are about 17km per second). The kinetic energy of the impact creates a compression shock wave that radiates away {{from the point of}} entry. This is succeeded by a rarefaction wave, which is responsible for propelling most of the ejecta out of the crater. Finally there is a hydrodynamic rebound of the floor that can create a central peak.|$|E
25|$|Further {{examination}} of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of a bomb or missile warhead ("severe pitting, <b>cratering,</b> petalling, or hot gas washing"). This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found. Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage {{that would have been}} caused by the detonation of a bomb or missile. None of the victims' remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{faculty of}} six in 1874 {{has grown to}} 2,563 tenured and tenure-track faculty in the Purdue Statewide System by Fall 2007 totals. The number of faculty and staff members system-wide is 18,872. The current faculty includes scholars such as Arden L. Bement Jr. – Director of the National Science Foundation, R. Graham Cooks, Joseph Francisco, Douglas Comer, Louis de Branges de Bourcia (who proved the Bieberbach conjecture), Ei-ichi Negishi, Victor Raskin, Michael Rossmann (who mapped the human common cold virus), Leah Jamieson, James L. Mohler (who has written several manuals of computer graphics), Roxane Gay, and H. Jay Melosh (an American geophysicist, renowned as an expert on impact <b>cratering).</b>|$|E
25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins larger than about 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost certainly is more complex than our threefold division indicates, but {{we were not able to}} define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and <b>cratering</b> for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E
25|$|Impacts {{at these}} high speeds produce shock waves in solid materials, and both {{impactor}} {{and the material}} impacted are rapidly compressed to high density. Following initial compression, the high-density, over-compressed region rapidly depressurizes, exploding violently, to set in train {{the sequence of events}} that produces the impact crater. Impact-crater formation is therefore more closely analogous to <b>cratering</b> by high explosives than by mechanical displacement. Indeed, the energy density of some material involved in the formation of impact craters is many times higher than that generated by high explosives. Since craters are caused by explosions, they are nearly always circular – only very low-angle impacts cause significantly elliptical craters.|$|E
25|$|This valve allows fluids {{to pass up}} or be pumped {{down the}} {{production}} tubing. When closed the DHSV forms a barrier {{in the direction of}} hydrocarbon flow, but fluids can still be pumped down for well kill operations. It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including <b>cratering</b> caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface safety valve) below the seabed may be as much as 1km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve.|$|E
25|$|Impact craters are the {{dominant}} geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io and Titan, visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried or transformed by tectonics over time. Where such processes have destroyed {{most of the}} original crater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact <b>cratering</b> was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.|$|E
25|$|These craters {{appear in}} a {{continuum}} of diameters {{across the surface of}} the Moon, ranging in size from tiny pits to the immense South Pole–Aitken basin with a diameter of nearly 2,500km and a depth of 13km. In a very general sense, the lunar history of impact <b>cratering</b> follows a trend of decreasing crater size with time. In particular, the largest impact basins were formed during the early periods, and these were successively overlaid by smaller craters. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of crater diameters on a given surface (that is, the number of craters as a function of diameter) approximately follows a power law with increasing number of craters with decreasing crater size. The vertical position of this curve can be used to estimate the age of the surface.|$|E
25|$|Amritsar — At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages {{flying from}} Sargodha {{and led by}} Wing Commander Hakimullah {{attacked}} Amritsar AB. Hakimullah's flight was armed with two 500kg bombs each, which the strike used efficiently hitting the first 300m of the runway and <b>cratering</b> it enough to leave it nonoperational for several hours. However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of Mig 21s and Su-7 that flew against Rafiqui AB the next morning. A second strike of two F-104 Starfighters, led by Wing Commander Amjad H Khan hit the P-35 radar station at Amritsar, rendering it inoperational for nearly an hour. Two Sukhois then took off from the one remaining serviceable lane of the runway, moments before it was bombed by a passing B-57.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact <b>cratering</b> was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and {{there was no reason to}} believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E
