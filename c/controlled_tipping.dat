The fabricated mushroom-shaped micropillar arrays exhibited highly different tendencies in adhesion strength and repeatability depending on tip geometries, such as tip diameter and thickness, thereby demonstrating the importance of precise tunability of tip geometry of micropillars. The fabricated dry adhesives with optimized tip geometries not only exhibited strong pull-off strength of up to ∼ 34. 8 N cm- 2 on the Si surface but also showed high durability.

50|$|During the {{construction}} of the school, the playing field area needed to be levelled out.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 10 patients. The patients were divided into 2 groups of 5 patients each. The first group consisted of those who were in the Stage I or stage II, and were fitted with 0. 025 " x 0. 017 " braided NiTi (Turbo) sectionals, instead of the MAA, during retraction of maxillary anterior teeth. The second group included 5 patients who were ready for the stage III, and were treated with braided stainless steel or super elastic NiTi sectionals in 0. 025 " x 0. 017 " size, instead of a torquing auxiliary.

30|$|Orthodontic {{treatment}} {{is a long-term}} process with repeated occurrences and even side effects (if you {{do not expect to}} have tooth movement). The {{reason for this is that}} the orthodontists can not accurately control the orthodontic force. Studying orthodontics and the way the tooth moves can help orthodontists to develop a more rational orthopedic plan and design to ultimately improve orthodontic treatment efficiency. Previous studies have focused on teeth movements when a force or moment is applied to the tooth directly, the effect of bracket, and the direction of the force on the M/F ratios based on suitable material assumption for the PDL which are rarely performed in orthodontics. The aim of this study is to determine the precise M/F ratio that can generate uncontrolled tipping, <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping,</b> and translation movements for the mandible canine models with and without brackets, as well as the force systems applied in buccal-lingual and distal-mesial directions.|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} mechanical {{characteristic of a}} loop which determines the type of tooth movement is the moment/force ratio (M/F ratio) [12, 13]. As TMA wires exert lesser force than SS wires {{for the same amount}} of activation, hence, M/F ratio will be more in loops fabricated by TMA wires. Higher dimension TMA wires used in prescribed slot result in lesser amount of play and better torque expression that is further reinforced by gable bends given anteriorly in loops. This results in increased counterbalancing moment, hence better M/F ratios with higher dimension wires. This justifies the use of TMA wires of higher dimension in 0.18 slot over SS wires in the present study. According to the orthodontic literature, M/F ratio of 5 : 1 produces uncontrolled tipping, ratio of 7 : 1 produces <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping,</b> ratio of 10 : 1 produces bodily movement, and ratios greater than 10 : 1 produces root movement in labial orthodontics [13].|$|E
40|$|Torque control during lingual {{anterior}} retraction without posterior appliances Objective: To {{evaluate the}} factors that affect torque control during anterior retraction when utilizing the C-retractor with a palatal miniplate as an exclusive source of anchorage without posterior appliances.

Emphasis is put on {{the analysis of the}} effectiveness of tip injection when the approaching flow is at design and off-design incidences. A total of three incidence angles are investigated, − 7. 4 °, 0 °, 0 °, 0 °, and 7. 6 °, 0 ° relative to the design value. The results indicate that even at the off-design incidences, tip injection can also act as an obstruction to the tip clearance flow and weaken the interaction between the passage flow and the tip clearance flow. It is also found that tip injection causes the tip clearance loss to be less sensitive to the incidences. Moreover, with injection, at all these incidences the heat transfer conditions are improved significantly on the blade tip surface in the middle and aft parts of blade. Thus, tip injection is proved to be an effective method of <b>controlling</b> <b>tip</b> clearance flow, even at off-design conditions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the Hounsfield unit (HU) changes in the alveolar bone and root surfaces during controlled canine retractions. METHODS: Eighteen maxillary canine retraction patients were selected for this split-mouth design clinical trial. The canines in each patient were randomly assigned to receive either translation or <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping</b> treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment cone-beam computed tomography scans of each patient were used to determine tooth movement direction and HU changes. The alveolar bone and root surface were divided into 108 divisions, respectively. The HUs in each division were measured. Mixed-model analysis of variance was applied to test the HU change distribution at the P < 0. 05 significance level. RESULTS: The HU changes varied with the directions relative to the canine movement. The HU reductions occurred at the root surfaces. Larger reductions occurred in the divisions that were perpendicular to the moving direction. However, HUs decreased in the alveolar bone in the moving direction. The highest HU reduction was at the coronal level. CONCLUSIONS: HU reduction occurs on the root surface in the direction perpendicular to tooth movement and in the alveolar bone in the direction of tooth movement when a canine is retracted...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, numeric {{methods have}} been widely used to {{calculate}} the stress/strain in the PDL, and FEM has been the choice of orthodontic researchers frequently. Some previous literatures [6, 7] confirmed the limitations on the finite element (FE) results due to the complexity of shape and composition of the periodontal tissue. Many attempts on the relationship between the force system and tooth movement have been made as well as the reaction of the surrounding tissues have been made; however, it is still an open question. Cattaneo et al. [8] simulated the pure translation of the tooth with an M/F ratio of 10 and 12 respectively for premolar and canine. Athicha et al. [9] suggested that bodily movement of incisor happened when the ratio is 11.65 at zero inclination. Zhipeng Liao et al. [10] proposed that an M/F ratio of approximately 10.2, 9.7, and 8.8 can generate the bodily movements of maxilla canine, incisor, and first premolar. Cai et al. [11] attempted to find appropriate M/F ratio for translation and <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping</b> movement. However, they neglected the influence of a bracket and the direction of external force on the M/F ratio. In quantitative analysis, the influences can help the orthodontist design ideal orthodontic force system for different patients.|$|E
30|$|By {{observing the}} tooth {{movement}} especially in Fig.  2 c, {{we can understand}} that bowing caused by elastic deflection of the archwire was another reason for lingual tipping of the incisors. This tipping occurred under a condition where a moment was applied from the archwire to the incisor, and therefore, {{it was a kind}} of <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping.</b> The tipping angle of the incisor was greater than the maximum rotation angle Δθ in each archwire size. The difference between both angles is due to the elastic deflection of the archwire, which increases by decreasing the archwire size. In Fig.  2, the tipping angle due to the elastic deflection becomes 4.1 ° (=[*] 6.4 – 2.3 °), 6.9 ° (=[*] 16.7 – 9.8 °), and 7.6 ° (=[*] 25.6 – 18.0 °) when decreasing the archwire size. Elastic deflection of the archwire affected individual teeth differently. In the central incisor, an elastic deflection caused lingual tipping, and it was added to that produced by the play. As a result, lingual tipping of the central incisor became remarkable. In the canine, crown distal tipping was caused by an elastic deflection of the archwire. In the molars, the influence of elastic deflection was small. In all kinds of tooth, tipping due to the elastic deflection can be prevented by using an inversely prebent archwire or torqueing (third-order bend) of archwire [13].|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} whether {{applying a}} well-defined initial three-dimensional (3 D) load can create consistently expected tooth movement in patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients who needed bilateral canine retraction to close extraction space {{were selected for}} this split-mouth clinical trial. After initial alignment and leveling, two canines in each patient {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either translation (TR) or <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping</b> (CT) load. The load was delivered by segmental T-loops designed to give specific initial moment/force ratios to the canines in each treatment interval (TI), verified with an orthodontic force tester. Maxillary dental casts were made before canine retraction and after each TI. The casts were digitized with a 3 D laser scanner. The digital models were superimposed on the palatal rugae region. The 3 D canine displacements and the displacement patterns in terms of TR, CT, and torque were calculated for each TI. RESULTS: The method can reliably detect a TR displacement greater than 0. 3 mm and a rotation greater than 1. 5 °. Ninety-two TIs had displacements that were greater than 0. 3 mm and were used for further analysis. Most displacements were oriented within ± 45 ° from the distal direction. The displacement pattern in terms of TR or CT was not uniquely controlled by the initial moment/force ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The initial load system is not the only key factor controlling tooth movement.

30|$|Consequently, {{responsible}} authorities particularly municipalities and landfill operators nationwide are facing difficulty {{in dealing with}} staggering amount of MSW to dispose it in a sustainable way. In addition, the selection for ideal and feasible method in controlling the disposal of high quantities of MSW at economical costs that can avoid environmental damages are difficult to be decided due to various deliberations {{need to be made}} (Umar et al. 2010). Conventionally, landfilling of solid waste has been the most preferred method for solid waste disposal due to technical feasibility, ease of operation, minimum supervisions and low operation expenditure. In most countries, landfilling is the most acceptable means for eliminating MSW which favors to the technology exploitation and capital cost (Renou et al. 2008).While most of the landfills nowadays equipped with a level three sanitary systems, many developing countries are still struggling to equip state of the art facilities at the landfill. For example, there are 261 landfills in Malaysia whereby more than 80  % of them are being <b>controlled</b> <b>tipping</b> or open dumping practice. This {{is due to the fact}} that it obscures lower cost of operation and maintenance compared to the other established techniques (incineration and advanced landfill system) (Halim et al. 2010 a). Unfortunately, this practice has caused excessive generation of leachate whereby if it is not treated and safely disposed, landfill leachate could be a potential source of surface and ground water contamination, as it may percolate through soils and subsoils, causing pollution to receiving waters (Aziz et al. 2011).|$|E

The comparison was carried out from data collected at Melbourne, Florida {{during the month of}} July 98. GV operational level 3 (L 3 monthly) accumulation algorithm was used to obtain surface volumetric accumulations for the radar. The gauge records were accumulated using the 1 minute interpolated rain rates while the radar Volume Scan (VOS) intervals remain {{less than or equal to}} 75 minutes. The correlation coefficient for the radar and gauge totals for the monthly time-scale remain at 0. 93, however, a large difference was noted between the gauge and radar derived rain accumulation when the radar data interval is either 9 minute, or 10 minute. This difference in radar and gauge accumulation is being explained in terms of the radar scan strategy information. The discrepancy in terms of the Volume Coverage Pattern (VCP) of the NEXRAD is being reported where VCP mode is ascertained using the radar tilt angle information. Hourly radar and gauge accumulations have been computed using the present operational L 3 method supplemented with a threshold period of +/- 5 minutes (based on a sensitivity analysis). These radar and gauge accumulations are subsequently improved using a radar hourly scan weighting factor (taking ratio of the radar scan frequency within a time bin to the 7436 total radar scans for the month).

In order to minimize the influence of the nonlinear components of this friction, the control scheme is composed of two nested loops: an inner loop that controls the motor position, and an outer loop that <b>controls</b> the <b>tip</b> position. It is demonstrated that proper design of the inner loop of this control scheme eliminates the effects of friction in <b>controlling</b> the <b>tip</b> position, and may significantly simplify the design of the tip position controller. Three control schemes are proposed for the outer loop. All of them are based on an hybrid feedforward-feedback control scheme. The first and second schemes use only tip position feedback while the third one uses sensing of positions at several points of the beam.
