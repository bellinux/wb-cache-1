40|$|Managing {{strategic}} {{change is}} a challenge, especially in the large multinational companies that dominate the business arena of today. Utilizing and leveraging the middle management {{can be an effective}} way to facilitate strategy implementation and thus manage strategic change initiatives. This study investigates the role of middle <b>managers</b> as <b>change</b> agents in strategic change and seeks to investigate their role in the strategic change process. In addition, the aspects potentially hindering {{and on the other hand}} facilitating the work of these change agents is also explored in this study. This research is as a case study on a network of change agents at Nokia Corporation. Thus, the context of this study is a network of change agents – the Nokia Change Management Network within the Operations-function. The individuals of this network, called <b>change</b> <b>managers,</b> are industry specialists working partly with change management within their organizational units, in which they are responsible for making change happen. The role of these change agents was reflected on strategic management literature, especially from a strategy practice perspective, and also on the research conducted on the middle manager role in strategizing. The empirical part of this study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with 18 of these <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> in the research context. The strategic role of the <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> was in accordance with the roles mapped out in the strategic management literature: they synthesize information from various sides of the organization and raise topics upwards in the organization. They also promote, communicate and implement change downward towards the operational levels of the organization. In addition to these tasks, <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> must personally understand the change and assist others in strategic sensemaking. The challenges <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> experienced were related to time and resource pressure, the interconnections between strategy and change and the virtual working environment. On the other hand, the Change Management Network was seen as a significant facilitator for <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> in their work with change. Additionally, the proactive and reflexive way <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> evaluated their own work was found to be a substantial change facilitator. Therefore, utilizing middle <b>managers</b> in strategic <b>change</b> implementation provides these change agents a broad variety of challenging tasks, which can be facilitated by a network of practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Management texts {{have long}} been {{prescriptive}} regarding management practice, recommending managers do this, and managers do that, to ensure greater and greater effectiveness. Only a relatively minor proportion of management researchers have gone into the field to observe just what <b>managers</b> actually do. <b>Change</b> management literature tends to be prescriptive regarding how organisations should manage change, and why some leaders are better than others. There is a relative paucity of empirical information discussing what effective <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> actually do. This paper aims to present empirical data from a longitudinal change management research study to develop an enhanced understanding of what managers do during major organisational change. The first part provides a comprehensive overview of the main empirical studies of ‘what <b>change</b> do <b>managers</b> do’ over the last fifty years. The more salient among these are explored in greater depth, with their strengths and weaknesses examined. The second part assesses {{the applicability of the}} conceptualised categories using data from the research project, by comparing what <b>change</b> <b>managers</b> actually do against what is espoused in the literature. An analysis is provided which examines each activity performed by the managers, classifying these activities in terms of the change management roles identified in the literature, assessing the weight given to each role in terms of time and frequency.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore how different stakeholders perceive successful IT-enabled change.

The findings showed that a general view was that the IT-enabled change was perceived successful. The identified determinants were applied, however not formally and not before the final release of the BI system, in contrast to what the determinants suggest. Another finding was that, unlike previous studies, the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> and change recipients viewed the determinants similarly, while the IT-manager and <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> had different perspectives. Moreover, it was also found that the background of the change recipients influenced how they perceived the determinants.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} finding out {{about the nature of}} the relationship between the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> and the change project. An action learning approach to the investigation and analysis was adopted throughout in order to achieve a 'practitioner's perspective' in a range of inter-related learning environments. The research tracks the progress of six change managers. To attempt to minimise the variables, six smaller organisations (i. e. those employing fewer than 250 employees) from the manufacturing and production sector were recruited; all were based within a 20 mile radius; and all were attempting to change to meet the key indicators of a national performance standard from a similar starting point. Please see Table 1 below for further details. From the work with the change managers and the action learning set, all of whom acted as co-researchers during the analysis phase, some conclusions were drawn. The most significant being that the relationship between the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> and the change project could be described as being essentially symbiotic in its nature, insofar as the change project impacted directly and indirectly upon the <b>change</b> <b>manager,</b> and the change manager's direct and indirect actions influenced the degree of success of the change project. From the conclusions drawn, and as might be considered to befit an action learning approach to research, a practical solution was proposed for achieving more successful organisational change outcomes - a framework to enable the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> to develop, within the context of the demands of the change project. The framework was not intended to be a constant, but rather a guide for action.

40|$|This thesis {{sought to}} go beyond the {{mainstream}} of academic research to uncover a perspective different to what Reason (2006, p 188) termed the “dominant quantitative hypothetic-deductive research” approach in order to add real value to the professional practice of change managers in the 21 st century. As a <b>change</b> <b>manager,</b> the researcher realised that a quantitative research approach, while producing useful data, would not offer the depth and insight she considered was necessary to provide a significant contribution to professional practice, as is expected from a thesis of this type. Paradoxically given her scientific background, this caused her to adopt the challenging qualitative research strategy of an immersed practitioner in a modified action research methodology. Through this research she paralleled her action as a <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> with her research into the process and impact of change on herself as a <b>change</b> <b>manager.</b> Consistent with Reason’s (2006) view of action research, she started with what concerned her in practice by presenting the issues from real life experience. The journey commences from the uncommon ontology (at least in business circles) of the researcher’s background as a Quantum Physicist. This enabled her to apply a perspective that viewed change and ambiguity as states to be ‘lived with’ rather than ‘managed’. The self reflective process resulted in the researcher moving progressively from a quantitative scientific approach to {{what appeared to be a}} diametrically opposed interpretivist approach. While the researcher recognises the difficulty of seeking to generalise from a single self-reflective journey, the thesis is presented as a narrative describing her journey through three case studies of change as a means to enable the reader to vicariously experience what Dyer and Wilkins (1991, p 634), describe as: “the relationships and ideas which emerge and (to) understand and remember the complexity longer than if they had been presented as a formal construct in statistical table format”. From this narrative the researcher presents a tentative conclusion that her experience may not be unique and indeed that any change practitioner needs to adopt the mantel of a change leader rather than a <b>change</b> <b>manager.</b> The flexibility that comes with leading change by accepting ambiguity rather than trying to manage it as if it were a linear process enables adaption to changing situations. If this conclusion can indeed be generalised it suggests that change leaders need to, first, understand that there is more than one ontology (or paradigm) from which any change process may start. Second, and arising from the first, whichever ontology one starts from, it will create its own epistemology (or knowing). Thus leaders of change need to be able to recognise the ontology from which they commence and the limitations that poses, understand that others will start from a different ontology and that this will present challenges, and finally be prepared to develop ontological flexibility to deal with these challenges. They should therefore be prepared for their own ontology to change during the change process...|$|E
40|$|Organizational Change Cynicism – When {{the waves}} of change are rapidly {{succeeding}} each other … In today’s business life change seems to be inevitable. Change is partly driven by technological progress and partly it {{is the result of}} a rapid evolution of management techniques most companies’ decision makers feel obliged to follow to some extend or other. This study sets out to investigate the effect on employees of such (fashion?) waves of new management techniques. Based on results from e. g. (Connell & Waring 2002) and (Brown & Cregan 2008) it can be assumed that employees will develop a cynical attitude to such changes, and corresponding behaviour (also referred to as BOHICA – Bend Over, Here It Comes Again) if they will be considered as “yet another management technique” or if the implementation of the change fails to include the employees in the change efforts. By investigating an organization that has first introduced Coaching in a large scale change effort, and then subsequently chose to focus next on Performance Management, it is the aim to determine how a prospective <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> can limit the change cynicism that would potentially arise as a result of such consecutive alterations in management techniques – or from the implementation of changes in general. The study is performed by interviewing both the leaders of the latter change in the organization, and experienced middle managers who have been involved in both the implementation of Coaching and in the successive implementation of Performance Management. It is being investigated if the seemingly quite different nature of these techniques does indeed increase the level of change cynicism in the organization or if such a relationship cannot be found. The investigation is performed as a series of qualitative interviews with the managers. The questions asked are both related to the experiences with the latest implementation and lessons learned from this. The recommendations from these affected managers with respect to impeding such change cynicism are also extracted. The results from the interviews are evaluated in a reference interview with a middle manager from an organization in a different political and business context. A surprising finding from the interviews is that Coaching and Performance Management are in no way felt to be contradictory, nor that it is a problem to implement and use these techniques in parallel. This is attributed to the skilled translation of these concepts, when applied in the actual organizational context. Nevertheless the study eventually leads to the following points to be considered by a prospective <b>change</b> <b>manager,</b> when asked to manage the implementation of the “next” change: 1. 	Limit the number of change initiatives that are implemented in the organization in parallel. If too many initiatives are run in parallel, the “cynical” employees will make the selection/prioritization for you, per se; by ignoring such initiatives that they believe will fail anyway. The <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> should ensure that such a prioritization has indeed been performed 2. 	For the change initiatives that are prioritized it is imperative that they are fully implemented, and not abandoned half way through the implementation. Failed implementations are almost guaranteed to lead to increased change cynicism 3. 	It is important to adapt the change implementation to the characteristics of the change. If the change involves detailed prescriptions of how it must be applied, it will require a much more controlled implementation, including precise communication to all involved. While other types of changes may allow for a less controlled diffusion, with the option of some adaptation and translation in the process An innovative model is presented that can assist the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> in assessing the characteristics of a proposed change initiative with the objective of determining the best implementation strategy, labelling of the change and the needed effort in implementation of the change. The new model can also be used by the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> to ensure that the necessary effort is realized by the senior management requesting the change, and thus also provides an opportunity to refuse to accept the responsibility for the change effort, should these prerequisites not be fulfilled. The report is concluded with suggestions for further research and an article aimed at presenting the results of the study to a broader audience of project managers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the role of an {{emergent}} arts practice in the transformation of professional subjectivity for the organisational <b>change</b> <b>manager.</b> Beginning with the conventional literature of organisational change management, the researcher then turned to arts-based methods and feminist body theory in order to understand her own experience of confronting a crisis of confidence in mainstream management theory and practice. Through an auto-ethnographic investigation using fabric work and journal writing, the research focused on attending to the change manager’s body in art practice and organisational life. It documents the experience of not knowing entered through the process of fabric assemblage making and the struggle to articulate words in the liminal space of personal transformation and movement towards the production of new subjectivities and new knowledge. The study found that using creative processes of fabric object making enabled the conflicted body of the professional practitioner in crisis to emerge initially into abstract representation and ultimately to bridge the difficult transition into words. This transition represented an onto-epistemological transformation in which new knowledge came into being simultaneously with new forms of subjectivity. The research draws attention to the lived experience of change managers in organisations in confronting the deeper impacts of their work, and the need for an awareness of approaches to change work that take the body of the <b>change</b> <b>manager</b> into account. Through an exploration of the transformative power of sustained immersion in the language of the body, the study contributes to questions of enabling new subjectivities for the professional practitioner more generally...|$|E
