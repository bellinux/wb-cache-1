25|$|During the 1938 racing season Meier, rode a BMW RS 255 Kompressor in both European and German Championships. For the 1938 Isle of Man TT, Meier {{was entered}} by the BMW team along with Jock West and Karl Gall. The BMW team {{suffered}} setbacks when Karl Gall {{was injured in}} a crash during an unofficial practice, {{was found in a}} ditch above the Gooseneck, and was unable to race. On the startline for the 1938 Senior TT Race, one of the BMW mechanics stripped a <b>cylinder-head</b> thread during a spark plug change on the engine of Meier's Type 255 machine. Trying to start the 1938 Senior race on one cylinder, Meier soon retired on lap one at the bottom of Bray Hill. The race was won Harold Daniell riding for Norton at an average race speed of 89.11mph and Jock West riding the works supercharged BMW finished in 5th place at an average race speed of 85.92mph. In 1938, Meier {{went on to win the}} 500cc Belgium Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, the 500cc Dutch TT, the German Grand Prix at the Hohenstein-Ernstthal (or Sachsenring) road course and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The 500cc 1938 Ulster Grand Prix was won by BMW teammate Jock West and Meier became the 1938 500cc European Motor-Cycle Champion.|$|E
60|$|But if {{they was}} joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; {{for it was}} like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the Sawyer family--than ever {{happened}} to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a <b>cylinder-head</b> at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because THEY didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's lucky; because {{sometimes}} people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas {{was coming up}} from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a <b>cylinder-head</b> and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he DID die. Mortification set in, {{and they had to}} amputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was mortification--that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn't you?--oldish man, with a--" ...|$|E
5000|$|The 1927 DeLuxe {{featured}} machined {{and polished}} [...] "Ricardo" [...] <b>cylinder-heads</b> and developed 35 hp at 3,800 rpm. The clutch was strengthened with two extra plates. There {{was a new}} tank top instrument cluster, featuring speedometer, ammeter, oil pressure gauge and a headlight switch. There were new valve spring covers and an updated Zenith carburetor.|$|R
60|$|By and by he rather doubtfully {{opened the}} {{throttle}} to its widest. If the boiler primed again, he might knock out the <b>cylinder-heads,</b> {{but there was}} a steep pitch in front that was difficult to climb. The short locomotive rocked and hammered, the wheels skidded and gripped again, and Dick took his hand from the lever to dash the sweat from his eyes.|$|R
50|$|The Maya had a {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{with wooden}} stringers and Wobex mat covering. The cabin stood above the rear fuselage line, enclosing side-by-side seats with a third, occasional seat, or luggage space, behind. In front a 75 kW (100 hp) Lycoming flat four engine, with <b>cylinder-heads</b> exposed, drove a two blade propeller. It had a conventional undercarriage, with each mainwheel mounted on V-struts and half axles hinged to the fuselage central underside via rubber shock absorbers. The fixed tailwheel was steerable.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Aurelio Lampredi, the Fiat SOHC engine first {{appeared}} in the front-wheel drive (FWD) Fiat 128 of 1969. The in-line four-cylinder engine comprised an iron block with an aluminium <b>cylinder-head</b> containing a single over-head camshaft operating directly on both the inlet and exhaust valves in a reverse-flow <b>cylinder-head</b> configuration. The camshaft was driven by a belt rather than chain. The engine remained in production until the mid 1990s and grew in capacity over the years from 1100 cc (in the Fiat 128) to an eventual 1600 cc (in the Fiat Tipo/Tempra). The Fiat 130 2866 cc V6 engine, also appearing in 1969, although having cross flow <b>cylinder-head,</b> {{is directly related to the}} 128 SOHC engine, but with a 1.20 upscale in bore and stroke.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the inline-five is the narrow-angle V5 (such as the Volkswagen V5 engine) which has a single <b>cylinder-head</b> and cylinder-block, and which is very compact.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{motorcycles}} such as Harley-Davidsons, Moto Guzzis and BMWs become identifiable {{by their}} <b>cylinder-head</b> types, namely airhead, panhead, oilhead, and even knucklehead. [...] The Ducati desmos head enables higher rpm {{to be achieved}} without detrimental valve float.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was planned}} {{to power the}} RG.40 with a [...] AVA 4A-02, an air-cooled, flat four, two stroke engine, mounted in the nose with <b>cylinder-heads</b> {{projecting}} for cooling, but the earliest flights were made with a smaller bore version, the [...] AVA 4A-00. The Week-End's rectangular cross-section fuselage had a wooden structure and was ply covered. The forward view from the cabin was through a long, one-piece transparency and the only sideways obstructions were the two pairs of vertical members that joined fuselage and wing. Cabin entry was via two large doors.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "Oilhead" [...] {{is a name}} to {{describe}} BMW flat-twin motorcycle engines with partial oil-cooling, and to distinguish these engines from the earlier air-cooled [...] "Airhead" [...] models. [...] The Oilhead's finned cylinders have conventional air-cooling, but the four-valve <b>cylinder-heads</b> are oil-cooled. Unlike earlier BMW boxers which had a single camshaft in the crankcase (variously above or below the crankshaft), the Oilhead has a camshaft in each head. (It is still technically an ohv engine rather than a true sohc unit, as the camshaft bears onto very short pushrods which operate valve rockers). In 2013, BMW introduced water-cooling to its boxer range. The engine is still used in just one line of motorcycles the BMW R nineT.|$|R
50|$|It was {{powered by}} a , {{eighteen}} cylinder Salmson 18 Cm. This {{was one of the}} last, and the most powerful, of Salmson's water-cooled radial engines, with two in-line rows of nine cylinders. It was enclosed in a rounded cowling with caps over the <b>cylinder-heads.</b> Fuel was held in the wing centre-section and two Lamblin radiators were mounted on the undercarriage legs. Behind the engine the fuselage was rectangular in section, defined by light-metal, U-section longerons and cross-frames. The open cockpit was at the wing leading edge, with small side-windows for a better view downwards. Behind the cockpit the cabin seated six passengers, each with their own window. Entry was via a port-side door and there was a disposable emergency ceiling hatch to allow passengers to escape by parachute.|$|R
50|$|The CX was {{the first}} V-twin {{motorcycle}} that Honda ever built. It was initially designed as a 90 Â° V-twin. Honda built a prototype CX350 {{but it was never}} released to the public. In that version the cylinder heads did not have the <b>cylinder-head</b> twist.|$|E
50|$|In {{the code}} of the engine, the first two {{initials}} indicate engine class, the two numbers indicate engine displacement (in decilitres), the last two initials indicate <b>cylinder-head</b> style and induction type (D=DOHC, S=carburetor, E=injection). In {{the case of a}} single-initial suffix, the initial indicates induction type.|$|E
50|$|The 1976 to 1977 2300 engine {{received}} a new <b>cylinder-head</b> design, incorporating hydraulic lifters {{to replace the}} taper-screw valve adjusters, improved coolant pathways, longer-life valve-stem seals, a redesigned water pump and thermostat, and a five-year, 60000 mi engine warranty. The engine's name was changed to Dura-Built 140.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{made for}} the ladder, and Austin, who went with him, {{carrying}} the book, was drenched before he reached the skipper's room. The air was filled with falling water that came down in rods, and blotted out the mangroves a dozen yards away. Steam rose from the sluicing deck, the creek boiled beneath the deluge, {{but there was no}} longer any trace of the insufferable tension, and he stood a moment or two relaxing under the rush of lukewarm water that beat his thin clothing flat against his skin. Then he splashed forward to the forecastle, where Tom had little difficulty in rousing the men. They crawled out, gaunt and haggard, in filthy rags, some of them apparently scarcely fit to stand, for the rain had come, and every inch the water rose would bring them so much nearer home. There was no need to urge them when they floundered into the engine room, and hour after hour they strained and sweated on big spanner and chain-tackle willingly, while the big <b>cylinder-heads</b> and pistons were hauled up to the beams. The one thought which animated them was that the engines would be wanted soon.|$|R
40|$|In many {{sectors of}} the {{industry}} geometric inspection of complex parts is currently solved by conventional measuring procedures using Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM). This process is very time-consuming and expensive. In many cases a CMM can only be used with great disadvantages compared to non tactile technologies. Internal geometries of complex parts can only be digitised after the object is cut, which automatically leads to losses in the data and difficulties in post-processing, e. g. the alignment of different data-sets. Furthermore it results in a destroyed part, which is often not wanted, especially in the prototype-state of the product development chain. The huge number of parts, like engine-blocks, <b>cylinder-heads</b> which all have complex outer and inner geometry, and the increasing competition on the global market force the industry to find faster and chepaer methods to bring their products to the market. In the last few years, industry, in particular automotive industry and their suppliers, {{became more and more}} familiar with the computed tomography technology (CT). The problem which appeared, was to build-up new process-cahins or better, integrate this new technology into existing workflow. The paper will discuss a way to integrate CT for measurement and quality inspection in the existin process chain and show how it worked in industrial applications like flow investigations...|$|R
5000|$|Available {{only in the}} 1973 and 1974 Formula Firebird and Firebird Trans AM, the SD-455 {{consisted}} of a strengthened cylinder block that included 4-bolt main bearings and additional material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged crankshaft, although actual production SD455s received nodular-iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged-aluminum pistons were specified, as were unique high-flow <b>cylinder-heads.</b> A camshaft with 301/313 degrees of advertised duration, 0.407 inch net valve lift, and 76 degrees of valve overlap was specified for actual production engines {{in lieu of the}} significantly more aggressive RAM AIR IV style cam that had originally been planned for the engine (initially rated at [...] with that cam), but ultimately proved incapable of meeting the tightening emissions standards of the era. The very modest cam, combined with a low-compression ratio of 8.4 (advertised) and 7.9:1 actual resulted in 290 SAE NET HP. The initial press cars that were given to the various enthusiast magazines (e.g. HOT ROD and CAR AND DRIVER) were fitted with the RAM AIR IV style cam and functional hood scoops - a fact that has been confirmed by several Pontiac sources. Actual production test cars ran considerably slower and yielded 1/4 miles times in the 14.5 second/98 MPH range in showroom tune - results that are quite consistent for a car with a curb weight of 3,850 pounds and the rated 290 SAE NET HP figure that some sources suggest was [...] "under-rated." [...] Various Pontiac sources have emphatically stated that NO [...] versions of the SD455 were installed in regular production cars. 1975 Factory Service Manual lists the SD455, but the SD455 did not meet emissions for the 1975 model year and was canceled.|$|R
50|$|Cylinder {{heads were}} held on with three studs and barrels slipped over the pistons. No <b>Cylinder-head</b> gasket was used, {{and since the}} wings unbolted in a few minutes, it was {{possible}} to remove the cylinder heads and barrels, change the pistons or piston-rings and reassemble the top end very quickly, using only a few tools.|$|E
50|$|Cliff Reuter has {{documented}} {{the history of}} a Bandini 750 Siluro that he acquired from the estate of the late Clair Reuter. This car received its Devin body when the SCCA stopped allowing cycle-fendered cars to compete. These 750 Bandinis used either a modified Crosley CIBA SOHC engine or a more highly customized Bandini-Crosley with a Bandini DOHC <b>cylinder-head.</b>|$|E
50|$|In all, Alfa was {{operating}} ten petrochemical and synthetic fiber plants in 1995, seven steel plants and a service center, six refrigerated-food plants, two carpet and rug plants, two mattress plants, an aluminum <b>cylinder-head</b> plant, and two building supplies retail stores. It operated more than 70 distribution centers. Alfa {{was a party}} to 11 joint ventures with foreign companies.|$|E
50|$|The {{one-piece}} <b>cylinder-head</b> had {{the spark}} plugs sunk into it {{at an angle}} along the nearside. The make and break and the distributor were set almost vertically {{at the side of}} the block. Alongside was the coil with a spare mounted beside it. The generator on the offside shares a triple belt drive with the water pump and the radiator cooling fan.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 the X1/9 {{was chosen}} by Dallara to enter the World Championship for Makes in the Group 5 Special Production class. The Dallara Icsunonove (the Italian {{pronunciation}} of [...] "X1/9") featured a modified X1/9 engine with a custom 16-valve <b>cylinder-head</b> and fundamental suspension and body/monocoque alterations, the most obvious of which are the massively flared wheel-arches and the oversized rear wing.|$|E
5000|$|The B10 3.5 was {{the first}} Alpina based on the BMW E34, With {{production}} beginning in April 1988 at launch {{it was the only}} available B10. The 3.5-liter BMW M30 inline six cylinder engine of the BMW 535i was reworked with Mahle-pistons, a modified <b>cylinder-head,</b> and a new camshaft increasing power from [...] to [...] In 1992 production was stopped after 572 copies.|$|E
50|$|Designed by {{engineer}} Andrew Strand, {{a powerful}} 61 cubic inch (996cc) 45 degree V-Twin SOHC, 45 horsepower engine was the powerplant {{chosen for the}} Cyclone. The overhead cams were driven by a vertical shaft with beveled-gear ends, and the <b>cylinder-head</b> had a hemispherical head combustion chamber. The Cyclone was capable of at least 115 mph top speed. Joerns Motor Co. sold the original Cyclone for $350.00.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the Australian/New Zealand Tasman Series {{was created}} with a 2500cc {{capacity}} limit applied to engines. Jack Brabham approached Repco {{to develop a}} suitable engine, and together they decided to base the SOHC design on Oldsmobile Jetfire 215 ci block with six <b>cylinder-head</b> studs per cylinder. Combined with a short stroke flat-plane crankshaft, Repco designed cylinder heads, camshafts and two-stage chain/gear cam drive, a 2.5L engine was built in 1965 with its cylinder head cast by Commonwealth Aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The ClÃ©on-Alu engine, {{also known}} under the code [...] "A engine [...] " [...] or [...] "A-Type" [...] (A for aluminium) is an {{automotive}} internal combustion gasoline engine, developed and produced by Renault in 1960. A four-stroke inline four-cylinder design with aluminium-alloy block and <b>cylinder-head,</b> it was water cooled, with a five main-bearing crankshaft and a side-mounted chain-driven camshaft operating eight overhead valves via pushrods and rockers. It {{made its debut}} appearance on the Renault 16.|$|E
50|$|The Beare-head engine {{internal}} combustion engine technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with a ported cylinder head closely resembling that of a two-stroke engine. The head piston is smaller and moves at half {{the speed of the}} opposing piston. Functionally, the <b>cylinder-head</b> piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional four-stroke engine. This configuration {{has been described as a}} six-stroke engine based on adding together the four strokes per cycle of the bottom end and the two strokes of the cylinder head.|$|E
5000|$|Bodywork {{could be}} of an open or closed type and was {{required}} to provide adequate accommodation {{for a minimum of}} two persons. The original design of the cylinder-block, <b>cylinder-head,</b> transmission and suspension had to be retained and forced induction was permitted only if fitted as standard by the manufacturer. Minor changes to bodywork, mudguards and interior trim were permitted. A 5000cc engine capacity limit which was applied {{at the time of the}} introduction of the category [...] was latter raised to 6000cc.|$|E
50|$|The first models {{featured}} a 493cc (80x98mm) single ported <b>cylinder-head,</b> {{topped by a}} cast-aluminium enclosure for the rockers, with exposed valve springs. Alongside the cast barrel were plated tubes to cover the pushrods. Easy cam contours and wide bases on the tappets ensured no associated valve clack, meaning that the Sloper was regarded by many {{as one of the}} smoothest and quietest of sporting 500cc machines. The large crankcase accommodated both a large and heavy flywheel, and a separate oil feed tank controlled by a hand meter.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mercedes-Benz built a 3.5-litre M-291 flat-12 engine for {{endurance}} racing. This engine employed a clever <b>cylinder-head</b> design with exhaust ports where the intake ports {{would normally be}} (on top of the engine, pointing upwards). The intake ports are between the intake and exhaust camshafts, just above the spark-plugs, pointing at an outward angle from the vertical. Putting the exhaust system on top, rather than underneath, allowed the engine to ride much lower in the engine-bay of the C-291 (and later C-292).|$|E
50|$|For {{lightness}} and compactness; design optimization, material optimization, and component integration {{were identified}} as effective means of minimizing weight and bulk, so they were comprehensively effected in combination with each other. With regard to materials, the cylinder block is made of aluminum; the <b>cylinder-head</b> cover and intake manifold are made of plastic; the exhaust manifold has a pipe-based structure and cams driven by a timing chain. Component integration was applied {{in many areas of}} the engine. Notably, the functions of engine accessories were integrated into the cylinder block.|$|E
50|$|The valve rotates {{to provide}} the opening and closing {{necessary}} for intake and exhaust. It {{is attached to the}} engine, vertical to the cylinder block, via a shaft at its top; this allows the valve to rotate horizontally above the cylinder and when it turns. The valve is hollow, and has a large cut-out opening in one side. This alternately allows gases into the combustion chamber, and out to the exhaust system by lining up holes in the valve shaft with the <b>cylinder-head</b> ports which allows the gases to pass.|$|E
50|$|These were {{manifold}} {{and difficult}} for operators to resolve. The Panther Cub {{was a relatively}} underpowered chassis asked {{to do a job}} beyond its capabilities. Ten of the twenty Manchester examples had turbo-charged engines, the turbocharger fitment designed to give more torque at lower revolutions rather than more horsepower, but the turbocharged engines had more than their share of blown <b>cylinder-head</b> gaskets and was removed to improve reliability, so although the option was offered throughout the Panther Cub's short life, few but the Manchester buses had this version of the 0.400H engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Lago-SS {{shared the}} {{advanced}} <b>cylinder-head</b> {{technology of the}} Lago-SpÃ©cial, but it used a shortened 2650 mm wheel-base chassis. There was no [...] "standard body" [...] offered with this car which was produced by Talbot only in bare chassis form. Exotic coach-built bodies were provided by coach builders, most notably Figoni & Falaschi. Although fuel feed was [...] "normally" [...] provided using triple ZÃ©nith 32 carburetters, cars were also produced featuring larger diameter ZÃ©nith 35 carburetters, and thus equipped the car came with listed maximum power of [...]|$|E
50|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} {{from the engine}} are minimized by measures including optimal design of the combustion chambers, optimal control of the intake air motion {{by means of the}} <b>cylinder-head</b> ports, employment of the MIVEC system, employment of an ultra-thin cylinder head gasket, and employment of micro-droplet fuel injectors. The vehicle's overall exhaust emissions are further suppressed by location of the exhaust manifold {{at the rear of the}} engine. This layout is beneficial since it minimizes the heat capacity of the exhaust system upstream of the catalytic converter and thus, together with combustion control, promotes activation of the catalytic converter.|$|E
