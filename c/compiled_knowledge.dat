5000|$|Ottilie [...] "Tilly" [...] Edinger {{was born}} in Frankfurt, Germany in 1897. Her father Ludwig Edinger, himself a pioneer in {{comparative}} neurology, provided Tilly with invaluable exposure to his field and the scientific community at large. Tilly had many private tutors before attending Schiller-Schule, the only secondary school for girls in Frankfurt at that time. Tilly Edinger continued her schooling with university studies in zoology, geology, and paleontology. While preparing her doctoral dissertation, Edinger encountered a natural brain endocast of Nothosaurus, a marine reptile from the Mesozoic era. Edinger's first paper, published in 1921, centered {{on the characteristics of}} the Nothosaurus specimen. Prior to the publication of her work, inferences about the evolution of the vertebrate brain were made exclusively through comparative anatomy of extant fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal brains. Tilly Edinger's background in neurology and paleontology paved the way for her to integrate comparative anatomy and stratigraphic sequence, thus introducing the concept of time to neurology and creating the field of paleoneurobiology. The field was formally defined with the publication of Die fossilen Gehirne (Fossil Brains) in 1929 which <b>compiled</b> <b>knowledge</b> on the subject that had previously been scattered {{in a wide variety of}} journals and treated as isolated events.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{knowledge}} compilation is to enable fast queries. Such queries {{are often in}} the form of conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses, and the query amounts {{to the question of whether}} the clause is implied by the knowledge base.

The methods allow us to incrementally select the best pieces of evidence to add to the set of <b>compiled</b> <b>knowledge</b> in an engineering setting.

40|$|Plans {{which were}} {{constructed}} by human experts {{and have been}} repeatedly executed to the complete satisfaction of some customer in a complex real world domain contain very valuable planning knowledge. In order to make this <b>compiled</b> <b>knowledge</b> re-usable for novel situations, a specific integrated knowledge acquisition method has been developed: First, a domain theory is established from documentation materials or texts, which is then used {{as the foundation for}} explaining how the plan achieves the planning goal. Secondly, hierarchically structured problem class definitions are obtained from the practitioners 2 ̆ 7 highlevel problem conceptualizations. The descriptions of these problem classes also provide operationality criteria for the various levels in the hierarchy. A skeletal plan is then constructed for each problem class with an explanation-based learning procedure. These skeletal plans consist of a sequence of general plan elements, so that each plan element can be independently refined. The skeletal plan thus accounts for the interactions between the various concrete operations of the plan at a general level. The complexity of the planning problem is thereby factored in a domain-specific way and the <b>compiled</b> <b>knowledge</b> of sophisticated expert plans can be re-used in novel situations...|$|E

Although HEV replication is controlled by the host immune system, viral factors (especially specific viral genotypes and mutants) can modulate HEV replication, infection and pathogenesis.

40|$|Abstract. The reduced {{implicate}} trie, {{introduced in}} [11], is a data structure {{that may be}} used as a target language for knowledge compilation. It has the property that, even when large, it guarantees fast response to queries. Specifically, a query can be processed in time linear {{in the size of the}} query regardless of the size of the <b>compiled</b> <b>knowledge</b> base. The knowledge compilation paradigm typically assumes that the “intractable part” of the processing be done once, during compilation. This assumption could render updating the knowledge base infeasible if recompilation is required. The ability to install updates without recompilation may therefore considerably widen applicability. In this paper, several update operations not requiring recompilation are developed. These include disjunction, substitution of truth constants, conjunction with unit clauses, reordering of variables, and conjunction with clauses. ...|$|E
