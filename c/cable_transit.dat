25|$|The {{result is}} a {{frequency}} compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10megohms shunted by 12pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, {{it does not work}} when the time scale shrinks to several <b>cable</b> <b>transit</b> times (transit time is typically 5ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and there will be reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing. The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.|$|E

Multiple cable transits are being used as a standard decoupling measure between the zones. Cables shields are connected in the cable transits with the objective to shortcircuit cable sheath currents to the wall. Measurements have been performed to check the quality of the installation. The test procedure and some measurement results are described.

40|$|In {{ground-based}} extensive {{air shower}} experiments, {{the direction and}} energy are reconstructed by measuring the relative arrival time of secondary particles, and the energy they deposit. The measurement precision of the arrival time is crucial for determination of the angular resolution. For this purpose, we need to obtain a precise relative time offset for each detector, and to apply the calibration process. The time offset {{is associated with the}} photomultiplier tube, cable, relevant electronic circuits, etc. In view of the transit time through long cables being heavily dependent on the ambient temperature, a real-time calibration method for the <b>cable</b> <b>transit</b> time is investigated in this paper. Even with a poor-resolution time-to-digital converter, this method can achieve high precision. This has been successfully demonstrated with the Front-End-Electronic board used in the Daya Bay neutrino experiment...|$|E

50|$|Metrocable is a gondola {{lift system}} {{implemented}} by the City Council of Medellín, Colombia, {{with the purpose of}} providing a complementary transportation service to that of Medellín's Metro. It was designed to reach some of the city's informal settlements on the steep hills that mark its topography. It is largely considered to be the first urban <b>cable</b> propelled <b>transit</b> system in South America. There were plans in the city for some decades before its inception for some form of transportation that took account of the difficult topography of the region. These ideas date back to the use of cable-car technology for exporting coffee starting in the 1930s between the city of Manizales, to the south of Medellin, and the river Cauca 2,000 metres below. In its modern incarnation, it {{was the result of a}} joint effort between the city's elected mayor and the Metro Company. For some, the initial conception of this system was indirectly inspired by the Caracas Aerial Tramway (also known as the Mount Avila Gondola) which was designed primarily to carry passengers to a luxury hotel.|$|R

These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours. Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.|$|R

40|$|A {{cable crane}} {{collision}} accident usually causes serious damage to workers, equipment and materials. Owing {{to the emergence}} of global position system (GPS), some new collision avoidance and guidance systems have been developed and applied in many large-scale civil engineering projects. However, {{it is very difficult to}} find an optimal GPS-guidance transit route with safety and efficiency based on experience among complex three-dimensional working situations. Our objective is to make use of the artificial immune algorithm to optimize the GPS-guidance <b>transit</b> route for <b>cable</b> crane collision avoidance under two different working situations. A comprehensive evaluation function that merges the consideration of reliability, convenience and cost with respect to the GPS-guidance transit route has been established to assess the <b>cable</b> crane <b>transit</b> route. We used the engineering case of the Dagangshan hydropower station to test our algorithm. The results suggest that the artificial immune algorithm can effectively and stably determine the optimal route under a complex environment. The analysis of optimization performance indicates that the proposed optimization approach fully considers comprehensive performance. It reveals that the collision risk changes with the elevation of the cable crane within a three-dimensional space. These findings allow us to reasonably make use of the GPS-guidance function to achieve cable crane collision avoidance more efficiently.
