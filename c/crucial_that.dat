5|$|Blancornelas {{covered the}} rise of Mexico's drug {{trafficking}} organizations for more than thirty years, but his best {{work in the field}} took place during the 1990s. During this period, Mexico experienced {{the rise of}} three powerful drug cartels: the Tijuana Cartel in the west; the Juárez Cartel in Ciudad Juárez; and the Gulf Cartel in the east. Blancornelas' stories are considered so <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> almost every written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, it is <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the court should not merely rely on international law to determine {{the meaning of the}} liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{after the}} Malayan Union had been {{replaced}} by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance.

25|$|The Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa {{also offers}} a co-op option for some of their {{programs}} including: accounting, commerce, e-business, finance, management, marketing, and few other interconnected programs.

The entry requirements for graduate students are {{a little different from}} those for undergraduate co-operative education programs.

In an interview that promoted her fifth Japanese studio album Ultra Blue (2005) and her single [...] "Passion", which is the follow to [...] "Hikari", Utada felt the writing process was difficult. She believed that the plot to Kingdom Hearts was soulless, and was unable to become inspired by it to write the song.

500|$|At this point, Charles called another {{council of}} war {{to discuss the}} situation. It was {{resolved}} that it was <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> Gloucester was still to be taken; if it was left in Parliamentarian hands, it would act as a break in lines of communication should the Royalists advance further east towards London. In addition, Charles's personal reputation had been sullied – travelling so far and yet not taking Gloucester would impact on the respect and prestige accorded to him, about which he was [...] "notoriously sensitive". Based on reconnaissance, Charles's officers were confident that the garrison's food and ammunition would not last long; they argued that the city could be taken in less than 10 days, with Parliament lacking an effective army to relieve the city. If Essex's forces did not attack, the Royalists would take the city. If they did attack, they would be exhausted and, according to Royalist intelligence, far weaker than the Oxford army, allowing Charles to destroy Parliament's one remaining significant force.|$|E

2500|$|Depending {{on how it}} is defined, APD may {{share common}} {{symptoms}} with ADD/ADHD, specific language impairment, Asperger syndrome {{and other forms of}} autism. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism. Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: [...] "We regard it as <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research." [...] In practice, this seems rare.|$|E
2500|$|Any finite {{space is}} trivially compact. A non-trivial {{example of a}} compact space is the (closed) unit {{interval}} [...] of real numbers. [...] If one chooses {{an infinite number of}} distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some accumulation point in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence [...] get arbitrarily close to0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to1. [...] The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the interval be bounded, since in the interval [...] one could choose the sequence of points , of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2008, Greenspan {{wrote an}} article for the Financial Times Economists' Forum {{in which he said}} that the 2008-financial crisis in the United States is likely to be judged as the most {{wrenching}} since the end of World WarII. In it he argued: [...] "We {{will never be able to}} anticipate all discontinuities in financial markets." [...] He concluded: [...] "It is important, indeed <b>crucial,</b> <b>that</b> any reforms in, and adjustments to, the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure: market flexibility and open competition." [...] The article attracted a number of critical responses from forum contributors, who, finding causation between Greenspan's policies and the discontinuities in financial markets that followed, criticized Greenspan mainly for what many believed to be his unbalanced and immovable ideological suppositions about global capitalism and free competitive markets. Notable critics included J.Bradford DeLong, Paul Krugman, Alice Rivlin, Michael Hudson, and Willem Buiter.|$|E
