Two main interlocking stalks are shown, their branches extending almost at right angles from the stalk. Small, thistle-like blossoms can be seen. A neutral background is visible behind.; "History: 'Brodiaea' was named for James J. Brodie, a Scotch botanist. 'Douglasii' indicates that the species designation of the plant was named for David Douglas. Description: The Wild Hyacinth has blue, tubular-shaped flowers in a cluster at the top called an umbel. There are 5 to 15 flowers in the umbel with each flower about 1 inch long.

40|$|Eucomis autumnalis is an {{attractive}} ornamental species from the South Africa, commonly used in natural medicine. Plant protection programs, particularly those concerning plants grown for phytotherapeutics, are focused on prophylactic treatments that facilitate a limited use of pesticides negatively affecting the environment. Polysaccharides, such as chitosan and sodium alginate are exemplary non-toxic and biodegradable substances used for hydrogel coatings. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of treating E. autumnalis bulbs with fungicide or coating with natural polysaccharides on the morphological traits and content of minerals in the leaves and bulbs.

5000|$|Metal halide lights {{have also}} been used for retrofitting. Virtually all {{fixtures}} that are converted to metal halide have previously been lit with high-pressure sodium (HPS). Examples of retrofitted fixtures for metal halide use include the Thomas & Betts Model 25 and Model 327, as well as full-cutoff versions of GE's M400. MH lamps suffer color shift as they age though this has been improving. Actual life expectancy is about 10,000 to 12,000 hours on average. There {{has also been a}} noted issue with the lamps [...] "exploding/shattering" [...] during a failure. Metal Halide light bulbs also tend to dim and/or flicker {{at the end of their}} life cycles, and on occasion, cycle. Sometimes, they emit a pinkish glow at or near the end of their life cycle which in this case, the bulb just burns out. High cost and low life hours has kept them from becoming popular municipal lighting sources even though they have a much improved CRI around 85. Therefore, the use of metal halide is limited mainly to city and high end street lighting. They are available in clear or <b>coated</b> <b>bulbs.</b> Probe start MH lights (which are less efficient and are also soon to be banned, unlike Mercury Vapor lamps) come in wattages of 50, 70, 100, 175, 250, 400, and 1000 watt sizes, while pulse start MH lights come in sizes of 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 320, 350, 400, 450, 750, and 1,000 watt sizes.

2500|$|Most {{light bulbs}} have either clear or coated glass. The <b>coated</b> glass <b>bulbs</b> have a white powdery {{substance}} {{on the inside}} called kaolin. Kaolin, or kaolinite, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on {{the interior of the}} bulb. It diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for [...] "party bulbs", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by coloring the glass with a dopant; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green). Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.|$|R
40|$|Typical CCD {{digital imaging}} sensors are {{insensitive}} to ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{by virtue of}} the very shallow (2 nm) penetration depth in silicon. This warrants the use of a post-packaging coating to up-covert the UV radiation to longer wavelengths. In this thesis, A light-converting inorganic coating has been developed to improve the responsivity of gated CCD image sensors in the UV (from 250 - 400 nm). The coating consists of a plastic acrylic layer doped with inorganic phosphors. The coating is deposited using a spin-coater typically used by the IC fabrication industry. Inorganic phosphors were selected over organic phosphors since they are quite well established and are typically used to <b>coat</b> light <b>bulbs,</b> an application that requires a long lifetime. In contrast, organic phosphors rapidly degrade upon exposure to UV radiation. The parameters associated with the coating and coated sensor are presented here. They include coating conversion effciency, penetration depth, photostability; and coated sensor quantum effciency, contrast transfer function and photo-response non-uniformity. The coatings presented here are a viable, cost-effective alternative to other UV response CCD designs...|$|R

50|$|The fringes only {{appear in}} the {{reflection}} of the light source, so the optical flat must be viewed from the exact angle of incidence that the light shines upon it. If viewed from a zero degree angle (from directly above), the light must also be at a zero degree angle. As the viewing angle changes, the lighting angle must also change. The light must be positioned so that its reflection can be seen covering the entire surface. Also, the angular size of the light source needs to be many times greater than the eye. For example, if an incandescent light is used, the fringes may only show up in {{the reflection of the}} filament.

40|$|During {{photometric}} measurements involving {{the use of}} photometric lamps {{it is necessary that}} the filament of lamp takes a strictly predetermined position with respect to the photodetector and the optical axis of the photometric setup. The errors in positioning of alignment filament with respect to the optical axis of the measuring system lead to increase the uncertainty of measurement of the photometric characteristics of the light sources. A typical method for alignment of filament of photometric lamps is based on the use a diopter tubes (telescopes). Using this method, the mounting of filament to the required position is carried out by successive approximations, which requires special concentration and a lot of time.

Many trap designs are employed for this purpose and it is therefore important {{to know how they}} differ in their sampling of the flying insect fauna. Here we compare three Robinson-type trap designs, each of which employs a 125 W mercury vapour bulb. The first uses a standard bulb; the second uses the same bulb {{with the addition of a}} Pyrex beaker, often deployed to prevent bulbs from cracking in the rain, and the third uses a <b>bulb</b> <b>coated</b> with a substance that absorbs visible wavelengths of light (also known as a black light). The black light trap caught fewer moths than either of the other traps, and had lower macromoth species richness and diversity than the standard + beaker trap. This lower species richness could be accounted for by the smaller number of moths caught by the black light trap. Furthermore the black light caught a different composition of both species and families to the other two trap types. Electromagnetic spectra of the three trap types showed the black light trap lacked peaks in the visible spectrum present in both of the other traps. We therefore conclude that the addition of a beaker to a Robinson-type trap does not make catches incomparable, but use of a black light does. These differences are probably due to lower total emission of radiation in the black light trap, thus catching fewer moths overall, and the lack of visible radiation produced, meaning that moths most sensitive to visible wavelengths are not attracted...|$|R
