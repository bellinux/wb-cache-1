40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{summarize}} our entire surgical experience {{in the treatment of}} tachyarrhythmias in children. We emphasize our application of a newer <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> system for use in both the electrophysiology laboratory and the operating room to localize points of activation of the tachyarrhythmias. Background. A retrospective review was undertaken to examine the results of operative procedures in 290 children undergoing surgical treatment for tachyarrhythmias from 1977 to the present. Methods. Operative procedures were performed in 290 children and consisted of the following: surgical ablation of accessory pathways of the Kent bundle type (210 children); surgery with cryoablation for atrial ectopic tachycardia (35 children); surgical excision or cryoablation, or both, for ventricular tachycardia (26 children); cryoablation for the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia (15 children) and atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia (4 children). Results. The surgical cure rate for accessory pathway tachycardia in the era before <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> was 80 % (41 patients) in the period from 1977 to 1982 and 95 % (86 patients) in the period from 1982 to 1988. This rate improved to 100 % (83 patients) after the advent of the <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> technique. These improved results are probably due to a combination of factors, including increasing experience in electrophysiologic mapping and surgery, and cannot be attributed to the <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> system alone. Surgical cure or major improvement in symptoms was documented in 33 (94 %) of 35 patents with atrial ectopic tachycardia. Surgical cure was accomplished in 25 (96 %) of 26 patients with the complex form of ventricular tachycardia, In 19 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia and the more typical AV node reentrant tachycardia, the surgical cure rate was 100 %. Conclusions. In all forms of supraventricular reentrant tachycardia that occur in children, preoperative <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques combined with intraoperative <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> and surgical ablation can eliminate tachycardia at a success rate of close to 100 %. Computerised mapping techniques are less accurate in patients with atrial ectopic tachycardia because of multiple foci and a broader surface area to be mapped. This experience demonstrates that excellent results can be achieved in the surgical treatment of tachyarrhythmias in children...|$|R

BACKGROUNDMapping VT in the electrophysiology laboratory conventionally is achieved by sequentially positioning an electrode catheter at multiple endocardial sites. METHODSFifteen patients with VT underwent 18 electrophysiology procedures using the noncontact, <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> system. A 9 F 64 electrode balloon catheter and a conventional 7 F electrode catheter for mapping and ablation were positioned in the LV using a retrograde aortic approach. Using a boundary element inverse solution, 3, 360 virtual endocardial electrograms were computed and used to derive isopotential maps. An incorporated locator system was used in conjunction with or instead of fluoroscopy to position the conventional electrode catheter. RESULTSA total of 21 VTs, 12 of which were hemodynamically-tolerated and 9 of which were not, were mapped. Isolated diastolic potentials, presystolic areas, zones of slow conduction and exit sites during VT were identified using virtual electrograms and isopotential maps. Among 19 targeted VTs, radiofrequency ablation guided by the <b>computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> system and the locator signal was successful in 15.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: i) {{analysis}} of clinical severity evolution in multiple sclerosis patients; ii) identification of temporal indicators for clinical worsening. We investigated by echo-color-Doppler (ECD) 789 patients (490 female plus 299 male), aged 45. 4 years, with chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) and multiple sclerosis (MS). All patients tested positive for CCSVI by ECD assessment were divided into three groups, namely: type 1 CCSVI (371) presenting an endo-vascular obstacle to the venous drainage; type 2 CCSVI (40) presenting an extra-vascular obstacle to the venous drainage, for external compression of the vessel; type 3 CCSVI (315) presenting both venous endo-vascular and extra-vascular obstructed drains. We analyzed the morphological and hemodynamic data recorded on <b>computerized</b> <b>map</b> (MEM-net). All data were collected by respecting the Italian Privacy Laws and they {{are available on the}} National Epidemiological Observatory on CCSVI website (www. osservatorioccsvi. org). We focused in the three main parameters in all studied patients. First parameter was expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score; second parameter was illness duration; third parameter was CCSVI type. The MS duration values stratified by EDSS grouped values in CCSVItype- 1 and CCSVI-type- 3 patients shows that the differences were statistical significant by Kruskal-Wallis test: H= 44. 2829; degree of freedom= 1 for CCSVI-type- 1 (P< 0. 001); and H= 37. 3036; degree of freedom= 1 for CCSVItype- 3 (P< 0. 001). The present study confirmed and completed scientific literature about relation between CCSVI and MS.

40|$|Abstract: Computer mapping is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} technique that can assist police departments {{in a variety}} of ways. Computer mapping techniques can be classified into three general categories: descriptive, analytical and interactive mapping. Descriptive mapping shows data in a pin map or shaded area format. Analytical mapping starts with analysis of data followed by automatically displaying the results on a map. such as the identification and display of crime "hot spots " in a city. Interactive mapping allows a user to cycle through a series of steps starting with making queries against a database, mapping the results, making a decision from the maps and starting anew with another query. This chapter provides examples of each type, with emphasis on how computer mapping can assist police operations. The final sections discuss the steps necessary to establish a computer mapping system, and what we can expect in the future. <b>Computerized</b> <b>mapping</b> is a rapidly developing technology that assists police departments in strategic planning, operations and crime analysis.
