When processing a handwritten script, a great deal of ambiguity occurs when strokes overlap, merge, or intersect.

We show excellent results on various loop resolution scenarios, including axial loop understanding and <b>collapsed</b> <b>loop</b> recovery. We demonstrate our approach for loop investigation on several realistic data sets of static binary images and compare with the ground truth of the genuine online signal.

40|$|International audienceLoop {{collapsing}} is {{a well-known}} loop transformation which combines some loops that are perfectly nested into one single loop. It allows {{to take advantage of}} the whole amount of parallelism exhibited by the <b>collapsed</b> <b>loops,</b> and provides a perfect load balancing of iterations among the parallel threads. However, in the current implementations of this loop optimization, as the ones of the OpenMP language, automatic <b>loop</b> <b>collapsing</b> is limited to loops with constant loop bounds that define rectangular iteration spaces, although load imbalance is a particularly crucial issue with non-rectangular loops. The OpenMP language addresses load balance mostly through dynamic runtime scheduling of the parallel threads. Nevertheless, this runtime schedule introduces some unavoidable execution-time overhead, while preventing to exploit the entire parallelism of all the parallel loops. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically collapse any perfectly nested loops defining non-rectangular iteration spaces, whose bounds are linear functions of the loop iterators. Such spaces may be triangular, tetrahedral, trapezoidal, rhomboidal or parallelepiped. Our solution is based on original mathematical results addressing the inversion of a multi-variate polynomial that defines a ranking of the integer points contained in a convex polyhedron. We show on a set of non-rectangular loop nests that our technique allows to generate parallel OpenMP codes that outperform the original parallel loop nests, parallelized either by using options " static " or " dynamic " of the OpenMP-schedule clause...|$|R

The YAFTA feature tracking algorithm {{is applied to}} GONG++ one-minute magnetograms for 77 X-class and M-class flares to analyze the evolution and interaction of the magnetic features and to estimate the amount of canceled magnetic flux. We find that significantly more magnetic flux decreases than increases occurred during the flares, consistent with a model of <b>collapsing</b> <b>loop</b> structure for flares. Correlations between both total (unsigned) and net (signed) flux changes and the GOES peak X-ray flux are dominated by X-class flares at limb locations. The flux changes were accompanied in most cases by significant cancellation, most of which occurred during the flares. We find that the field strength and complexity near the polarity inversion line are approximately equally important in the flux cancellation processes that accompany the flares. We do not find a correlation between the flux cancellation events and the stepwise changes in the magnetic flux in the region. Comment: Published in Solar Physic...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Small bowel {{obstruction}} (SBO) {{is common}} in adult surgical procedures, mainly due to postoperative adhesions. Acute SBO in adults without history of abdominal surgery, trauma or clinical hernia is less common and has various etiologies. Congenital band is an extremely rare cause. Presentation of case: A 56 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a two-day history of abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. He had no history of abdominal surgery or any other medical problems. A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen showed a distention of small bowel loops with transition point in the right hypochondrium. Distended loops of small bowel were located in {{the left side of}} the abdomen, whereas <b>collapsed</b> <b>loops</b> was located in the right side. The normal bowel wall enhancement was preserved. After initial treatment with intravenous fluid and nasogastric suction, he was operated. At laparoscopy a band obstructing the ileum was clearly observed. This anomalous band extending from gallbladder to transverse mesocolon caused a small window leading to internal herniation of the small bowel and obstruction. The band was coagulated and divided. Postoperative outcome was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. There was no recurrence of symptoms on subsequent follow-up. Discussion: Congenital peritoneal bands are not frequently encountered in surgical practice and these bands are often difficult to classify and define. Diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction due to CPB must be included in the differential diagnosis in any patient with no history of abdominal surgery, trauma, clinical hernia, inflammatory bowel disease or peritoneal tuberculosis. Conclusion: Despite technological advances in radiology preoperative diagnosis remains difficult, however the diagnosis of SBO due to CPB must be considered in any patient with no history of abdominal surgery, Trauma or clinical hernia consulting for occlusive syndrome.
