Bahá'ís in Ho Chi Minh City were allowed to hold a quiet ceremony in May 2004 to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Baha'i Faith in the country. By 2006, Bahá'í community leaders reported having [...] "good relations with authorities", and that the Bahá'ís [...] "appeared to be able to practice their faith without significant harassment." [...] In November of that year, the US State Department reported that restrictions were being eased. Finally, after many years of progress, the Bahá'í community was officially registered in early 2007, receiving a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> operation from the governmental Committee for Religious Affairs. Following a year-long probationary period, its nine-member National Spiritual Assembly was elected and its charter adopted on 21 March 2008, at a national congress in Ho Chi Minh City coinciding with the Bahá'í holy day of Naw-Rúz. The event was attended by over 250 delegates and visitors. The National Spiritual Assembly received its <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>national</b> recognition in July 2008, setting the stage for Local Spiritual Assemblies to be registered as well.|$|R

Until the Technical Regulations replace the GOST Standards, the latter continue to play a part in the certification process on the Russian territory. It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC), but generally this method is used in voluntary certification.|$|R

40|$|A major {{dilemma for}} music {{teachers}} in Sweden {{is that the}} educational system since 15 years dictates that local adaptations should be made, since all students shall be assessed equivalently. In this study I have examined what strategies music teachers have in the grading process, and specifically how they do to grade equivalently. Previous research shows that Swedish music teachers have difficulties {{when it comes to}} make use of regulatory documents. Working conditions for Swedish music teachers also often differ from other teacher groups (e. g. it is usually only one music teacher at a school) and therefore, and {{because of the fact that}} the area is largely unexplored, new knowledge and understanding is needed. The thesis consists of two parts: A web survey (quantitative and qualitative parts) and core questions in the survey (on how to grade equivalently in music). I emanate in my reasoning from a music teacher’s awareness but with an open approach. With socioculture influences and a critical approach I question the prevailing circum- stances. With the qualitative approach, I aim to get close to the material and identify music teachers' strategies for assessment in accordance with the requirements <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>equivalence.</b> More than 600 music teachers contributed to the survey, representing around 50 % of all final grades that are written each year in Swedish compulsory school music. The outcomes show that during the last decade an ongoing professionalization has taken place among music teachers. The findings also include knowledge about how impor- tant note taking is for equivalence and the problems music teachers have with physi- cal conditions for the teaching (such as group sizes and instrumentation). Also the gut felling, as a cultural tool, is observed in a particular way in the assessment work. Last, the picture of “music teachers as their own curriculum” is suggested to be revised. Since music teachers need to adjust to local conditions, and now have a greater knowledge and experience in the mechanism of grading equivalently, it is suggested that music teachers are forced to be their own curriculum...|$|R
