40|$|The {{purpose of}} work was the {{assessment}} of influence of a palliative resection of a liver with application of cryodestruction and without cryodestruction application on the remote results of treatment of the patients who have been repeatedly operated for alveococcosis. The analysis of surgical treatment of 14 patients operated repeatedly for alveococcosis of a liver is carried out. Patients were operated in the complicated stage of a disease {{in the presence of}} germination of a parasite in caval and/or portal gate of organ. Primary interventions were various – a diagnostic laparotomy, a cytoreduction and a marsupialization of a parasite, a liver resection. All patient at repetition intervention executed palliative resections of a liver. Resections were carried out by a clinic technique with imposing the ginglymoid of ligatures on remaining tissue of a liver at distance of 2 – 3 cm from the deleted parasitic knot taking into account a segmentary structure of organ. At all patients on "dangerous zones" (a zones of gate of a liver, a hepatoduodenal ligament) plates of parasitic fabric of various sizes from 1  2 cm to 2  4 cm were left. At 10 patients they were exposed to cryodestruction. The exposition in one point made from 1 to 2 minutes at a temperature – 196 С. Postoperatively, patients received a dose of 10 mg/kg albendazole. Development of hepatic insufficiency after palliative resections of a liver is noted in one case. Lethal outcomes weren't. All patients for convenience of the analysis were divided into two groups: group of patients without application of <b>cryotechnologies</b> (n = 4) and group of the patients operated with application of cryodestruction (n = 10). Efficiency of palliative resections estimated on a median of survival of patients. Calculation of survival carried out Kaplan–Meier's method. The survival median in groups made 12 and 17 years respectively. When comparing survival of patients by Gehan's test with Yates's correction distinction of survival in two selections are statistically significant (z = 2, 94; p < 0, 005). Among patients repeatedly operated for alveococcosis when involving in parasitic process of gate of a liver, lack of possibility of prosthetics of vascular structures and developments of a compensatory hypertrophy of not struck departments of body the palliative resection allows to achieve survival of 50 % of patients more than 16, 8 years. Cryodestruction is the effective and safe method, allowing to increase survival of patients after a p alliative resection of a liver, through the destruction left {{in the area of the}} liver gate parasitic tissue sections. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. Cryobiopsy {{is used to}} biopsy {{peripheral}} lung lesions through flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance. However, fluoroscopy is {{not available}} at some institutions. This study evaluated the feasibility of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchoscopic cryobiopsy without fluoroscopy. Methods. This retrospective study was conducted at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch, in Taiwan. This study enrolled patients who received bronchoscopy examinations with <b>cryotechnology</b> between July 2014 and June 2016. The data were collected through medical chart review. Results. During the study period, 101 patients underwent bronchoscopy examinations with <b>cryotechnology.</b> Ninety patients with endobronchial tumors were excluded from this study. Eleven patients who underwent radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchoscopic cryobiopsy for lung parenchymal lesions were enrolled into this study. The mean age was 61. 1 [*]±[*] 13. 8 years. Five patients were men, and the other six were women. The number of cryobiopsies ranged from 1 to 3. In the histological biopsies, the mean specimen diameter was 0. 53 [*]±[*] 0. 23 [*]cm, and the mean biopsy area was 0. 20 [*]±[*] 0. 19 [*]cm 2. Nine of 11 patients had pathological diagnoses. No complications, including pneumothorax, respiratory failure, or major bleeding, were recorded after the procedure. Conclusions. Endobronchial ultrasound is used to ensure biopsy location, and endobronchial ultrasound-guided cryobiopsy is a feasible technique to biopsy peripheral lung lesions in selected cases at institutions without fluoroscopy equipment. This study provided some rationale for further studies examining the impact of fluoroscopy...|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} one option for {{patients}} with localized prostate cancer. Despite advances in delivering radiation to the prostate gland with therapies such as brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation therapy, urologists will be faced with managing patients with rising prostate-specific antigen values and with positive biopsy results secondary to radiation-recurrent prostate cancer. If the cancer is detected early, salvage therapy can be initiated. Since salvage prostatectomy is associated with significant morbidity, patients are often left with the option of either watchful waiting or temporary palliation with hormone deprivation therapy, with its attendant toxicity. The introduction of third-generation <b>cryotechnology</b> using 17 -gauge CryoNeedles™ (Oncura, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) and the recent modifications in the technique of salvage cryosurgery have enabled cryosurgeons to eradicate these tumors safely and with significantly decreased morbidity.

40|$|The {{potential}} role of {{embryo cryopreservation}} {{from the point}} of view of prevention of multiple pregnancies is analysed. Cryopreservation is an unavoidable option in stimulated IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), but at the same time an underestimated tool in the prevention of twins. There is a need for an evaluation system not only of the <b>cryotechnology</b> process per se, but also of the true augmenting effect of cryopreservation on the total reproductive potential of a single oocyte harvest. Only cryopregnancies occurring after an unsuccessful fresh cycle (possibly followed by one or more unsuccessful freeze-thaw cycles with embryos from the same harvest) truly reflect the augmentation potential of cryopreservation. This potential is greater than generally thought. First, the efficacy of cryopreservation is suboptimal with survival rates between 30 and 70 %. Second, if single-embryo transfer were applied in a much larger proportion of cycles than is presently the case, more embryos would be available for cryopreservation, resulting in more and more successful freeze-thaw cycles. In the future, the combination of elective single-embryo transfer with an optimized cryopreservation programme is likely to become the standard of care for routine IVF/ICSI treatment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{storage of}} {{reproductive}} cells and tissues in cryobanks {{and their use}} in reproductive medicine and biotechnology have become an indispensable part of modern science and clinical service. However, current methods have severe limitations, in particular resulting in sub-optimal maintenance of viability after freezing-thawing of gametes. The improvement of gamete cryopreservation systems is therefore of great importance for genetic resource banking, agriculture and human reproduction. So far, advances have been made largely via empirical rather than analytical approaches. When an analytical biophysical approach had been applied, severe discrepancies {{between theory and practice}} often have been revealed. A basic understanding of the cellular processes which accompany gamete cryopreservation is therefore necessary for successful development of the relevant technology. In particular, the concepts of biological variability between cell types, species and individuals, as well as of heterogeneity between cells of the same type must be considered. This review focuses essentially on the fundamental physical and chemical principles of gamete cryobiology and cryoinjury, {{as well as on the}} biological properties of gametes in different species that are mainly responsible for the heterogeneous outcome and poor rates of improvement in their <b>cryotechnology...</b>|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of linear echoendoscopes, {{endoscopic}} ultrasound (EUS) has become more operative and a new field of oncological application has been opened up. From tumor staging to tissue acquisition under EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration, new operative procedures have been developed {{on the principle of}} the EUS-guided puncture. A hybrid probe combining radiofrequency with <b>cryotechnology</b> is now available, to be passed through the operative channel of the echoendoscope into the tumor to create an area of ablation. EUS-guided fine-needle injection is emerging as a method to deliver anti-tumoral agents inside the tumor. Ethanol lavage, with or without paclitaxel, has been proposed for the treatment of cystic tumors in non-resectable cases and complete resolution has been recorded in up to 70 %- 80 %. Many other chemical or biological agents have been investigated for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: activated allogenic lymphocyte culture (Cytoimplant), a replication-deficient adenovirus vector carrying the tumor necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1; gene, or an oncolytic attenuated adenovirus (ONYX- 015). The potential advantage of treatment under EUS control is the real-time imaging guidance into a deep target like the pancreas which is extremely difficult to reach by a percutaneous approach. To date there are no randomized controlled trials to confirm the real clinical benefits of these treatments compared to standard therapy so it seems wise to reserve them only for experimental protocols approved by ethics committees...|$|E
40|$|The only {{widely used}} and {{accepted}} method for long-term cell preservation is storage below - 130 °C. The biosciences will make {{increasing use of}} preservation and place new demands on it. Currently, cells are frozen in volumes greater than 1 ml but the new cell and implantation therapies (particularly those using stem cells) will require accurately defined freezing and storage conditions for each single cell. Broadly-based, routine freezing of biological samples allows the advantage of retrospective analysis {{and the possibility of}} saving genetic rights. For such applications, one billion is a modest estimation for the number of samples. Current cryotechniques cannot handle so many samples in an efficient and economic way, and the need for new <b>cryotechnology</b> is evident. The interdisciplinary approach presented here should lead to a new sample storage and operating strategy that fulfils the needs mentioned above. Fundamental principles of this new kind of smart sample storage are: (i) miniaturisation; (ii) modularisation; (iii) information/sample integration, i. e. freezing memory chips with samples; and (iv) physical and logical access to samples and information without thawing the samples. In contrast to current sample systems, the prototyped family of intelligent cryosubstrates allows the recovery of single wells (parts) of the substrate without thawing the rest of the sample. The development of intelligent cryosubstrates is linked to developments in high throughput freezing, high packing density storage and minimisation of cytotoxic protective agents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of our developments {{in the fields of}} <b>cryotechnology</b> and cryoelectronics for managing biological samples stored over liquid nitrogen, fields that are essential to a central cryostorage facility for AIDS related material used in worldwide collaborative research. As a fundamental part of this project we have developed new electronic cryovials and carrier plates attached to Flash memory chips, so that a redundant and portable set of data is present with each sample. The recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after cryopreservation in the new cryosubstrates showed, especially for small sample volumes (0. 1 ml), an increased viability in comparison to the preservation in standard cryovials. The electronic cryosubstrates interface with a dedicated laboratory workflow management system for reproducible and standardized sample processing. This system can read standard operating procedures (SOPs) stored on each sample's memory chip. Finally, we have developed a polymorphic cryoelectronic infrastructure for sample storage tanks. This cryoelectronic system has been integrated in a hermetic storage and semiautomatic handling environment. The new technologies provide state-of-the-art sample identification, documentation and tracking that brings added value to each sample. The first application of these technologies is in a worldwide collaborative research towards the production of an AIDS vaccine. The functionality and versatility of the technologies will lead to an essential optimization of sample and data exchange for global clinical studies by ensuring a high degree of standardization between laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the possible effects of cryotop vitrification on maturation rate and ultrastructural morphology of human in vitro matured germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. Study design: A total of 301 surplus immature GV oocytes obtained from infertile patients were allocated into two groups: (i) GV oocytes (n = 150) matured in vitro (fIVM), and (ii) GV oocytes (n = 151) that were first vitrified, then matured in vitro (vIVM). Supernumerary fresh in vivo matured oocytes (n = 10) {{were used as}} controls. The maturation media was Ham's F 10 supplemented with FSH + LH and human follicular fluid. After 36 h of incubation, the oocytes were investigated for nuclear maturation and ultrastructural changes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Oocyte maturation rates were reduced (P < 0. 001) in vIVM (45. 92 %) in comparison with fIVM oocytes (75. 33 %). The rate of degeneration was also significantly higher in vIVM than in the fIVM group (44. 4 % vs. 6. 0 %). Large and numerous mitochondria and minute vesicles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) complexes (MV complexes) were observed in both fIVM and vIVM groups. In addition, TEM revealed a drastic reduction in amount of cortical granules (CGs) at the cortex of vitrified-warmed GV oocytes, as well as appearance of vacuoles and small mitochondria-SER aggregates in the ooplasm. Conclusion: The vitrification procedure is associated with ultrastructural alterations in specific oocyte microdomains, presumably related to the reduced competence of cryopreserved oocytes for maturation.

Silk materials will be able to combine 5000 -year-old, traditional techniques of agriculture with modern biotechnology and material design in a truly unique way. Tables shows selected silk producing species the name of their silk if commercially available and their diet and grade of domestication as well as tensile properties of selected man-made and natural fibres. It will be reviewed here first, starting with the structure and properties of the material mulberry silk and nephila dragline silk, followed by its production and finally its processing and applications as biomaterial. The potential and attraction of recombinant (regenerated) silks is undisputable. It is of course difficult to judge the potential of such a young field of technology. However, considenng that regenerated, recombinant and natural silks can be used in cell culture applications and that the US cell culture market alone was USD 714. 5 million in 2005, an economic impact of some hundreds of millions should be expected. Other fields also stand to benefit from the outstanding mechanical properties found in silks. From highperformance textiles, impact protection foils and composite materials to rope safety-cores, nanotechnology and even <b>cryotechnology</b> - the potential for silk materials has yet to be realised. One thing is certain: the success of future silk materials will depend firmly on the development of practical fibre formation and re-formation processes...|$|E
