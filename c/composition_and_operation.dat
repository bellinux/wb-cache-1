40|$|Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde {{has been}} seen as the nineteenth century {{prototype}} of the workings of the criminal mind. Similarly, current psychoanalytic readings of the novel suggest that it serves as a precursor to Freud’s theories on the structural model of personality, and repression and that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can provide insight into the psychology of addiction, multiple personality disorder and borderline personality disorders, as these terms have currency in the discipline of modern psychology. Indeed, Stevenson’s novel can even be seen as a precursor to the very genre of Freud’s “case” study. In fact, current readings of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde continue to focus on its case study aspects, claiming that the novel shows “the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of the criminal mind” (Thomas qtd in Rosner, Spring 29). “Much Ado About Handwriting: Countersigning with the Other Hand in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is concerned with making a Gothic case “the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of the criminal mind,” but not because the word “composition” denotes a mental constitution that merely pre-exists the text or that the text refers to or represents a substantive criminal mind; instead the word suggests that there exists a displaced link between writing, reading, interpretation, and criminality as the shadowy “place” where the “other” begins and collusion enters the scene. Taking as a premise Jacques Derrida’s contention that “it is the ear of the other that signs,” this paper is concerned with “composition,” signatures and encryption as a way of exploring how these texts pose insoluble psychic double binds regarding the determination of criminality...|$|E

40|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} local government reform in many Commonwealth countries has been a heavy reliance on structural reform, often {{in the form of}} forced local council amalgamation. This paper argues that the long-run success of structural change in local government hinges on several key factors, not least that voluntary rather than compulsory council mergers have a far greater chance of success. A second key ingredient resides in a high degree of local autonomy in both the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of decentralized governmental functions. A third vital factor lies in ensuring that revenue and tax assignment is sufficient to provide local government with financial autonomy. Finally, adequate powers of taxation need to be accorded to local government and this requires careful consideration of the types of taxes most suited to local government...|$|E

This {{is based on}} the concept of sustainable development with context, structures and strategies as factors affecting poverty reduction. Quantitative and qualitative research designs were used.

Results reveal CDGs as a potential strategy in effective community development benefiting group members for poverty reduction. Such benefits include; social, economic, physical, human or environmental. However, group <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> processes pose challenges for benefits to trickle down to some members.

The composition of the committee {{and the structure of}} the meeting can affect the quality of the decision making. In this paper we review economic, experimental, sociological and psychological studies to identify criteria for the optimal institutional setting of a monetary committee. These include the optimal size of the committee, measures to encourage independent thinking, a relatively informal structure of the meeting, and abilities to identify and evaluate individual members' performances. Using these criteria, we evaluate the <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of monetary policy committees in various central banks. Our findings indicate that e. g. the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England follows committee best-practice, while the committee structure of other major central banks could be improved.

40|$|Various carbon nanofibers (CNFs) {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by catalytic decomposition of methane over Ni−Al 2 O 3 and Ni−Cu−Al 2 O 3 catalysts at 500 − 700 °C. On {{the basis of}} the physical and chemical characterization of these CNFs, their electrochemical reactivities are evaluated in a novel direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC). It is found that the microstructures and electrochemical reactivities of CNFs are highly dependent on the decomposition temperature, catalyst <b>composition</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> times in the DCFC. Decreasing decomposition temperature and introducing Cu into Ni−Al 2 O 3 catalyst can produce electrochemically reactive CNFs, due to their enlarged surface area and decreased degrees of graphitic structure.
