40|$|One single <b>compact</b> <b>rack</b> includes: Direct Digital Synthesizer (RF-generator), turn-on and {{protection}} devices. The system synthesizes a highly stable RF signal up to 120 MHz, turns the power {{on in the}} RF cavities through a step-ramp modulator, and protects the RF system against mismatching, sparks and multipactoring. A first prototype has been designed, assembled and tested on the RF system of the k- 800 superconducting cyclotron at Infn-Lns. The hardware, the software, and the preliminary test results, are shown in this paper. This solution {{is part of the}} new computer-based RF control systemIMP;Chinese Academy of Science...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{stand-alone}} board explicitly {{designed to}} active {{noise and vibration}} control and for damage detection, is presented. The system is based on ADSP- 21060 SHARK and for flexibility the hardware is divided in two parts: the main processor board, containing the A/D and D/A converters, able to work as stand-alone or in a multiprocessor system being configurable without any hardware change; the I/O interface boards. All the boards are accommodated in a <b>compact</b> <b>rack.</b> The authors have developed all the software tools needed for application in the active noise control or damage detection framework. The software parameters may be changed by the user via a user friendly interface from a host PC connected to the system via a RS 232 port. The system has been extensively testes in different applications with encouraging results, work in progress {{are related to the}} use of the platform to implement M. I. M. O. ANC systems...|$|E
50|$|The Juniper Networks JCS1200 Control System is the industryâ€™s first purpose-built, {{control plane}} scaling platform, {{providing}} high-power processing with a multi-CPU, multi-core server-class computing environment. With scalable memory and storage media, JCS1200 provides up to 12 routing engines in a <b>compact</b> one-quarter <b>rack</b> chassis.|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{criticality}} {{safety and}} sensitivity calculations of {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) spent nuclear fuel repository facilities for the Slovenian nuclear power plant Krsko are presented. The MCNP 4 C code was deployed to model and assess the neutron multiplication parameters of pool-based storage and dry transport containers under various loading patterns and moderating conditions. To comply with standard safety requirements, fresh 4. 25 % enriched nuclear fuel was assumed. The impact of potential optimum moderation due to water steam or foam formation {{as well as of}} different interpretations, of neutron multiplication through varying the system boundary conditions was elaborated. The simulations indicate {{that in the case of}} <b>compact</b> (all <b>rack</b> locations filled with fresh fuel) single or "double tiering" loading, the supercriticality can occur under the conditions of enhanced neutron moderation, due to accidentally reduced density of cooling water. Under standard operational conditions the effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) of pool-based storage facility remains below the specified safety limit of 0. 95. The nuclear safety requirements are fulfilled even when the fuel elements are arranged at a minimal distance, which can be initiated, for example, by an earthquake. The dry container in its recommended loading scheme with 26 fuel elements represents a safe alternative for the repository, of fresh fuel. Even in the case of complete water flooding, the keff remains below the specified safety level of 0. 98. The criticality safety limit may however be exceeded with larger amounts of loaded fuel assemblies (i. e., 32). Additional Monte Carlo criticality safety analyses are scheduled to consider the "burnup credit" of PWR spent nuclear fuel, based on the ongoing calculation of typical burnup activities...|$|R
