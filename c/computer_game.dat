40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the differences of attitudes of students, who played the educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> developed for this research, towards both mathematics course and educational <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> For this reason, researchers developed two educational <b>computer</b> <b>games,</b> Proportional Tetris and Proportional Clown, which are about ratio and proportion topic in mathematics education. Researchers used a survey including a demographic data form and two likert-like scales about both mathematics course and educational <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> Educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> and the survey were applied to 176 students in two primary schools in Balikesir, Turkey. Whether educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> affected the students’ attitudes towards both mathematics course and educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> was tested with Paired Samples t test. Whether there is a meaningful relationship between students’ attitudes towards mathematics course and students’ attitudes towards educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> was tested with Pearson Correlation test. As a result, students’ attitudes towards both mathematics course and educational <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> became positive.

40|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>games</b> have {{attracted}} much attention over the years, mostly attention of the less flattering kind. This has been true for <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> focused on entertainment, but also for what for years seemed a sure winner, edutainment. This dissertation aims to be a modest contribution to understanding educational use of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> by building a framework that goes beyond edutainment. A framework {{that goes beyond the}} limitations of edutainment, not relying on a narrow perception of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> in education. The first part of the dissertation outlines the background for building an inclusive and solid framework for educational use of <b>computer</b> <b>games.</b> Such a foundation includes a variety of quite different perspectives for example educational media and non-electronic games. It is concluded that educational use of <b>computer</b> <b>games</b> remains strongly influenced by educational media leading to the domination of edutainment.

5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987.

The board was sturdier than the previous edition's paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the <b>computer</b> <b>game</b> bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a <b>computer</b> <b>game.</b> Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
