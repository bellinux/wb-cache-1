5|$|The {{reign of}} Leopold II saw {{the rise of}} {{organized}} socialist political groups and parties, most notably among the industrial workers in Wallonia. The early socialist movement was characterized by a successful <b>co-operative</b> <b>movement</b> in Flanders. Trade unions were legalized in 1866, opening the way to organized labor politics. The International Workingmen's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism, under figures such as César De Paepe, expanded dramatically.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural co-operatives in Japan {{are known}} as Nokyo across the world. Their <b>co-operative</b> <b>movements</b> are rather unique because they have three major features: comprehensiveness, full coverage, and {{territorial}} possessiveness. In this paper, we attempt to discuss the structure, the conduct {{and the performance of}} the agricultural co-operative sector in order to get economic implications of their movements. We also discuss major changes that have occurred in the nature of multi-purpose <b>co-operative</b> <b>movements</b> since 1970, specifically in the areas of organization, business, and management, using the survey for SMAC conducted annually by MAFF. The main conclusion is that they are now standing at the crossroads, where they can either become co-operative firms with a close relationship to commercial enterprises, or remain as classical co-operative societies, and there is a rapid increase in the heterogeneity of their members, which is very painful for <b>co-operative</b> <b>movements.</b> The multi-purpose agricultural co-operatives, as they focus on the needs of part-time farmers, become rural co-operatives rather than agricultural co-operatives. As a result, vital farmers are leaving the co-operatives. 日本の農業協同組合ば“農協”として世界的に有名である。その協同組合運動は総合性，網羅性，属地性という 3 つ の特徴を持つことできわめてユニークである。本稿では，その協同組合運動の経済的意味を引き出すために農協セク ターの構造，行動，成果について議論した。また総合農協統計表（農水省）を使って， 1970 年以降の総合農協運動の 主要な変質を組織，事業，経営の領域にわたって議論した。主要な結論は 2 つあり，一つは民間企業と非常に近い性 質を持つ協同組合企業に変質するか，あるいは古典的な協同組合として踏みとどまるかという重大な岐路に現在農協 が立たされているということであり，もう一つは協同組合運動にとって苦渋に満ちたものであるが，組合員の異質性 が急速に進行しているということである。兼業農家のニーズに焦点を当てれば当てるはど，総合農協は農業者の協同 組合ではなく農村の協同組合として発展していくであろう。しかし，その結末は活力あふれる農民たちが協同組合か ら去っていくことである...|$|R

25|$|Within {{two weeks}} of {{starting}} work at the Union, Green sat down with other high-profile members of the <b>co-operative</b> <b>movement</b> and drafted a letter to Tony Blair. The letter – signed by Green, Lord Graham of Edmonton, Graham Melmoth, and Len Fyfe – called on the Prime Minister to sponsor a commission to review the <b>co-operative</b> <b>movement</b> and determine its future development and modernisation. The letter arrived {{against a background of}} the impending merger of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) and Co-operative Retail Services to create the Co-operative Group, as well as recent efforts by entrepreneur Andrew Regan to demutualise the CWS. Blair responded favourably to the request, and pledged his support in setting up a Co-operative Commission.|$|E

25|$|The Commission {{was set up}} in {{response}} to the <b>co-operative</b> <b>movement</b> experiencing its first ever halt in its growth, caused by the massive changes in retailing following the end of rationing and the beginning of self-service. The <b>co-operative</b> <b>movement</b> still had a large presence in the retail market, with 30,000 shops, 250 factories and 967 retail societies paying dividends to their customer members of over £40m a year. However, these payments were often made at the expense of retained capital, and there was growing concern about the movements ability to fund its future development. There was also concern about the movement's market share, with 1957 seeing the co-operative share at 11.62% whilst the new supermarkets - luring customers away with competitive prices the movement's structure wouldn't allow it to match - had a 25% share.|$|E
