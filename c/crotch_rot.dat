500|$|While {{discussing}} the installment's origins, producer Glen Morgan {{said that he}} [...] "wanted an episode with more of a sexy edge". It proved difficult to portray sex as convincingly scary, which caused the producers to introduce the concept of [...] "people like the Amish who are from another planet". [...] "Gender Bender" [...] was penned by freelance writers Larry and Paul Barber, whose initial draft focused heavily on {{the contrast between the}} farming community of the Kindred and a version of city life [...] "with very sexual connotations", influenced by the works of Swiss artist H. R. Giger. This script went through various rewrites during the development process, including the removal of a scene where someone's <b>crotch</b> <b>rots</b> away, to address concerns about the content of the episode. The chants uttered by the Kindred were not in the script handed in by the Barbers; they were added later by producer Paul Rabwin.|$|R
