40|$|Excess and {{obsolete}} {{stocks of}} chemical warfare material (CWM) were sea disposed by the United States between 1919 and 1970. One-ton containers {{were used for}} bulk storage of CWM and were the largest containers sea disposed. Disposal depths ranged from 300 to 17, 000 feet. Based on a Type D <b>container</b> <b>assembly</b> drawing, three independent analyses (one corrosion and two structural) were performed on the containers to address the corrosion resistance from prolonged exposure to sea water and the structural response during the descent. Corrosion predictions were made using information about corrosion rates and the disposal environment. The structural analyses employed two different finite element codes and were used to predict the buckling and material response of the container during sea disposal.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reducing fuel-cycle {{costs for the}} N. S. SAVANNAH by replacing the stainless steel fuelelement containers in the permanent reactor core structure by similar containers of a zirconium alloy was investigated. These containers, although not integral parts of the fuel-bearing components, are located within the active core and divide the core into 32 separate channels into which the fuel elements are placed. Areas of investigation included reactor physics, fuel-cycle economics, materials compatibility, structural design, and reactor hazards. A summary of the method of analysis and results is given for each area ot investigation. Calculations indicated that the substitution of Zircaloy containers would increase core reactivity about 6 % DELTA k and control- rod worth about 4 % DELTA k. Fuel-cycle costs would be reduced about 26 %. Zircaloy- 4 appears to be compatible with the reactor system, except for some uncertainty with respect to fretting corrosion, which can be resolved only by tests. The substitution of cold-worked Zircaloy for stainless steel in the <b>container</b> <b>assembly</b> would necessitate only minor design modifications. Although this evaluation is strictly applicable only to the N. S.

40|$|The {{structural}} and functional {{requirements of the}} Plutonium Oxide/Metal Storage Containers are specified in the Report ``Complex 21 Plutonium Storage Facility Material Containment Team Technical Data Report`` [Complex 21, 1993]. There are no existing storage containers designed for long term storage of plutonium and current codes, standards or regulations do not adequately cover this case. As there is no extensive experience with the long term (50 + years) storage of plutonium, the design of high integrity storage containers must address many technical considerations. This analysis discusses a few potential natural phenomena that could theoretically adversely affect the container integrity over time. The plutonium oxide/metal storage container consists of a primary containment vessel (the outer container), a bagless transfer can (the inner container), two vertical plates {{on top of the}} primary containment vessel, a circular plate (the flange) supported by the two plates, tube for gas sampling operations mounted {{at the center of the}} primary containment vessel top and a spring system being inserted in the cavity between the primary containment vessel and the cap of the bagless transfer can.

40|$|This {{white paper}} {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a revised safety impact analysis conducted on the lead shielded <b>container</b> <b>assembly</b> (SCA). The purpose of the revised impact analysis is to identify any potential changes to the total effective (radiation) dose to on-site workers and the maximally exposed offsite-individual from previous analyses performed to support the WIPP Documented Safety Analysis (DSA). The revised analysis considers the potential for the lead in a SCA to melt during a fire/accident event and the resulting impacts on total effective radiation dose. The analysis provides the bounding fire scenarios that are required for development of the WIPP DSA. In that these scenarios are conservative, more realistic scenarios are also provided to explain what is more likely to occur. The WIPP DSA currently considers a variety of waste containers for contact-handled transuranic (CH TRU) waste, including 55 -gallon drums, 85 -gallon drums, 100 -gallon drums; standard waste boxes (SWB); ten drum overpacks; and pipe configurations overpacked in 55 -gallon drums. The 85 -gallon drum, 100 -gallon drum, SWB and ten drum overpacks may also be used to overpack smaller waste containers, e. g., a 55 -gallon drum may be overpacked in an 85 -gallon drum. The analysis presented in this white paper is conservatively based on the previous accident analysis and hazard controls that were selected for the SCA based on DOE-STD- 5506. The process described in this white paper evaluates the potential impacts from the lead in SCAs melting during a fire/accident on total effective dose to on-site workers and to members of the public. This impact analysis has been performed as a step in the process of seeking EPA approval for the use of SCAs at WIPP...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{multimedia}} content available via the Internet, {{and the number}} of formats in which it is encoded, stored and delivered continues to grow rapidly. So too the number and diversity of the devices and software applications which produce, process and consume such content. This constantly changing landscape presents an increasing challenge to interoperability, since more and more software and hardware must be upgraded as new formats are developed. However, many of the operations performed on multimedia content are similar across coding formats. In recognising this, this thesis proposes several approaches to format-independent media processing, with an emphasis on content delivery. This considerably simplifies interoperability, since support for a new content format may be provided by disseminating a data file, rather than requiring application and device providers to extend and modify their software and hardware. A fundamental requirement for format-independence is the ability to describe the structure of any given format in a way that exposes how it may be fragmented for delivery or processing, and how other data important to the processing (for instance temporal or scalability parameters) can be extracted from the binary data. Several meta-syntax languages are evaluated that (to greater or lesser degree) perform this function. Of these, the most suitable for general use in format-independent processors is found to be MPEG- 21 ’s Bitstream Syntax Description Language (BSDL). Its general suitability notwithstanding, BSDL exhibits several critical flaws when used to describe and process modern content formats. In response, this thesis proposes several new features for the language which significantly reduce processing complexity, and provide extensibility for complex data types. These features are implemented and validated using bitstreams of real-world length, which enable a linear response of approximately 10 times the speed of playback (on the particular test machine used), for videos up to one hour in duration. Digital media increasingly encompasses a wide range of metadata, as well as collections of related content (a DVD and it’s “special features”, for instance). Several recent standards address generic virtual containers for such rich content. While these standards—which include MPEG- 21 and TVAnytime—provide numerous tools for interacting with rich media objects, they do not provide a framework for streaming or delivery of such data. This thesis presents the Bitstream Binding Language (BBL), a format-independent tool that describes how multimedia content and metadata may be bound into delivery formats. Using a BBL description, a generic processor can map rich content (an MPEG- 21 Digital Item, for example) into a streaming or static delivery format. BBL provides a universal syntax for fragmentation and packetisation of both XML and binary data, and allows new content and metadata formats to be delivered without requiring the addition of new software to the delivery infrastructure. The BBL framework is validated and tested against a number of application scenarios including a format-independent streaming server, generic metadata syntax translation, virtual <b>container</b> <b>assembly,</b> and a format-independent hinter. Finally, it is observed that much of the semantic metadata that is generated to describe multimedia content could also be used to improve the decisions that must be made in order to transmit it effectively. Indeed, methods have been proposed for using specific semantic concepts in the delivery process. However, until now, no high-level system has been proposed that is able to take arbitrary semantic metadata, and utilise it in the multimedia delivery decision-making process. This thesis proposes such a system. It combines the aforementioned semantic concepts with other existing work in Rate-Distortion Optimisation for multimedia delivery, scalable content formats, and syntax description, and then develops a generalised framework to permit an arbitrary range of semantic metadata and optimisation techniques to be utilised. This objective is accomplished by utilising schema languages to describe the details of any given content or metadata, so that declarative mapping rules can be specified for translating from format-specific data points to format-independent concepts that are directly used by the framework. This translation can then be performed using software or hardware that knows nothing about the specific format it is processing. This thesis describes a particular embodiment of the semantic-aware multimedia delivery system which was implemented in order to verify its key assertions. It presents the results of subjective testing that was performed on several short news clips encoded using H. 264 /SVC scalable video coding, and Scalable-To-Lossless (SLS) au dio coding. Each clip was adapted to four target bitrates, using both of two methods: (a) using the semantic-aware system to devote a greater proportion of the available bandwidth to that part of the content (audio or video) that was conveying more of the semantics at any given time; and (b) at a constant bit-rate with the same average rate as clip (a). Test participants were shown each pair of clips (a and b) in a random order and were asked to evaluate which was more successful at conveying the meaning of the story. The result of this subjective testing was a 72 % preference for those clips which had been adapted so as to devote more bandwidth to the semantically-important parts of the content...|$|E

In mammals, transport vesicles coated with coat complex (COP) II deliver secretory cargo to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that ferry cargo from endoplasmic reticulum exit sites to the Golgi stack.

Here, we document in vitro direct tethering and SNARE-dependent fusion of endoplasmic reticulum–derived COPII transport vesicles to form larger cargo <b>containers.</b> The <b>assembly</b> did not require detectable Golgi membranes, preexisting VTCs, or COPI function.

This study has been done to support the criticality update. For criticality to occur, the wooden fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>containers</b> would have to burn such that the fuel inside would slump into a critical geometry configuration, a sufficient number of containers burn to form an infinite wide configuration, and sufficient water (about a 17 inch depth) be placed onto the slump.

It should be noted that 0. 95 wt% enriched fuel and billets are stacked higher than only two high. In this analysis, two initiating events will be considered.

This muon tracker comprises four detection modules, each containing orthogonal layers of Saint-Gobain BCF- 10 2 mm-pitch plastic scintillating fibres. Identification of the two struck fibres per module allows the reconstruction of a space point, and subsequently, the incoming and Coulomb-scattered muon trajectories. These allow the container content, with respect to the atomic number Z of the scattering material, to be determined through reconstruction of the scattering location and magnitude.

Functionally graded cermets secure obtaining of cutting tools with hard wear resistance surface layer and ductile body frame. A new FGM was obtained using P/M method. Design/methodology/approach: Materials were obtained using free sintering at vacuum and the high temperature-high pressure sintering method. Functionally graded cermets have more amount of hard phase in the surface layer and lower participation of this phase in the body frame. FGMs were prepared by the layers pressing method and the centrifugal deposition method. Findings: Material with 55 wt. % of TiC and 45 wt. % of (Ni,Mo) was prepared. The phase’s composition of this material was analysed. The ring structure of material and complex carbides formation was confirmed. The gradient of the phase composition and hardness measurement are presented. Phase composition of FGM strongly depend on conditions of centrifugal sedimentation process: duration, rotation speed, solid content, dispersive liquids. The centrifugal deposition process of powders forming guarantees gradient phase composition for materials obtaining the powder metallurgy methods. The FGM obtained by powders forming method should be sintered using pressure processes in a closed <b>containers</b> (or special <b>assembly)</b> because of materials high porosity which {{is a result of}} various chemical contents of this same material parts.
