30|$|Projects {{funded by}} EU Structural Funds are heterogeneous. Broadly speaking, {{they refer to}} four categories: (i) {{payments}} {{for the purchase of}} goods and services; (ii) incentives for firms and workers; (iii) payments for infrastructural projects; and (iv) other expenditures (purchase of stocks or other capital transfers). For the first category, during each year between 2008 and 2013, there were positive payments in all LLMs, although 9.5 % of the LLMs had payments smaller than one euro per-capita in 2008. Payments related to incentives were 0 only in 4.3 % of the LLM-year observations (concentrated in 2008, where they represented the 24.3 %), with an additional 3.2 % smaller than one euro per-capita. Payments for infrastructures were 0 in 6.9 % of the cases, while they were negative (due to reimbursements relative to projects that had been stopped) only for 1.1 % of the observations. An additional 9.9 % were smaller than one euro per-capita. In all these cases we impose the log to be equal to zero. We ignore the last category (other expenditures) because it amounted to 2.8 % of <b>total</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>payments</b> in 2013, with the majority of LLM-year observations equal to 0.|$|R
