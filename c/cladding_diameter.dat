50|$|Multi-mode fibers are {{described}} by their core and cladding diameters. Thus, 62.5/125 µm multi-mode fiber has a core size of 62.5 micrometres (µm) and a <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> of 125 µm. The transition between {{the core and}} cladding can be sharp, which is called a step-index profile, or a gradual transition, which is called a graded-index profile. The two types have different dispersion characteristics and thus different effective propagation distance. Multi-mode fibers may be constructed with either graded or step-index profile.|$|E
50|$|Matching fibers for {{improved}} pump coupling requires optimization of the <b>clad</b> <b>diameter</b> {{for both the}} passive and the active fiber. To maximize the amount of pump power coupled into the active fiber, the active fiber is designed with a slightly larger <b>clad</b> <b>diameter</b> than the passive fibers delivering the pump power. As an example, passive fibers with <b>clad</b> <b>diameters</b> of 395-um spliced to active octagon shaped fiber with <b>clad</b> <b>diameters</b> of 400-um improve the coupling of the pump power into the active fiber. An image of such a splice is shown, showing the shaped cladding of the doped double-clad fiber.|$|R

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{coupling}} in asymmetric fused-tapered single-mode fiber couplers {{is found to}} vary {{not only with the}} initial <b>cladding</b> <b>diameters</b> of the fibers to be tapered but also with the degree of fusion in the coupler.

A simple slab-waveguide model is described that can account for these trends in coupler performance...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{single-mode}} {{optical fiber}} has a core diameter between 8 and 10.5 µm and a <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> of 125 µm.

Data rates are limited by polarization mode dispersion and chromatic dispersion. , data rates of up to 10 gigabits per second were possible at distances of over 80 km with commercially available transceivers (Xenpak). By using optical amplifiers and dispersion-compensating devices, state-of-the-art DWDM optical systems can span thousands of kilometers at 10 Gbit/s, and several hundred kilometers at 40 Gbit/s.|$|E

It is shown that the conventional infinite <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> approximation cannot be used for index-antiguided gain-guided fibers, and the rigorous analysis presented in this paper is required for accurate prediction of the beam quality factor, as reported in recent experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|A {{multicore}} fiber with two-pitch layout {{is proposed}} {{to overcome the}} trade-off between core number and a <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> of a standard hexagonal layout with a single-core pitch. A fabricated ten-core fiber simultaneously realizes effective area of about 120 μm 2 at 1550 nm, small crosstalk, and <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> of 204 μm. The crosstalk between the center core and outer cores is about 30 dB smaller than that between outer cores. The small crosstalk of the center core would help to keep the transmission quality of the center core {{at the same level}} as that of the outer cores...|$|E
40|$|In-line single-mode-fiber (SMF) {{filters and}} polarizers require the {{interaction}} of electric fields which, in principle, are essentially confined to the fiber core. The reduction of the core and <b>cladding</b> <b>diameters</b> in a tapered fiber cause the evanescent field to extend beyond the outer boundary. Thus, when a metal film is evaporated on a tapered fiber, the surface plasma modes cause coupling to the fiber mode. Our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that such coupling leads to the resonant excitation of surface plasma modes and allows {{for the design of}} filters, polarizers, and sensors...|$|R

However, embedding an optical fibre into an electrode array may change its stiffness properties, which can affect the level of trauma during insertion. This report uses measurements of buckling and deflection force to compare the stiffness properties {{of a range of}} cochlear electrode arrays (Nucleus straight array, rat array, cat array and guinea pig array) with custom arrays containing an embedded optical fibre. The <b>cladding</b> <b>diameters</b> of the optical fibres tested were 125 μm, 80 μm and 50 μm. The results show that the stiffness of the optical-fibre-embedded arrays is related to the diameter of the optical fibre. Comparison with wired arrays suggests optical fibres with a diameter of 50 μm could be embedded into an electrode array without significantly changing the stiffness properties of the array...|$|R

40|$|Fused-tapered {{single-mode}} fibre couplers are available {{which have a}} flattened wavelength response and which are therefore useful in applications requiring a near-constant power-splitting ratio over a range of wavelengths. They are made by inducing an asymmetry in the constituent fibres, for example by pre-tapering or pre-etching one or both fibres prior to coupler fabrication, or by using two dissimilar fibres. The maximum coupled power in these couplers {{has been shown to}} decrease with increasing asymmetry. Couplers made from dissimilar fibres could also be useful for integrating systems made from different fibres, and it may be necessary for such a coupler to exhibit complete power transfer despite the asymmetry in fibre type. Complete power transfer has only previously been shown to be possible in dissimilar fibre couplers by differentially etching the fibres used to make the coupler, in order to adjust the extent of <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> asymmetry. It would be advantageous to be able to adjust the splitting ratio of these couplers without requiring close control over the <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> asymmetry of the constituent fibres. We demonstrate that the maximum coupled power of an asymmetric coupler is strongly dependent on the degree-of-fusion in the coupler, and {{that it is possible to}} obtain near-total power transfer (or indeed any level of power transfer) for a given <b>cladding</b> <b>diameter</b> asymmetry by controlling the degree-of-fusion of the coupler. We therefore remove the requirement for a controllable differential etching process prior to coupler fabrication...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{proposed}} to accurately determine longitudinal additional force in continuous welded rail (CWR) on bridges via hetero-cladding fiber Bragg grating (HC-FBG) sensors. The HC-FBG sensor consists of two FBGs written in {{the same type of}} fiber but with different <b>cladding</b> <b>diameters.</b> The HC-FBGs have the same temperature sensitivity but different strain sensitivity because of the different areas of the cross section. The differential strain coefficient is defined as the relative wavelength differences of two FBGs with the change of applied longitudinal force. In the verification experiment in the lab, the HC-FBGs were attached on a section of rail model of which the material property is {{the same as that of}} rail on line. The temperature and differential strain sensitivity were calibrated using a universal testing machine. As shown by the test results, the linearity between the relative wavelength difference and the longitudinal additional force is greater than 0. 9999. The differential strain sensitivity is 4. 85 × 10 − 6 /N. Moreover, the relative wavelength difference is not affected by the temperature change.

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{feedback control}} strategy for a vapor-phase axial deposition (VAD) is investigated in this paper. VAD {{is a widely}} used process {{in the creation of}} high purity glass for optical fiber. In previous work a soot tip surface temperature controller was developed for the VAD process to reduce the effects of core soot temperature variation on deposition geometry, leading to a more stable process. However, it is desired to regulate both the core soot and clad soot deposition such that they deposit at the same axial rate to provide a more uniform product. This paper presents the design and development of a cascaded controller strategy and process model to couple and regulate the surface temperature and deposition rates of core and clad soot. Simulation studies demonstrate a potential improvement in the uniformity of the core and clad soot geometry over the soot product length.

The modal and propagation {{characteristics of the}} PCF can be tailored by altering their geometrical parameters and material infiltrations. A drawback of commercially available PCF is their limited operating wavelengths, which is mostly in the infrared (IR) spectral band. Nanostructured composite materials manipulates the optical properties of the PCF, facilitating their operation in the higher sensitivity near infrared (NIR) wavelength regime. Hence, there arises a need to closely investigate the effect of nanostructure and composite materials on various optical parameters of the PCF sensor.
