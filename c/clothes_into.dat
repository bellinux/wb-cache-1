5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E
25|$|People {{entered the}} small room of the machine while {{it was on the}} beach, wearing their street clothing.

25|$|A one-year {{period of}} {{mourning}} {{for the late}} Chief ended on 13 May 2005, with the close {{of a series of}} ceremonies that started on the 9th. Those who had been observing mourning rituals symbolically changed from black <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> their normal attire. (Members of the Mara family, however, said that they would continue to wear black for a further three months, until the period of mourning for his wife, Adi Lala, is over). Many thousands of people arrived in the chiefly village of Tubou on the island of Lakeba {{to take part in the}} vakataraisulu ritual, which lifted taboos in place for the Mara family and the people of the Lau Islands. Mara's son, Ratu Finau Mara, who is widely expected to be named his successor as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, was expected to participate in the vakataraisulu at the request of elders from Tubou and Levuka, but for undisclosed reasons, remained in Suva. In 2004, he had attended his father's state funeral in Suva but not his private funeral in Lakeba. His younger brother, Roko Tevita Uluilakeba, was believed to be out of the country.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman: Born on Krypton as Kal-El {{and raised}} on Earth, he is a being of immense power, {{strength}} and invulnerability who, after realizing his destiny to serve mankind, uses his powers {{to protect and}} save others. As a means to protect his identity, he works in Metropolis at the Daily Planet as mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent and changes his <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> a red-blue red caped suit with an S shield on its chest and known for his dubbing as [...] "Superman" [...] by Lois.

500|$|Textile and {{clothing}} production {{was a major}} source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded among the peoples of the Empire, whose products were often named for them or a particular town, rather like a fashion [...] "label". Better ready-to-wear was exported by businessmen (negotiatores or mercatores) who were often well-to-do residents of the production centres. Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, who travelled to potential customers, or by vestiarii, clothing dealers who were mostly freedmen; or they might be peddled by itinerant merchants. In Egypt, textile producers could run prosperous small businesses employing apprentices, free workers earning wages, and slaves. The fullers (fullones) and dye workers (coloratores) had their own guilds. Centonarii were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> pieced goods.|$|E

More {{than any of the}} other children she treated him with a spontaneous affection that touched him deeply; she liked to smooth his hair and pat his <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> shape, and was by nature self-absorbedly neat and tidy, cutting out delicate bits of paper to put away in her workbox, threading ribbons, and sewing small things for her dolls and make-believe worlds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The nivi is today's {{most popular}} sari style from Andhra Pradesh. The {{increased}} {{interaction with the}} British saw most women from royal families come out of purdah in the 1900s. This necessitated a change of dress. Maharani Indira Devi of Cooch Behar popularised the chiffon sari. She was widowed early in life and followed the convention of abandoning her richly woven Baroda shalus in favour of the unadorned mourning white as per tradition. Characteristically, she transformed her [...] "mourning" [...] <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> high fashion. She had saris woven in France to her personal specifications, in white chiffon, and introduced the silk chiffon sari to the royal fashion repertoire.|$|E

2500|$|In about 1928 Yeo Vale was {{purchased}} by Stephen Berrold, described by Lauder (1981) as [...] "a strange, shadowy figure, possibly part foreign, described as the local mystery-man, with strange comings and goings, and 'dark people' to wait on him". He had lived in Palestine, from where he brought his staff, including a Persian chauffeur and two Arabic or Muslim maids. he was believed by locals {{to have been a}} Secret Service Agent, or a foreign spy. He did not mix with the local North Devon gentry, but always invited the villagers to Yeo Vale for an annual Christmas party and gave generous presents to the [...] local children. He kept a private aircraft at Stibb Cross, which on occasion he piloted to London. He was nevertheless described by his long-term gardener as [...] "always a gentleman to us". He had an argument (concerning the felling of trees) with John Westaway, the farmer who occupied the barton adjoining the mansion house, and in 1938 he moved to Stodden Park, near Petersfield in Hampshire, having deserted Yeo Vale never to return. His wife died soon after, which greatly affected him. He packed all her <b>clothes</b> <b>into</b> her Buick car and ordered his chauffeur to drive it off a cliff at Stodden Park, which he refused to do, upon which Berrold buried it in a pit and set it alight. He later married a French woman and moved to Africa. He retained ownership of the building, which was [...] "literally abandoned and left to die... It stood for many years deserted and empty, gazing forlornly out across the fields, like a dog patiently waiting for its master to return. But he never did". The house soon became dilapidated, but nevertheless was given a grade II listing in 1955, and Mr Westcott obtained a licence from the local council to demolish it in 1973.|$|E

60|$|He put one muscular leg out of bed, and then, at {{the earnest}} request of Mr. Scutts, {{put it back}} again. In a few simple, manly words the latter apologized, by putting all the blame on Mrs. Scutts, and, {{removing}} his <b>clothes,</b> got <b>into</b> bed.|$|R
