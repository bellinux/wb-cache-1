40|$|Peer-evaluation based {{measures}} of group research quality {{such as the}} UK's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), which do not employ bibliometric analyses, cannot directly avail of such methods to normalize research impact across disciplines. This {{is seen as a}} conspicuous flaw of such exercises and calls have been made to find a remedy. Here a simple, systematic solution is proposed based upon a mathematical model for the relationship between research quality and group quantity. This model manifests both the Matthew effect and a phenomenon akin to the Ringelmann effect and reveals the existence of two <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> for each academic discipline: a lower value, below which groups are vulnerable, and an upper value beyond which the dependency of quality on quantity reduces and plateaus appear when the <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> are large. A possible normalization procedure is then to pitch these plateaus at similar levels.

5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material.

Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one <b>critical</b> <b>mass,</b> with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

40|$|In {{the core}} {{accretion}} {{model for the}} formation of gas giant planets, runaway gas accretion onto a core is the primary requisite, triggered when the core <b>mass</b> reaches a <b>critical</b> value. The recently revealed wide diversity of the extrasolar giant planets suggests the necessity to further the understanding of the conditions resulting in the <b>critical</b> core <b>mass</b> that initiates runaway accretion. We study the internal structure of protoplanets under hydrostatic and thermal equilibria represented in terms of a polytropic equation of state to investigate what factors determine and affect the <b>critical</b> core <b>mass.</b> We find that the protoplanets, embedded in protoplanetary disks, have the same configuration as red giants, characterized by the envelope of the centrally-condensed type solution. Applying the theory of stellar structure with homology invariants, we demonstrate that there are three types of criteria for the <b>critical</b> core <b>mass</b> depending on the stiffness of polytrope and the nature of outer boundary condition. For the stiff polytropes of index N 3, this criterion acts at the bottom of gaseous envelope. Further, we elucidate the roles and effects of coexistent radiative and convective zones in the envelope of <b>critical</b> core <b>mass.</b> Based on the results, we discuss the relevance of Bondi and Hill surface conditions and explore the parameter dependences of <b>critical</b> core <b>mass.</b> Comment: 54 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

5|$|The {{table to}} the right lists the {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E

As we resolve the paradox of geographical location in a global economy, we may discover how businesses create their competitive advantage.

Geographical and cultural proximity provides companies better information, tighter relationships and other advantages {{hard to come by}} for distant competitors. Porter (1990) explains how the companies must be configures, how they can contribute to universities and what type of promotion governments must develop.

Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper we used chiral {{perturbation}} theory {{to determine the}} phase diagram and pion spectrum for Wilson and twisted-mass fermions at non-zero lattice spacing with non-degenerate up and down quarks. Here we extend this work to include the effects of electromagnetism, {{so that it is}} applicable to recent simulations incorporating all sources of isospin breaking. For Wilson fermions, we find that the phase diagram is unaffected by the inclusion of electromagnetism [...] -the only effect is to raise the charged pion masses. For maximally twisted fermions, we previously took the twist and isospin-breaking directions to be different, in order that the fermion determinant is real and positive. However, this is incompatible with electromagnetic gauge invariance, and so here we take the twist to be in the isospin-breaking direction, following the RM 123 collaboration. We map out the phase diagram in this case, which has not previously been studied. The results differ from those obtained with different twist and isospin directions. One practical issue when including electromagnetism is that the <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> for up and down quarks differ.

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form.

Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
