[...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I can see a better day/ I <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. A staff writer for GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who one asked.|$|E
2500|$|The Philips Record company's {{studio was}} slated as [...] "an {{extremely}} dead studio", {{it felt as}} though it had turned the treble down: [...] "There was no [...] and it was like singing in a padded cell. I {{had to get out of}} there". Springfield would end up in the ladies' toilets for its superior acoustics. Another example of refusal to use the studio is [...] "I <b>Close</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> Count to Ten" [...] – recorded at the end of a corridor.|$|E

It was a Bessie Smith recording of 'The Bleeding Hearted Blues,' with 'Midnight Blues' {{on the other}} side. The first time I laid the needle down on that record I felt cold chills and an indescribable excitement. It was my first exposure to jazz and the blues, although I had no {{idea at the time}} what to call those magical sounds. I just knew I had to hear more of them! — Frankie Laine ...|$|E
2500|$|Sculptor Jon Bickley {{perceived}} a {{kinship with}} Johnson noting that [...] "It seems Dr. Johnson and I {{were meant to}} come together [...] [...] [...] He was born in Lichfield, in the Midlands, and I was brought up just outside it. I can <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> picture his birth house." [...] Bickley modelled the cat on his own pet, Thomas Henry, and carefully selected the sculpture's height for maximum accessibility: [...] "I made Hodge about shoulder height for the average adult, which is just about right for putting an arm around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kastner's {{critics also}} argue that he promised the SS not to warn Hungarian Jews to avoid {{jeopardizing}} negotiations to save the Jews who escaped on the Kastner train. In 1960, an interview with Eichmann, made by the Dutch Nazi journalist Willem Sassen in Argentina, was published in Life Magazine. Eichmann said that Kastner [...] "agreed {{to help keep the}} Jews from resisting deportation—and even keep order in the collection camps—if I would <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> let a few hundred or a few thousand young Jews emigrate to Palestine. It was a good bargain". Rudolf Vrba wrote, [...] "Kastner paid for those 1,684 lives with his silence".|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} of Dusty, which {{featured}} her rendition of [...] "Get Ready" [...] and her UK No.13 hit, [...] "I'll Try Anything", was broadcast in 1967. It attracted a healthy audience but the series {{did not keep}} up with changes in pop music. The comparatively progressive album Where Am I Going? (October 1967) attempted to redress this by containing a [...] "jazzy", orchestrated version of [...] "Sunny" [...] and Jacques Brel's [...] "If You Go Away". Though it was critically appreciated, it did not sell well in the US – it reached the top40 in the UK. In November 1968, a similar fate befell Dusty... Definitely, which was not issued in the US, it reached the UK top30. Her choice of material ranged from the rolling [...] "Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone" [...] to the aching emotion of [...] "I Think It's Gonna Rain Today". In that same year, Springfield had a UK No.4 hit, [...] "I <b>Close</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> Count to Ten", which was written by Clive Westlake. Its flipside, [...] "No Stranger Am I", was co-written by Norma Tanega and Norma Kutzer. By late 1966, Springfield was in a domestic relationship with Tanega – a US-born singer-songwriter who had a UK Top30 hit with the novelty song, [...] "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog". Springfield's ITV series It Must Be Dusty was broadcast in May and June 1968, episode six featured a duet performance of [...] "Mockingbird" [...] with singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix fronting his band, The Experience.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bang" [...] was {{directed}} by Bruno Ilogti, with art direction by Giovanni Bianco, with more than 50 professionals involved in the production. [...] "That was the first video I left entirely on someone else's hands. I did not touched anything. I left Giovanni do it. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> trusted him. video is amazing," [...] she said. The singer wanted a video with [...] "strength, self-esteem messages," [...] {{but at the same}} time something that would be a [...] "step up" [...] in her career. She wanted it to be something that [...] "people from zero to one hundred years of age would enjoy." [...] The video was choreographed by Anitta herself, along with dancer Arielle. The singer commented on the production:"What I liked on the video is that it is innovative, different. I think people will be amazed once again, no one expected it. The video is very similar to the album's booklet, it has a lot of sensuality and fun. In my other videos, I always directed and wrote along, but this time I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> threw myself into Giovanni Bianco's ideas." ...|$|R

60|$|Days passed. When {{one morning}} I found the arbor vacant. Gone! A dream. I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> would have dreamed her back. In vain. Starting, I called upon her name; but none replied. Fleeing from the islet, I gained the {{neighboring}} shore, and searched among the woods; and my comrades meeting, besought their aid. But idle all. No glimpse of aught, save trees and flowers. Then Media was sought out; the event made known; and quickly, bands were summoned to range the isle.|$|R
60|$|I was exhausted; {{worn out}} in {{body and mind}} by the sickening fears which no effort of will seemed able to quell.

60|$|Twenty-four hours {{have passed}} since I made my last entry. It was night then, and it is night now. All that lies between seems phantasmagoric and unreal.

60|$|In short, {{my mother}} was in that {{positive}} state of mind which is expressed by the colloquial phrase of being on her high horse.

60|$|Her {{perfectly}} {{black dress}} threw the ghastly hue of her strained, wild face into startling prominence, and her slender arms were stretched passionately upwards {{in a gesture}} full of intense dramatic pathos.

I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> strove to win back to the chain- locked wagon-circle at Nephi. But so long as my visitors stood about me and talked I could not escape.|$|R
