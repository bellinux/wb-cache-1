25|$|In {{addition}} to the well-known potato dishes such as Gratin dauphinois, cooking au gratin is a widely used cooking technique {{in the preparation of}} numerous dishes including many meat, fish, vegetable and pasta dishes, fennel, leeks, crab meat, <b>celeriac</b> and aubergines (eggplant).|$|E
25|$|Hungarian {{chicken soup}} {{is a clear}} soup, a consommé, called Újházi chicken soup. A consommé with entire pieces of chicken, chicken liver and heart, with chunky {{vegetables}} and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, <b>celeriac,</b> parsley root and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Spätzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations.|$|E
25|$|Celery {{is among}} {{a small group of}} foods (headed by peanuts) that appear to provoke the most severe {{allergic}} reactions; for people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. The allergen {{does not appear to be}} destroyed at cooking temperatures. Celery root—commonly eaten as <b>celeriac,</b> or put into drinks—is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis may be exacerbated. An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult. In contrast with peanut allergy being most prevalent in the US, celery allergy is most prevalent in Central Europe. In the European Union, foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, must be clearly marked as such.|$|E
25|$|Snails of {{the same}} species {{collected}} from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: Alyssum, fruit and leaves of apple, apricot, artichoke (a favorite), aster, barley, beans, bindweed, California boxwood, almost any cabbage variety, camomile, carnation, carrot, cauliflower, <b>celeriac</b> (root celery), celery, ripe cherries, chive, citrus, clover, cucumbers (a favorite snail food), dandelion, elder, henbane, hibiscus, hollyhock, kale, larkspur (Consolida or Delphinium genera), leek, lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), lily, magnolia, mountain ash, mulberry, chrysanthemum, nasturtium, nettle, nightshade berries, oats, onion greens, pansy, parsley, peach, ripe pears, peas, petunia, phlox, plum, potatoes (raw or cooked), pumpkins, radish, rape, rose, sorrel, spinach, sweet pea, thistle, tomatoes (well liked), turnip, wheat, yarrow, zinnia. They will eat sweet lupines, but will reject bitter lupines and other plants with high quinolizidine alkaloids. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Italian queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland) many Italian cooks came to Poland after 1518. Although native {{vegetable}} foods were an ancient and intrinsic {{part of the}} cuisine, this began {{a period in which}} vegetables like lettuce, leeks, <b>celeriac</b> and cabbage were more widely used. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in Polish as włoszczyzna, a word derived from Włochy, the Polish name of Italy. During this period the use of spices, which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes, was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of King Jagiello (who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas and cauliflower.|$|E
500|$|Another dish which {{highlights}} local vegetables is a salt baked turnip side which accompanies duck. Harrod explained [...] "Turnips don't deserve their unloved image, {{they add}} a wonderful freshness to a dish." [...] The {{signature of the}} restaurant is a suckling pig themed dish, incorporating a pork shoulder which is cooked over two days in a bain-marie, served with shallot and mugwort. This {{is accompanied by a}} croquette made from pig's head and a pork cutlet with <b>celeriac,</b> pear, sorrel and cauliflower mushrooms. The restaurant serves breakfast to residents staying in the rooms, which includes Trealy Farm produced sausages and bacon.|$|E
500|$|A. A. Gill {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Sunday Times after {{the move to}} the Oak Room in late 1997. He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is {{as high as you can}} go in this country, and close to as high as you can go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a <b>celeriac</b> remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E
500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, <b>celeriac,</b> zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, {{another popular}} variety [...] is <b>celeriac</b> (also known as celery root), Apium graveolens var. rapaceum, grown because its {{hypocotyl}} forms a large bulb, {{white on the}} inside. The bulb could be kept for months in winter and mostly serves as a main ingredient in soup. It can also be ground up and used in salads.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main course}} usually {{includes}} {{a serving of}} meat, such as roast, chicken, or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), vegetables, side dishes and salads, including surówka [...] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, <b>celeriac,</b> seared beetroot) or sauerkraut ( [...] , [...] ). The side dishes are usually potatoes, rice or kasza (cereals). Meals conclude with a dessert such as sernik, makowiec (a poppy seed pastry), or drożdżówka [...] yeast pastry, and tea.|$|E
2500|$|The Danish hønsekødssuppe is {{traditionally}} cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as [...] "suppehøner" [...] (lit.: soup hens). Vegetables like <b>celeriac,</b> carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical flavourings are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat {{is reserved for}} other dishes such as høns i asparges (lit.: [...] "chicken in asparagus") or hønsesalat (lit.: [...] "chicken salad").|$|E
2500|$|The main meal {{might be}} eaten about 2p.m. or later. It {{is larger than}} the North American lunch. It might be {{composed}} of three courses especially among the traditionalists, starting with a soup like a popular rosół and tomato soup or more festive barszcz (beet borscht) or żurek (sour rye meal mash), followed perhaps in a restaurant by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast or kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet), or chicken. Vegetables, currently replaced by leafy green salads, were not very long ago most commonly served as surówka [...] – shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, <b>celeriac,</b> seared beetroot) or sauerkraut (...) [...] The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or more traditionally kasza (cereals). Meals often conclude with a dessert such as makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, or drożdżówka , a type of yeast cake. Other Polish specialities include chłodnik [...] (a chilled beet or fruit soup for hot days), golonka (pork knuckles cooked with vegetables), kołduny (meat dumplings), zrazy (stuffed slices of beef), salceson and flaki (tripe).|$|E
50|$|<b>Celeriac</b> is a root {{vegetable}} with a bulbous hypocotyl. In the Mediterranean Basin and in Northern Europe, <b>celeriac</b> grows wild and is widely cultivated. It is also cultivated in North Africa, Siberia, Southwest Asia, and North America. In North America, the Diamant cultivar predominates. <b>Celeriac</b> {{originated in the}} Mediterranean Basin.|$|E

50|$|Typically, <b>celeriac</b> is {{harvested}} {{when its}} hypocotyl is 10 to 14 cm in diameter. However, {{a growing trend}} (specifically in Peruvian and South American cuisine) {{is to use the}} immature vegetable, valued for its intensity of flavour and tenderness overall. It is edible raw or cooked, and tastes similar to the stalks (the upper part of the stem) of common celery cultivars. <b>Celeriac</b> may be roasted, stewed, blanched, or mashed. Sliced <b>celeriac</b> occurs as an ingredient in soups, casseroles, and other savory dishes. The leaves and stems of the vegetable are quite flavoursome, and aesthetically delicate and vibrant, which has led to their use as a garnish in contemporary fine dining.|$|E

50|$|The {{shelf life}} of <b>celeriac</b> is {{approximately}} {{six to eight}} months if stored between 0 C and 5 C, and not allowed to dry out. However, the vegetable will tend to rot through the centre if the finer stems surrounding the base are left attached. The freshness of the vegetable can be determined by viewing the hollowness of the vegetable; a fresh <b>celeriac</b> should not have a hollow centre. The freshness of the vegetable will also be obvious from the taste; the older the vegetable, the less potent the celery flavour.|$|E
