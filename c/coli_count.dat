This {{study sought to}} understand the sources of E. coli in Dunes Creek’s central branch. A systematic survey of random and fixed sampling points of water and sediment was conducted over 3 years. E. coli concentrations in Dunes Creek and beach water were significantly correlated. Weekly monitoring at 14 stations during 1999 and 2000 indicated chronic loading of E. coli throughout the stream. Significant correlations between E. coli numbers in stream water and stream sediment, submerged sediment and margin, and margin and 1 m from shore were found. Median E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts</b> were highest in stream sediments, followed by bank sediments, sediments along spring margins, stream water, and isolated pools; in forest soils, E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts</b> were more variable and relatively lower. Sediment moisture was significantly correlated with E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts.</b> Direct fecal input inade-quately explains the widespread and consistent occurrence of E. coli in the Dunes Creek watershed; long-term survival or multiplication or both seem likely. The authors conclude that (i) E. coli is ubiquitous and persistent throughout the Dunes Creek basin, (ii) E. coli occurrence and distribution in riparian sediments help account for the continuous loading of the bacteria in Dunes Creek, and (iii) ditching of the stream, increased drainage, and subsequent loss of wetlands {{may account for the}} chronically high E. coli levels observed...|$|R

The FDA {{has proposed}} that these E. coli levels are an indication of high risk of bacterial contamination of fresh onion (Allium cepa L.) bulbs regardless of the irrigation system. If onion irrigation exceeds 235 CFU, it is not known whether the contaminated water applied by furrow or drip irrigation actually reaches the onion bulb. Soil could filter E. coli and other bacteria before irrigation water reaches onion bulbs. ?Vaquero? onions were grown on Owyhee silt loam. In our preliminary studies reported here, well water free of E. coli was applied to onions through drip irrigation or through furrow irrigation. A second water source was intentionally enriched with E. coli by being run across a pasture and recaptured prior to use. Furrow and drip irrigation were used to apply this water containing 218 to > 2400 MPN/ 100 ml for 11 + hours per irrigation. E. coli was monitored in the soil water at the end of irrigation cycles through direct sampling of the soil. Soil water was also sampled using sterile soil solution capsules (SSSC) to sample E. coli in the soil water that moved into place, to differentiate the movement of soil water from the soil water already in place. Soil water measurements were made adjacent to the water source, half way to the bulbs, and immediately adjacent to the onion bulbs.

In 2009, nutrient concentrations correlated with E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts,</b> abundance of total cyanobacterial cells, Microcystis 16 S rRNA and mcyD genes and intracellular microcystin. Total and dissolved phosphorus also correlated significantly with rainfall. The major cyanobacterial taxa were members of the orders Chroococcales and Nostocales. The genus Microcystis was the main mcyD-carrier and main microcystin producer. Our results suggested that increasing nutrient concentrations and total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios approaching 11 : 1, coupled with an increase in temperature, promoted Microcystis-dominated toxic blooms. Although the importance of nutrient ratios and absolute concentrations on cyanobacterial and Microcystis dynamics have been documented in other laboratories, an optimum TN:TP ratio for Microcystis dominance has not been previously observed in situ.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to monitor {{variations}} and relationships between coliform and E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts,</b> the activities of their marker enzymes GAL and GUD, and temperature and pH {{over a period of}} 12 months in river samples obtained from the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Several polluted water samples were collected for direct coliform β-D-galactosidase (B-GAL) and Escherichia coli β-D-glucuronidase (B-GUD) assays and the membrane filtration technique. While all the samples showed enzyme activities, not all exhibited growth on CM 1046 media. Variation in B-GAL activity (40 %) was observed between November (highest activity month) and May (lowest activity month). The highest and lowest B-GUD activities were observed in the months of September and May/June, respectively. The sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay method was indicated by a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 coliform forming unit (CFU) / 100 mℓ and 2 CFU/ 100 mℓ for coliforms and E. coli, respectively. There was a significant (P < 0. 05) positive correlation between E. <b>coli</b> <b>counts</b> and GUD activity (R 2 = 0. 8909). A correlation of R 2 = 0. 9151 was also observed between total coliforms and B-GAL activity, even though the CFUs were not evenly distributed. Direct enzyme assays were also shown to be more sensitive than the membrane filtration (MF) technique...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{herds of}} dairy cows were {{examined}} by rectal swabbing {{for the presence}} of Campylobacter jejuni. Ten herds were positive with the incidence of colonized animals ranging from 10 to 72 % of those tested. With the exception of the two negative herds where mains water only was consumed, all animals drank from rivers or streams when grazing. There was no relationship between total and coliform counts and the presence of C. jejuni in raw milk. However, milk from one farm that consistently gave positive results had significantly higher Escherichia <b>coli</b> <b>counts</b> than other samples...|$|R
