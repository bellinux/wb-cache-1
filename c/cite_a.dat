5|$|Critics <b>cite</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E

25|$|The {{posterior}} (Moore or Southern) approach accesses {{the joint}} and capsule through the back, taking piriformis muscle {{and the short}} external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip abductors and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It {{has the advantage of}} becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics <b>cite</b> <b>a</b> higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} of {{disappeared}} {{in the form of}} PEN prisoners was 8,625 and of these disappeared 157 were killed after being released from detention. Human Rights Groups in Argentina often <b>cite</b> <b>a</b> figure of 30,000 disappeared, Amnesty International estimates 20,000 while other observers think 12,000 is a more accurate figure. In 1988, the Asamblea por los Derechos Humanos (APDH or Assembly for Human Rights) published its findings on the disappearances and stated that 12,261 people were killed or disappeared during the Dirty War. The Montoneros admitted losing 5,000 guerrillas killed, and the ERP admitted 5,000 of their own guerrillas had been killed.

25|$|Goldman {{also claimed}} that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 {{following}} a long hibernation, {{he was not}} immune to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene.

Goldman did not <b>cite</b> <b>a</b> single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|E
