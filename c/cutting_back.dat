5|$|In 1940, Eichelberger {{became the}} Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted {{a number of}} reforms, <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> {{activities}} such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituting modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.|$|E
5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E

5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E

40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>cutting</b> is {{a special}} {{condition}} that occurs when there is tool run-out, uneven tool wear on the inserts or machining over the same region in opposite directions in two different passes. As the tool progresses along a tool path the instabilities mentioned might cause the back half of the cutter to machine the workpiece. This condition is {{commonly referred to as}} <b>back</b> <b>cutting.</b> The most common way of observing the presence of <b>back</b> <b>cutting</b> is the reversal in the direction of tool marks. A series of experiments were performed to gauge the actual effect on process performance due to <b>back</b> <b>cutting.</b> The results surprisingly showed that <b>back</b> <b>cutting</b> does not have a serious impact on the burr formation. Pictures of burrs under an optical microscope shows that <b>back</b> <b>cutting</b> do not create burrs but merely machines over the burrs created from forward cutting. Experiments performed with different <b>back</b> <b>cutting</b> depths produced identical results. The study also revealed that the tool wear which causes nose rounding is the more significant cause of burrs not explained by prediction theories. Two different strategies, tool geometry based and tool path based are proposed to avoid kinematic conditions that promote burr formation with worn tools. The results from these strategies are presented {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R

5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on the expenses of his own household.|$|E
5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 {{and a similar}} sum was promised by the GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new Farringdon Road from the City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

50|$|When the Eastern Suburbs Line {{was under}} {{construction}} in the 1960s and 1970s, {{the plan was to}} locate a station in a closed off grass <b>cutting</b> <b>backing</b> onto the backyards of properties on four surrounding streets. It is believed that the cutting had, for many years, been owned and preserved by the then NSW Department of Railways, as a future potential railway site. Local residents, unaware of this, would use the pleasant but enclosed grassy cutting as a hidden local park. The area, being surrounded by the high rocky escarpment that is Edgecliff Road, Woollahra, contained many trees and was a sanctuary for bird life.|$|R

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the century there were a number of major restoration projects on British castles. Before the outbreak of the First World War work was undertaken at Chepstow, Bodiam, Caernarfon and Tattershal; after the end of the war various major state funded restoration projects occurred in the 1920s with Pembroke, Caerphilly and Goodrich amongst the largest of these. This work typically centred on <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> the vegetation encroaching on castle ruins, especially ivy, and removing damaged or unstable stonework; castles such as Beaumaris saw their moats cleaned and reflooded. Some castles such as Eilean Donan in Scotland were substantially rebuilt in the inter-war years. The early UK film industry took an interest in castles as potential sets, starting with Ivanhoe filmed at Chepstow Castle in 1913 and starring US leading actor King Baggot.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, {{which had}} looked at the {{situation}} in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000men, with a further 470,000in the laskar.|$|E

5000|$|Wisteria Sinensis {{was unknown}} in Europe before 1816, when several {{agents of the}} East India Company working in China sent <b>cuttings</b> <b>back</b> to England. [...] A 200 year-old vine, growing at Griffin's Brewery in Chiswick, London, planted that same year, is often cited as England's oldest living {{wisteria}} plant. Over the next several decades the plant became, and remains, one of the quintessential ornamental vines in English gardens. The white-flowering form, Wisteria Sinensis Alba, was discovered in a garden by Botanist Robert Fortune in 1844, from whence he took cuttings for the Royal Horticultural Society. It is most commonly trained along garden walls, along the exterior of buildings, or over a pergola to create avenues of overhanging blossoms during bloom.|$|R
5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Klondike Gold Rush {{challenged}} this policy, as the force soon became essential to controlling the borders in the far north. Moving the entire force to the remote region of the Yukon, though, would {{have more than doubled}} the cost of the police's training and support arrangements, and their existing bases therefore remained vital to the northern operations. The increasing demands from the railway companies and mining companies for police assistance, and appeals from the ranching community for continued support, also made it harder for the Liberals to consider <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> the force. The Second Boer War then disrupted plans to create a replacement militia unit, while Herchmer's disastrous tour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to replace him with Perry, a Liberal supporter. As a result, the political argument began to swing back in favour of potentially retaining the force.|$|E
5|$|The film opens by <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth}} between scenes of a naval ship {{carrying}} Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses {{the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root).|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the {{expanded}} offerings did not contribute well to the series, alongside the late-2000s recession; sales of most rhythm games including Guitar Hero and DJ Hero did not meet expectations, falling about 50% short of projected targets. Activision announced it would be <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> to only 10 SKUs within 2010 instead of the 25 in 2009. Though RedOctane and Neversoft continued to develop the 6th main game, , until its completion, both studios were later shuttered by Activision, moving key personnel into Activision directly for future game development, {{and in the case}} of Neversoft, closing its Guitar Hero division, while transferring future development duties for the series to Vicarious Visions, another Activision studio which had been fundamental in building the Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the games. In November 2010, Activision also closed Budcat Creations, the arm of the publisher that was primarily responsible for porting the Guitar Hero games to the PlayStation 2.|$|E

On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses.
