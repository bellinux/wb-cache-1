In this study, a numerical method it presented, which could simulate the vibration of spiral <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> that caused by the water flow in turbine flow passage. The numerical simulation of 3 -D unsteady turbulent flow through the flow passage of turbine model is accomplished by solving the N-S equations, and the flow fields of flow passage and dynamic water pressure on boundary are obtained. At the same time, the three-dimension finite element dynamic model of solid structure is established, which contain steel liner and concrete surrounding the spiral case. And then, the three-dimensional instantaneous analysis of solid are proceeded as well as the dynamic water pressure transfer real-time by user interface program on interface at which the fluid interacts with solid. The one-way coupling analysis between fluid and solid structure is realized, through which the stress field and displacement field of solid induced by water flow are obtained.

This special <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> can make the flow more complex and cause huge hydraulic losses. In this paper, the periodically unsteady turbulent flow in the circular casing of a high power centrifugal diffuser pump has been investigated numerically by CFD calculation. The velocity distributions in different positions were analyzed, and the pressure fluctuation results in time and frequency domains were considered. Finally, the pressure fluctuation intensity coefficient (PFIC) and peak pressure coefficient (PPC) based on statistical thinking were defined on each grid node and the results were analyzed quantitatively to check the time accumulation effect of the unsteady flow phenomenon. The results show that strong flow unsteadiness can be found near diffuser outlet positions of the circular channel and in discharge tube. In addition, the PPC and PFIC results can supply a new angle of view to evaluate the pressure variation, and it is a good supplement to the traditional unsteady pressure analysis method in time and frequency domains...|$|E

Active <b>casing</b> <b>structures</b> with embedded piezoelectric actuators {{appear to be a}} promising solution. They can control static and dynamic tip clearance, compensate for uneven deflections, and accomplish electromechanical coupling at the material level. In addition, they have a compact design. To assess the feasibility of this concept and assist the development of these novel structures, the NASA Lewis Research Center developed in-house computational capabilities for composite structures with piezoelectric actuators and sensors, and subsequently used them to simulate candidate active <b>casing</b> <b>structures.</b> The simulations indicated the potential of active casings to modify the blade tip clearance enough to improve stage efficiency. They also provided valuable design information, such as preliminary actuator configurations (number and location) and the corresponding voltage patterns required to compensate for uneven casing deformations.

The center figure shows the predicted radial displacements along the hoop direction that are induced when electrostatic voltage is applied at the piezoceramic actuators.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{extension}} of a two-dimensional, axisymmetric, Timoshenko-beam finite-element rotordynamic code to include a three-dimensional non-axisymmetric solid-element casing model. Axisymmetric beams are sufficient to model rotors. Spring and damper forces provide the interface between the rotor and its casing and capture the dynamics of the full model. However, axisymmetric beams limit the modeling of real-case machine <b>structures,</b> where the <b>casing</b> is not axisymmetric. Axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric 3 D finite element <b>casing</b> <b>structures</b> are modeled. These structures are then reduced using a technique called substructuring. Modal equations are developed for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric casing models. In a 3 D non-axisymmetric model, structural dynamics modes can be modeled by lateral modes in two orthogonal planes. Modal information of the complex 3 D <b>casing</b> <b>structures</b> are generated, and then incorporated into the 2 D code after a series of pre-processing steps. A reduction method called Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) is used to reduce the large dimensionality involved in calculation of rotordynamic coefficients. The results from the <b>casing</b> <b>structures</b> are merged with the rotor model to create a combined rotor-casing model. The analysis of the combined structure shows that there is a difference in the natural frequencies and unbalance response between the model that uses symmetrical casing and the one that uses non-axisymmetric casing. XLTRC 2 is used {{as an example of a}} two-dimensional axisymmetric beam-element code. ANSYS is used as a code to build three-dimensional non-axisymmetric solid-element casing models.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} an easy-to-use {{configurator}} tool for an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) <b>casing</b> <b>structure.</b> Since {{the emergence of}} computers, numerous design software applications {{have been developed to}} aid with design calculations and to automate the design process. The software used for structural design usually focuses on either of the following: Estimating the structure’s response to loading via some numerical method and then comparing the internal loading to load limits provided by standards. Determining the loading conditions present based on location data and standards. Applications capable of both estimating the loading and then evaluating the structure’s response are rare and usually very product-specific. The loading acting on the ESP <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> was analyzed via the approaches provided in the Eurocodes. These approaches were addressed on such level, that their intricacy meets the requirements of preliminary design phase. A mathematical model of the structure was formulated to suit the selected platform with its complexness and this model was further developed to a finite element model to evaluate the structure’s response to loading via stiffness matrix approach. The mathematical tools for solving the linear systems, such as Cholesky and LU -decompositions, were addressed to provide an overview of the configurator tool’s solving algorithm and it was found, both theoretically and in practice, that Cholesky factorization is drastically more efficient than direct inverse when solving sets of linear equations. The project resulted in a configurator tool for the ESP casing primary support structures, capable of evaluating casing’s loading conditions without excessive knowledge requirements from the user. The tool analyzes the structure’s response to loading and either selects required profiles based on maximum allowed utility ratio or checks the structure’s durability with user-provided profile selections. The tool utilizes finite element method based on beam elements, solves the set of linear equations efficiently and analyzes the utility of the structure based on the requirements set by Eurocodes. The dimensioning results were extensively benchmarked against commercial software with only minute deviation. Additionally, the selections made by the configurator were compared to those made by a structural engineer by looking at old projects. The selections proved to be very similar even when the tool was used with limited knowledge of the design rationale behind the existing products and thus the approach and execution was proven effective...|$|E

The literature appropriate to the casing layer is fully reviewed, including aspects relating to fructification and morphogenesis in A. bisporus, together with an appraisal of the various media employed, their properties and functions, and the commercial significance of the casing layer. Equipment is described for use in experiments in mushroom culture, based on a scaled-down version of normal growing technique, allowing the analysis of both weights and number of fruitbodies forming, which was useful in assessing the effects of different casing treatments. The basic steps in the production of fruitbodies in A. bisporus. are described, including a photographic study of the colonisation of casing and fructification. Various alterations to the physical structure of peat/chalk casing mixtures were found to have an effect on fructification; those causing an opening-out of the <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> tended to give better yields, especially {{in the early stages of}} production.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} reliable simulation methodology that can be applied to predict the impact response of the components made with 3 D textile composites in aero engine applications. Textile composites are excellent candidate materials for the design of aero engine fan containment casings, which are required to sustain the high velocity impact during a fan blade out (FBO) event. This work is focused on a particular form of 3 D woven textile composites, in which reinforcement through the thickness is provided by the interlocking weft or warp yarns. An extensive experimental characterisation was conducted for the composites with four different types of reinforcement. The in-plane mechanical properties under the quasi-static tensile, compressive and shear loadings were obtained. The compressive properties at high strain rate were determined in split Hopkinson pressure bar tests. In additional to that, ballistic impact tests were conducted with these composite materials to study their response to high velocity impact loads. The properties determined in the mechanical tests were employed to specify the input data for a commercially available material model in the finite element (FE) software, LS-DYNA. The model was validated by simulating the ballistic impact tests. Good agreement between the predictions and the experimental results was ensured. Once validated, the material model was applied in a range of parametric studies. Since the plate impact tests cannot fully represent the complexity of the FBO event, effects of the projectile shape, the impact obliquity, the target size and the target curvature on the impact performance were investigated by means of parametric studies. To ease the simulation cost encountered during the modelling of a large <b>casing</b> <b>structure,</b> mixed element type analysis (META) was employed for its FE models, where the computationally costly solid elements were coupled with simpler shell elements.

40|$|State-of-the-art imaging {{technologies}} for monitoring {{the integrity of}} oil and gas well bores are typically limited to inspection of metal casings and cement bond interfaces close to the first casing region. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel well-integrity inspection system that is capable of providing enhanced information about the flaw structure and topology of hydrocarbon producing well bores. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a multi-element electromagnetic (EM) inspection tool that can provide information about material loss in the first and second <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> as well as information about eccentricity between multiple casing strings. Furthermore, the information gathered from the EM inspection tool will be combined with other imaging modalities (e. g. data from an x-ray backscatter imaging device). The independently acquired data are then fused to achieve enhanced accuracy compared to the sum of individual acquired data. A test rig composed of several concentric pipes was assembled and various defect structures in the metal casings were imaged. Initial test results were obtained with a scanning system that includes a transmitting coil and several receiving coils that are mounted on a single rod. A mechanical linear translation stage was used to move the EM sensors in the axial direction during data acquisition. For simplicity, a single sensor and repetitive scans were employed to simulate performance of a sensor array system. The resulting electromagnetic images enable the detection of metal defects that previously have been introduced into the steel pipes. Responses from several sensors were used to assess position and amount of material loss in the first and second metal pipe as well as magnitude of eccentricities between the two pipes. The results from EM measurements and x-ray backscatter simulations demonstrate that data fusion from several sensing modalities can provide an enhanced assessment of flaw structures in producing well bores and potentially allow for early detection of anomalies that if undetected might lead to catastrophic failures...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Fracture of Thermosetting Polymers: Experiments and Modeling. (April 2009) Brad Evin Burgess Department of Aerospace Engineering Texas A&M University Research Advisor: Dr. Amine Benzerga Department of Aerospace Engineering Aircraft are {{becoming}} extremely {{complex in the}} modern age. Fueled by the advent of new technology, a modern plane?s makeup and structure are changing considerably. Recently the idea to utilize a greater amount of composite materials in creating {{the next generation of}} aircraft has surfaced, creating a demand for detailed analysis of these materials. Specifically, the composite fan blade cases on turbofan engines, which protect the greater structure of the aircraft, have come under scrutiny. The cases consist of a carbon fiber resin matrix. The resin can be any {{one of a number of}} epoxies, most germane of which is E 862. This resin has the effect of strengthening the overall <b>casing</b> <b>structure,</b> but the full nature of its use has yet to be acquired. This information would drastically improve the overall understanding of the uses and implications of E 862 in an aerospace environment. During the summer of 2008, extensive tensile testing was conducted on notched E 862 specimens at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. It was discovered that the behavior of E 862 in tension and fracture was drastically affected by the temperature of the specimen as well as the presence of thermal aging. Specifically, the specimens tested at higher temperatures appeared to yield at lower stress levels, and the aged specimens yielded at higher stress levels. While this testing and analysis exposed a number of interesting material parameters and behaviors, more research must be accomplished before a full understanding can be achieved. The specific fracture mechanics of the resin E 862 is a major area of research which must still be considered. This research involves SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces of the test specimens as well as advanced modeling of the fracture using Abacus software and FEM analysis. Once completed, this vital research will serve as a basis through which a more thorough understanding of the fan blade case structure can be gained, and therefore a safer, more structurally sound aircraft will be attainable.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the non-contact measurement of rotor blade vibrations in gas turbines. Specifically, use {{is made of}} internal casing wall pressure, and external casing vibration measurements. Non-contact measurement of gas turbine blade vibrations has made significant progress over recent years; however, there still exist some limitations in the current techniques available. The current dominant non-contact method uses proximity probes to measure blade arrival time, {{to be used for}} blade vibration monitoring. Distinctly with these blade tip timing methods, some of the limitations are: the requirement {{of a large number of}} sensors for each engine stage, difficulties in dealing with multiple excitation frequencies, and sensors being located in the gas path. Alternative techniques are examined here, utilising the unsteady casing wall pressure, and external casing vibration measurements which have the potential to rectify some of these limitations. Simulated internal pressure measurements are used in the proposal of a technique for direct rotor blade vibration amplitude estimation. A novel phase demodulation procedure was developed to obtain the blade vibration amplitude estimates from the simulated internal pressure signal. This demodulation technique has the potential to find further application with phase modulated signals, often present in rotating machinery, where the modulating frequency is higher than the carrier frequency. Although the use of internal pressure measurements showed great potential in the direct measurement of rotor blade vibrations, the use of external sensors outside of the flow path has a more discernible advantage. Thus, the development of the response of the external casing of a gas turbine under the internal pressure forces was undertaken, with the unique response of an axi-symmetric structure under moving loads being presented. Once the response of the <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> is determined, it can then be used in understanding how external casing vibration measurements could be correlated to rotor blade vibrations. It is shown that the stochastic portion of the external casing vibration measurements will contain narrowband peaks located at multiples of shaft speed plus and minus rotor blade natural frequencies. These results, significantly, demonstrated that blade vibration information can be obtained from casing vibration measurements at a single engine running speed...|$|E
40|$|The oil {{industry}} has been exploring and drilling for hydrocarbons for decades, and on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), most of the previously discovered big fields are in their ending phase. The remaining reserves in these fields may require highly complex wells, such as {{high pressure high temperature}} (HPHT) wells, and have not been previously drilled due to operational challenges in such a tight drilling window. Precise estimation of this window is therefore crucial when planning and drilling wells, something that may be done by the means of a carefully calibrated geomechanical model, describing the pressure gradients present in the formation of interest. This thesis involves building a 2 D Tor field specific linear elastic geomechanical model, and describes the work process in order to do so. The 2 D aspect of the model {{is due to the fact}} that several offset wells were utilized in the process of building the model, in the case of using only one well, the model would be 1 D. By using log data, survey data and MWD data to build the initial model in the Predict software, operational observations found in daily drilling reports and suchlike documentation are then used to calibrate the model to coincide with these physical observations. This calibration is a crucial part of the modeling, as it will fine-tune the pressure gradients, resulting in the possibility of drilling a well that was previously thought to be close to impossible. When planning future wells in this area, compressing and decompressing the model to fit the formation depths of the planned well will allow an estimation of the safe drilling window. The initial accuracy is presumed to be high, however the more wells that are added to the model will increase the precision of it and lead to a better model. Based on the drilling window produced by the model, the <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> and the mud design for the planned well can be estimated. Thus, on the basis of this model, with well estimated and reliable pore pressure gradients, fracture pressure gradients and shear failure pressure gradients, wells can be drilled both safely and cost efficient, allowing an optimal hydrocarbon recovery to surface. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{representative}} {{model of}} aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, shaft, <b>casing,</b> flexible support <b>structure</b> and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed {{in such a}} way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e. g. flexible support <b>structure,</b> <b>casing</b> etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books.

Entendendo-se que há uma diferenciação entre a imagem puramente cinematográfica, a televisiva com molduras coincidentes e a televisiva com moldura explícita, e que isso implica diretamente a estruturação narrativa do filme,indaga-se: com que uso representativo o filme trabalha essas questões? Pretende-se estudar a forma como as molduras configuram um jogo de olhares entre televisão e cinema {{reality show}} e filme. As considerações teóricas são ancoradas nos fundamentos da teoria da narrativa aplicada ao cinema nos termos de David Bordwell, Edward Branigan, Christian Metz, André Gaudreault e François Jost; em definições de enunciação, atualização, leitor-modelo e dêiticos discursivos, de acordo com Émile Benveniste, Yuri Lotman e Umberto Eco; na concepção de moldura de Erving Goffman e sua aplicação ao processo de análise de quadros em filmes pelo Groupe &# 956;; no conceito de estrutura de encaixe descrito por Tzvetan Todorov em suas análises de narrativas literárias; e nas ideias expostas por Linda Hutcheon e Denize Araujo sobre intertextualidade. Além disso, a pesquisa é amparada pela ideia do dispositivo enquanto estratégia narrativa em reality shows, {{conforme}} apresentado por Cezar Migliorin, e pelo conceito de index-appeal como estratégia de sentido neste formato, nos termos de Fernando Andacht, incluindo ainda observações de Jeffrey Ruoff sobre a gênese destes programas e reflexões de Ronald Bishop sobre a crítica midiática presente no filme estudadoThe film The Truman Show (Peter Weir, 1998) presents a complex multimidiatic narrative structure. There are scenes {{in which a}} television frame is evident; in other cases, this frame is incorporated by the film s main frame, resulting in two coincident frames that conduct different narrative routes. So, the film presents an elaborated system of media interrelation. We {{understand that there is}} a visible differentiation between the pure cinematographic image, the television incorporated and the television with an explicit frame, and that this {{is directly related to the}} film s narrative structure. The question is: what is the objective of this using of different media inside the film? We intend to study the way the frames configure this interrelation between television and cinema reality show and film. The study is anchored on the narrative theory as presented by David Bordwell, Edward Branigan, Christian Metz, André Gaudreault and François Jost; on concepts like enunciation, actualization, modelreader and deitics, according to Émile Benveniste, Yuri Lotman and Umberto Eco; on the definition of frame by Erving Goffman and its application to the process of frame analysis on films by Groupe &# 956;; on the concept of <b>casing</b> <b>structure</b> by Tzvetan Todorov; and on definitions by Linda Hutcheon and Denize Araujo concerning to inter-textuality. The research is also based on the idea of the dispositive as narrative strategy on reality shows, presented by Cezar Migliorin, and the concept of indexappeal as sense strategy by Fernando Andacht, including observations about the format by Jeffrey Ruoff, and Ronald Bishop s considerations about the media criticism in The Truman Sho...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to assess}} the causes of inefficient and unstable operation of centrifugal compressors and turboexpanders in process gas applications {{in order to provide}} a solution for performance restoration and enhancement. It encompasses thermodynamic and flow evaluations to examine the efficiency and operating range improvement options of new units. Besides, this work is complemented by a technoeconomic analysis to provide a rounded outcome from these studies. In order to achieve the desired objectives, a novel integrated approach has been developed {{to assess the}} design and performance of multi-stage centrifugal compressors. The proposed systematic methodology involves five basic elements including evaluation of compressor selection, compressor sizing and <b>casing</b> <b>structure,</b> performance prediction at the design and off-design conditions, modelling of efficiency and head deterioration causes; and stage design evaluation. This will contribute towards evaluating the geometrical parameters of the new units’ designs at the early preliminary design phase, and thus, will be useful to identify the options for efficiency and operating range enhancements. For installed units, this approach can be implemented to assess the cause of inefficient and unstable operation by assessing the available operation data. A method was developed to predict the performance curve of multi-stage centrifugal compressor based on a stage stacking technique. This approach considers the advantages of Lüdtke and Casey-Robinson methods with an incorporation of a methodology for compressor selection and sizing to generate more accurate results. To emphasize the validity of the developed model, it has been evaluated for both low and high flow coefficient applications. The obtained results show a significant improvement in the estimated efficiency, pressure ratio, shaft power and operating range as compared with the existing methods. The centrifugal compressor is designed to run under various operating conditions and different gas compositions with the primary objective of high efficiency and reliability. Therefore, a new iterative method has been developed to predict the equivalent compressor performance at off-design conditions. This technique uses the performance parameters at design conditions as a reference point to derive the corresponding performance characteristics at numerous suction conditions with less dependency on the geometrical features. Through a case study on a gas transport centrifugal compressor, {{it was found that the}} developed approach can be applied for design evaluation on the expected variation of working conditions, and for the operation diagnosis of installed units as well. Furthermore, a parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effect of gas properties on the stage efficiency, surge margin, and compressor structure. The obtained results support the need for considering the gas properties variation when the off-design performance is derived. To evaluate the impact of internal blockage on the performance parameters, this study proposed an approach to model the effect of non-reactive deposits, which has been qualified using four operation cases and the obtained results are compared with the internal inspection findings from the stage overhauling process. This also covers the influential aspects of flow blockage on the technical and economic values. Since the main challenge here is to analyze the process gas composition in real time, the influences of the non-reactive deposits have been compared with the effect of the unanticipated gas composition change. Subsequently, it has turned out that the pressureratio parameter is not enough to assess the possibility of flow blockage and unexpected gas properties change. Moreover, it was observed that the stage discharge pressure was more sensitive to the fouled aftercooler comparing with suction and internal blockage. However, the effect of contaminated aftercooler on the surge point and discharge pressure and temperature of the upstream stage was found greater than its impact on the shaft power. Thus, a substantial surge margin reduction was detected when the first stage was operating with a fouled aftercooler comparing with the measured reduction as a result of unanticipated gas properties change. Furthermore, a larger pressure ratio drop was measured in the case of liquid carryover which revealed a more significant impact of the two phases densities difference comparing with the gas volume fraction (GVF) effect. The possibility of hydrate formation has been assessed using hydrate formation temperature (HFT) criteria. Additionally, this research highlights a number of challenges facing the selection of typical centrifugal stage design by assessing the contribution of design characteristics on the operating efficiency and stable flow range. Besides, an empirical-based-model was established to select the optimum impeller and diffuser configurations in order to make a compromise decision based on technical and economic perspective. It was concluded that there is no absolute answer to the question of optimum rotor and stator configuration. The preliminary aerothermodynamic evaluation exposed that the selection of the optimum impeller structure is governed by several variables: stage efficiency, pressure loss coefficient, manufacturing cost, required power cost, resonance frequency and stable operating range. Hence, an evaluation is required to compromise between these parameters to ensure better performance. Furthermore, it was argued throughout this study that the decision-making process of the typical stage geometrical features has to be based upon the long-term economic performance optimization. Thus, for higher long-term economic performance, it is not sufficient to select the characteristics of the impeller and diffuser geometry based on the low manufacturing cost or efficiency improvement criterion only. For turboexpanders, a simple and low cost tool has been developed to determine the optimum turboexpander characteristics by analysing the generated design alternatives. This approach was used in designing a turboexpander for hydrocarbon liquefaction process. Moreover, since the turboexpanders are expected to run continuously at severe gas conditions, the performance of the selected turboexpander was evaluated at different inlet flow rates and gas temperatures. It has turned out that designing a turboexpander with the maximum isentropic efficiency is not always possible due to the limitations of the aerodynamic parameters for each component. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the stage geometrical features prior the construction process to compromise between the high capital cost and the high energetic efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Pear-shaped casing swage (PCS) repair {{technology}} is highly efficient in repairing deformed casing {{and the value}} of repairing force is a very important parameter for designing and optimizing the <b>casing</b> swage and <b>structure</b> parameters. A new three-dimensional simulation analysis of casing swage in the well and the finite element analysis (FEA) model of 7 ′′ API deformed casing and PCS are established based on the elastic-plastic mechanics, the finite element theory, and application of numerical simulation analysis for the actual process of repairing deformed casing.

40|$|Proof-mass {{actuators}} {{are typically}} used to supply an external control force to a structure,for {{the purpose of}} vibration suppression. These devices comprise a proof-mass suspended in a magnetic field that is accelerated {{in order to provide}} a reaction force on the actuator <b>casing</b> and the <b>structure</b> itself. If the actuator stroke length is reached or exceeded, the proof-mass will hit the end stops, resulting in a nonlinear phenomenon known as stroke saturation. In this paper, a theoretical and experimental investigation into the actuator’s dynamical behaviour is undertaken. First, the blocked inertial force of the actuator in response to an input voltage was measured experimentally using a variety of excitation amplitudes and frequencies. An analysis was conducted in the time- and frequency-domains, and the first-order force-voltage FRF of the actuator was ascertained for each excitation amplitude. The information provided by the analysis was then used to estimate the parameters for a linear piecewise stiffness model of the actuator, in order to simulate the time-domain response. Finally, a comparison of the simulated and measured signals is conducted to establish the accuracy of the model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConsideration {{is given}} to a very {{specific}} interaction phenomenon that may occur in turbomachines due to radial rub between a bladed disk and surrounding <b>casing.</b> These two <b>structures,</b> featuring rotational periodicity and axi-symmetry respectively, share {{the same type of}} eigenshapes, also termed nd-nodal diameter traveling waves. Higher efficiency requirements leading to reduced clearance between blade-tips and casing together with the rotation of the blade disk increase the possibility of interaction between these traveling waves through direct contact. By definition, large amplitudes as well as structural failure may be expected. A very simple two-dimensional model of outer casing and bladed disk is introduced in order to predict the occurrence of such phenomenon in terms of rotational velocity. In order to consider traveling wave motions, each structure is represented by its two $n_d$-nodal diameter standing modes. Equations of motion are solved first using an explicit time integration scheme in conjunction with the Lagrange multiplier method which accounts for the contact constraints, and then by the Harmonic Balance Method. While both methods yield identical results that exhibit two distinct zones of completely different behaviours of the system, HBM is much less computationally expensive...|$|R
