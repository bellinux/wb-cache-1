5000|$|The [...] "Great Shoe Spill of 1990" [...] {{was one of}} {{the several}} {{occasions}} when shipping accidents have contributed to the knowledge of ocean currents and aided scientists and amateur researchers in their endeavours. After hearing of the accident, oceanic scientist Curtis Ebbesmeyer seized the opportunity: He established links with beachcombers and formed a network of people reporting the landfall of the contents of this and other spills. Using OSCURS (Ocean Surface Currents Simulation), a <b>computer</b> <b>simulator</b> developed by oceanographer Jim Ingraham, Ebbesmeyer tracked the oceanic movement of the Hansa Carrier spill and other flotsam, including 34,000 ice hockey gloves washed off the Hyundai Seattle in 1994. In the case of the Hansa Carrier spill, reports from beachcombers revealed that the first 200 shoes started arriving at the northern Washington coast around Thanksgiving 1990, about 6 months after the spill. Beachcomber finds in January-February 1991 off Vancouver Island and in March 1991 in Queen Charlotte Sound showed that the aggregate mass of shoes next floated northward with the winter Davidson Current. The normal spring wind transition from southerly winds of winter to northerly winds of summer off the Pacific northwest coast must have occurred at the end of March 1991, because the next batch of recoveries was reported to the south off Oregon in April and May, indicating that a sharp reversal of currents had moved the flotilla to the south.|$|E

Method: Study was a quasi-experimental study conducted with 106 nursing students.

Theoretical lectures and video presentations on IV injections were given to both groups. Each group went through the training practice using the IV arm or <b>computer</b> <b>simulator.</b> After the completion of training, questionnaires were given to the students to evaluate their learning attitudes and experiences, self-confidence in IV injection, and satisfaction with the training materials. Results: Student satisfaction with the training materials including the reality, usefulness, and educational effects showed notable differences between the two groups with the <b>Computer</b> <b>Simulator</b> group reporting more positive effects that the IV Arm group.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a quantum <b>computer</b> <b>simulator</b> with a web interface based on the circuit model of quantum computation [3]. This is the standard model for which most quantum algorithms have been developed. Quan-tum algorithms are expressed as circuits of quantum registers (series of qubits) and quantum gates operating on them. Each quantum gate is a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space determined by the quantum register. The quantum <b>computer</b> <b>simulator</b> is developed in Python, using some extra libraries for our purposes. The fundamental library that is used is Numpy: the package for scientific computing with Python. Because of the limitations of GUI for a large number of qubits, we propose an another version of quantum <b>computer</b> <b>simulator</b> without a user interface, which could simulate quantum computations for larger inputs. The inputs of the simula-tor are the number of qubits, the number of computation steps, the initial state of quantum register and the gates that applied at each step.
