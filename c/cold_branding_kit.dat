40|$|Hot {{branding}} {{has been}} used for many years by researchers to identify seals from a long distance. In livestock, <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> has been proposed as an alternative because it is thought to be less painful. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the healing process of hot and <b>cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied to harbour seal pups (Phoca vitulina). A total of 306 animals was branded with a unique set of four characters: three applied for 3 - 5 s with an iron heated to 500 degrees C, and one applied for either 10 or 20 s with an iron frozen to - 175 degrees C. At three subsequent times over 10 weeks, 43, 41 and 51 animals, respectively, were recaptured, the macroscopic appearance of their brands recorded, and biopsies taken for microscopic examination. <b>Cold</b> <b>brands</b> had a faster healing rate than hot brands. However, they resulted in less destruction of hair follicles, and <b>cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied for 20 s caused more depigmentation. Regrowth of hair follicles could subsequently obscure brands, while depigmentation reduces the contrast between the brand and the surrounding fur. <b>Cold</b> <b>brands</b> applied for 20 s also caused more extensive deep vascular damage, which subsequently may have resulted in deeper wounds in some of these brands. Yet, macroscopically, other <b>cold</b> <b>brands,</b> or portions thereof, were almost invisible. On the basis of this short-term study, the technique of <b>cold</b> <b>branding</b> that we used in harbour seals does not appear to be as reliable as that of hot branding to provide permanent legible brands. ...|$|R

It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved or otherwise oppressed person.

40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{draws from}} phenomenological inductive reasoning and syllogisms, {{as a basis}} for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis. It highlights a global phenomenon – which transcends national and cultural boundaries. De facto: sports participation and support necessitate that uniforms distinguish and identify associated parties. As a basic premise, uniform ownership suggests exclusivity and encouraged competition. However, now <b>branded</b> <b>kit,</b> teams, athletes and sponsors are entering symbiotic brand relationships – where they actively seek publics, open to multiple adopted national global identities. Significantly, consumers are choosing to wear sporting merchandise, from an 'other' nation, or region – whom they have no primary affiliation with. Rather, they are governed by a sharing of emotional and psychographic criteria, housed within a complex network of ascribed meaning towards brands. In short, sports uniform no longer demands restrictive monogamous loyalty. This draws consumers towards embracing temporal identities, culminating in an adopted national identity – termed surrogacy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} how Multinational Corporations (MNCs) manage crises that can potentially damage their global reputation in an interconnected world. Design/Method/Approach: A Case study approach was used to examine Nestle’s response to the campaign launched by Greenpeace International in 2010 against its chocolate <b>brand</b> <b>Kit</b> Kat and its sustainable practices in Indonesia; and Benetton Group’s response to the garment factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2013. Findings: The findings show commonality in both crises’ lifecycle patterns and stages of development, and explain how crisis management strategies deployed by both organisations contributed to the ways in which the crises were represented in the public arena. Two MNC response patterns were identified from the cases - lack of understanding of the integrated and international nature of news and social media and its power to influence public opinion, and poor choices in the deployment of crisis communication strategies. While these cases are not generalizable, they call on MNCs to reflect on their communication practices and consider the role of issue management as a long term cost effective measure to protect global reputation in a mediated world...|$|R
