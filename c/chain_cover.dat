Fuel economy is approximately 45 mpg city and 50 mpg highway. The update included new 'reverse cone' chrome silencers, a new design of cast alloy wheels, adjustable clutch and front brake levers {{and a new}} all black engine finish with chromed covers. The chrome <b>chain</b> <b>cover,</b> pillion footrest hanger and upper fork shrouds were restyled and a more comfortable pillion seat fitted.|$|E
50|$|For the 1992 model year, the 4.3L had its {{block design}} {{modified}} {{to allow a}} balance shaft to be installed. Even though the 4.3L is an even fire V6, the 90-degree block layout is not ideal for smoothness. The balance shaft on the 4.3L is installed above the top timing gear, and runs through {{the top of the}} lifter valley. It is gear driven off the timing chain, and therefore a new timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s. Balance shaft engines do not have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump unlike the non-balance shaft motors which retained the cast in boss.|$|E

5000|$|Later {{versions}} of the 2AZ-FE engine were upgraded with 9.8:1 compression ratio, a slightly more aggressive intake cam profile, 6500 rpm red line, and piston oil squirters. These later versions are rated at [...] in the Scion tC, [...] in the Rav4, and [...] in the Camry, Corolla XRS, and Scion xB. However, these latter 2AZ-FE models {{were the first to}} be rated under the new SAE J1349 standard. The new standard usually produces more conservative numbers, though no definitive comparison is available since the two versions were never tested by the same standard.The Rav 4 uses a different timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> than the Camry, they can however be interchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The small-block {{engine that}} was {{identified}} as the Windsor engine {{was introduced in the}} 1962 Ford Fairlane. Displacing 221 cuin L, it was designed to save weight, using thin-wall casting with a block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover,</b> which differentiates it from the later 335-series Cleveland engines that use an integrated timing cover. All Windsor engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with [...] "2V" [...] and [...] "4V" [...] designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use straight six-bolt valve covers. Coolant is routed into the block by the intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of coolant flowing through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the coolant to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated timing chain housing. The timing chain housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|E

50|$|Harmonic Balancer - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a harmonic balancer pulley which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003 which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the harmonic balancer pulley {{can be compared to}} those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.|$|E
50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and {{cylinder}} head bolt pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very different internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the radiator hose locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the radiator hose connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the cam timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover.</b> The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts. All of the 335 series engines differ from the Windsor engines by having a roughly 2-inch extension {{at the front of}} the block which forms an integrated timing cover casting.|$|E
5000|$|Alfa Romeo's Twin Spark {{technology}} used dual ignition to fire two spark plugs in the cylinder head of each piston bore and {{was first used}} in the A.L.F.A. Grand Prix car of 1914. Racing versions of the Giulia engine, including the engine used in the GTA, featured a cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder. Twin Spark versions of the Twin Cam were also developed for 1750 and 2000 models used for racing. In 1987 the model 75 was fitted with a Twin Spark head, which provided improved fuel ignition and allowed an improved combustion chamber shape with narrower angle between intake and exhaust valve. Although developed from the Twin Cam, few if any parts are interchangeable between Twin Spark engines and Twin Cams. For instance, while Twin Cams have six oilways leading to the cylinder head the Twin Sparks only have two, the timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> is narrowed and the included angle between the valves is down to a 46Â°. The Twin Spark engine in the 75 also employed Alfa's variatore di fase VVT system which, when combined with electronic fuel injection, gave a power output of [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing <b>chain</b> <b>cover.</b> The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the pistonâs oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|E
40|$|In this work, a vibro-acoustic {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} analysis {{was carried out}} for the <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> of a low powered four-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine, belonging to the FPT (FCA Power Train) family called SDE (Small Diesel Engine). By applying a methodology used in the acoustic optimization of new FPT engine components, firstly a finite element model (FEM) of the engine was defined, then a vibration analysis was performed for the whole engine (modal analysis), and finally a forced response analysis was developed for the only <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> (separated from the overall engine). The boundary conditions applied to the <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> were the accelerations experimentally measured by accelerometers located at the points of connection among <b>chain</b> <b>cover,</b> head cover, and crankcase. Subsequently, a boundary element (BE) model of the only <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> was realized to determine the <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> noise emission, starting from the previously calculated structural vibrations.

40|$|A {{bipartite graph}} G=(U,V,E) is convex if the {{vertices}} in V can be linearly ordered such that for each vertex uâ U, the neighbors of u are consecutive in the ordering of V. An induced matching H of G is a matching such that no edge of E connects endpoints {{of two different}} edges of H. We show that in a convex bipartite graph with n vertices and m weighted edges, an induced matching of maximum total weight can be computed in O(n+m) time. An unweighted convex bipartite graph has a representation of size O(n) that records for each vertex uâ U {{the first and last}} neighbor in the ordering of V. Given such a compact representation, we compute an induced matching of maximum cardinality in O(n) time. In convex bipartite graphs, maximum-cardinality induced matchings are dual to minimum chain covers. A <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> is a covering of the edge set by chain subgraphs, that is, subgraphs that do not contain induced matchings of more than one edge. Given a compact representation, we compute a representation of a minimum <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> in O(n) time. If no compact representation is given, the cover can be computed in O(n+m) time. All of our algorithms achieve optimal running time for the respective problem and model.

The chips are fabricated in a 0. 1 Âµm GaAs metamorphic high electron-mobility transistor process. The -band frequency doubler <b>chain</b> <b>covers</b> 110 to 130 GHz with peak output power of 5 dBm. The chip requires 2 dBm input power and consumes only 65 mWof dc power. The signal at {{the fundamental frequency}} is suppressed more than 25 dB compared to the desired output signal over the band of interest. The -band frequency sextupler (x 6) <b>chain</b> <b>covers</b> 155 to 195 GHz with 0 dBm peak output power and requires 6. 5 dBm input power and 92. 5 mWdc power.
