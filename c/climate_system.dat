5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the <b>climate</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} if and how indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems</b> {{are important}} for passive house certification. The research subjects are passive houses in Belgium, occupied by owner-clients. These have received a quality assurance certificate from an independent organization. Through interviews with the owners, and on-site analysis of indoor climate installations in passive houses, the selection of indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems</b> for passive houses was analyzed and insights were obtained in changes occurring after certification. Also, two houses were analyzed during further visits, including interviews and measurements, to allow detailed performance evaluation of the indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems.</b> The paper concludes that adaptation of certification procedures is recommended, by looking {{more closely at the}} practical implementation of indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems.</b> The paper further questions the general validity of the scientific basis of the passive house definition. ...|$|R

5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and <b>climate</b> <b>system,</b> to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's <b>climate</b> <b>system.</b> The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> {{may have}} a natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{development}} of a high performance <b>climate</b> modeling <b>system</b> {{as an example of the}} application of Grid based technology to climate modeling. The <b>climate</b> simulation <b>system</b> at Argonne currently includes a scientific modeling interface (Espresso) written in Java which incorporates Globus middleware to facilitate climate simulations on the Grid.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of forcings imposed on it, the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> will still show {{internal}} variability (see images opposite). This internal variability {{is a result of}} complex interactions between components of the <b>climate</b> <b>system,</b> such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean (see also the later section on Internal climate variability and global warming). An example of internal variability is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.|$|E
25|$|An abrupt {{climate change}} {{occurs when the}} <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> is forced to {{transition}} to a new climate state {{at a rate that}} is determined by the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing. Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime. One proposed reason for the observed abrupt climate change is that feedback loops within the <b>climate</b> <b>system</b> both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states.|$|E

5000|$|The Trewartha climate {{classification}} is a <b>climate</b> classification <b>system</b> {{published by}} American geographer Glenn Thomas Trewartha in 1966, and updated in 1980.

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} of <b>climate</b> control <b>systems</b> {{is important in}} order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of their climate control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> control <b>system</b> {{as a function of the}} system’s settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the <b>climate</b> control <b>system’s</b> settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the <b>climate</b> control <b>system.</b> The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent...|$|R

40|$|According to the definition, passive {{houses in}} Europe meet a target energy demand for heating {{of less than}} 15 kWh per square meter and per year. This low level for the heating demand is based on heating by a small post-heater in the {{hygienic}} ventilation system at 52 0 C maximum, while the ventilation system can be dimensioned purely for ventilation purposes. In theory thus the installed heating power is less than approximately 10 Watts/m 2. But what happens in practice? The practical realization can {{be different from the}} definition and user experiences with indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems</b> for passive houses may require further adaptations. Belgian example projects and the indoor <b>climate</b> <b>systems</b> in winter and in summer were studied. The study includes inspection of technical details and interviews with occupants of some passive houses in Belgium. The results illustrate the concerns of occupants considering winter and summer comfort in especially bedrooms, low air humidity creating respiratory problems and complex control of installations including temperature control. The research shows that occupants tend to prefer new adapted types of post-heating. Also, a good realization of (passive) cooling techniques is a very important issue in passive houses.
