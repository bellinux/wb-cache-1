5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to <b>conical</b> <b>shaped</b> corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E

25|$|Castletown House & The Wonderful Barn. Located off {{the main}} street of nearby Celbridge, Castletown House is the first grand Palladian House in Ireland – the design of the {{building}} led to the construction of Leinster House and from thence to the White House in Washington, D.C.. Begun in 1722 by Speaker William Conolly (1662–1729), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, the lands and the house itself lie in Celbridge, however there is also an entrance from Leixlip, hence there are two modern housing estates bearing the Castletown name, one in each town. To mark the eastern vista of Castletown a <b>conical</b> <b>shaped</b> building – The Wonderful Barn – was constructed in 1743 with the stairs ascending around the exterior of the building.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{women in}} Yemen {{traditionally}} wore branched pantaloons beneath their long black tunics. The pantaloons were usually {{made of a}} jet-black color, tapering close to their ankles, and decorated at the lower seams with a fine embroidered stitch of silver. The tunic served as, both, a dress and long-sleeved blouse, all in one piece. In addition, all young girls wore a black, <b>conical</b> <b>shaped</b> hat upon their heads, which took {{the place of a}} scarf. These hats were called in the local vernacular, gargoush, and were also decorated with an embroidered sash about its borders, besides being equipped with tapering flaps that extended down to the ears and to the nape of the neck. Older women in Sana'a would wear a broad veil-like scarf over their heads, called maswan, especially when going out in public places, and which was traditionally worn above the closer fitting scarves that covered their hair. All women were adorned with black slippers when walking in public places, and only very small girls would walk barefoot.|$|E

500|$|It was usual to use {{the thighs}} of frogs for the battery construction. [...] The legs of the frog were first skinned, then the lower leg was cut off at the knee joint and discarded. [...] Damaging the muscle during this {{procedure}} would detract from the results. [...] The thigh muscle was then cut in two transversely to produce two half-thighs. [...] Only the lower, <b>conical</b> <b>shaped</b> piece was kept. [...] The half-thighs were then laid on an insulator of varnished wood so arranged that the inside surface of one was {{in contact with the}} outside surface of the next, with the conical ends of the outside surface being pushed into the cavity of the cut surface.

60|$|The shaft, {{it will be}} remembered, has {{to sustain}} the same weight as the long piece of wall which was {{concentrated}} into the shaft; it is enabled to do this both by its better form and better knit materials; and it can carry a greater weight than the space {{at the top of}} it is adapted to receive. The first point, therefore, is to expand this space as far as possible, and that in a form more convenient than the circle for the adjustment of the stones above. In general the square is a more convenient form than any other; but the hexagon or octagon is sometimes better fitted for masses of work which divide in six or eight directions. Then our first impulse would be to put a square or hexagonal stone {{on the top of the}} shaft, projecting as far beyond it as might be safely ventured; as at a, Fig. XX. This is the abacus. Our next idea would be to put a <b>conical</b> <b>shaped</b> stone beneath this abacus, to support its outer edge, as at b. This is the bell.|$|E
