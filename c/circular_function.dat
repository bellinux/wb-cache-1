Constructive non-specular wave scattering permits the scattering angle to be other than twice that of incidence and can result in gross violations of the law of reflection. Hence significant fraction of the phase space becomes accessible. A wide range of novel reflective behaviors ensues; including the phenomenon of negative reflection were energy transport remains {{on the same side of}} the normal. Also, at a critical incidence coherent superposition can force both the transmitted and reflected waves to graze the scattering surface thus synergistically reinforcing the diffractive process in a behavior reminiscent of critical internal reflection of ray optics. We experimentally demonstrate the concept with measurements on a one-dimensionally periodic system (grating) where the scattering angle is shown to be an inverse <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> of a function that depends on the diffractive index and the two angles.

40|$|Abstract In {{decision}} tree models, considerable attention has beenpaid {{on the effect}} of symmetry on computational complexity. That is, for a permutation group Γ, how low can thecomplexity be for any boolean function invariant under Γ? In this paper we investigate this question for quantum de-cision trees for graph properties, directed graph properties, and circular functions. In particular, we prove that the n-vertex Scorpion graph property has quantum query complexity Θ (n 1 / 2), which implies that the minimum quantumcomplexity for graph properties is strictly less than that for monotone graph properties (known to be Ω (n 2 / 3)). Adirected graph property, S INK, is also shown to have the Θ (n 1 / 2) quantum query complexity. Furthermore, we givean N-ary <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> which has the quantum querycomplexity Θ (N 1 / 4). Finally, we show that for any per-mutation group Γ, as long as Γ is transitive, the quantum query complexity of any function invariant to Γ is at leastΩ (N 1 / 4), which implies that our examples are (almost) thebest ones in the sense of pinning down the complexity for the corresponding permutation group...|$|E

Sport activity is frequently associated with changes in both LV and arterial functions. This study aimed to find correlations between three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived segmental LV deformation parameters and echocardiographically assessed aortic stiffness index (ASI) in athletes. This study comprised 26 young elite athletes (mean age: 26. 7  ±  8. 4 years, nine men). Results Among segmental circumferential strains (CSs), only that of apical anterior (r[*]=[*] 0. 40, p[*]=[*] 0. 05), septal (r[*]=[*] 0. 47, p[*]=[*] 0. 01), inferior (r[*]=[*] 0. 59, p[*]=[*] 0. 001), lateral (r[*]=[*] 0. 44, p <  0. 05), and midventricular anteroseptal (r[*]=[*] 0. 44, p <  0. 05) segments correlated with ASI, whereas LV-CS of the midventricular anterior segment showed a correlation tendency. Only longitudinal strain of basal anteroseptal (r[*]=[*]− 0. 46, p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and inferoseptal (r[*]=[*]− 0. 57, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) segments showed correlations with ASI, whereas that of the basal anterior segment had only a tendency to correlate. Some segmental multidirectional strains also correlated with ASI. Conclusions Correlations could be demonstrated between increased aortic stiffness and <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> of the apical and midventricular LV fibers and longitudinal motion of the basal septum and LV anterior wall (part of LV outflow tract) in maintaining circulation in the elite athletes...|$|E

Different types of mathematical models have been evolved over the years but still a lot needs to be done. The regulatory function of genes can be modeled mathematically by using various types of polynomials and also by changing its degree, one can conclude whether increase {{of the degree of}} polynomial has any impact on predicate value.

40|$|In this paper, a novel tactile {{photoelastic}} transducer {{for normal}} forces is presented. When a normal input force profile {{is applied to}} the transduction medium, stress is generated in the photoelastic layer making it birefringent. Consequently, circularly-polarized input light becomes elliptically polarized at the output due to the introduction of a phase-lead distribution. If a circular-reflection polaridoscope is used, the output light-intensity is a <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> of the total phase-lead distribution. The first part of the paper describes the forward analysis of the transducer using finite-element analysis to determine the stress distribution in the transducer. Then, the phase-lead distribution is determined using the theory of photoelasticity. The second part of the paper describes a technique for the recovery of the phase-lead distribution from the ideal noise-free light-intensity distribution. Also, a verification method is proposed to determine whether a recovered phase-lead distribution is the correct one or not. In the third part of the paper, we consider the non-ideal situation, where the light-intensity distribution is no longer noise-free. Quantization errors added to the detected light-intensity distribution are also considered. Recovering the phase-lead distribution under noisy conditions constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. An algorithm that accurately and effectively determines the phase-lead distribution from a noisy light-intensity distribution is presented. The inverse-tactile problem is solved using an optimization function. 1...|$|E

40|$|The work {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} the strength of mild steel fillet welds subject to static loading, and the behaviour of flange welded beam-column connections under combined bending and shear. Tests are conducted on short welds in the as-welded and stress relieved conditions, and also on full-size beam-column connections. It is shown that welds under compression have a lower strength than when under tension. Failure of the fillet weld is initiated at the weld root, the important factor controlling the initiation being weld ductility. The greater the residual stress, the lower the weld ductility and ultimate strength. Thermal stress relieving increases strength by as much as 30 %. Weld failure plane is rarely at the throat and varies from 0 ° to 45 ° depending upon loading condition. Failure plane average stresses are related by a <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> which is expressed in terms of externally applied forces at limit state. The tension weld of a flange-welded beam-column connection always fails before the compression weld. The shear load sharing between the welds is a complex function of elastic compression of the web, elastic/plastic deformation of the flanges, load/deformation characteristics, and the type of load application. Bearing forces between the compression flange and column face produce low level bearing stresses and frictional forces which make a negligible contribution to shear load resistance. Three modes of connection failure are possible; 'end mode', 'bending mode' and 'shear mode', with a sudden change taking place between the two latter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} use of partial-order program clauses and lattice domains for {{declarative}} programming. This paradigm is particularly useful for expressing concise solutions to problems from graph theory, program analysis, and database querying. These applications are characterized by a need to solve circular constraints and perform aggregate operations, a capability that is very clearly and efficiently provided by partial-order clauses. We present a novel approach to their declarative and operational semantics, {{as well as the}} correctness of the operational semantics. The declarative semantics is model-theoretic in nature, but the least model for any function is not the classical intersection of all models, but the greatest lower bound/least upper bound of the respective terms defined for this function in the different models. The operational semantics combines top-down goal reduction with memo-tables. In the partial-order programming framework, however, memoization is primarily needed in order to detect circular <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> calls. In general we need more than simple memoization when functions are defined circularly in terms of one another through monotonic functions. In such cases, we accumulate a set of functional-constraints and solve them by general fixed-point-finding procedure. In order to prove the correctness of memoization, a straightforward induction on the length of the derivation will not suffice {{because of the presence of}} the memo-table. However, since the entries in the table grow monotonically, we identify a suitable table invariant that captures the correctness of the derivation. The partial-order programming paradigm has been implemented and all examples shown in this paper have been tested using this implementation...|$|E

The adopted material is a semicrystalline network based on poly(ε-caprolactone) crosslinked by thermal curing; the material was adopted due to its fast recovery process when heated close to the melting temperature and the high recovery degree, and, due to its good biocompatibility, it may suitable for biomedical application. The original, or “permanent”, material shape {{is that of a}} cylindrical annulus, which is set in a “temporary” configuration as a six spikes star. The temporary shape is fixed through a thermo-mechanical program, involving deformation above melting temperature and cooling under fixed strain and carried out by means of an ad-hoc designed fixture. By heating the deformed specimen above the melting temperature, the system is able to recover the original cylindrical shape realizing a motion and a mechanical power. This peculiar response, consisting in a progressive radial expansion activated by temperature, may be considered for application as self-expanding stenting device triggered by the human body temperature. The shape of the system, that changes during the transformation, can be described as a two dimensional temporal function that represents the mean line of the section of the cylindrical annulus (perpendicular to the height of the annulus). This temporal function is a combination of a <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> and of a modified rhodoneal function and, after a proper calibration through experimental tests, is used to evaluate the kinematics of the system.
