40|$|Haloperidol {{inhibited}} dopamine (DA) mediated behaviours and induced pronounced catalepsy in rodents. Metoclopramide, sulpiride, sultopride, tiapride and <b>clebopride,</b> in general, also inhibited these behaviours {{but only}} <b>clebopride</b> induced marked catalepsy. Haloperidol displaced 3 H-haloperidol and 3 H-spiperone from striatal binding sites and inhibited DA stimulated cyclase from striatal and mesolimbic regions. In general, substituted benzamide drugs displaced labelled ligands, {{but did not}} inhibit adenylate cyclase. Elevations of striatal HVA produced by haloperidol and sulpiride, but not other benzamide drugs, were partially reversed by atropine. Hypophysectomy did not prevent the elevation of forebrain HVA produced by sulpiride and metoclopramide. Substituted benzamide drugs appear to act on cerebral DA receptors that are independent of DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase and are not balance by a cholinergic input...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clebopride,</b> a new benzamide derivative, has, {{in common}} with the other members of this group, {{antidopaminergic}} activity. In animals, its therapeutic ratio is superior to that of metoclopramide at doses free of side effects associated with hyperprolactinemia and extrapyramidal symptoms. The present study was designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced histologically-proven cancer, treated with cisplatin at a dose of greater than 50 mg/m 2. Most of them were pretreated and refractory to standard antiemetics. <b>Clebopride</b> was started at a dosage of 0. 10 mg/kg in a group of 6 patients and escalated by 0. 2 mg at each dose level. A total of 30 patients were included. Side effects include somnolence, diarrhea and extrapyramidal-like symptoms. The latter occurred at almost all dose levels in 14 % of the cycles and limited continuation of the study. Activity in this group of patients was encouraging but, considering the rate of extrapyramidal symptoms, further dose escalation is not indicated and activity at lower, nontoxic levels should be investigated.

40|$|A {{histidine}} residue (His(394)) that {{is likely}} to be located in the ligand-binding region of the D- 2 dopamine receptor has been mutated to a leucine (Leu(394)), and the properties of the mutant receptor have been determined. For a range of antagonists the mutation has only a minor effect on the affinity of the receptor for the antagonist. The mutation does, however, elicit a structurally specific effect on the affinity with which certain members of the substituted benzamide class of antagonist bind to the receptor. Some of these drugs, e. g., sulpiride, sultopride, and tiapride, bind with reduced affinity to the mutated receptor, whereas others, e. g., <b>clebopride</b> and metoclopramide, bind with increased affinity. However, the Na+/H+ sensitivity of the binding of sulpiride to the receptor is not reduced by the mutation. These findings have been interpreted in terms of the productive or unfavourable interaction of the His(394) residue with these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Cisapride is a {{substituted}} benzamide {{compound that}} stimulates motor activity in {{all segments of}} the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing the release of acetylcholine from the enteric nervous system. Cisapride is administered orally {{in the treatment of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndromes and chronic constipation. In gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in both adults and children, cisapride provides symptomatic improvement and mucosal healing. Long term treatment with cisapride is effective in the prevention of relapse of oesophagitis. Cisapride improves gastric emptying rates and improves symptoms in patients with gastroparesis of various origins. Unlike domperidone and metoclopramide, long term administration of cisapride seems to result in persistently enhanced gastric emptying. Cisapride is also effective in improving symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. In comparative studies in patients with functional dyspepsia, cisapride was at least as effective as metoclopramide, domperidone, <b>clebopride,</b> ranitidine and cimetidine. Cisapride increases stool frequency and reduces laxative consumption in patients with idiopathic constipation. Severe cases of slow transit constipation seem refractory to cisapride. Clinical studies also indicate that cisapride might be effective in the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, postoperative ileus, peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. Further clinical studies are warranted to define the role of cisapride in these conditions. The dosage of cisapride ranges from 5 mg 3 times daily to 20 mg twice daily. Cisapride is generally well tolerated, both during short and long term treatment. In children, cisapride is also well tolerated in doses of 0. 2 to 0. 3 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times daily.
