50|$|The {{traditional}} leche merengada, a cold cinnamon- and lemon- flavored meringue; and horchata de <b>chufa,</b> horchatas made of chufas original {{from the}} Valencian Community, are popular nonalcoholic beverages.|$|E
50|$|Cyperus eragrostis is {{a species}} of sedge known by several common names, {{including}} tall flatsedge, nutgrass, tall nutgrass, umbrella sedge, <b>chufa,</b> Earth almond, zula nuts, edible galingale and pale galingale.|$|E
5000|$|Horchata ( [...] ; [...] ), or orxata (Valencian pronunciation|oɾˈʃata), is {{the name}} of several kinds of beverages, made of ground almonds, sesame seeds, rice, barley, tigernuts (<b>chufas),</b> or melon seeds.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., Horchata de Arroz (morro horchata) {{is served}} in many Latin restaurants, whereas the horchata de <b>chufas</b> (tigernut) is {{virtually}} unknown. Rice-based horchata is also sometimes available in U.S. grocery and convenience stores.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the actual methods of harvest of fruits and {{vegetables}} in Spain is made. Special emphasis is given to the main horticultural Spanish crops that can be harvested by machines like green, beans, green peas broad beans, tomatoes, lettuces and <b>chufas,</b> as vegetables, and olives almonds, cherries, apples pears apricots, etc. as fruits...|$|R
50|$|Horchata, is a {{drink that}} {{originated}} in Spain out of <b>chufa</b> nuts and sugar. The drink was later {{introduced to the}} Caribbean and Latin America. Almost every Latin country has its version.|$|E
50|$|In <b>chufa</b> (tiger nut, Cyperus esculentus) {{and sugar}} beet the {{predominant}} diferulic acids are 8-O-4'-DiFA and 8,5'-DiFA respectively. 8-5' Non cyclic diferulic acid {{has been identified}} to be covalently linked to carbohydrate moieties of the arabinogalactan-protein fraction of gum arabic.|$|E
50|$|According to the Consejo Regulador de <b>Chufa</b> de Valencia (Regulating Council for Valencia's Tiger Nuts), the {{nutritional}} composition/100 ml of the Spanish beverage horchata de chufas is as follows: energy content around 66 kcal, proteins around 0.5 g, carbohydrates over 10 g with starch at least 1.9 g, fats at least 2 g.|$|E
50|$|Planting is {{normally}} done on flat soils where ridges to favour the coming irrigations have previously been done. The separation between ridges is approximately 60 cm and seeds are planted manually. Distances between seeds may vary from 15 to 20 cm and seeding depth is around 8 cm. A typical seeding rate for <b>chufa</b> is about 120 kg of tubers/ha (107 lbs/acre).|$|E
50|$|The flood plains also grow {{foods for}} the {{wildlife}} that need marshlands to grow. These plants include smartweed, millet, <b>chufa,</b> bulrush, and sedge. These marshlands begin dry, and are burned or turned over {{before they are}} flooded {{in order to produce}} fresh soil for the new plants.  They are then flooded to become the breeding grounds for these marsh plants.|$|E
50|$|Cyperus esculentus can {{be found}} wild, as a weed, or as a crop. Evidence exists for its {{cultivation}} in Egypt since the sixth millennium BC, and for several centuries in Southern Europe. In Spain, C. esculentus is cultivated for its edible tubers, called earth almonds or tiger nuts, for the preparation of horchata de <b>chufa,</b> a sweet, milk-like beverage. However, in most other countries, C. esculentus is considered a weed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chufa</b> flatsedge (C. esculentus) has edible tubers and {{is grown}} commercially for these; they are eaten as vegetables, made into sweets, or {{used to produce}} the horchata of the Valencia region. Several other species - e.g. Australian bush onion (C. bulbosus) - are eaten to a smaller extent. For some Northern Paiutes, Cyperus tubers were a {{mainstay}} food, {{to the extent that}} they were known as tövusi-dökadö ("nutsedge tuber eaters").|$|E
50|$|Cyperus esculentus (also called <b>chufa</b> sedge, nut grass, yellow nutsedge, tiger nut sedge, or earth almond) is {{a crop of}} the sedge family {{widespread}} {{across much}} of the world. It is found in most of the Western Hemisphere, as well as Southern Europe, Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Historically it has become naturalized in many other regions, including Ukraine, China, Hawaii, Indochina, New Guinea, Java, New South Wales, and various oceanic islands.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a global}} search for {{alternative}} sources of fuel which could be cheaper, safer, and more environmentally friendly in comparison with widely used burning fuels.Since the tubers of C. esculentus contain 20-36% oil, {{it has been suggested}} as potential oil crop for the production of biodiesel. One study found that <b>chufa</b> produced 1.5 metric tonnes of oil per hectare (174 gallons/acre) based on a tuber yield of 5.67 t/ha and an oil content of 26.4%. A similar 6-year study found tuber yields ranging from 4.02 to 6.75 t/ha, with an average oil content of 26.5% and an average oil yield of 1.47 t/ha.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{definitive}} composition of spices {{that makes up}} ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different proportions, although some purists insist that it must contain exactly 12 items. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, <b>chufa,</b> grains of paradise, orris root, monk's pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper. Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.|$|E
5000|$|The Poales are {{the most}} {{economically}} important order of monocots and possibly the most important order of plants in general. Within the order, {{by far the most}} important family economically is the family of grasses (Poaceae, syn. Gramineae), which includes the starch staples barley, maize, millet, rice, and wheat as well as bamboos (mostly used structurally, like wood, but somewhat as vegetables), and a few [...] "seasonings" [...] like sugarcane and lemongrass. Graminoids, especially the grasses, are typically dominant in open (low moisture but not yet arid, or also fire climax) habitats like prairie/steppe and savannah and thus form {{a large proportion of the}} forage of grazing livestock. Possibly due to pastoral nostalgia or simply a desire for open areas for play, they dominate most Western yards as lawns, which consume vast sums of money in upkeep (artificial grazing--mowing--for aesthetics and to keep the allergenic flowers suppressed, irrigation, and fertilizer). Many Bromeliaceae are used as ornamental plants (and one, the pineapple, is internationally grown in the tropics for fruit). Many wetland species of sedges, rushes, grasses, and cattails are important habitat plants for waterfowl, are used in weaving chair seats, and (especially cattails) were important pre-agricultural food sources for man. Two sedges, <b>chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus, also a significant weed) and water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) are still at least locally important wetland starchy root crops.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This work {{reported}} the proximate evaluation of dry <b>Chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus L.) tubers {{with emphasis on}} the characterization of its oil extracted as compared with olive oil (Oleo europea). Moreover, fatty acids compositions of both oils were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography (GLC). Minerals content of <b>chufa</b> tubers were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Also, amino acids content of <b>chufa</b> tubers was determination by amino acid analyzer. <b>Chufa</b> coated with chocolate was prepared from <b>chufa</b> tubers and sensory qualities were evaluated as compared with commercial peanut coated with chocolate. Results indicated that <b>Chufa</b> tubers were characterized by low moisture content (3. 75 %), high levels of starch (295 g / kg) and high fat content (30. 00 %). Tubers contained significant amounts of fiber (4. 30 %), rich in Ca (152. 00 ppm), P (123. 00 ppm) and Na (140 ppm). Moreover, <b>Chufa</b> tubers are {{a good source of}} total amino acids. Amino acid profiles were dominated by, aspartic acid followed by glutamic acid, leucine, alanine and arginine. It is remarkable that the <b>Chufa</b> and olive oils are similar in fatty acid composition. <b>Chufa</b> and olive oils contained palmitic acid as the main saturated acid and oleic acid as the predominant unsaturated acid. In conclusion, the results obtained show that preparation of <b>Chufa</b> coated with chocolate from <b>Chufa</b> tuber was cheaper, more nutritious highly acceptable healthy food. The results provide additional information about the nutritional value and confirm that of <b>chufa</b> tubers are an interesting healthy food.

40|$|<b>Chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus) is an {{emergent}} perennial sedge that {{is common}} in seasonally flooded wetlands. Although <b>chufa</b> {{is common in}} many States, it is most abundant in the Southeast, including the Mississippi alluvial valley (Fig. 1).

40|$|Natural wetland food plants help meet {{energetic}} {{requirements for}} sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis). <b>Chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus) tubers {{were found to}} be a prominent item in the winter diet of cranes in New Mexico and Texas. In 1996 and 1997, <b>chufa</b> production was compared among mowing, discing, and sustained-flooding treatments intended to enhance <b>chufa</b> tuber growth. Sandhill crane numbers were monitored on wetlands during winter flooding to determine treatment preferences. No differences in sandhill crane use of treated wetlands were found in 1996, however in 1997, crane use was higher on disked field than sustained flood fields with mowed fields recording similar use levels as other treatments. Regression analysis also was used to explore the relationship between crane use and above and belowground food production. <b>Chufa</b> mass and fall panicum (Panicum dichotomiflorum) seed were positively related to crane use. We hypothesize cranes used wetlands where high biomass of these above and belowground food items was available to efficiently meet daily energetic needs. Disking wetlands at a depth of 5 cm about 30 days following initial wetland drawdown may be an effective treatment to expand <b>chufa</b> production and attract sandhill cranes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus L. var. sativus Boeck.) is an {{important}} vegetable crop in Valencia (Spain), where its tubers are used to produce a refreshing drink called 'horchata'. Water is relatively inexpensive, there are no data regarding the volumes of water used to grow <b>chufa,</b> and the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) has neither been determined. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare the productive responses of the <b>chufa</b> crop to two irrigation strategies (IS). The volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was monitored with capacitance sensors. Trends in VSWC were used to determine the in situ field capacity (FC), beginning each irrigation event when the VSWC reached either approximately 45 % (H 1) or 60 % (H 2) of the FC at a soil depth of 0. 10 m. The experiments were conducted over three consecutive seasons. An area velocity flow module measured the water flow. The yields, the water volumes used, and the IWUE were calculated. Plants were periodically sampled and the harvest index and relative growth rate were determined. The yield was affected by the year and by the IS. The greatest yields were obtained with the H 2 strategy (on average 2. 18 kg m- 2 for H 2 vs. 1. 94 kg m- 2 for H 1; p≤ 0. 01), and the average tuber weight (ATW) was affected (p≤ 0. 01) by the year and IS interaction. IWUE was affected by the year, and none of the considered factors affected the harvest index (p≤ 0. 05). It can be concluded that maintaining a higher VSWC would increase both yield and ATW without affecting IWUE...|$|E

40|$|Two {{field trials}} (Los Andes 1998 - 1999 and Santiago 2004 - 2005) {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} growth inhibition of yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.), growing on the plantation row, by mulch derived from a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop established between grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) rows on overhead (cv. Flame Seedless) and vertical (cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) training. Spring mowing of the rye sown in the fall allowed for developing a thick and long lasting mulch along the grape rows. Nutsedge and bermudagrass control was 81 and 82 %, respectively, and was more effective than conventional chemical (in the row) + mechanical (between rows) control. Glyphosate at 2 % for nutsedge and 1 % for bermudagrass control, applied twice (October and December), was insufficient to control either perennial weed adequately. Total broadleaved and grass/sedge weed control was 67. 3 and 43. 0 % more effective with the rye mulch than with conventional treatments at Los Andes and Santiago, respectively. Perennial weed control levels could be explained as the new foliage of yellow nutsedge and bermudagrass was particularly susceptible to the shading provided by the rye mulch assembled prior to mid spring shoot emergence, and this effect remained active up {{until the beginning of}} autumn. The subsequent rye foliage mowing at the vegetative stage fully expressed the allelopathic effect produced by this local rye cultivar. The use of rye cover crop management and mulch could be applied as an effective weed control technique in conventional, as well as organic deciduous tree orchards. En dos ensayos de campo (Los Andes 1998 - 1999 y Santiago 2004 - 2005) se determinó el efecto inhibitorio sobre <b>chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus L.) y pasto bermuda (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) de residuos de centeno (Secale cereale L.) establecido en otoño entre las hileras de vides (Vitis vinifera L.) en parronal (cv. Flame Seedless) y espaldera (cv. Cabernet Sauvignon). Las siegas sucesivas del centeno formaron un mulch vegetal denso y duradero sobre las hileras de vides. El mulch orgánico fue un 81 y 82 % más efectivo para controlar <b>chufa</b> y pasto bermuda, respectivamente, que el control químico (sobre la hilera) + mecánico (entre las hileras). Dos aplicaciones de glifosato (octubre/diciembre) al 2 % para <b>chufa</b> y 1 % para pasto bermuda no fueron suficientes para controlar efectivamente las dos malezas. El grado de control del total de malezas fue 67, 3 y 43, 0 % más efectivo con el mulch vegetal que con los tratamientos químicos en Los Andes y Santiago, respectivamente. El alto control ejercido por el mulch de centeno se debió a que el crecimiento de los nuevos brotes de <b>chufa</b> y pasto bermuda fueron particularmente susceptibles al sombreamiento del mulch, formado antes de su emergencia primaveral y que permaneció hasta inicios del otoño, y a que la siega del centeno maximizó los efectos alelopáticos de esta variedad local de centeno.

30|$|Apart from “close to expectation,” {{there is}} also another notion “out of expectation” that we have {{considered}} before our first trial of investigation. However, the notion “out of expectation” shows a far more complex pattern than “close to expectation.” The reason is that “out of expectation” could have various sources. For instance, it could be caused by an unexpected newly added information to the speaker like in the sentence “我差點忘了! 我還有個會要開! wo chadian wang le! wo hai you ge hui yao kai! ‘I almost forgot! I still have a meeting to attend!’” The added event is a completely new piece of information to the speaker, and it brings the sense of “unexpectedness.” However, it can also come from the notion of “continuation” like in the sentence “你還沒有出發?! ni hai meiyou <b>chufa?</b> ‘You haven’t set off yet?!’” In this case, it can also denote a sense of mirative, but it apparently comes from the notion of “continuation.” Besides, in our investigation, many languages use phonetic rather than lexical devices to encode the notion. So far, we lack of enough evidence to show how this notion is connected to other notions in the conceptual space, but we believe this line is well worth pursuing.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chufa</b> (Cyperus esculentus L. var. sativus Boeck.) is a {{traditional}} crop in the Mediterranean region of Spain, where it is only furrow irrigated. This article analyzes the irrigation performance for this crop, conducting field studies over three consecutive seasons in Valencia (Spain). Irrigation schedule {{was based on the}} volumetric soil water content, which was measured with capacitance sensors. Infiltrability was measured with blocked-furrow infiltrometers. An area velocity flow module measured the water flow, the cross-sectional geometry of furrows was determined using furrow profilometers, and times for advance and recession were recorded. WinSRFR software was used to analyze every irrigation event, determining the application efficiency (AE) and distribution uniformity of the minimum (DUmin), and to optimize the combination of furrow inflow (q) and cut-off time (Tco). Average values obtained for AE were 30. 1 %, 25. 6 %, and 26. 7 % in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, and the corresponding DUmin values were 0. 54, 0. 61, and 0. 67. Optimized results showed {{that it is possible to}} reach AE and DUmin values up to 87 % and 0. 86, respectively. However, understanding the q-Tco relationship that maximizes both AE and DUmin is more important than knowing the specific values. A function that related q and Tco was obtained for the typical plot dimensions, and this was validated in 2011. Therefore, this function can be used in most of the plots in the cultivation area...|$|E
40|$|Cyperus esculentus (yellow nutsedge) {{belongs to}} the world most {{important}} weeds on arable land. This species is classified as an invasive one in Central and North-western Europe. It is not yet present as a weed in the Czech Republic, but its occurrence in neighbouring countries {{and its ability to}} survive winters in this region must be taken into account. A cultivated form of C. esculentus, known as <b>Chufa</b> or Tiger nuts, is occasionally grown in home gardens as a crop for its edible tubers. In pot experiments we tested the growth of both forms, weedy and cultivated one. Weight of both fresh and dry biomass of plant parts (leaves, roots, rhizomes, tubers, inflorescences) was measured in monthly intervals from May till September 2012. Results show that {{there were no significant differences}} in leaf and root biomass. The weight of rhizomes was approximately 50 - 80 times higher in the wild form. Number of tubers was also higher in the wild form (max. 1118 pcs; crop max. 342 pcs in single pot), but the total weight of tubers was not significantly different. The cultivated form did not produce inflorescences at all, the wild form produced in average 13 inflorescences per plot. Based on our results we can state that growing of the cultivated form does not pose any risk – plants do not show intensive vegetative spread and do not produce inflorescences so crossing with the weedy form is not possible. The wild form can produce high amounts of rhizomes and tubers and is able to produce flowers under our conditions. That makes it a potentially dangerous weed in warmer regions of the Czech Republic...|$|E
