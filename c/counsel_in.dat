40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to review the {{national}} regulations and practices of genetic <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> 38 European countries, and to examine how well they intersect the ideals of genetic <b>counselling</b> defined <b>in</b> international guidelines. Using an electronic survey, representatives of the National Societies of Human Genetics in 29 countries, and appropriate contact persons for the field of genetic <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> 9 other countries, were asked about the regulations and practices. The answers showed that consent, confidentiality, genetic <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> the context of prenatal diagnosis, those professionals who may perform genetic counselling, and non-directiveness were the topics most often either agreed upon among professionals or regulated in those countries. These are also among the key aspects of ideal genetic counselling, based on international guidelines. <b>Counselling</b> <b>in</b> the context of susceptibility testing for multifactorial diseases, counselling people from ethnic minorities and recontacting the counsellees, on the contrary, were topics regulated or guided by generally applied practices in only few countries. Many of the answers expressed a desire for more regulation of genetic counselling, and that more uniform practices of education and organization of genetic counselling would be welcome in Europe...|$|R
5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal <b>counsel</b> <b>in</b> 30 cases there.|$|E

5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded <b>counsel,</b> <b>in</b> most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own <b>counsel.</b> <b>In</b> Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the <b>counsel,</b> <b>in</b> which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on Friday 15 May 1812, under the {{presiding}} judge Sir James Mansfield, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. The prosecuting team was led by the Attorney General, Gibbs, whose assistants included William Garrow, himself a future Attorney General. Brougham having declined, Bellingham was represented by Alley, assisted by Henry Revell Reynolds. The law at that time limited the role of defending <b>counsel</b> <b>in</b> capital cases; they could advise on points of law, and could examine and cross-examine witnesses, but otherwise Bellingham would have to present his own defence.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} young peoples’ experiences of <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> a school setting. Five {{young people who}} received <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> their school were interviewed individually and their responses analysed using the constant comparative method. The results highlight four particular areas that {{would be helpful to}} address if a school were considering setting up a counselling service. The findings emphasise the importance young people place on autonomy around the disclosure of the fact they are attending counselling, as well as the actual content of counselling sessions. They suggest that many young people would prefer to have <b>counselling</b> <b>in</b> their school, rather than at another venue. The young people interviewed identify certain qualities in the counsellor that facilitate an effective counselling relationship, and finally how many of their peers were unaware of the nature and existence of a <b>counselling</b> service <b>in</b> their school. The relevance of the outcomes to the effective counselling of young people are discussed...|$|R
