However, some missile analysts feel that a standard databus {{may not be the}} best path to follow. It is said that a customised databus is better because in a standard databus, one tends to use off-the-shelf electronic devices whose performance may not be optimal. However most new missiles are moving towards digital buses using commercial off-the-shelf technology and which enables affordable sub-system replacement.|$|E

Heuristics are used to reduce the problem complexity, which include limiting number of intermediate solutions, using a continuous buffer sizing model, and restricting the buffer locations along the Hanan graph.

40|$|Today, large {{telecommunications}} {{customers are}} increasingly using {{virtual private network}}s to link geographically dispersed sites. A virtual private network is provided by provisioning a set of permanent (long term) virtual circuits between customer endpoints on a large backbone network.

Routing decisions must be made on-line without any knowledge of future request sets. Furthermore, frequent rerouting to correct inefficiencies that can result from the on-line routing decisions are not possible since rerouting creates a service disruption for the customer. Finally, the forward and reverse bandwidth of a virtual circuit must be routed over the same single path.

40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} reconfigure around {{manufacturing}} defects and operational faults increases FPGA chip yield, reduces system downtime and maintenance in field operation, and increases reli-abilities of mission- and life-critical systems. The fault reconfigu-ration technique {{discussed in this}} work use the principle of node covering in which reconfiguration is achieved by constructing re-placement chains of cells from faulty cells to spare/unused ones. A key issue in such reconfiguration is efficient incremental rerouting in the FPGA. Previous methods for node-covering based reconfig-uration are “static ” {{in the sense that}} extra interconnects are added a-priori as part of the initial <b>circuit</b> <b>routing</b> so that a specific fault pattern (e. g., one fault per row) can be tolerated [1].
