40|$|Immunization {{of strain}} A mice with p-azophenylarsonate-conjugated protein stimulates B cells that {{synthesize}} anti-p-azophenylarsonate antibodies. A large fraction of these cells produce antibodies with variable (V) regions encoded {{by a single}} heavy chain V gene segment together with multiple combinations of diversity, heavy chain joining, light chain variable, and light chain joining gene segments. Early in the immune response, these V regions are not somatically mutated. One of these V regions is initially expressed by {{only a minority of}} the responding B cells but binds p-azophenylarsonate with the highest affinity. After a secondary immunization, B cells synthesizing mutated derivatives of this single V region dominate the response and bind p-azophenylarsonate with even higher affinity than does the unmutated V region. These results suggest that antigen directs both the expression of the immune repertoire and the amplification of V region diversity by a sequential process of clonal selection of B cells expressing receptor antibodies encoded by unmutated V genes, induction of mutation in the V genes expressed by the selected <b>cells,</b> and <b>reselection</b> of B <b>cells</b> expressing antibodies with mutated V regions of higher affinity...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of the gene responsible for the Cl- ion transport defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has provided important information {{about the relationship between}} the disease pathology and the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms. In addition, new areas of investigation and therapy are now possible. Most notably, the {{isolation of}} the CF gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has {{led to the development of}} different gene therapy strategies. To circumvent possible complications due to insertional mutagenesis and virally induced immune responses, we have employed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -based expression vectors for correction of the cAMP-dependent Cl- transport defect associated with CF. A CFTR-containing expression construct under the regulation of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) (pREP 5 /CFTR) was introduced into transformed human airway epithelial cells defective in cAMP-dependent Cl- transport. Transfected cells were assayed for Cl- transport. Transfected cells were assayed for Cl- ion transport by 36 Cl- efflux, SPQ, and patch clamp and showed restoration of intact cAMP-dependent transport. CFTR transcription from pREP 5 /CFTR was detected by Northern hybridization. The level of response to agonists appeared to be dependent on the level of CFTR expression. When cells were tested for functional expression of CFTR after removal of selection pressure, they showed a continuous decrease in responsiveness to forskolin as a function of time after removal of selection. This decreased correlated with a loss of CFTR mRNA and in the loss of CFTR mRNA and in the loss of the pREP 5 /CFTR. After 12 to 15 weeks growth without selection both cAMP-dependent Cl- transport and plasmid-derived CFTR mRNA were not detectable. However, it was still possible to rescue cAMP-dependent Cl- transport in these transfected <b>cells</b> by <b>reselection</b> suggesting the presence of the CFTR containing plasmid in a portion of the cells. Analysis of DNA indicated that the pREP 5 /CFTR vector copy number was reduced from 30 copies per cell with continuous selection, to approximately 0. 3 copies per cell after 20 weeks without hygromycin B. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the author have studied and {{measured}} how LTE Release 8 interworks with previous legacy 3 G networks in real environmental conditions. At present, LTE technology is deployed based on service hotspots that cover small geographical areas. It {{is expected that}} full scale deployment of LTE network will take a considerable time, which also means the mobile users have to primarily depend on legacy 3 G and 2 G networks for years to come. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study the interworking mechanisms between LTE and legacy networks in order to provide seamless mobility and uninterrupted user services in primarily available LTE hotspots. In order to perform this study, field measurements have been carried out in DNA commercial network in outdoor and indoor environments. Initially, <b>cell</b> selection and <b>reselection</b> criteria for inter-RAT mobility in idle condition is mathematically checked and verified. Then, channel conditions are studied and analyzed based on radio parameters like RSRP, RSCP, RSRQ, Ec/No, SNR and CQI when inter-RAT handover is performed. After that, an inter-RAT handover test from LTE towards 3 G is studied with the help of signalling message. Next, the impact of inter-RAT handover on KPIs like MAC DL throughput, handover success rate, RTT, handover latency and user plane delay are studied and analyzed. Finally, performance of inter-RAT handover in outdoor and indoor measurement environment is compared based on KPI measurements. From this study, it is found that inter-RAT mobility from LTE towards 3 G network is working in both idle and connected modes with 100 percent handover success rate, however, the user experienced network latency around 4 seconds in average. The user experienced degradation in throughput because of decreasing link quality. The user data service interruption is roughly for 3 - 4 seconds and the RTT value for 32 bytes of data is observed to be around 300 ms in average during handover. It is also found that the impact of inter-RAT handover in indoor environment is higher than outdoor environment based on KPIs results...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, avalanches, {{earthquakes}} and collapsed buildings are claiming an increasing death toll due to urbanisation, {{climate change and}} tourism, which means a harder work is required from Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. Despite this claim, SAR operations are still very limited and expensive, due to numerous constraints. RESCUECELL is a European Commission funded project, that {{will take advantage of}} the fact that nowadays most of the victims of this kind of accidents carry mobile phones with them, to develop an accurate location system based on mobile signal measurements, {{in order to create a}} cost-effective and portable kit for emergency search services, which will be easy to install and use. The aim of this thesis is to study, develop, and test the implementation of a portable GSM Base Transceiver Station (BTS) for the RESCUECELL system. This master node is called Control Centre (CC) and will be in charge of communicating with the buried GSM phones and locating them through captured mobile signals with the help of GSM sniffers, called Femtocell Access Points (FAPs) in this project, disposed within the disaster zone. GSM architecture involves a lot of highly expensive infrastructure, which would certainly not fulfill the requirements. The challenge of implementing it in a portable kit, easy to be transported by the rescue team, is faced in this thesis. Such implementation will be able to serve all the terminals within the disaster area, independently of the operator, and provide emergency and normal call support. Furthermore, <b>cell</b> selection and <b>reselection</b> procedures followed by Mobile Terminals (MTs) are studied, both for the technology chosen (GSM) as for other coexisting technologies (i. e. UMTS and LTE), in order to present an optimal cell setup that will enable the cell broadcasted by RESCUECELL CC to appear as the most attractive cell for the MTs in the affected area to attach to, in the presence of other competing cells, whether they are GSM, or other technology cells. Finally, CC-FAP communication is also studied and tested through GPRS communication, allowing the FAPs communicate the phones' signal properties (RSSI and ToA) to the CC and hence to locate them. In conclusion, this thesis presents the hardware and software used, procedures followed, requirements needed, optimal configuration, and developed code, in order to create a portable system that can make all phones in the affected area attach to the cell operated by RESCUECELL CC, and communicate with it, in order to permit the FAPs calculate their signal properties, and communicate them to the RESCUECELL CC leading to the phones' location...|$|R

To maintain the quality of services in a wide service area, coverage area is divided into smallest geographic units called cells. If the user moves from one area of the cell to another, then it needs an algorithm that guarantees the continuity of communications services. These algorithm is called a handover to a dedicated mode and the <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> for idle mode. In observing handoff algorithm, the operator did a drive test using computer and handset, which each had been equipped with special software, and GPS. This final project analyze the matters related to the handoff algorithm, both when in idle mode or dedicatd mode, including the causes, processes and things that influence it. Data acquisition is carried out through a drive test using software TEMS Investigaions GSM 4. 1. 1 with routes in the downtown area of Semarang. Drive test held on every Thursday and Sunday for three consecutive weeks starting on August 23, 2009 and each of day divided into three time allocation, ie morning, noon and night. The observed event include: <b>cell</b> <b>reselection,</b> handover, handover (intracell), handover failure and intracell handover failure. In addition Information Element that effected on the event are also observed, path loss criteria and <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> criteria for <b>cell</b> <b>reselection,</b> and received power, bit error rate and timing advance for the four other events. From the analysis is known that the assignment channel is triggered by the Information Element value that reaches a certain threshold value. For <b>cell</b> <b>reselection,</b> the both Information Element having equal influence. Information Element of the most influential for the handover and the handover failure is received power, whereas for two other events the most influential is the received bit error. After the detected value of the Information Element reaches a certain threshold, MSC will instruct the candidate cell to monitor and serving mobile station. Different process going on for handover (intracell), which after the information element value is known at a certain threshold, MS will move to another traffic channel in the same cell. If handover (intracell) was requested but could not be performed then handover based quality is tried the next time (if criterion is still given). When this handover also fails then BS toggles back and tries again a handover (intracell). In this drive test result there are 15 handover failures that may because no available traffic channel in candidate cell. There is only once handover intracell failure happened which may be caused by full traffic in candidate channel, but no <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> failure is found because this event doesn’t need traffic channel but only signalling channel.

30|$|As {{shown in}} {{previous}} references, the specific objectives of traffic steering depend on operator policy, {{and they are}} achieved by utilizing mechanisms of mobility management, which are usually standardized by {{organizations such as the}} 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP)[11]. In idle mode, no dedicated resources have been established for the user equipment (UE), and the procedure for changing of camping cell is called <b>cell</b> <b>reselection.</b> A traffic steering policy can be used in this case to determine the preferred layer for camping[3, 12]. In connected mode, an HO is typically carried out when the UE moves between two cells to preserve the user connection. However, this is not necessarily the only reason for triggering an HO. Since the coverage area of the layers is overlapped, a UE could trigger an HO due to traffic steering reasons[1, 13]. An important issue that arises from using both <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> and HO procedures for traffic steering is the need of aligning these two mechanism to avoid ping-pong effects.|$|E

30|$|This paper investigates traffic {{steering}} techniques by static adjustment of mobility parameters in HetNets. To find the optimal user distribution across the network layers, a <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> algorithm considering different layer priorities and inter-RAT HOs {{is used for}} {{traffic steering}} purposes. More specifically, first, the problem of allocating absolute priorities (APs) to network layers for <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> is analyzed. Second, a procedure to select the optimal thresholds of the 3 GPP events that trigger the inter-RAT HOs is proposed. In this case, the problem arising {{from the use of}} HO triggering events based on the signal level is addressed. When the events are based on the signal level instead of the signal quality, the thresholds involved in these events require a more precise adjustment, especially in multi-layer scenarios, where the location of low-power nodes within the macro-cell may determine the adjustment of the thresholds. The proposed techniques are assessed in a realistic scenario thoroughly deployed to cover hotspots with LTE pico-cells so that the traffic steering policy is to offload traffic to the pico-layers in order to use more efficiently the radio resources and improve service performance. The main contribution of this work is the design of an algorithm to simplify the task of adjusting these thresholds for traffic steering. The impact of the LTE penetration in the mobile terminals is also studied in the LTE/HSPA scenario, where the LTE pico-cells are deployed in areas without LTE macro-coverage.|$|E

To achieve this objective, the absolute priorities of the <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> algorithm in idle mode and the thresholds of B 2 / 3 A events for inter-RAT HOs in connected mode have been statically modified to further offload the macro-layer. In addition, an algorithm to simplify the task of adjusting the B 2 / 3 A thresholds when the measurement type is based on the signal level has been proposed.|$|E
30|$|In {{cellular}} networks, cell service {{areas can}} be modified by different techniques. A first group of techniques adjust physical parameters in the base station, such as data or pilot transmit power[8] or antenna radiation pattern[9]. In practice, these techniques have seldom been used since they may create coverage holes (unless changes in adjacent cells are synchronized) and involve maintenance actions in legacy equipment. Alternatively, a second group of techniques change parameters in RRM processes, such as <b>cell</b> <b>reselection</b> (CR)[10] and HO[11]. Since tuning CR parameters is only effective during call set-up, the optimization of HO parameters is normally the preferred option. Thus, most traffic sharing algorithms rely on HO margins, regardless of the radio access technology (e.g.,[11 – 17]).|$|E

A cross-layer parallel handover optimization (CPHO) scheme is proposed in this paper to reduce the handover signaling overhead and latency in each stage. The key idea of our proposed scheme is that uses the knowledge achieved from the backhaul inter-BS communications to reduce the HO control message load in wireless links and overlaps the executions of the link layer and the network layer handover process.

The conditions to be applied between the different cases (i.e., HSPA to HSPA and HSPA to LTE) are the same, but the signal measurements are technology-dependent. When multiple cells of different priorities are suitable for reselection by fulfilling the above conditions, cells of higher priority will take precedence over a lower priority frequency or RAT. For intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency cases, criterion R is applied. R is a cell-ranking criterion based on either of signal quality or signal level.|$|E

In addition, L 3 and L 4 carry similar traffic volumes since the LTE penetration is only partial. Conversely, with 100 % LTE penetration, L 4 carries considerably more traffic since there are more LTE-compatible UEs which can be transferred to L 4. In addition, more traffic (approximately 3 Mbps) is carried by L 4 when AP 1 and AP 2 are used instead of the reference case AP 0. Note also that most of this traffic comes from the co-sited pico-layer (L 3), which means that macro-offloading (i.e., traffic from macro- to pico-cells) is very limited.|$|E
