5|$|Rootes {{had always}} been insufficiently capitalised, and losses {{resulting}} from a damaging thirteen-week strike at one of its subsidiaries, British & Light Steel Pressings, coupled with the expense of launching the Hillman Imp, meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties. At the same time, Chrysler was looking to boost its presence in Europe, and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £12.3 million ($34.44 million) for a large stake in Rootes, although not a controlling one. As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not to acquire a majority of Rootes voting shares without {{the approval of the}} UK government, which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the UK motor industry. In 1967 Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgewood Benn approached BMH and Leyland to see if they would buy out <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> Rootes and keep the company British, but neither had the resources to do so. Later that year Chrysler was allowed to acquire a controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £20 million.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 Soler was {{incorporated}} in San Juan, Puerto Rico, {{and became a}} Chrysler-Plymouth dealer, {{doing business in the}} Pueblo Viejo district of the nearby suburb of Guaynabo. It and Mitsubishi Motors, a joint venture of <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland, concluded two separate agreements to this effect: a distributor agreement with <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> separate sales procedure agreements with <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> Mitsubishi. The latter contained arbitration clauses requiring that any disputes under them be arbitrated in Japan under the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (JCAA). The goal of the manufacturer and dealer was to introduce the small cars Mitsubishi made for both <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> itself to the Puerto Rican market, for which they were considered ideal.|$|E
