A total of four column base tests with different <b>connection</b> <b>configurations</b> were carried out, and {{it was found that}} section failure under combined bending and shear was always critical. Moreover, the proposed column bases were demonstrated to be structurally efficient attaining moment resistances close to those of the connected sections. In order to examine the structural behaviour of the column base connections, a finite element model was established using shell and spring elements to model the sections and the bolted fastenings respectively. Both material and geometrical non-linearities were incorporated, and comparison between the test and the numerical results was presented in details. The design rules originally developed for bolted moment connections between lapped Z sections were adopted and re-formulated for the design of column base connections after careful calibration against the test data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic (PV) arrays {{have been}} {{installed}} {{for many years}} in a very wide range of applications from very small one or two module installations to megawatt grid connected systems. Technology is moving rapidly, particularly in the area of inverter topologies with moves toward higher voltages, high frequency transformer isolation and topologies without galvanic isolation.

The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate the 5 -year clinical results for {{a large number of}} single implants restored by certified prosthodontists in an attempt to establish whether different clinical outcomes could be detected for external- or internalconnection implants. Materials and Methods: All single implants with internal or external connections inserted in 27 private dental practices from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007 were evaluated. An initial statistical analysis was performed to describe the sample population at baseline and then to compare the two types of implant-abutment <b>connection</b> <b>configurations</b> and their clinical outcomes. All data were statistically analyzed with STATA 12 (StataCorp). Results: Twenty-eight of the 85 active members of the Italian Academy of Prosthetic Dentistry (AIOP) participated in this study. The sample included 1, 159 patients and 2, 010 implants. Of the implants, 75 were dropped because there was no information about follow-up. Of the remaining implants, 1, 431 (74. 0 %) were followed for at least 5 years, and 332 implants (17. 2 %) were followed for more than 8 years. Nearly 99 % (98. 9 %) of the implants survived. The difference between the survival frequencies of the two types of implant-abutment <b>connection</b> <b>configurations</b> was not significant for each negative event (log-rank test, P >. 05).
