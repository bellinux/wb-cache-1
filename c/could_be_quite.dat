5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{voluntary}} subscription, {{rather than}} funding from local or central government, {{was considered the}} only correct {{way to pay for}} a war memorial, although it was disputed whether active proactive fundraising was appropriate. Raising the sums required <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> difficult, and many committees tried various means, including moral blackmail, to exhort larger sums out of the more wealthy members of the community. The amount of money successfully raised varied considerably: the city of Glasgow, with a million inhabitants, raised approximately £104,000 for memorials; Leeds, with around half a million inhabitants, only £6,000. A typical memorial monument in Britain costed between £1,000 and £2,000, but some could be cheaper still; larger pieces, such as the Royal Artillery Memorial, could cost as much as £25,000. Australian communities raised funds in similar ways to their British equivalents, but the process of fund-raising was much more open, and included directly canvassing for donations. Typical Australian projects cost between £100 and £1,000, with the larger memorials costing up to £5,000; bank-loans were also sometimes used. Memorials along the Western front, being larger, cost rather more than their civic equivalents; the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial, for example, cost the IWGC and Australian government around £40,000.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E

25|$|Block {{printing}} {{first came}} to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.|$|E

25|$|A {{problem for}} some game {{software}} developers {{was that the}} method by which MSX-1 computers addressed their video RAM <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> slow compared to systems that gave {{direct access to the}} video memory. This, {{and the fact that the}} completely different features the MSX-1's video chip (using the MSX Video access method) had to compensate for the slower video access were not efficiently used while porting (mostly Spectrum) software, made the MSX-1 appear slower when running ported games.|$|E
25|$|Early on, {{development}} costs were minimal, {{and video games}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as royalties on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as Origin Systems, Sierra Entertainment, Capcom, Activision and Electronic Arts.|$|E
25|$|However, as a stock bowler for Nottinghamshire, Staples was an {{essential}} part of their successful team in the 1920s because his long spells of accurate medium-pace bowling allowed speedster Harold Larwood and the physically sensitive Tich Richmond to be more effective through not being overworked. Although on a relatively few occasions his off-break from round the wicket <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> unplayable, Staples rarely obtained exceptional averages even in helpful summers but {{there is no doubt that}} without his ability to keep more penetrative bowlers fresh Nottinghamshire's bowling would have been much less formidable.|$|E

25|$|The Singsaker Line {{had always}} had the lowest {{ridership}} of the three tram lines, and therefore it had been served using the oldest material—narrow cars with only wooden benches. The first Class 4 tram—no. 35—was put into service on 12 September 1952. Many people tried to time their trips into town to catch it; this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> difficult since {{there was only a}} one seventh chance. From December, the tram was taken out of service due to the amount of snow. This resulted in protest meetings, but the company did not have enough trams to use them on Line 3.|$|E

25|$|Studying colours and spectra {{provides}} {{insight into}} the objects' origin and a potential correlation with other classes of objects, namely centaurs and some satellites of giant planets (Triton, Phoebe), suspected to originate in the Kuiper belt. However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, solar wind and micrometeorites. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> different from the regolith underneath, and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.|$|E

25|$|Loganair had one {{previous}} {{air ambulance}} accident, also involving a Britten Norman Islander, on 19 May 1996, {{in which the}} pilot was killed, and the two passengers, a physician and a flight nurse, were injured. (In 1996, flights were typically made with a nurse, and sometimes a physician, if needed. The passenger cabin of the Islander was of limited size, and typical of ambulance aircraft, working conditions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> cramped with more personnel.) This 1996 accident bore similarities to the 2005 accident. It occurred at night with a single fatigued and poorly rested pilot making an approach in difficult weather, though {{in this case it}} was a strong and gusting crosswind rather than poor visibility that was the primary meteorological challenge.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{argue that}} there were two {{cultures}} existing side by side in 18th century Ireland, which had little contact with each other. One was Catholic and Gaelic, the other Anglo-Irish and Protestant. In this period, there continued to be a vibrant Irish language literature, exemplified by the Aisling genre of Irish poetry. These were dream poems, typically featuring a woman representing Ireland who pleaded with the young men of Ireland to save her from slavery and oppression. Many Irish language poets clung to a romantic attachment to the Jacobite cause, although some wrote in praise of the United Irishmen in the 1790s. Other, non-political poetry <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> sexually explicit, for example the poem Cuirt an Mean Oiche (the Midnight Court). Gaelic poets of this era include Aogán Ó Rathaille and Brian Merriman.|$|E

He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.|$|E
60|$|He was comfortably seated under a large tree, with Mrs. Harnett and Mrs. Simpson {{on either}} side of him, and, so far as <b>could</b> <b>be</b> judged, <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> as well off there as he {{would have been in the}} house.

25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, {{one way to}} try to avert it was to simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> sudden. The fact that it {{seems to have been a}} common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E
25|$|Gamelin was right; most reserve {{divisions}} had by {{now been}} committed. The only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, attacked on the 16th. However the French armoured {{divisions of the}} Infantry, the Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve, were despite their name very specialized breakthrough units, optimized for attacking fortified positions. They <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> useful for defence, if dug in, but had very limited utility for an encounter fight: they could not execute combined infantry-tank tactics as they simply had no important motorized infantry component; they had poor tactical mobility as the heavy Char B1 bis, their main tank in which half of the French tank budget had been invested, had to refuel twice a day. So 2nd DCR divided itself in a covering screen, the small subunits of which fought bravely – but without having any strategic effect.|$|E
25|$|Practices such as these, varying {{from the}} mundane to the grotesque, were {{commonly}} associated with necromancy. Rituals <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers {{even went so far}} as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased’s ghostly spirit instead.|$|E
