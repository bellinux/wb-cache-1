50|$|Kidney <b>cancer</b> {{originates}} <b>in</b> {{the kidney}} in two principal locations: the renal tubule and the renal pelvis. Most <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> the renal tubule are {{renal cell carcinoma}} and clear cell adenocarcinoma. Most <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> the renal pelvis are transitional cell carcinoma.|$|R

50|$|Mutations in the ATM gene {{are found}} at {{relatively}} low frequencies <b>in</b> sporadic <b>cancers.</b> According to COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations <b>In</b> <b>Cancer,</b> the frequencies with which heterozygous mutations in ATM are found <b>in</b> common <b>cancers</b> include 0.7% <b>in</b> 713 ovarian <b>cancers,</b> 0.9% <b>in</b> {{central nervous system}} <b>cancers,</b> 1.9% <b>in</b> 1,120 breast <b>cancers,</b> 2.1% <b>in</b> 847 kidney <b>cancers,</b> 4.6% <b>in</b> colon <b>cancers,</b> 7.2% among 1,040 lung <b>cancers</b> and 11.1% <b>in</b> 1790 hematopoetic and lymphoid tissue cancers.|$|R
5|$|Chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{appears to}} almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis {{may be a}} symptom of a tumor. The risk of pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> individuals with familial pancreatitis is particularly high.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> men, and cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E

50|$|Many mutagens {{are also}} {{carcinogens}}, but some carcinogens are not mutagens. Alcohol {{is an example}} of a chemical carcinogen that is not a mutagen. In Western Europe 10% of <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> males and 3% of <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> females are attributed to alcohol.|$|R

5|$|Her public {{appearances}} became increasingly rare later in life. She {{and her husband}} returned to California, and later moved to New Jersey. She suffered two strokes, one in 1976 and another in 1983, then was diagnosed with lung <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> 1992. She died in 1993, aged 81.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 Shangguan was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and had a successful surgery. However, only two months later it was found that she also had <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> her brain and had to undergo another major operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E

50|$|There is {{scientific}} and social controversy about the virus SV40 causing <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> human. Leaving that controversy aside, Syrian hamsters injected with SV40 certainly will develop various <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> predictable ways {{depending on how}} {{they are exposed to}} the virus. The hamster {{has been used as a}} research model to clarify what SV40 does in humans.|$|R
40|$|Inadequate dietary Zn {{consumption}} increases {{susceptibility to}} esophageal and other <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> humans and model organisms. Since Zn supplementation can prevent <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> rodent {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC) models, {{we were interested in}} determining if it could have a preventive effect in a rodent skin cancer model, as a preclinical basis for considering a role for Zn in prevention of human nonmelanoma skin cancers, the most frequent <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> humans. We used the 7, 12 -dimethyl benzanthracene carcinogen/phorbol myristate acetate tumor promoter treatment method to induce skin tumors in Zn-sufficient wild-type and Fhit (human or mouse protein) knockout mice. Fhit protein expression is lost in 3 ̆e 50...|$|R

5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with <b>cancer</b> <b>in</b> 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, eat, or drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E

50|$|In Western Europe, 10% of <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> {{males and}} 3% of <b>cancers</b> <b>in</b> females are {{attributed}} to alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers. Cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases, causing at least 200,000 deaths. Cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene.|$|R
