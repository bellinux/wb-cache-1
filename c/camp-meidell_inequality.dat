40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis {{we describe}} some improvements of Chebyshev inequa- lity. In {{the first chapter}} we introduce inequalities for random variables with uni- modal distributions. We prove Gauss and <b>Camp-Meidell</b> <b>inequality</b> and we deduce Vysochanskii-Petunin inequality. We describe inequalities for variables with mode 0 and with unspecified mode. In the second chapter we consider constants C(r), for which the approximations are the best. We are interested in finding optimal parameter r or its approximation. In the third chapter we state inequalities from the first chapter for specific distributions, calculation of their constants, appli- cations and graphic presentations of the results. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} a technique for estimating error bounds about {{the predictions of}} data-driven models of dynamical systems. The bootstrap technique is applied to predictions from a set of dynamical system models, {{rather than from the}} time-series data, to estimate the reliability (in the form of prediction intervals) for each prediction. The technique is illustrated using human core temperature data, modeled by a hybrid (autoregressive plus first principles) approach. The temperature prediction intervals obtained are in agreement with those from the <b>Campâ€“Meidell</b> <b>inequality.</b> Moreover, as expected, the prediction intervals increase with the prediction horizon, time-series data variability, and model inaccuracy.

40|$|Abstract. Chebychev's {{inequality}} {{provides a}} bound on P[IX-pI 2 kc], where X has an arbitrary cdf F with u 2 < oo. We extend this result by placing further restrictions on F. We first assume that X is n times divisible so that X {{can be viewed}} as an average of n i. i. d. random variables. <b>Camp-Meidell's</b> <b>inequality</b> provides a tighter bound than Cheby-chev's by assuming that X is absolutely continuous with unimodal density function. We also extend this inequality by placing additional smoothness assumptions on the density of X. 1. Introduction. Statistica...|$|R
