40|$|<b>CRIXIVAN</b> TM {{is a drug}} used {{currently}} in AIDS treatment. Due to its complex structure, <b>CRIXIVAN</b> TM is difficult and expensive to chemically manufacture. Scientists have discovered bacteria, however, which c an synthesize indandiol, a precursor to <b>CRIXIVAN</b> TM. Rhodococcus {{is an example of}} such a bacterium. Synthesis of indandiol requires the enzymes naphthalene dioxygenase and toluene dioxygenase. The genes for these enzymes have not yet been identified in Rhodococcus, but their sequences are known in Pseudomonas, a less accessible bacterium. The objective of these experiments is to use the known sequences from Pseudomonas to identify similar genes in Rhodococcus. Once identified, these genes could be manipulated to enhance production of indandiol in Rhodococcus, which could potentially expedite the production of <b>CRIXIVAN</b> TM and minimize its production cost. Rhodococcus I 24 and B 264 - 1 are able to stereospecifically bioconvert indene to indandiol,a potential precursor to <b>CRIXIVAN</b> TM. Indene bioconversion is catalyzed by the multicomponent enzymes, naphthalene d ioxygenase and toluene dioxygenase. The genes for these enzy mes have not been identified in Rhodococcus, but sequences are known in Pseudomonas. The objective of these experiments is to screen a cosmid library from Rhodococcus I 24 for homologs to genes from Pseudomonas that encode naphthalene dioxygenase (nahAa) and toluene dioxygenase (todA). DNA from cosmids making up the I 24 library were isolated and prepared for hybridization studies. Probes to nahAa and todA were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and labeled. Dot blots identified which cosmids hybridized to the probes, and Southern blots determined whether these hybridizations were due to sequence-specific homology or to a nonspecific, bulk DNA effect (binding due to the presence of a large amount of DNA from multiples sources). Many dots from the dot blots showed hybridization to each probe. Analysis of these dots by Southern hybridization suggested that hybridization was due to nonspecific binding to pRhodoCOS, the cosmid vector. However, comparing the two membranes used in the dot blots suggested that some sequence-specific interactions existed...|$|E
40|$|Work {{conducted}} in Project lab 7. 13 Throughout the past decade, AIDS {{has become one}} of the most threatening and prevalent diseases in America. As the number of patients suffering from the potentially fatal disease increases, so does the demand for different types of drug therapy. One of the more successful therapies is Crixivan™, a drug produced by MERCK. Although highly effective at slowing the spread of AIDS in the body, it is incredibly difficult and expensive to synthesize in the lab, and thus is hard to obtain at a reasonable price. Alternate means have been employed to solve this problem, the most successful being the genetic engineering of bacteria to produce certain key components for the synthesis of <b>Crixivan.</b> It has been shown that the bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis I 24 can convert molecules of indene to indandiol, a key ingredient in the making of <b>Crixivan.</b> However, the actual gene or genes responsible for this process are still unknown. We sought to identify any and all genes related to this pathway, so that they can be utilized to help speed up the production of <b>Crixivan,</b> and lower the cost of AIDS drug therapy across the nation. Few drugs have emerged within the past few years as highly effective combatants in the fight against the AIDS virus. One such drug is called Crixivan™. Unfortunately, synthesis of this anti-HIV protease inhibitor remains a highly complex and expensive process. Thus, attempts have been made to speed up this process by genetically engineering bacteria to produce key precursors of the drug <b>Crixivan.</b> A very promising bacteria...|$|E

40|$|<b>Crixivan</b> ™ {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} treatments now available for AIDS therapy. However, the drug’s costly and difficult chemical synthesis has led the search for alternative pathways of synthesis. Specifically, researchers sought to eliminate several of the steps involved in the drug’s chemical synthesis by employing bacteria strains capable of producing certain key components of the synthesis. It has been shown that Rhodococcus I 24 can convert indene to indandiol, a key ingredient in the <b>Crixivan</b> ™ synthesis. Furthermore, a naphthalene-inducible dioxgenase (nidAB) system has been identified in Rhodococcus I 24. Naphthalene is an aromatic compound similar to indene. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of the nidAB system in Rhodococcus I 24. The naphthalene-inducible dioxgenase of Rhodococcus I 24, encoded by nidAB genes, can convert indene into cis-(1 R, 2 S) -indandiol. Using Northern blot analysis, we studied the regulation by naphthalene on the expression of the nidAB genes. By reporter gene strategy, we examined the role of naphthalene on a 800 bp segment of the upstream sequence of nidAB at the transcriptional level. The upstream sequence from nidAB was cloned into a promoterless lacZ cassette. Results from Northern blot analysis suggest little change of nidAB gene expression in the presence of naphthalene. ß-galactosidase assays suggest no naphthalene-induced transcriptional regulation by the upstream sequence from nidAB operon. Continued study of the naphthalene-responsiveness and regulation of nidAB genes will provide a better understanding of this dioxygenase system and indene bioconversion in Rhodococcus I 24...|$|E

As such, development of new MCRs and post-condensation modification of the MCR products have proven fruitful {{in the quest for}} new molecular probes and their expedited progression along the drug discovery value chain. The products thereof have found their way into numerous corporate compound collections. <b>Crixivan</b> (Indinavir), an antiretroviral, and Xylocaine (Lidocaine), a local anesthetic, are two examples of drugs derived from an MCR that have been marketed.

The collaborators will combine {{state of the art}} genetic approaches, genomics, DNA microarrays and directed evolution to investigate metabolic engineering of Rhodoccus as production platforms for (1) cis-amino indanol, aprecursor to the AIDS dug <b>Crixivan</b> and (2) novel polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide antibiotics. The metabolic pathways involved in these will be investigated, and production bottlenecks circumvented using genetic engineering and directed protein evolution approaches.

40|$|Indinavir (IDV) (also called <b>CRIXIVAN,</b> MK- 639, or L- 735, 524) is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protease. During early clinical trials, in which patients initiated therapy with suboptimal dosages of IDV, we monitored the emergence of viral resistance to the inhibitor by genotypic and phenotypic characterization of primary HIV- 1 isolates. Development of resistance coincided with variable patterns of multiple substitutions among at least 11 protease amino acid residues. No single substitution was present in all resistant isolates, indicating that resistance evolves through multiple genetic pathways. Despite this complexity, all of 29 resistant isolates tested exhibited alteration of residues M- 46 (to I or L) and/or V- 82 (to A, F, or T), suggesting that screening of these residues {{may be useful in}} predicting the emergence of resistance. We also extended our previous finding that IDV-resistant viral variants exhibit various patterns of cross-resistance to a diverse panel of HIV- 1 protease inhibitors. Finally, we noted an association between the number of protease amino acid substitutions and the observed level of IDV resistance. No single substitution or pair of substitutions tested gave rise to measurable viral resistance to IDV. The evolution of this resistance was found to be cumulative, indicating the need for ongoing viral replication in this process. These observations strongly suggest that therapy should be initiated with the most efficacious regimen available, both to suppress viral spread and to inhibit the replication that is required for the evolution of resistance...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{is a science}} concerned with the improvement of cellular properties {{through the application of}} recombinant DNA technology. To this point, the field has frequently been limited to methodological issues pertaining to gene introduction, expression and control by way of molecular biological techniques. While such methods are critical for the implementation of strategies for metabolic pathway design and modification, an equally critical activity is the quantitative analysis of metabolic networks and the evaluation of phenotype/genotype relationships. A prominent new opportunity to extend the scope of metabolic engineering has recently emerged to analyze and engineer biocatalytic microorganisms capable of catalyzing stereospecific transformations useful in chiral pharmaceutical manufacturing. This thesis formulates and applies a general framework for the optimization of uncharacterized bioconversion strains (those biocatalysts with little a priori genetic or metabolic data available) comprising five essential steps: (i) Establishment of an experimental system for strain selection and metabolic network analysis, (ii) definition of the bioconversion network and quantification of network fluxes, (iii) target identification, (iv) flux redistribution, and (v) analysis of the modified bioconversion strain to identify areas for further development. In the case described here, a systematic evaluation of the physiology of the soil bacterium Rhodococcus, and analysis of the relative fluxes of an indene bioconversion network,(cont.) facilitated the construction of a biocatalyst for production of (2 R) -indandiol suitable for the manufacturing of the HIV protease inhibitor, indinavir sulfate (<b>Crixivan,</b> Merck and Co., Inc.). The chemical synthesis of (-) -cis-(lS, 2 R) -l-aminoindan- 2 -ol [(-) -CAI], a key precursor in CrixivanT manufacturing, may be carried out by the asymmetric epoxidation of indene to (1 S, 2 R) -indan oxide at up to 87 % enantiomeric excess by way of hydrolytic kinetic resolution followed by crystallization to purify the (1 S, 2 R) -indan oxide. To circumvent this technically demanding epoxidation, Merck scientists conceptualized a bioconversion process in which indene is oxidized to one of three derivatives that can serve as precursors to (-) -CAI: cis-(1 S, 2 R) -indandiol, trans-(1 R, 2 R) -indandiol, or (1 S, 2 R) -indan oxide. Rhodococcus sp. were isolated that utilize complex networks of enzymatic reactions to convert indene to several oxygenated derivatives of different stereochemistries. In previous work, prolonged cultivation of Rhodococcus sp. I 24 in a continuous flow system with a novel indene air delivery led to the evolution of a mutant strain, designated KY 1, with improved bioconversion properties, in particular a twofold increase in yield of (2 R) -indandiol relative to I 24. Induction studies with both strains indicated that KY 1 lacked a toluene-inducible dioxygenase activity present in I 24 that was responsible for the formation of undesired byproducts. Flux analysis of indene bioconversion in KY 1 performed using steady state metabolite balancing and labeling with [14 C]-tracers revealed that at least 94 % of the indene is oxidized by a monooxygenase [...] . by Daniel Edward Stafford.
