50|$|The Agency's director, Marc Latour, {{said that}} Narconon Trois-Rivières was {{dangerous}} for patients, that it violated {{many of the}} <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> rehabilitation centres in Quebec, {{and that there was}} no medical supervision and no scientific basis to its treatment. He added that at least four clients had been hospitalized in recent months because of methods used at the centre.|$|R
40|$|In our article {{entitled}} ‘The Responsibility to Protect – An incoherent Doctrine?’ we claimed that R 2 P in the version {{proposed by the}} ICISS is incoherent. We argued that the ICISS-report used the criteria of right intention, proportionality and legitimate authority to determine when a humanitarian intervention is obligatory and we continued by arguing that this cannot {{be done in a}} coherent manner. In his reply to our article Tim Haesebrouck refutes our argument by claiming that the ICISS differentiates between <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> when a humanitarian intervention is obligatory from <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> what is permitted in an obligatory intervention and thereby avoid being incoherent. In this closing reply we show through an analysis of the report that ICISS does indeed differentiate between the criteria, but not in order to determine what is obligatory or permitted. Hence, our conclusion regarding the incoherence is not refuted by Haesebrouck...|$|R

40|$|We derive <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> two-weight {{estimates}} for multilinear fractional integrals and appropriate maximal functions. The two and one weight problems for multi(sub) linear strong fractional maximal operators are also studied; in particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the trace type inequality for this operator. We also establish the Fefferman-Stein type inequality, and obtain one-weight criteria when a weight function is of product type. As a consequence, appropriate results for multilinear Riesz potential operator with product kernels follow. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

40|$|According to the Dutch Mental Health Act, {{there are}} three <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> {{compulsory}} admission to a psychiatric hospital: the subject himself does not agree with admission; he presents a danger to himself and others and the 'last resort' principles applies (i. e. there is no reasonable alternative). The criteria themselves are not under dispute, but certain elements relating to legislation and practice can be improved. International agreements and foreign legislation can serve as useful sources of introducing improvements into Dutch legislatio...|$|R
50|$|At that time, U.S. state jurisdictions had varying <b>criteria</b> and {{procedures}} <b>governing</b> this situation. In some states, insanity acquittees were {{governed by the}} same rules {{and procedures}} as an individual facing civil commitment. Another group of states, although treating insanity acquittees in a generally similar fashion as the civilly committed, had more stringent <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> insanity acquittees; for example, in emergency commitment proceedings in which a civilly committed person may be committed for a maximum of one week, an insanity acquittee may be committed on an emergency basis for 90 days—and then the discharge would take place only after judicial approval. A third group subjected an insanity acquittee to automatic, indefinite commitment, usually with periodic reviews to determine if commitment continued to be necessary.|$|R

40|$|The Schwarzschild <b>criterion</b> <b>governing</b> {{the onset}} of {{convective}} instability has been modified to include magnetic field. This may be of importance for solar variability. The revised condition suggests that the underside of field layers are stabilizing and the upper side destabilizing. Absolute instability can be reached to achieve conventional magnetic buoyancy. This may explain the inverse correlation between the time intervals between sunspot minima and sunspot maxima with the maximum values of sunspot number, which {{is found to be}} significant at the 5. 5 sigma level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{selection}} <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> finite-amplitude synchronized oscillating {{states are}} discussed for model systems and real wake flows in a domain of infinite streamwise extent. Two types of nonlinear global modes are possible: hat modes with overall smoothly varying amplitude and elephant modes {{with a sharp}} front. The vortex street in wake flows is of elephant type, as observed in direct numerical simulations of a real spatially developing wake. Furthermore, the elephant frequency selection criterion is in excellent agreement with the numerically determined vortex shedding frequency...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study has}} been conducted {{to gain a better}} understanding of the <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> the merger of corotating vortices. The zero-equation and one-equation turbulent-flow models are used to model the interaction of two rolled-up, corotational vortices. A model appropriate for the swirling flow under consideration has been proposed to prescribe the algebraic variation of mixing-length in the flow field. The unsteady, two-dimensional equations in a cross-plane are solved for primitive variables using an implicit finite-difference code. The computed downstream merging distances are in good agreement with available wind tunnel data...|$|R
40|$|In 1979, {{the state}} of Washington broadened its <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> the {{involuntary}} commitment of the mentally ill. This study examined {{the impact of the}} revised law on involuntary and voluntary admissions and on the type of patient admitted to state hospitals in Washington. The short-term effect of the law was an abrupt increase in involuntary commitments, with a concomitant but not offsetting decline in voluntary admissions. Although the law resulted in a substantial change in admissions policy, it {{does not appear to have}} altered the type of patient admitted to state mental hospitals in Washington...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objectives}} of this project, {{and of the}} succeeding stages for which it forms a logical first step, are to expand the <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> the design (in the largest sense) of urban regions, adding explicit concerns for resource conservation and resilience. Typically overlooked, these criteria aim respectively at ameliorating the impact of urban development on the environment through more efficient and interlinked use of scarce energy and material resources in urban regions, and at minimizing the net costs to the concerned society of the inevitable system or subsystem failures...|$|R
50|$|Evaluation is asystematic {{determination}} of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using <b>criteria</b> <b>governed</b> {{by a set}} of standards. It can assist an organization, program, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change.|$|R
40|$|Pseudo {{compressibility}} is {{used for}} numerically solving incompressible flows to achieve computational efficiency. The use of pseudo compressibility results {{in a system of}} hyperbolic-type equations of motion that introduce waves of finite speed. The interactions of the wave propagation and the vorticity spreading are analyzed. A <b>criterion</b> <b>governing</b> the dependence of the pseudo compressiblity on the Reynolds number and the characteristic length of the flow geometry is obtained that allows for a proper convergence. It is demonstrated that the solution does tend to the incompressible limit. External and internal viscous flow test problems are presented to verify the theory...|$|R
40|$|Examples {{are used}} to {{illustrate}} the different present-day forms of forest management, based first and foremost on decision-making procedures governing management choices rather than on technical <b>criteria</b> <b>governing</b> the choice and implementation of programmes. These examples range from the Gabonese forest to Madagascar to the arid regions of the Sahel in Mali and Niger. They also involve different spatial scales ranging from the village forest to large forested areas, {{and then to the}} nationwide dimension. Last of all, they incorporate various targets - timber production, raffia exports, biodiversity conservation - and take many different objectives into account (livestock raising, honey, etc. ...|$|R
