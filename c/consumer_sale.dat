Purpose: The purpose was to investigate how <b>consumer</b> <b>sales</b> promotion {{can be used on}} retail clothing companies’ websites to increase sales. Method: This thesis is done as a qualitative research and with a deductive approach since we have studied theories and then done our own research.

Theoretical framework: This chapter is introduced with theories regarding online marketing which is followed by a section on the marketing mix online. Further a closer look is done at one of the devices of the marketing mix; the promotion tools. There are five promotion tools existing and in this thesis a closer look is taken at the <b>sales</b> promotion tool. <b>Consumer</b> <b>sales</b> promotion which is one of the sales promotion tools are then at focus and the reader will through this chapter develop a deeper understanding for the different ways of using <b>consumer</b> <b>sales</b> promotion online.

Chaired by Lord Crowther, the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971. The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending. Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a <b>Consumer</b> <b>Sale</b> and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use.|$|E
40|$|The 19 th century saw the {{development}} of contract law {{based on the idea}} of freedom of contract. The influence of free market economy and laissez-faire contributed to the idea that individuals should be left free to make private arrangements. The 20 th century saw great social and economic change, which heralded a swing away from the classic theory of freedom of contract. During this period it began to be realized that the notion of freedom of choice rested on many uncertain and fragile assumptions. In the realm of <b>consumer</b> <b>sale</b> of goods, there exists a fundamental inequality in terms of bargaining power, knowledge concerning the characteristics and technical components of the goods, and resources, between consumers and traders. Thus freedom of contract ceases to appropriate as the underlying doctrine for the formulation of laws regulating <b>consumer</b> <b>sale</b> contracts.

40|$|In this article, the Author {{criticizes the}} propositions of changes which are {{planned to be}} made in the Polish <b>consumer</b> <b>sale</b> law, demonstrating that almost all of these propositions are ill-founded or badly-designed. According to him, the reason is twofold. First, the proffered {{solutions}} do not fit the very reality in which <b>consumer</b> <b>sale</b> takes place in Poland (and not only here) : especially the basic need to maintain positive relations among the consumers and sellers as well as between the sellers and their direct and indirect suppliers seems to be – by the drafters – utterly disregarded. Second, the propositions are very often based upon fallacious assumptions or the misunderstanding of working of a legal institution they have wanted to reform. The more significant concern, however, lies in the fact that full of defects though the planned changes are, almost none of these defects has been discerned and pointed out by the consulted organizations and state agencies whose mission is to take care of the consumers’ and entrepreneurs’ rights and interests. In consequence, one is tempted to ask who, if not such organizations and agencies, is to see to the needs of the market and its participants having been properly secured in the Polish consumer law.

40|$|Most {{customers}} {{faced with}} contract containing ‘small print’ {{do not know}} what it contains or understand the effect of the clauses. Exclusion clauses may deprive a consumer of certain specific rights which social policy requires that he should have. Very often they are introduced in ways which results in consumers remaining ignorant of heir presence. In a contract of sale of goods, consumers are being confronted with an even worse position. The Sale of Goods Act 1957, the primary source of the law of sale of goods in Malaysia, allows the seller to avoid all the statutory implied conditions imposed on them under section 14 – 17 by merely inserting a clause to the effect. Nevertheless the harshness caused by such clauses has to a certain extent been lessened by the Consumer Protection Act 1999.

Despite being sensitive to oxygen and nutritionally fastidious, Campylobacter spp. are able to survive in food processing environments and reach consumers in sufficient numbers to cause disease. To investigate Campylobacter persistence on processed chicken, exudates from chickens produced for <b>consumer</b> <b>sale</b> were collected and sterilized. Two types of exudates from chicken products were collected: enhanced, where a marinade was added to the chickens during processing, and nonenhanced, where no additives were added during processing. Exudates from enhanced chicken products examined in this study contained a mixture of polyphosphates. Exudate samples were inoculated with Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli strains and incubated under a range of environmental conditions, and viable bacteria present in the resultant cultures were enumerated. When incubated at 42 °C in a microaerobic environment, exudates from enhanced chicken products resulted in increased survival of C. jejuni and C. coli compared with that in nonenhanced exudates in the range of 4 log CFU/ml. Under more relevant food storage conditions (4 °C and normal atmosphere), the exudates from enhanced chicken products also demonstrated improved Campylobacter survival compared with that in nonenhanced exudates. Polyphosphates present in the enhanced exudates were determined to be largely responsible for the improved survival observed when the two types of exudates were compared. Therefore, polyphosphates used to enhance chicken quality aid in sustaining the numbers of Campylobacter bacteria, increasing the opportunity for disease via cross-contamination or improperly cooked poultry...|$|E
