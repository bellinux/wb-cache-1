40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between financing constraints and investment-cash flow sensitivities by focusing on cash holdings of firms as the basic classification scheme to separate firms into financially constrained and unconstrained categories. The idea is that high cash reserves increase the ability of firms to undertake profitable investment opportunities. Our classification scheme {{is based on an}} optimal cash model, which helps us identify the firms that deviate significantly from their target cash ratio. We conduct the analysis for an emerging market, just before and during a financial crisis to test the hypothesis that the hedging role of cash is more critical in states of the world characterized by high asymmetric information and excessive costs of external finance. The results are in line with our expectations and show that constrained firms exhibit greater investment to cash flow sensitivities than unconstrained firms. Also, there is strong evidence that <b>cash</b> <b>stands</b> as an effective device for firms mainly, during the crisis period.

None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti.|$|R
25|$|In Big Brother 2001, Big Brother 2002, and Big Brother 2003, the <b>cash</b> prize <b>stood</b> at a {{guaranteed}} A$250,000. In Big Brother 2004, the prize money {{was raised to}} {{a guaranteed}} $1,000,000. Big Brother 2005 and Big Brother 2006 both continued to offer the $1,000,000 prize money, however, {{with the introduction of}} the fines system. The winner of Big Brother 2005 received $836,000 in prize money, while the winner of Big Brother 2006 received $426,000 {{as a result of the}} fines system. Housemates in Big Brother 2005 and Big Brother 2006 were given opportunities to regain lost prize money in special Friday Night Live events named: The Prize Fight. Big Brother 2007 was advertised as having no prize money available to the winner of that series. Later, when the series began, it was revealed that prize money could be accumulated upon the successful completion of tasks. The prize money at the end of the series stood at $450,000. In Big Brother 2008, the prize money was not mentioned until halfway through the series, eventually being revealed as $250,000. In Big Brother 2012, the prize fund was not mentioned until the end of the second week when the prize was revealed as a guaranteed $250,000.|$|R
60|$|It isn't {{merely the}} American that adores the Almighty Dollar, {{it is the}} human race. The human race has always adored the hatful of shells, or the bale of calico, or the half-bushel of brass rings, or the handful of steel fish-hooks, or the houseful of black wives, or the zareba full of cattle, or the two-score camels and asses, or the factory, or the farm, or the block of buildings, or the {{railroad}} bonds, or the bank stock, or the hoarded <b>cash,</b> or--anything that <b>stands</b> for wealth and consideration and independence, and can secure to the possessor that most precious of all things, another man's envy.

50|$|In the United States, drive-up banks {{often use}} {{pneumatic}} tubes to transport cash and documents between cars and tellers. Some U.S. hospitals have a computer-controlled {{pneumatic tube system}} to deliver drugs, documents and specimens to and from laboratories and nurses' stations. Many factories use them to deliver parts quickly across large campuses. Many larger stores use systems to securely transport excess <b>cash</b> from checkout <b>stands</b> to back offices, and to send change back to cashiers. NASA's original Mission Control Center had pneumatic tubes connecting controller consoles with staff support rooms. Denver International Airport uses many pneumatic tube systems, including a 25 cm diameter system for moving aircraft parts to remote concourses, a 10 cm system for United Airlines ticketing, and a robust system in the parking toll collection system with an outlet at every booth.|$|R

So {{to learn more}} and train {{the power of the}} Eastern yo-yo power, Leon returns to China and stops a robbery on his trip, which catches the eye of a school coach who had been given the work of starting a yo-yo team for JiangHai school. The school doesn't have the required money to get a training spot and uniforms, and the coach {{must find a way to}} solve this problem.

40|$|At {{the time}} of the {{transition}} to democracy in 1994, the South African social security system was already notably well developed for a middle income country (Lund 1993; Van der Berg 1997; Case and Deaton 1998). This fact can be ascribed {{to the way in which}} the system developed under apartheid as a welfare state for whites which was then incrementally expanded under social and political pressure to incorporate other groups. Thus, at the advent of the new post-apartheid society some important planks for a social assistance system were in place. Since then, a set of policies have been implemented that have expanded this system substantially. Direct spending on <b>cash</b> transfers currently <b>stands</b> at 3. 5 percent of GDP. This is more than twice the median spending of 1. 4 percent of GDP across developing and transition economies (World Bank 2009). ...|$|R
5000|$|State Senator Clay Davis hires high-powered {{attorney}} Billy Murphy (played by {{the real}} life Baltimore attorney of the same name) to represent him in his case, attempting to sway him to his side by [...] "offering" [...] to be indicted federally {{to make it a}} bigger case. Davis arrives at the courthouse with a copy of Prometheus Bound, comparing himself to the titular character (and mispronouncing both the name of the main character and author). During the trial the state presents its evidence and testimony from former Davis driver Damien Lavelle [...] "Day Day" [...] Price, who states that he returned his charity salaries to Davis in <b>cash.</b> Taking the <b>stand</b> himself, Davis charms the jury, saying he withdrew cash simply so that it would be on hand for him to dispense to needy constituents. To the shock of Bond and Pearlman, Davis is found not guilty.|$|R
40|$|A Eucalyptus globulus clonal spacing trial teasting {{spacings}} from 500 to 3, 000 stems {{per hectare}} for four clones was planted in Sept. 1994 on a deep volcanic-ash high productivity site near Mulchén, VIII Region, Chile, under a split-plot design with three replicates. The trial was measured at age 12 years and results across all clones and spacings were analysed from both, growth rate and economic perspective. A comparison with Permanent Sampling Plots [PSP] data from surrounding commercial seedlings plantations was also made. Volume growth curves were simulated up to 16 years old for all treatments, and optimized Land Expectation Value [LEV = Faustmann Value] and rotation age {{were calculated for}} each combination of clone and stocking, and for the commercial <b>stand.</b> <b>Cash</b> flow values were calculated under current market costs and prices structure in Chile. Sensitivity analysis on mill gate pulpwood prices and plant prices was also carried out. From the stocking perspective, the mean annual increment (MAI, in m 3 ha- 1 y- 1) peaked at 1000 to 1500 sph with a value of 43. 0 at 12 years age. From the clone perspective, the best clone reached an MAI of 44 at this stand density, while growth of the commercial stand was 40 at a current stocking of 1, 400 sph. Non-significant statistical differences were found among {{three of the four}} clone...|$|R
