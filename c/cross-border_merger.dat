40|$|Two literatures exist {{concerning}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger</b> activity's {{impact on}} domestic wages: one focusing on positive spillover-effects; the other focusing on negative bargaining-effects. Motivated by scarce theoretical scholarship spanning these literatures, we nest both mechanisms {{in a single}} conceptual framework. Considering the separate phenomena of inward and outward <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger</b> activity, our theoretical model generates three formal propositions: cross-border mergers can lead to wage increases via positive spillover-effects; and negative bargaining-effects are relatively more dominant when union market power is high, and when merging firms exhibit relatedness. Employing US firm-level panel data on wages combined with industry-level data on unionization and merger activity (covering 1989 - 2001), we find support for our propositions as inward and outward <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger</b> activity generate positive spillovers to wages, but {{are more likely to}} generate firm-level wage decreases when unionization rates are high and when <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger</b> activity is characterized as horizontal. Accordingly, future research on how cross-border mergers affect domestic wages should be mindful that both spillover and bargaining effects are at play, and that the degree of union market-power and the relatedness of <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger</b> activity are critical in determining which effect dominates.

40|$|Expanding {{abroad and}} {{entering}} on foreign markets {{is a natural}} {{step in the process}} of growth and development of firms. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions represent, currently, an important tool in the competitive struggle, which is increasingly intense due to the globalization of economies, and also {{the driving force behind the}} growth of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows globally. In Romania, the share of <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions inflows in the total FDI inflows increased progressively, reaching 46, 6 % in 2006, when the highest value of these transactions was registered (5. 308 million dollars, according to UNCTAD). The aim of this empirical research is to study the correlation between the number of inward <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> acquisitions and a series of other variables, considered factors of influence, over the period 1992 - 2013. Using simple regression models, the study reveals that economic factors such as Gross domestic product (GDP), stock market capitalization (as a percentage of GDP), interest rate, exchange rate, M 2 monetary aggregate and inflation have an important role in explaining <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions inflows. Between the number of inward <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions and GDP, M 2 monetary aggregate, market capitalization, respectively the exchange rate, there is a direct and linear correlation and between the number of inward mergers and acquisitions and the interest rate, respectively the inflation, there is an inverse linear correlation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of human {{resource}} practices on organizational ambidexterity in <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. Previous research suggests that human resource practices {{play an important role}} in improving organizational performance, but that there may be contingency factors that interact with human resource practices, leading to different performance outcomes. We focus on one such potential contingency factor: distributed leadership as a key moderator that interacts with human resource practices, leading to organizational ambidexterity in <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. We examine 84 deals of emerging economies <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. We found that human resource practices positively influence the acquired firms' ambidexterity, but when we take into account the contingent role of distributed leadership, {{the effect of}} human resource practices becomes much stronger, indicating the importance of distributed leadership as a key variable that can explain variations in the success of <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions.

Using a unique dataset of 868 Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) events, the study focuses attention {{on the effect of}} macroeconomic and investor protection conditions in the countries where the companies reside over the likelihood of these companies participating in a cross-border M&A transaction. The study considers the effect of company-specific variables in the likelihood of going cross-border. Univariate analysis and logistic regressions strongly support the idea that better economic and business-friendly conditions in the countries where the target operates, increase the likelihood of <b>cross-border</b> <b>merger.</b> Results show that not only is the business environment in the target country important but also in the bidder country. Lower levels of property rights protection in the acquirer country negatively affect the likelihood of a cross-border deal.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between leverage and <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. Using a sample of 85, 560 <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions in 57 countries over the period 1990 to 2010, we find that firms with higher leverage are less likely to acquire foreign targets, whereas firms with lower leverage tend to be targets acquired by foreign firms. These effects are more pronounced in Asian countries than North America. Acquisition premium, the likelihood of all-cash offer and the percentage of cash in the acquisition offer decrease with leverage in <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. Foreign targets gain positive abnormal returns in the both short run and long run, while acquirers earn positive abnormal returns in the short-run, but negative returns in the long run. We also find that firms adjust their capital structure after the acquisition by issuing more equity if they were overleveraged, or issuing more debt if they were underleveraged before the acquisition. Our results provide international evidence on how leverage affects managerial decision to acquire foreign targets, payment method and acquisition premium in <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> on acquirers' post-merger default risk using a sample of 375 US {{acquiring}} firms from 1997 to 2011.

Our results are consistent with the asymmetric information hypothesis that managers take advantage of the overvaluation and volatility of their stock prices. We also observe that the geographic distance and industrial relatedness play significant roles in affecting post-merger default risk but find limited evidence indicating the relevance of institutional environments and cultural factors on changes in default risk.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{cross-border}} M&As have totaled over eight trillion dollars and have fluctuated widely from year to year. In this paper, I study the dynamic patterns of <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and make two distinct contributions: First, I present key facts about international mergers: (1) <b>Cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> come in waves that are highly correlated with business cycles. (2) Most mergers occur when both the acquirer and the target economies are booming. (3) Merger booms have both an industry-level component (productivity shocks) and a country-level component (financial shocks). (4) Across over one million observations, acquirers {{tend to be more}} productive and targets tend to be less productive, compared to their industry peers. These facts are consistent with the neoclassical theory of mergers in which productive firms expand overseas to seize new investment opportunities, but not with the widely held views that most <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> occur when the target economies are in a recession or face a financial crisis. Second, I construct a dynamic structural model of <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers</b> and integrate the im-portant facts above into the model. This dynamic structural approach allows me to quantify the effects of productivity and financial shocks on M&A decisions. In addition, this approach provides a proper analytical framework for conducting policy experiments. As an example of such analyses, I investigate the impact of President Obama’s proposal on multinational corporation taxation. My simulation results suggest that the foreign operation tax has economically significant effects on productive firms and can be very distortionary for <b>cross-border</b> <b>mergers...</b>|$|R
