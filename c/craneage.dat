50|$|In 1985 BET {{acquired}} the crane company G W Sparrow & Sons plc, and combined its <b>craneage</b> interests {{into a new}} subsidiary, Grayston White and Sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The {{underwater}} {{vehicles are}} all equipped with positioning systems, TV-cameras, and sonar systems, {{allowing them to}} operate in conditions of poor visibility. The maximum diving depth is 1000 m and underwater work is performed by using hydraulic manipulators {{with a range of}} interchangeable tools.The Belos (III) has a numerous <b>craneage</b> capacity. For lifting, <b>craneage</b> with a capacity of 5, 6, 10 och 100 tons is available. In addition, an A-frame in the stern with a capacity of 55 tons is used for handling the submarine rescue vessel URF.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} cleared of <b>craneage</b> {{although}} {{some evidence of}} the building berths remained visible until ca 2004. Part of the yard's covered facilities are utilised by steel stockholders GKN whilst the riverside berth has been utilised by Motherwell Bridge Engineering for heavy fabrication work.|$|E
50|$|A local {{blacksmith}} {{constructed a}} machine {{to pull the}} wagons loaded with the stone; the machine relied on human muscle power and {{was found to be}} inadequate. Apparently a locomotive was now ordered, and brought by coastal ship to the shore at Sidmouth; however there was no <b>craneage</b> available to unload it, so the ship was taken to Exmouth, where the locomotive was unloaded and brought to Sidmouth by horse and cart.|$|E
50|$|As an MSV, {{the vessel}} was always {{conceived}} to provide accommodation for about 220 persons, saturation diving facilities, a large workshop, <b>craneage,</b> and helicopter landing area with hangar and re-fueling. All were still {{featured in the}} eventual design but had been enhanced with other features and sophistication much of which was to support the emergency role. ESV incorporated novelty and ideas that were years ahead of their time. Indeed, part of the brief was that she should still be modern ten years after entering service.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{the ship}} does not anchor, but hover at the distressed {{submarine}} using her Azimuth- and bow thrusters, and the Dynamic Positioning (DP) system. Onboard Belos, an extensive array of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVâ€™s), oceanographic equipment, <b>craneage,</b> diving-, medical-, and decompression facilities are accessible. Different sonar systems {{attached to the}} hull and towed astern of the Belos {{can be used for}} searching distressed submarines or other objects at the seabed. The Belos along with the Submarine Rescue Vessel (SRV) URF compose the backbone of the Swedish Submarine Escape and Rescue System.|$|E
50|$|Ring {{discharge}} grabs have {{a single}} supporting rope or chain which means that a port with limited <b>craneage,</b> or even a ship's lifting boom can be used at a port where no facilities are available for bulk handling to load or offload the cargo. A cast steel ring is hung {{from the end of}} the boom through which the rope or chain passes to the grab. The outside of the ring has a lip at its lower edge. The top of the grab has a pivoting hook protruding from the top girder which catches the lip and allows opening and closing. The clamshell bucket on the right hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a chain ring discharge grab.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The continuous desire to improve health and safety in UK construction has in recent years been challenged to adopt offsite strategies {{in order to address}} the poor health and safety record of construction. Despite the benefits of using offsite there has been little research on the actual benefits and disadvantages of the effect of offsite on occupational health and safety. This is important given that the UK government has promoted the use of offsite to improve health and safety performance. This thesis provides a strategy for the management of offsite risk and a risk management tool has been developed. The study investigated offsite manufacturers views on offsite activities and risks in comparison with insitu activities and risks. This was achieved through three phases: phase I comprised two expert group interviews, phase II involved ergonomic audits and phase III consisted of three semi-structured interviews with three offsite manufacturers. The thesis identified that there are significant health and safety benefits of offsite. The benefits relate to specific activities within the offsite categories and context studied. Examples include the elimination of work at height, reduction in noise, reduction in work in confined space, reduction in congested work with trade overlap and greater control over work in the factory. The research revealed that there are still potential health and safety risks with offsite. Examples include; transportation and delivery of units of large size and weight with associated high consequence <b>craneage</b> and handling risks (unit fall and hand injury), whole body vibration, cuts, MSDs, RSIs, fumes and slips trips and falls. There appears to be little in the literature to support the identification of offsite risk issues. The study identified strategies to eliminate and reduce offsite residual risks. The case study investigated solutions to further reduce residual risks, which were further explored in phase III the semi-structured interviews. The solutions are grouped into four approaches: process change, workplace environment designing out risks, automation and the use of tools. An offsite risk management tool was developed which transfers knowledge from the study to provide awareness and management of offsite risk. The thesis provides a contribution to knowledge by providing a better understanding of offsite risks, offsite residual risks and strategies used to reduce residual risks...|$|E
