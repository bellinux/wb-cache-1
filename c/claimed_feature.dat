40|$|Several recent {{observations}} using standard {{rulers and}} standard candles now suggest, either individually or in combination, that the Universe {{is close to}} flat, i. e. that the curvature radius is about {{as large as the}} horizon radius (∼ 10 h^- 1 Gpc) or larger. Here, a method of distinguishing an almost flat universe from a precisely flat universe using a single observational data set, without using any microwave background information, is presented. The method (i) assumes that a standard ruler should have no preferred orientation (radial versus tangential) to the observer, and (ii) requires that the (comoving) length of the standard ruler be known independently (e. g. from low redshift estimates). The <b>claimed</b> <b>feature</b> at fixed comoving length in the power spectrum of density perturbations, detected among quasars, Lyman break galaxies or other high redshift objects, would provide an adequate standard candle to prove that the Universe is curved, if indeed it is curved. For example, a combined intrinsic and measurement uncertainty of 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} App Store Analysis {{can be used}} to {{understand}} the rich interplay between app customers and their developers. We use data mining to extract price and popularity information and natural language processing and data mining to elicit each app’s <b>claimed</b> <b>features</b> from the Blackberry App Store, revealing strong correlations between customer rating and popularity (rank of app downloads). We found evidence for a mild correlation between price and the number of <b>features</b> <b>claimed</b> for an app and also found that higher priced features tended to be lower rated by their users. We also found that free apps have significantly (p-value < 0. 001) higher rating than non-free apps, with a moderately high effect size (Â 12 = 0. 68). We also provide initial evidence that extracted <b>claimed</b> <b>features</b> are meaningful to developers (precision = 0. 71, recall = 0. 77). All data from our experiments and analysis are made available on-line to support further analysis...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the consequences of}} a non-negligible baryon fraction for models of structure formation in Cold Dark Matter dominated cosmologies, emphasizing in particular the existence of oscillations in the present-day matter power spectrum. These oscillations are the remnants of acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid before last scattering. For acceptable values of the cosmological and baryon densities, the oscillations modulate the power by up to 10 %, with a `period' in spatial wavenumber which is close to Delta k approximately 0. 05 / Mpc. We study the effects of nonlinear evolution on these features, and show that they are erased for k > 0. 2 h/ Mpc. At larger scales, the features evolve as expected from second-order perturbation theory: the visibility of the oscillations is affected only weakly by nonlinear evolution. No realistic CDM parameter combination is able to account for the <b>claimed</b> <b>feature</b> near k = 0. 1 h/ Mpc in the APM power spectrum, or the excess power at 100 Mpc/h wavelengths quoted by several recent surveys. Thus baryonic oscillations are not predicted to dominate existing measurements of clustering. We examine several effects which may mask the features which are predicted, and conclude that future galaxy surveys may be able to detect the oscillatory features in the power spectrum provided baryons comprise more than 15 % of the total density, but {{that it will be a}} technically challenging achievement.

40|$|Over {{thirty years}} ago Krugman (1965) claimed that {{learning}} of advertising messages was much more like an Ebbinghaus nonsense syllable memory task than an exercise in rhetoric. If anything, he seems even more right today in a media environment that continues to become more cluttered. In this article, we investigate the role that memory plays {{in the development of}} beliefs within this context and focus on the formation of beliefs that develop with little intention or opportunity to learn. Following on previous work, we investigate the effect of repetition-induced increases in be-lief for advertising claims that are hierarchically related: a superordinate general benefit claim (e. g., security of a lock) and multiple subordinate <b>feature</b> <b>claims</b> (e. g., pick resistant and profes-sional installation required). We find that beliefs in <b>feature</b> <b>claims</b> increase monotonically with number of exposures, although at a diminishing marginal rate. We find no evidence of horizontal spillover of repetition-induced increases in belief from one subordinate <b>feature</b> <b>claim</b> to another. However, we find a substantial amount of vertical spillover of repetition-induced increases in be-lief from individual subordinate <b>feature</b> <b>claims</b> to the superordinate general benefit. A dual media-tion analysis suggests that the vertical spillover comes from both an increase in familiarity of the general benefit and greater belief in the set of subordinate <b>feature</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R
