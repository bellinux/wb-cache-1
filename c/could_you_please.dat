500|$|... 52 was {{promoted}} as a comic that {{would attempt to}} incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q session hosted by Newsarama.com, 52 editor Michael Siglain answered {{a series of questions}} regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked [...] "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> tell us when we can expect his appearances?" [...] Siglain's simple response to readers was, [...] "check back in the late 40s." [...] Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. [...] On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for [...] "Week 48", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: [...] "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover" [...] Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, [...] "I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're {{going to get to the}} Haunted Tank). Too bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1999, Rowling said in {{interview}} {{that she was}} a great fan of Grimble by Clement Freud, saying: [...] "Grimble is one of funniest books I've ever read, and Grimble himself, who is a small boy, is a fabulous character. I'd love to see a Grimble film.

For example the injured worker might say: [...] "Dear co-workers, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> watch your tools a little more carefully, so as to prevent such cases and avoid work-place injuries?" [...] In another variant of the joke the punch line is [...] "Vasya, please desist in pouring molten tin over my head".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{joined with}} long-time Hüsker Dü sound {{engineer}} Lou Giordano to record The Rising Tide, released in June 2000. The band had {{high expectations for}} the release, and subsequently undertook a lengthy US tour. At {{the end of the}} tour, the band expressed its desire to finally reach out to its European fans by undertaking its first overseas tour. However, {{on the eve of the}} tour, Time Bomb pulled its tour funding, claiming that they simply could not afford to support the band overseas. It turned out that the label had invested a substantial amount of money in supporting Peter Searcy's <b>Could</b> <b>You</b> <b>Please</b> and Thank You, and the album had performed so poorly that the label was almost completely bankrupt. [...] Not only could they not support Sunny Day Real Estate overseas, they could no longer fund the band at all. Some weeks later, the label ceased operations. Disillusioned and disappointed, the band retreated home, and subsequently announced their disbanding.|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated {{each other}} at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. One of the more {{interesting}} aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: [...] "It has been reported [...] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" [...] This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for [...] "making aspersions" [...] and responded: [...] "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her." [...] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read: ...|$|E

50|$|While English has {{different}} registers, its levels of formality and politeness {{are not as}} formalized or as clearly defined as in Japanese. However, they can be instructive in gaining a feel for Japanese speech. English imperatives range from very blunt ("Give me the book"), to very indirect and elaborate ("If it's not too much trouble, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> be so kind as to pass me the book?"—note the use of potential form, as in Japanese).|$|E

50|$|All {{of this is}} done in {{attempt to}} avoid {{imposition}} on the hearer. Negative politeness is concerned with proceeding towards a goal in the smoothest way and with sensitivity to one's interlocutors. In English, deference ('Excuse me, sir, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> close the window') {{is associated with the}} avoidance or downplaying of an imposition; the more we feel we might be imposing, the more deferential we might be. It is clearly a strategy for negative politeness and the redressing of a threat to negative face, through actions such as favor-seeking.|$|E
