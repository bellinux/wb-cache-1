25|$|The {{line graph}} of a {{connected}} graph is connected. If G is connected, {{it contains a}} path connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in L(G) containing any two of the vertices of L(G). However, a graph G that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a <b>connected</b> <b>line</b> graph.|$|E
25|$|All line graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs {{without an}} induced {{subgraph}} {{in the form}} of a three-leaf tree. As with claw-free graphs more generally, every <b>connected</b> <b>line</b> graph L(G) with an even number of edges has a perfect matching; equivalently, this means that if the underlying graph G has an even number of edges, its edges can be partitioned into two-edge paths.|$|E
25|$|The line {{originally}} {{opened to}} provide access from the centre for the new residential areas {{in the eastern part}} of city, along the right bank of the Neva River. However, delays in the construction of the future Frunzensko-Primorskaya Line (Line 5), compelled the metro officials to temporarily link the already completed northern part of the Line 5 (starting from Sadovaya) to Pravoberezhnaya Line, as they felt that it was better to have a single <b>connected</b> <b>line</b> rather than two unconnected ones. From that point on, the line expanded northward, as per original plans of Line 5 expansion.|$|E

25|$|On 30 November 2005, {{the first}} {{underground}} leg of Line 4 from Tobalaba to Grecia, and the viaduct between Vicente Valdés and Plaza de Puente Alto {{opened to the}} public. The unfinished track from Grecia and Vicente Valdés was covered by a rail replacement bus service operated by Transantiago until 2 March 2006, when the remaining stations and track were finished. Line 4 at this time was the longest of the network, with an extension of 24.7 kilometres and 22 stations serving Providencia, Las Condes, Ñuñoa, La Reina, Peñalolén, Macul, La Florida and Puente Alto. This new line also saw {{the introduction of new}} rolling stock, the AS-2002, manufactured by Alstom in Brazil, featuring more interior space than those running other lines. Finally, Line 4 would be complemented with the opening of a branch service on 16 August 2006, Line 4A, which <b>connected</b> <b>Line</b> 2 from La Cisterna with Line 4 at Vicuña Mackenna, running through the Américo Vespucio ring road.|$|E
25|$|The Secretariat of Communications and Transport of Mexico {{proposed}} a high-speed rail link that would transport passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco, with {{stops in the}} cities of Querétaro, Guanajuato, Leon and Irapuato; and a <b>connected</b> <b>line</b> running from {{the port city of}} Manzanillo to Aguascalientes. The train which would travel at 300km/h allows passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2hours at an affordable price (the same trip by road would last 7hours). The network would also connect the network to Monterrey, Chilpancingo, Cuernavaca, Toluca, Puebla, Tijuana, Hermosillo, Cordoba, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Colima, Zacatecas, Torreon, Chihuahua, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Mexicali Saltillo and Acapulco by 2015. The whole project was projected to cost 240billion pesos, or about 25billion dollars. Mexican billionaire Carlos Helú expressed an interest in investing in high-speed rail. Most recently the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico has highlighted {{as one of the most}} probable areas for the development of high-speed rail in Latin America with the Transpeninsular Fast Train for bidding in September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The {{village of}} Thiepval was {{opposite}} {{the centre of}} the X Corps sector, on a spur within the German front position, at the junction with Bazentin Ridge. During the British preparatory bombardment, most of the sixty dwellings in the village were demolished but the house cellars were covered by fallen masonry, which protected them from all but super-heavy shells. None of the German machine-gun positions was hit and shelters excavated under the village, provided accommodation for the garrison during the bombardment and protected ammunition stores and machine-guns, ready to be set up in the open. A chain of cellars on the west fringe of the village, had been joined together to form a <b>connected</b> <b>line</b> of machine-gun posts, which had been kept silent to surprise an attacker. The château ruins in the south-west corner had also been fortified. Both sets of machine-guns could sweep all the upper western slope of Thiepval Spur and enfilade an attack further south as far as Authuille. South of Thiepval, lay the Leipzig Redoubt, at the west end of the Leipzig Salient, containing many machine-guns, which dominated no man's land, from [...] wide to the west and the south, the narrowest point being opposite Leipzig Redoubt.|$|E
