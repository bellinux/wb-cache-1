25|$|On 19 June 1916 Metzinger {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} (later renewed for 15 years) with the dealer, art collector and gallery owner Léonce Rosenberg. The agreement gave full rights for exhibitions and sales of Metzinger's production to Rosenberg.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{licensing}} of a non [...] drastic process innovation by an outside innovator to a Cournot oligopoly. We propose a new mechanism that combines a restrictive license auction with royalty licensing. This mechanism is more profitable than standard license auctions, auctioning royalty <b>contracts,</b> <b>fixed</b> [...] fee licensing, pure royalty licensing, and two-part tariffs. The key features are that royalty contracts are auctioned and that losers of the auction are granted {{the option to}} sign a royalty contract. Remarkably, combining royalties for winners and losers makes the integer constraint concerning the number of licenses irrelevant...|$|R

We address the hedging problem of such aentities which face joint price and quantity risk. Exploiting {{the correlation between}} consumption quantities and spot prices, we develope optimal, self financed hedging strategies under various assumptions regarding the uncertainty in wholesale price and consumption volume and under different models of risk aversion and hedging objectives. We then show how such strategies can be implemented using standard forward contracts and commodity derivatives...|$|R

The mitigation of typical problems of contractor selection, motivation and risk sharing between client and contractor are examined {{in the context of}} cost plus <b>fixed</b> fee <b>contracts,</b> firm <b>fixed</b> price <b>contracts,</b> and incentive contracts.

40|$|We study {{two parties}} who desire a smooth trading {{relationship}} {{under conditions of}} value and cost uncertainty. A <b>contract</b> <b>fixing</b> price works well in normal times because {{there is nothing to}} argue about. However, when value or cost is unusually high or low, one party will deviate from the contract and hold up the other party, causing deadweight losses as parties withhold cooperation. We show that allocating asset ownership and indexing contracts can reduce the incentives to engage in hold-up. In contrast to much of the literature, the driving force in our model is payoff uncertainty, rather than noncontractible investments.

25|$|The {{concession}} <b>contracts</b> <b>fixed</b> a 22 {{percent annual}} rate of return for the private operators. The net profit of Palyja varied between Rupiahs 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. Palyja’s financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rupiahs 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rupiahs 142 billion (USD 16 million). However, these profits {{are based on the}} assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators.

50|$|A formal {{request for}} the {{licensing}} of a rail network {{was made by the}} mayor of Locarno, Francesco Balli, in 1898, but although construction of the Centovalli Railway was begun in May 1913, the collapse of the financing bank later that year, together with the intervention of the First World War meant that construction was not resumed until August 1921, with the line being constructed from each end and meeting on 27 March 1923 and public service being inaugurated on 25 November 1923. On 12 November 1918 Italy and Switzerland had signed a contract aboutthe construction of a narrow gauge railway Locarno - Domodossola.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to test whether or not software agents can match the observed behavior of human subjects in laboratory tests of markets. For this purpose, one set of tests uses four software agents and two human subjects to represent six suppliers in three different market situations: no forward <b>contracts,</b> <b>fixed</b> price forward <b>contracts,</b> and renewable forward contracts. An identical set of tests is also conducted using software agents to represent all of the suppliers. The results show that software agents were able to replicate the behavior of human subjects effectively in the experiments. This indicates that software agents can be used effectively in testing electricity auctions, doing additional sensitivity tests, and supplementing results obtained using human subjects...|$|R

We find: i) Houses that eventually foreclosed sold for about 3 % less than predicted by a hedonic model, ii) Houses that eventually foreclosed sold at less of a discount to list price than houses that did not, iii) Houses that eventually foreclosed took about 12 % longer to sell than other houses, and iv) A hedonic model based predicted house price is a very strong covariate of future foreclosure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a positive theory about the contractual form of procurement contracts under cost uncertainty. However, while {{the cost of}} manufacture is uncertain it can be reduced by an amount depending {{on the extent of}} effort exerted by the agent. The effort exerted by the agent is not verifiable but causes disutility to the agent, hence, its extent will ultimately depend on the power of incentives built into the terms of reimbursement agreed to in the contract. The analysis in the paper explicitly models the possibility that the agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beliefs are ambiguous and the agent is ambiguity averse. The principal finding is that the greater the ambiguity/ambiguity aversion of the agent, the lower the power of the incentive scheme incorporated in the terms of reimbursement included in the optimal contract. procurement, incentive contracts, uncertainty aversion, cost-plus <b>contracts,</b> <b>fixed</b> price <b>contracts...</b>|$|R

The paper suggests study of the dynamic properties of each specification, following different monetary shocks on the growth rate of the money stock. We develop the analytical form of the price dynamics, and we display graphics for the responses of prices, output, and inflation. We show that the choice made {{for each of the three}} assumptions has a strong influence on the dynamic properties. Notably, the choice of the price structure, while often considered as unimportant, is indeed the most influential choice concerning the dynamic responses of output and inflation.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analytical}} {{model of a}} REDD+ mechanism with an international payment tier and a national payment tier, and calibrate land users' opportunity cost curves {{based on data from}} Sumatra.

Our paper shows that a fixed-price scheme is likely to be more efficient than an opportunity-cost compensation scheme at low international carbon prices, when the government is "benevolent" or when variation in opportunity cost within land users is high relative to variation in opportunity cost across land users. Thus, a PES program which pays local communities or land users based on the value of the service provided by avoided deforestation may not only distribute REDD revenue more equitably than an opportunity cost-based payment system, but may be more cost-efficient as well. ...|$|R
