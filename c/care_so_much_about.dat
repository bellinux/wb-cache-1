500|$|In 1962 {{she left}} Martha Jackson Gallery {{for a brief}} stint at the Sidney Janis Gallery. After an {{unsuccessful}} first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her {{and was unable to}} recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, [...] "I wouldn't ordinarily have gone. I didn't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed {{to get out of town}} and all of my expenses were paid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you help}} me, if I--er--try {{to fix that}} Dave Porter?" [...] asked Nat. [...] "He started it. I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Lawrence." ...|$|E
60|$|SIBYL. But I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{defying the}} philosophers, {{if only one}} could get {{a clear idea of}} life, or soul, for one's self.|$|E

5000|$|After Brian returned, Seth MacFarlane said: [...] "Thanks for <b>caring</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the canine Griffin, he is {{overcome}} with gratitude". MacFarlane {{also said that}} [...] "we'd have to be fucking high" [...] to kill Brian permanently.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was growing}} dusky in the room, and the youth, though still rebellious, was profoundly {{affected}} by this action. His hot anger died away and a swift repentance softened him. [...] "Don't cry, mother," [...] he said, clumsily kneeling beside her. [...] "I didn't think you <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the old thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No Sally; it's not my secret. I wish I {{could do}} something--help them somehow. Yes, it's sure a terrible mix. I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just at {{this time}} of the day we don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, Mr. Crawley; and one doesn't catch a new cousin every day, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> bonnets, Mary!" [...] This {{the doctor said}} as an assertion; but there was, nevertheless, {{somewhat}} of a question involved in it.|$|E
5000|$|He {{attended}} Somerset College on the Gold Coast and says, [...] "I loved Drama in high school. For {{me it was}} a real {{escape from}} teenage life. I had a wonderful drama teacher at Somerset College ... who <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Arts." [...] He continued to act in theatre on the Gold Coast after leaving school.|$|R
50|$|As a {{child he}} resided in Staten Island. Bruce Kershner {{obtained}} degrees from Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. He most recently resided in Amherst {{with his wife}} Helene. He taught high school biology at John F. Kennedy High School in Cheektowaga, NY until 2005 where he established the Environmental Club, exposing many of his students to the old grown forests he <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Claire--look---- You don't really <b>care</b> <b>so</b> terribly <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{these little}} luxuries, food and fixin's and six-dollar-a-day-hotel junk, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not {{suppose that}} Miss Temple would <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what I was saying, {{but she did}} seem to care, and listened attentively to every word.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{staying in}} the room," [...] was the reply. [...] "But I can assure you of one thing,--I am not going without my supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am his darling. Only {{it sounds}} so {{conceited}} in any girl to say so. Why should he <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> me?--or why should you, for the matter of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>care</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> hurting folks' feelings?" [...] {{observed}} Henchard {{with a half}} sneer. [...] "You do, I know--especially mine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> that," [...] {{said the}} {{cautious}} Captain, {{who began to}} perceive that he need not be specially bitter against the lady.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mother did. And {{now because}} it did not go off all serene, I am to hear nothing but reproaches. Of course I never <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think, Theodore, I <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{my own way}} as {{some women}} do. I am sure I always think your opinion is better than my own--that is, in most things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I may. If I {{can only}} get my heart to turn to stone, then I shall. I don't know why I should {{have been made to}} <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. Other people don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, father, {{and he is}} not," [...] said Maria, {{approaching}} her father, {{and taking}} his hand; [...] "but {{he wants to go}} very much, and I do not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it; so he may go, and I will stay at home." ...|$|E
50|$|Hicks threatens Priest, {{claiming}} he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she's been infected or not. (Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, {{who is in}} love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he'd kill her.) Hicks doesn't understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, <b>cares</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> her. Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{she is not}} {{forthcoming}} when Miles asks why she <b>cares</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> him. But after Miles later quits being Spider-Man following personal tragedy, Jessica reveals to Miles {{that she}} is Peter's clone. She explains that although she has Parker's memories, she is not Spider-Man but knows that someone must be, and that person is Miles, convincing him to resume the Spider-Man identity. Eventually, Spider-Woman and Spider-Man team up with Cloak & Dagger and Bombshell as a ragtag team of youths in fighting Roxxon's Brain Trust as well as confronting Philip R. Roxxon.|$|R
50|$|She has {{a strong}} sense of {{morality}} and {{will be the first to}} challenge her sister or mother if she thinks they are out of line. This makes life very complicated for her when she finds herself in a dubious moral situation: she falls for German airman Bernhardt Tellemann. Because Angelique <b>cares</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what others - especially her mother and sister - think of her, she initially refuses to admit her feelings to herself, but eventually gives into them and embarks on a relationship with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{she should}} marry him, how could I be sure that--afterwards--you would <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the {{question}} which has all our thoughts, hers and mine?" [...] This inquiry evolved itself from Olive's rapid meditation; but even to herself it seemed a little rough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't," [...] she answered. [...] "No one could. As for you, I suppose you will marry Louise. What {{will happen to}} you after that, I don't know. Perhaps I sha'n't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> London then. You've made it very nice for me, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{wait till the}} time comes," [...] {{she said to her}} sister. [...] "Perhaps next May you won't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> London. Mr. Beaumont and I," [...] she went on, smiling at her companion, [...] "have had a {{tremendous}} discussion. We don't agree about anything. It's perfectly delightful." ...|$|E
50|$|Trilling sees Rudyard Kipling as {{a writer}} {{belonging}} “irrevocably to our past;” specifically, the past of childhood, where a justified rejection of him represents “our first literary-political decision.” Kipling, Trilling writes, was “one of liberalism’s major intellectual misfortunes.” Trilling describes Kipling as unlovable because of the mindlessness of his ideas, most especially of his “mindless imperialism,” which made readers react against him as a dangerous proponent of nationalism and national values. In so doing, Trilling argues, Kipling did damage to the very national values he <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R

50|$|His {{father was}} a strict person, always pushing his son to go further, a trait which his son would inherit. Whenever the future King would fail a task, or do it incorrectly, he would be punished harshly by his father. Despite being strict and harsh to the future King, he <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> his son. He was a boxer in his younger years. While good, {{he was not the}} best, and in one telling scene, after losing first place in a boxing tournament, the Emperor throws his son’s second-place trophy into the river out of disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} have a journey to Pretoria before us," [...] Sankey said. [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> myself, because that is only the fortune of war, but I am awfully sorry that you are taken, Chris, and all through my beastly folly in not taking shelter as you told me." ...|$|E
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a man and his wife who had seven boys. The {{children}} lived in the open air and grew big and strong, and the six eldest spent part of every day hunting wild beasts. The youngest did not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> sport, and he often stayed with his mother.|$|E
60|$|With the {{thoughts}} of bringing down one or more deer filling their minds, the boy hunters did not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> making a camp for the night. If necessary, they knew they could erect their tent anywhere, and take it down again in the morning. Even the prospect of rain did not daunt them.|$|E
5000|$|On Armistice Day 1941, Mrs. Crapsey wrote {{a letter}} to the editor of the Courier-Gazette {{newspaper}} in Newark, New York, a town about thirty-five miles from Rochester. She enclosed a check to be used to send the paper to men in the armed services from Newark. The letter explained why she <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> soldiers: [...] "A very young and beloved Uncle was in the Mexican War and killed in his first battle. My husband was in the Civil War. Two of my Sons were in the Spanish-American War and my youngest Son was in the World War." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{pretty much}} as you say, Sir John," [...] he continued; [...] "in England you may press men, but it won't do to press hospitality. Get a {{volunteer}} in this way, and he {{is as good a}} fellow as heart can wish. I shouldn't have <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the chap's book, if he had said nothin' ag'in the rum. Why, Sir John, when the English bombarded Stunin'tun with eighteen pounders, I proposed to load our old twelve with a gallon out of the very same cask, for I do think it would have huv' the shot the best part of a mile!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you," [...] said Herbert. [...] "But the blow has fallen, and as for myself, I believe that I can bear it. I do not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the property." ...|$|R
