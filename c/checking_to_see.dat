The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|Rico's {{choice is}} taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves {{with a sense}} of estrangement. He is {{assigned}} to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated enough not to resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.|$|E

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{miscarriage}} include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and {{drug or alcohol}} use. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the cervix is open or closed, testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.|$|E

Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her hands off the steering wheel, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal. When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal, the car will then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} drivers and TSRs, {{is that they}} would use {{different}} amounts of conventional and/or upper memory, based on the order they were loaded. This {{could be used to}} advantage if the programs were repeatedly loaded in different orders, and <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how much memory was free after each permutation. For example, if there was a 50 KB UMB and a 10 KB UMB, and programs needing 8 KB and 45 KB were loaded, the 8 KB might go into the 50 KB UMB, preventing the second from loading. Later versions of DOS allowed the use of a specific load address for a driver or TSR, to fit drivers/TSRs more tightly together.|$|E
25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Figure 1, for instance, a first step would be {{to decide on the}} piece sizes to be used (in this case all the same), and the shape of the desired target. An initial program would then be able to {{generate}} a list L corresponding to every possible tiling of this target shape by 3 distinct decominoes (polyominoes of size 10). Each decomino is represented by a unique integer, so that L will consist of a list of integer triads. A subsequent routine can then run through and test every combination of three different triads in turn. The test will consist in treating the candidate triads as the row entries in a 3×3 square, and then <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether the columns and diagonals thus formed each contain 3 integers that are also in L—which is to say, are also target-tiling triads. If so, a 3×3 geomagic square using 9 decominoes and selected target has been identified. If this fails, alternative target shapes can be tried. An elaborated version of the same method can be used to search for larger squares, or for squares including differently-sized pieces.|$|E
500|$|A {{police officer}} interrogates Parker (Julie Gonzalo) about her rape, {{but she does}} not {{remember}} any of it. Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was happening. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) sociology professor recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck in a bear trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they just drive her home.|$|E
2500|$|Obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is {{a mental}} disorder where people {{feel the need}} to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called [...] "rituals"), or have certain thoughts repeatedly. People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur {{to such a degree that}} the person's daily life is negatively affected. Often they take up more than an hour a day. Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense. The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled culpable homicide. Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to James Grauerholz, two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was <b>checking</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if it was loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story. Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel Queer while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs's attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to Ted Morgan, to [...] "skip" [...] and return to the United States. He was convicted in absentia of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.|$|E
