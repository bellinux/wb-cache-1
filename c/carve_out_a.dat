5|$|While Ferdinand {{kept the}} French occupied, Prussia {{had to contend}} with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> piece of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was {{increasingly}} concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.|$|E

25|$|The legendary {{religious}} zeal of the Normans was {{exercised in}} religious wars {{long before the}} First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch. They were major foreign participants in the Reconquista in Iberia. In 1018, Roger de Tosny travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> state for himself from Moorish lands, but failed. In 1064, during the War of Barbastro, William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the colonists}} were {{governed by a}} {{president}} and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped {{with varying degrees of}} success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new settlement on a frontier. When Captain John Smith became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with Chief Powhatan's people improved.|$|E

25|$|Relations between Arabs and Berbers in al-Andalus {{had been}} tense {{in the years}} after the conquest. Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were {{assigned}} the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> rebel state in Cerdanya for a while.|$|E
25|$|The temple is spiritually {{the most}} {{significant}} shrine in Sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s. In the early 1980s, the temple became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a militant movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new nation named Khalistan from parts of India and Pakistan. In 1984, Gandhi sent in the army, leading to numerous deaths of militants, soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the temple {{and the destruction of}} Akal Takht. The temple complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, Philip of Flanders {{arrived in}} Jerusalem on pilgrimage; he was Baldwin IV's cousin, {{and the king}} offered him the regency and command of the army, both of which Philip refused, {{although}} he objected to the appointment of Raynald as regent. Philip then attempted {{to intervene in the}} negotiations for Sibylla's second husband, and suggested one of his own retinue, but the native barons refused his suggestion. In addition, Philip seemed to think he could <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> territory of his own in Egypt, but he refused to participate with the planned Byzantine-Jerusalem expedition. The expedition was delayed and finally cancelled, and Philip took his army away to the north.|$|E

25|$|It is suspected, though, {{that the}} figures of Bangladeshi {{migrants}} in India are too far-fetched to be accorded any credence. The diplomatic difficulty is increased {{by the failure of}} conspiracy theorists in India to comprehend that supporting Indian rebels in a plot to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Greater Bangladesh would bring very little strategic dividend to Bangladesh. Scholars have also reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. There also is an alleged parallel threat of turning Assam into a part of a Greater West Bengal.|$|E
25|$|At {{least nine}} Mexican and Colombian drug cartels have {{established}} bases in 11 West African nations. They are reportedly {{working closely with}} local criminal gangs to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> staging area {{for access to the}} lucrative European market. The Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that {{it is much easier to}} smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to Europe – mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. Higher demand for cocaine in Western Europe in addition to North American interdiction campaigns has led to dramatically increased trafficking in the region: nearly 50% of all non-U.S. bound cocaine, or about 13% of all global flows, is now smuggled through West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Sunni Muslim traders of the Shafi'i fiqh, {{as well as}} Sufi Muslim traders from India, Oman and Yemen brought Islam to Indonesia. The {{earliest}} known {{mention of}} a small Islamic community midst the Hindus of Indonesia is credited to Marco Polo, about 1297 AD, whom he {{referred to as a}} new community of Moorish traders in Perlak. Over 15th and 16th centuries, a Muslim militant campaign led by Sultans attacked Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms and various communities in the Indonesian archipelago, with each Sultan trying to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> region or island for control. Four diverse and contentious Islamic Sultanates emerged in north Sumatra (Aceh), south Sumatra, west and central Java, and in southern Borneo (Kalimantan).|$|E

25|$|The wave of {{raids on}} north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords {{continued}} after Mahmud of Ghazni. The raids did not establish or extend permanent boundaries of their Islamic kingdoms. The Ghurid sultan Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori, {{commonly known as}} Muhammad of Ghor, began a systematic war of expansion into north India in 1173. He sought to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world. Muhammad of Ghor sought a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus {{laid the foundation for}} the Muslim kingdom called the Delhi Sultanate. Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Muhammad Ghori in South Asia by that time.|$|E

25|$|The nearly {{simultaneous}} {{invasions of}} Honduras in 1524 by rival Spanish expeditions began {{an era of}} conflict among rival Spanish claimants {{as well as with}} the indigenous population. The major initial expeditions were led by Gil González Dávila, who hoped to <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> territory for his own rule, and by Cristóbal de Olid, who was dispatched from Cuba by Cortés. Once in Honduras, however, Olid succumbed to personal ambition and attempted to establish his own independent authority. Word of this reached Cortés in Mexico, and to restore his own authority, he ordered yet another expedition, this one under the command of Francisco de Las Casas. Then, doubting the trustworthiness of any subordinate, Cortés set out for Honduras himself. The situation was further complicated by the entry into Honduras of expeditions from Guatemala under Pedro de Alvarado and from Nicaragua under Hernando de Soto.|$|E
