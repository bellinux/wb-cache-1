The {{purpose of this study}} was to report preliminary normative ranges of sciatic nerve excursion using real time ultrasound during a modified SLR. The sciatic nerve was scanned in the posterior thigh in sixteen asymptomatic participants (age range 19 - 68 years). Nerve excursion was measured in transverse and longitudinal planes during knee extension from 90 ° to 0 °, with the hip flexed to 30 ° and 60 °. The ultrasound data was analysed off-line using <b>cross</b> correlation <b>software.</b> Results demonstrated that most nerves moved superficially during knee extension, a large proportion (10 / 16) moved laterally. Longitudinal excursion ranged from 6. 4 to 14. 7  mm (mean (SD) 9. 92  mm (2. 2)) in 30 ° hip flexion, and 5. 1 - 20. 2  mm (mean (SD) 12. 4  mm (4. 4)) in 60 ° hip flexion. Mean nerve excursion was significantly greater in 60 ° hip flexion (p =  0. 02). There is a large between-subject variation in sciatic nerve excursion during this modified SLR in asymptomatic subjects. Mean nerve excursion was found to be higher with the hip pre-positioned in greater flexion, suggesting that pre-loading may not consistently reduce excursion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Automotive chassis is an {{important}} part of an automobile. It forms the bones of a vehicle. The chassis serves as a frame work for supporting the body and different parts of the automobile, it should be rigid enough to withstand the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses & its principle function is to carry the maximum load for all designed operating condition safely. An important consideration in chassis design is to have adequate bending stiffness along with strength for better handling characteristics. Therefore, maximum shear stress and deflection are important criteria for the chassis design. This paper describes Structural analysis & optimization of vehicle chassis with constraints of maximum shear stress and deflection of chassis under maximum load. In the present work, we have taken higher strength as the main issue, so the dimensions of an existing vehicle chassis of a TATA LP 912 Diesel BS 4 bus is taken for analysis with materials namely Steel alloy (Austenitic) subjected to the same load. The four different vehicle chassis have been modeled by considering four different cross-sections. Namely C, I, Rectangular Box (Hollow) and Rectangular Box (Intermediate) type cross sections. For validation the design is done by applying the vertical loads acting on the horizontal different <b>cross</b> sections. <b>Software</b> used in this work Pro e 4. 0 & Altai...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a general statistical {{framework for the}} genetic analysis of quantitative trait data in inbred line crosses. Our main result {{is based on the}} observation that, by conditioning on the unobserved QTL genotypes, the problem can be split into two statistically independent and manageable parts. The first part involves only the relationship between the QTL and the phenotype. The second part involves only the location of the QTL in the genome. We developed a simple Monte Carlo algorithm to implement Bayesian QTL analysis. This algorithm simulates multiple versions of complete genotype information on a genomewide grid of locations using information in the marker genotype data. Weights are assigned to the simulated genotypes to capture information in the phenotype data. The weighted complete genotypes are used to approximate quantities needed for statistical inference of QTL locations and effect sizes. One advantage of this approach is that only the weights are recomputed as the analyst considers different candidate models. This device allows the analyst to focus on modeling and model comparisons. The proposed framework can accommodate multiple interacting QTL, nonnormal and multivariate phenotypes, covariates, missing genotype data, and genotyping errors in any type of inbred line <b>cross.</b> A <b>software</b> tool implementing this procedure is available. We demonstrate our approach to QTL analysis using data from a mouse backcross population that is segregating multiple interacting QTL associated with salt-induced hypertension...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the reliability of a frame-by-frame cross correlation method of assessing longitudinal sciatic nerve excursion motion using real time ultrasound imaging during a modified passive straight leg raise (SLR) test. Eighteen asymptomatic participants (age range 19 - 68 years) lay on their sides on a purpose made jig and the sciatic nerve in the posterior thigh was imaged during knee extension at 30 ° and then 60 ° of hip flexion (HF). Participants were re-tested ≥ 48 h later. The ultrasound images were analysed off-line using <b>cross</b> correlation <b>software.</b> Results demonstrated excellent repeatability of in vivo sciatic nerve excursion during a modified SLR (HF 30 ° ICC 0. 92, CI 0. 79 - 0. 97, SEM 0. 69; HF 60 ° ICC 0. 96, CI 0. 89 - 0. 99, SEM 0. 87). The authors also identify points of good practise to ensure an accurate as possible measurement of nerve excursion using this method. These include breaking down larger movements into sub-components, visually tracking the moving nerve during the tracking procedure, and ensuring the optimal image is captured prior to analysis. The use of ultrasound imaging in lower limb nerve dysfunction will enhance the understanding of how nerves move in vivo during neurodynamic testing, as well as being able to identify possible alteration to nerve movements in patients with neuropathic pain states...|$|R

40|$|Background: Minimal data {{exists on}} in-vivo sciatic nerve motion during {{straight}} leg raise (SLR), particularly in symptomatic participants. Such data could help clinicians {{to better understand}} nerve mechanic changes following nerve dysfunction. Design: Cross-sectional, controlled laboratory study. Objectives: To investigate whether individuals with spinally referred leg pain have different nerve excursion patterns compared to healthy participants. Method: The sciatic nerve was scanned using ultrasound imaging in the posterior thigh in asymptomatic participants, and individuals with spinally referred leg pain sub-grouped into somatic pain, radicular pain or radiculopathy. Nerve excursion was measured in transverse and longitudinal planes during a side-lying modified SLR. The ultrasound data was analysed off-line using <b>cross</b> correlation <b>software.</b> Longitudinal plane data was collected from 16 asymptomatic and 60 symptomatic participants and transverse plane data from 16 asymptomatic and 56 symptomatic participants. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in longitudinal nerve excursion between the 4 groups. The direction of transverse plane motion altered between groups. These varied movements may be related to protective muscle activation between the groups, although this is speculative at present. Conclusion: Longitudinal sciatic nerve excursion at the posterior thigh during a modified SLR is not different between asymptomatic participants and those with spinally referred leg pain. Transverse plane movement appears to be more varied. This may suggest that in individuals with nerve root pain, there is no restriction in nerve excursion. However, as it was not possible to measure excursion at the nerve root, more research is needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
