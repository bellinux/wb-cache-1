5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} <b>contaminated</b> with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of <b>contaminated</b> soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be <b>contaminated</b> by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be <b>contaminated</b> through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the <b>contaminated</b> areas. The movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification. The areas most heavily <b>contaminated</b> with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.|$|E

However, the presence of asymmetric information impedes the implementation of the first-best policy. As a solution to this problem a site specific deposit refund system for the <b>contaminating</b> input and the <b>contaminating</b> byproduct are proposed.

40|$|Abstract- In some applications, {{channel noise}} {{is the sum}} of a Gaussian noise and a {{relatively}} weak non-Gaussian <b>contaminating</b> noise. Although the ca-pacity of such channels cannot be evaluated in general, we analyze the decrease in capacity, or sensitivity of the channel capacity to the weak <b>contaminating</b> noise. We show that for a very large class of <b>contaminating</b> noise processes, explicit expressions for the sensitivity of a discrete-time channel capacity do exist. Sensitiv-ity is shown to depend on the <b>contaminating</b> process distribution only through its autocorrelation function and so it coincides with the sensitivity with respect to a Gaussian <b>contaminating</b> noise with the same auto-correlation function. A key result is a formula for the derivative of the water-filling capacity with respect t...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} laws {{of spatial}} distribution {{of the values of}} the biosedimentation speed have been studied. The streams of the suspended matter from the photic zone of the seas have been determined. The question {{about the role of the}} biosedimentation in the removal of the <b>contaminating</b> substances from the sea ecosystems has been investigated. The evaluations of the removal of the priority <b>contaminating</b> substance (PVCP, DDT, cadmium, mercury) from the ecosystems of the Baltic and Black Seas have been obtained. The time of the <b>contaminating</b> substances staying in the activating layer of the seas has been shown. The developed methods of the data analysis by the biosedimentation ans removal of the <b>contaminating</b> and removal of the <b>contaminating</b> substances allow to realize the designs of the streams of the suspended organic substance and toxicants in the sea regionsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations <b>contaminated</b> the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the <b>contaminated</b> rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of contamination in next-generation optical storage drives are paramount when active gap control is employed. In near-field recording devices, the read/write interface {{can be on}} the order of 20 - 30 nm, which means that the gap could be quite susceptible to contamination. Predictive modeling approaches for studying the behavior of <b>contaminates</b> in nanoscale hydrodynamic interfaces are needed. Here, we present such a model. The interface consists of a flat disk surface translating under a solid immersion lens (SIL) of hemispherical geometry. We present the computational modeling simulation results for nano-scale <b>contaminates</b> around the near-field SIL. The simulation shows that the discrete <b>contaminates</b> actually circumnavigate the SIL/disk interface during operation. We identify and discuss the external influences on the discrete <b>contaminate</b> particle behavior...|$|R

Although the capacity of such channels cannot be evaluated in general, we analyze the decrease in capacity, or sensitivity of the channel capacity to the weak <b>contaminating</b> noise. The main result of this paper is that for a very large class of contaminat-ing noise processes, explicit expressions for the sensitivity of a discrete-time channel capacity do exist.
