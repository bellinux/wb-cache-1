We test the predictions using a novel data set including all real-time transactions of institutional investors in the German stock market.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{empirical evidence}} on the viability of a form of volatility trading known as "dispersion trading. " The results {{shed light on the}} efficiency with which U. S. options markets price volatility. Using end-of-day implied volatilities extracted from equity option prices for the stocks that comprise the S&P 500, the implied volatility of the S&P 500 is computed using a modification of the Markowitz variance equation. This Markowitz-implied volatility is then compared to the implied volatility of the S&P 500 extracted directly from index options on the S&P 500. These contemporaneous measures of implied volatility are then examined for exploitable discrepancies both with and without transaction costs. The study covers the period October 31, 2005 through November 1, 2007. It is shown that, from a trader's perspective, index option implied volatility tended to be more often "rich" and component volatilities tended to be more often "cheap. " Nevertheless, there were times when the opposite was true; suggesting that potential dispersion trades can run in either direction.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{variance}} risk and correlation {{risk in the}} equity market, and consists of three essays. The first essay demonstrates that the variance risk, mea- sured as {{the difference between the}} realized return variance and its risk-neutral expectation, is an important determinant of the cross-sectional variation of hedge fund returns. Empirical evidence shows that funds with significantly higher loadings on variance risk outperform lower-loading funds on average. However, they incur severe losses during market downturns. Failure to account for variance risk results in overestimation of funds' absolute returns and underestimation of risk. The results provide important implications for hedge fund risk management and performance evaluations. The second essay examines the empirical properties of a widely-used correlation risk proxy, namely the dispersion trade between the index and individual stock options. I find that discrete hedging errors in such trading strategy can result in incorrect inferences on the magnitude of correlation risk premium and render the proxy unreliable as a measure of pure exposure to correlation risk. I implement a dynamic hedging scheme for the dispersion trade, which significantly improves the estimation accuracy of correlation risk and enhances the risk-return profile of the trading strategy. Finally, the third essay aims to forecast the average pair-wise correlations between stocks in the market portfolio. I investigate a comprehensive list of forecasting models and find that past average correlation and the option-implied correlation provide superior out-of-sample forecasting performance compared to other predictors. I provide empirical evidence showing that the forecasts of average correlation can improve the optimal portfolio choices and substantially enhance the performance of active <b>correlation</b> <b>trading</b> strategies.

30|$|Private {{information}} may {{also lead to}} serial <b>correlation</b> in <b>trades,</b> since informed investors try to prevent conveying their information to the market by splitting their orders and buy or sell repeatedly until the price has moved to the extent indicated by their information (Kyle 1985, p.  1330). Similar effects occur when institutions split large orders to reduce price impact, sometimes over several days (Chan and Lakonishok 1995, p.  1152). Herding (see, e.g., Lakonishok et al. 1992) e.g., due to peer group pressure (see, e.g., Lee et al. 2004, p.  332) information cascades (Chiao et al. 2011, p.  132) or processing correlated (Chiao et al. 2011, p.  132) or even the same public (Lakonishok et al. 1992, p.  26) or private information (Hasbrouck and Seppi 2001, p.  386), positive feedback trading (Lakonishok et al. 1992, p.  26) or exogenous factors (Hasbrouck and Seppi 2001, p.  386) will also lead to serial <b>correlation</b> in <b>trades.</b> This amplifies the inventory holding and adverse selection effects described above.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{experience}} of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has stimulated the debate over currency union and reinforced the incentive {{for the emergence of}} currency blocs in other regions of the world. This paper builds a dynamic stochastic model-based on network externalities operating through trade channels-to explain the emergence of currency blocs, and specifically, why some countries join a currency union earlier than others. The paper develops and formalizes the intuition that currency bloc formation is path dependent, and that countries join currency blocs sooner the more they trade with the bloc member countries, with each additional member serving in a dynamic way to attract more members into the bloc. Evidence from the current pattern of EMU expansion supports the model, which is later used to elaborate on the pattern of further expansion of the union.

Stylized facts {{play a significant role}} in the testing whether models agree with known statistical anomalies and phenomena that occur in financial markets or not. Thus, we can use these stylized facts as a modelling tool or just to understand the general behavior of financial markets better. In the paper by Bouchaud et al in 2004 [1] we see the promotion of a new stylized fact that <b>correlations</b> in <b>trade</b> signs fail to die out, even after large lags. In fact, Bouchaud et al expressed the correlations as a slow power-law decay over trade ticks. In the results of our empirical study of JSE and BM&FBOVESP we find that the selected stocks show the this same power-law decay of <b>correlations</b> of <b>trade</b> signs.

40|$|This paper derives {{a general}} {{relationship}} among intra-industry trade, specialization, and gravity. This relationship holds in any two-country trade model under assumptions that are frequently adopted in theoretical trade models. Using this general relationship, {{we can take}} an integrated approach {{to the theory of}} intra-industry trade. In two-good, two-factor models, this relationship implies that the intensity of intra-industry trade is decreasing in the difference in factor proportions and is increasing in the product of per-worker GDPs. Thus, the popular assertion that a negative correlation between the intensity of intra- industry trade and the difference in factor proportions supports monopolistic competition is groundless. Using panel data on bilateral trade flows, we estimate these relationships. We find that the negative <b>correlation</b> between intra-industry <b>trade</b> and specialization is quite robust.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{portfolio}} choice and stock trading volume with loss-averse investors. The demand function for risky assets is discontinuous and nonmonotonic: As wealth rises beyond a threshold, investors follow a generalized portfolio insurance strategy, {{which is consistent with}} the disposition effect. In addition, loss-averse investors hold no stocks unless the equity premium is quite high. The elasticity of the aggregate demand curve changes substantially, depending on the distribution of wealth across investors. In an equilibrium setting, the model generates positive <b>correlation</b> between <b>trading</b> volume and stock return volatility but suggests that this relationship is nonlinear. ...|$|R
