30|$|The {{absence of}} pupillary light {{response}} is not sufficiently predictive {{when it is}} sought on admission, due to a high false-positive rate, which can reach 30 % [37]. Several additional clinical findings accurately predict poor outcome: myoclonus status epilepticus within the first 24 hours, absence of pupillary responses within days 1 to 3 after CPR, absence of <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes</b> within days 1 to 3 after CA, and absent or extensor motor responses after 3 days [37, 38]. Thus, the prognosis is invariably poor in comatose patients with absent pupillary or <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes,</b> or absent or extensor motor responses 3 days after CA. On the opposite, single seizures and sporadic focal myoclonus do not accurately predict poor outcome. In the same way, although permanent status epilepticus {{is associated with a}} mortality approaching 100 %, exceptions have been reported.|$|R

We calculated sensitivity and false positive rate for Glasgow Coma Scale motor score (GCS M), pupillary and <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes</b> and SSEP to predict poor neurological outcome using prospective data from the Target Temperature Management after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Trial which randomised 939 comatose survivors to treatment at either 33 °C or 36 °C. Poor outcome was defined as severe disability, vegetative state or death (Cerebral Performance Category scale 3 - 5) at six months. 313 patients (33 %) were prognostically assessed; 168 in the 33 °C, and 145 in the 36 °C group. A GCS M ≤ 2 had a false positive rate of 19. 1 % to predict poor outcome due to nine false predictions.

In marked contrast, the figure cited from Daoust et al.'s report represents the number of seals clubbed or shot that were brought on board sealing vessels while still conscious.

[...] Another difference between these reports is [...] "Daoust et al.'s direct observations were made under very different conditions than those provided by Burdon et al. Unlike Burdon et al.'s observations, they were made directly from sealing vessels so that the sealers were unavoidably aware that observers were present. As Daoust et al.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} review {{outcomes in}} comatose survivors after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). METHODS: The authors analyzed studies (1966 to 2006) that explored predictors of death or unconsciousness after 1 month or unconsciousness or severe disability after 6 months. RESULTS: The authors identified four class I studies, three class II studies, and five class III studies on clinical findings and circumstances. The indicators of poor outcome after CPR are absent pupillary light response or <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes,</b> and extensor or no motor response to pain after 3 days of observation (level A), and myoclonus status epilepticus (level B). Prognosis cannot {{be based on}} circumstances of CPR (level B) or elevated body temperature (level C). The authors identified one class I, one class II, and nine class III studies on electrophysiology. Bilateral absent cortical responses on somatosensory evoked potential studies recorded 3 days after CPR predicted poor outcome (level B). Burst suppression or generalized epileptiform discharges on EEG predicted poor outcomes but with insufficient prognostic accuracy (level C). The authors identified one class I, 11 class III, and three class IV studies on biochemical markers. Serum neuron-specific enolase higher than 33 microg/L predicted poor outcome (level B). Ten class IV studies on brain monitoring and neuroimaging did not provide data to support or refute usefulness in prognostication (level U). CONCLUSION: Pupillary light response, <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes,</b> motor responses to pain, myoclonus status epilepticus, serum neuron-specific enolase, and somatosensory evoked potential studies can reliably assist in accurately predicting poor outcome in comatose patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arres...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Outcome {{studies in}} {{patients}} with anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy focus on the early and reliable prediction of an outcome no better than a vegetative state or severe disability. We determined the effect of mild therapeutic hypothermia on {{the validity of the}} currently used clinical practice parameters. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult comatose patients after cardiac arrest treated with hypothermia. All data were collected from medical charts and laboratory files and analyzed from the day of admission to the intensive care unit until day 7, discharge from the intensive care unit or death using the Utstein definitions for the registration of the data. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 103 patients. The combination of an M 1 or M 2 on the Glasgow Coma Scale or absent pupillary reactions or absent <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes</b> on day 3 was present in 80. 6 % of patients with an unfavourable and 11. 1 % of patients with a favourable outcome.

None of the patients with a favourable outcome had a bilaterally absent somatosensory evoked potential of the median nerve.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish the reliability of neurologic examination, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and median nerve somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) to predict poor outcome in patients treated with mild hypothermia after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods: This multicenter prospective cohort study included adult comatose patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after CPR and treated with hypothermia (32 - 34 °C). False-positive rates (FPRs 1 - specificity) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for pupillary light responses, <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes,</b> and motor scores 72 hours after CPR; NSE levels at admission, 12 hours after reaching target temperature, and 36 hours and 48 hours after collapse; and SEPs during hypothermia and after rewarming. The primary outcome was poor outcome, defined as death, vegetative state, or severe disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1 - 3) after 6 months. Results: Of 391 patients included, 53 % had a poor outcome. Absent pupillary light responses (FPR 1; 95 % CI, 0 - 7) or absent <b>corneal</b> <b>reflexes</b> (FPR 4; 95 % CI, 1 - 13) 72 hours after CPR, and absent SEPs during hypothermia (FPR 3; 95 % CI, 1 - 7) and after rewarming (FPR 0; 95 % CI, 0 - 18) were reliable predictors. Motor scores 72 hours after CPR (FPR 10; 95 % CI, 6 - 16) and NSE levels were not. Interpretation: In patients with persisting coma after CPR and therapeutic hypothermia, use of motor score or NSE, as recommended in current guidelines, could possibly lead to inappropriate withdrawal of treatment.
