50|$|Chromatophores are color pigment {{changing}} {{cells that}} are directly stimulated by central motor neurons. They are primarily used for quick environmental adaptation for camouflaging. The process of changing the color pigment of their skin relies on a single highly developed <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> and many muscles, nerves, glail and sheath cells. Chromatophores contract and contain vesicles that stores three different liquid pigments. Each color is indicated by {{the three types of}} chromatophore cells: erythrophores, melanophores, and xanthophores. The first type is the erythrophores, which contains reddish pigments such as carotenoids and pteridines. The second type is the melanophores, which contains black and brown pigments such as the melanins. The third type is the xanthophores which contains yellow pigments in the forms of carotenoids. The various colors are made by the combination of the different layers of the chromatophores. These cells are usually located beneath the skin or scale the animals. There are two categories of colors generated by the cell - biochrome and schematochromes. Biochromes are colors chemically formed microscopic, natural pigments. Their chemical composition is created to take in some color of light and reflect the rest. In contrast, schematochromes (structural colors) are colors created by light reflections from a colorless surface and refractions by tissues. Schematochromes act like prisms, refracting and dispersing visible light to the surroundings, which will eventually reflect a specific combination of colors. These categories are determined by the movement of pigments within the chromatophores. The physiological color changes are short-term and fast, found in fishes, and are a result from an animal’s response to a change in the environment. In contrast, the morphological color changes are long-term changes, occurs in different stages of the animal, and are due the change of numbers of chromatophores. To change the color pigments, transparency, or opacity, the cells alter in form and size, and stretch or contract their outer covering.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis Unshelled {{cephalopods}} have {{a remarkable}} ability {{to alter their}} appearance, using textural, postural, and chromatic elements to generate a myriad of body patterns. Of the unshelled cephalopods, it is generally acknowledged that cuttlefish express the most detailed and widest range of body patterns, including static and dynamic patterns. In this paper we present data on the neuronal mechanisms underlying this amazing behavior, focusing on the neuroregulation of the chromatic elements, the chromatophore organs, in the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. Cephalopod chromatophore organs, including those in Sepia, are unlike those in any other animal taxa; each consists of a pigment-containing <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> that expands {{in response to the}} coordinated activation of a set of radial muscles which are directly attached to the <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell.</b> We show that the chromatophore muscles are regulated by 2 different excitatory transmitters, glutamate and the family of FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs). Glutamate mediates rapid and transient <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> expansion whereas the FaRPs are responsible for slower, more sustained responses. Using retrograde dye filling, immuno-cytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques, we demonstrate that the cell bodies of the glutamatergic and FaRPs-containing motoneurons innervating the fin chromatophore muscles are primarily localized to the posterior chromatophore and fin lobes in the posterior subesophageal mass of the Sepia brain. Data are also presented showing that some fin chromatophore motoneurons have multiple axons in different nerve branches, which accounts for overlapping chro-matophore motor fields by adjacent peripheral nerves...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of neural crest-derived pigment cells {{has been studied}} extensively {{as a model for}} cellular differentiation, disease and environmental adaptation. Neural crest-derived chromatophores in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) consist of three types: melanophores, xanthophores and iridiphores. We have identified the zebrafish mutant endzone (enz), that was isolated in a screen for mutants with neural crest development phenotypes, based on an abnormal melanophore pattern. We have found that although wild-type numbers of chromatophore precursors are generated in the first day of development and migrate normally in enz mutants, the numbers of all three <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> types that ultimately develop are reduced. Further, differentiated melanophores and xanthophores subsequently lose dendricity, and iridiphores are reduced in size. We demonstrate that enz function is required cell autonomously by melanophores and that the enz locus is located on chromosome 7. In addition, zebrafish enz appears to selectively regulate chromatophore development within the neural crest lineage since all other major derivatives develop normally. Our results suggest that enz is required relatively late in the {{development of}} all three embryonic chromatophore types and is normally necessary for terminal differentiation and the maintenance of cell size and morphology.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Bacterial {{contamination}} of food poses a great risk {{to human health}} worldwide. A chromatophore cell-based biosensor, utilizing B. splendens erythrophore cells, is an emerging technology that has shown potential to detect bacterial toxicity based on function-dependent mechanisms. Previous studies have investigated the response of erythrophore cells to foodborne pathogens, pesticides, and environmental toxicants. Numerous studies reveal that the <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> type, erythrophore, can rapidly detect, by aggregating their pigment organelles, several food associated bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella typhimurium. This study describes the Betta splendens erythrophore cells response to Salmonella typhimurium, including {{an analysis of the}} bacterial mechanism(s) that may be involved in this response. Previous studies using mutagenesis, identified genes of S. typhimurium that contributed to a response in erythrophore cells. The results indicated a potential role for the Type Three Secretion System (T 3 SS) apparatus coded for by the prgHIJK operon. In the current study, a mutation was identified in a region different from the mutation that disrupted the prgHIJK operon. However, both mutantions induced a similar but not identical response in erythrophore cells. The first objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that this second S. typhimurium (ST 10) mutant has a mutation residing in either the gene(s) coding for the process regulating expression of the prgHIJIK operon or the gene(s) coding for the effector proteins secreted by the PrgHIJK apparatus. The S. typhimurium (ST 10) mutant contained an insertional mutation in the hilD gene, a regulator involved in regulating the expression of the prgHIJK operon. Failure to express hilD in S. typhimurium impacts pigment organelle movement in erythrophore cells. The second objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the effector proteins of T 3 SS (SipA, SopB, SopE 2, SptP) are the components of S. typhimurium’s invading mechanism directly involved in inducing pigment organelles to undergo an aggregative response in erythrophore cells. Mutations in sopE 2, sipA, or sptP did not change the erythrophore cell response to S. typhimurium as the magnitude and kinetics of the response was similar to that observed with wildtype S. typhimurium. A mutation in the sopB gene that encodes the SopB effector protein, which is involved in actin filament rearrangement, did change erythrophore cell response to S. typhimurium as the magnitude and kinetics of the response was different to that observed for the wildtype S. typhimurium. This is the first evidence in support of a direct role for the S. typhimurium SopB effector protein in pigment organelle aggregation in erythrophore cells. Results from this research effort suggest that hilD and sopB genes of S. typhimurium are involved in pigment organelle movement in a neuron-like pigment cell, an erythrophore cell of the <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> classification, isolated from the fish species, Betta splendens. The outcome to this research effort is to increase understanding of the biological basis of the erythrophore cell response to bacterial pathogens.

5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|R

Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cells</b> in separate layers of their skin.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this dissertation, we {{simulate}} the underwater polarized light field. A three-dimensional backward Monte Carlo code is developed to simulate light scattering for an atmosphere-ocean system. In this model, we send photons from the detector and propagate them toward the source, which allows us to calculate the effective Mueller Matrix of the medium. The 3 D vector radiation field can be calculated with dynamic interface, complex boundary conditions, as well as the complex ocean objects included in the system. The polarizer imaging is first modeled when polarizers are stuck on the surface of a piece of mirror and put in the open ocean to study the light polarizations in the ocean water. The effects of observation distance and viewing angle on the radiance, the degree of polarization, as well as the angle of polarization are studied systematically. Then we use a simple tank model, where several spheres of different sizes and different scattering properties were placed, to simulate what a marine organism can see under the water. Images based on four different Stokes components are obtained for a variety of underwater circumstances. In the second part, we study the effect of both coherent and incoherent beams on both forward and multiple scattering of particulate media in biological tissues. The phase shift of a single particle in the forward direction is calculated using the anomalous diffraction method; the influence of particle size distributions, particle shapes, and particle orientations on the forward coherent peaks is studied for an ensemble of particles. In particular, we demonstrate the forward coherent scattering, as well as multiple scattering properties in detail for the <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> in cephalopods and the human blood system.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Detection of both {{biological}} and chemical environmental toxicants is essential {{in the assessment of}} risk to human health. Cell-based biosensors are capable of activity- based detection of toxicity. Chromatophore cells, responsible for the pigmentation of poikilothermic animal, have shown immense potential as cell-based biosensors in the detection of a broad range of environmental toxicants. Chromatophore cells possess the motile pigment granules that intracellularly aggregate or disperse in response to external stimuli. Previous studies have assessed chromatophore cells isolated from red Betta splendens and grey Oncorhynchus tschawytscha fish for use as a biosensor. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe blue B. splendens chromatophore cells in tissue culture. Blue B. splendens chromatophore cells were assessed for their longevity in tissue culture and their responses to previously established control agents. Blue B. splendens chromatophore cells were exposed to select chemicals and pathogenic bacteria to assess their ability to respond to environmental toxicants. Three concentrations of mercuric chloride, methyl mercuric chloride, paraquat, sodium arsenite, sodium cyanide chemicals were tested. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were tested. Red B. splendens chromatophore cells were subjected to the select chemical and bacterial toxicants, and observed for their responses. The data collected in this and previous studies were compiled to compare <b>chromatophore</b> <b>cell</b> responses to a broad range of environmental toxicants. Chromatophore cells isolated from both blue and red B. splendens were responsive to methyl mercuric chloride and sodium arsenite. Grey O. tschawytscha chromatophore cells have shown responsiveness to mercuric chloride and sodium arsenite. Blue and red B. splendens chromatophore cells were both responsive to B. cereus and both Salmonella serovars. Grey O. tschawytscha have previously been shown to respond to B. cereus as well. In conclusion, this study reports the chromatophore cells isolated from blue B. splendens in tissue culture and showed similar responsiveness to the selected chemical and bacterial environmental toxicants as chromatophore cells isolated from red and grey colored fish. This study provides compelling evidence that the chromatophore response is not dependent on fish color and that chromatophore cells used for a cell-based detection system may be isolated from different colored fish...|$|E
