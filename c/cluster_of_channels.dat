40|$|AbstractThe Ig cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAM) neurofascin (NF) and Nr-CAM are localized at developing nodes of Ranvier in peripheral myelinated axons prior to <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Na+ <b>channels.</b> Different isoforms <b>of</b> NF are expressed on neurons and glia, and NF binding on both cells {{has been suggested}} to play roles in node and paranode formation. To clarify the role of NF further, we analyzed effects of NF-Fc fusion proteins in Schwann cell–DRG neuron myelinating cocultures. NF-Fc significantly inhibited nodal <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Na+ <b>channels,</b> ankyrinG, and βIV spectrin, and modestly reduced Caspr clustering at paranodal junctions; it did not significantly affect lengths or numbers of myelin-positive segments, axon initial segments, or accumulations of phosphorylated-ERM proteins in Schwann cell nodal microvilli. NF-Fc binds to Schwann cells but little or no binding to DRG neurons was detected. The results suggest a critical early role for axonal NF in <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Na+ <b>channels</b> at nodes <b>of</b> Ranvier via interactions with receptors on Schwann cells...|$|R
40|$|Calcium sparks in cardiac muscle cells {{occur when}} {{a cluster of}} Ca 2 + {{channels}} open and release Ca 2 + from an internal store. A simplified model of Ca 2 + sparks has been developed to describe the dynamics of a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels,</b> which is of {{the form of a}} continuous time Markov chain with nearest neighbour transitions and slowly varying jump functions. The chain displays metastability, whereby the probability distribution {{of the state of the}} system evolves exponentially slowly, with one of the metastable states occurring at the boundary. An asymptotic technique for analysing the Master equation (a differential-difference equation) associated with these Markov chains is developed using the WKB and projection methods. The method is used to re-derive a known result for a standard class of Markov chain displaying metastability, before being applied to the new class of Markov chains associated with the spark model. The mean first passage time between metastable states is calculated and an expression for the frequency of calcium sparks is derived. All asymptotic results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the perceptions that two communities of urban Hispanics have of various sources and channels of information regarding cigarette smoking and to {{compare them with}} those of non-Hispanic whites. DESIGN: Random samples of subjects of both ethnic groups and of both genders were surveyed by telephone to determine the perceived credibility and motivating power of 13 different channels of information and of 14 different sources of cigarette smoking information. SUBJECTS: 544 Hispanics and 542 non-Hispanic whites from San Francisco, California and Houston, Texas, 18 - 65 years in age, of both genders. RESULTS: Differences {{in the proportion of}} respondents assigning various perceived qualities to sources and channels of information regarding cigarette smoking were found to exist across ethnic groups (Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites); the respondents' gender (particularly among Hispanics); and the acculturation level of the Hispanic respondents. Nevertheless, there was a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> (printed media and television news) and of sources (physicians, people with cancer, friends, and peers) that were positively evaluated by large proportions of the respondents in both ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics differ from non-Hispanic whites in their evaluation of various possible sources and channels of information about tobacco control. Culturally appropriate interventions for Hispanics need to be designed so as to use those channels and sources of information that are more positively perceived by Hispanics. ...|$|E

Here we simulate the full and reduced equations, exploring the conditions necessary for {{the validity of the}} rapid buffering approximation for an isolated Ca 2 + channel or a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>channels.</b> Using a point source and performing numerical simulations of different durations, we quantify the error of the rapid buffering approximation as a function of buffer and source parameters as well as the time and spatial scale set by the resolution of confocal microscopic measurements.

These calculations also show that the traditional calculation of [Ca 2 +] from a fluorescence signal may grossly underestimate the true value of [Ca 2 +] near a source. Finally, we use the full model to simulate the transient Ca 2 + domain near the pore of an open Ca 2 + channel in a cell dialyzed with millimolar concentrations of 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid or EGTA.

40|$|SummaryAccumulation <b>of</b> Na+ <b>channels</b> at the nodes of Ranvier is a {{prerequisite}} for saltatory conduction. In peripheral nerves, <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> these <b>channels</b> along the axolemma is regulated by myelinating Schwann cells through a yet unknown mechanism. We report the identification of gliomedin, a glial ligand for neurofascin and NrCAM, two axonal immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules that are associated with Na+ channels at the nodes of Ranvier. Gliomedin is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells and accumulates at the edges of each myelin segment during development, where it aligns with the forming nodes. Eliminating the expression of gliomedin by RNAi, or the addition of a soluble extracellular domain of neurofascin to myelinating cultures, which caused the redistribution of gliomedin along the internodes, abolished node formation. Furthermore, a soluble gliomedin induced nodal-like <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> Na+ <b>channels</b> in the absence of Schwann cells.

The addition of Konig’s polyanion caused substantial deceleration of the photoinactivation kinetics <b>of</b> gram-TAEA <b>channels,</b> which expose three positive charges to the aqueous phase at {{both sides of the}} membrane.

One key innovation is to allow different <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> paths to vary individually across the blocks, where the delay, amplitude and phase variations <b>of</b> the <b>clusters</b> are determined based on the <b>channel</b> estimate <b>of</b> the previous block and the measurements on pilot subcarriers of the current block.

To test this idea, we have compared sites of exocytosis and the spatial distribution <b>of</b> calcium <b>channels</b> in chromaffin cells. Fusion of individual vesicles was visualized using interference reflection microscopy and the submembranous calcium signal was assessed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Depolarization triggered a burst of exocytosis from up to seven sites in a membrane area of 11 μm 2, but these sites did not colocalize with calcium microdomains. Instead, calcium influx occurred in large patches (averaging 34 μm 2) containing a mixture of P/Q- and N-type channels. About 20 % of fusion events occurred outside calcium channel patches. Further, the delay between the onset of stimulation and a burst of exocytosis was prolonged for several seconds by increasing the concentration of the slow calcium chelator EGTA from 1. 5 to 5 mm. These results demonstrate that while calcium channels and release sites tend to congregate in specialized regions of the surface membrane, these have dimensions of several micrometres.

Quantitative analysis by means of SDS-FRL revealed that about two-thirds <b>of</b> BKCa <b>channels</b> belong to the scattered pool and about one-third to the clustered pool in principal cell somata. Overall densities <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> in both pools differed in the different cell types analyzed, although being considerably lower compared to cerebellar PC. Postembedding immunogold labeling revealed association <b>of</b> <b>clustered</b> <b>channels</b> with subsurface membrane cisterns and confirmed extrasynaptic localization <b>of</b> scattered <b>channels.</b> This study indicates a common organizational principle for somatic BKCa channels in central principal neurons with the formation <b>of</b> a <b>clustered</b> and a scattered pool <b>of</b> <b>channels,</b> and a cell-type specific density <b>of</b> this <b>channel</b> type...|$|R
