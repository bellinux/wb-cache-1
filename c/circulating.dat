5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the <b>circulating</b> libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The <b>circulating</b> libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British <b>circulating</b> libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the <b>circulating</b> libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and <b>Circulating</b> Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood.

Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of <b>circulating</b> blood and Hippocrates noted blood <b>circulating</b> cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E
