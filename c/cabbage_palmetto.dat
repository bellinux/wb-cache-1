5|$|The lichen {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the southeastern United States; in 1954 the north border of its distribution was given as a line passing through southern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Although the northern limit was extended to southern Delaware, the author later revised his opinion, and the northern limit {{is thought to be}} North Carolina. In North Carolina, it is found on Smith Island, a notable location because it represents the northern limit of the distribution of <b>cabbage</b> <b>palmetto</b> (Sabal palmetto). The presence of this 6meter (20ft) tree interspersed among the dominant tree species Quercus virginiana give the island a subtropical appearance—consistent with the lichen's preferred climate.|$|E

50|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{is home to}} a relict {{population}} of northern caracaras that dates to the last glacial period, which ended around 12,500 BP. At that point in time, Florida {{and the rest of the}} Gulf Coast was covered in an oak savanna. As temperatures increased, the savanna between Florida and Texas disappeared. Caracaras were able to survive in the prairies of central Florida as well as in the marshes along the St. Johns River. <b>Cabbage</b> <b>palmettos</b> are a preferred nesting site, although they will also nest in southern live oaks. Their historical range on the modern-day Florida peninsula included Okeechobee, Osceola, Highlands, Glades, Polk, Indian River, St. Lucie, Hardee, DeSoto, Brevard, Collier, and Martin counties. They are currently most common in DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee and Osceola counties. Loss of adequate habitat caused the Florida caracara population to decline, and it was listed as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Silver Palms {{in their}} natural habitat often grow among saw {{palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) and <b>cabbage</b> <b>palmetto</b> (Sabal palmetto) which have similar fronds. Silver Palms can be distinguished by its smooth vertical trunk, and its small, crescent-shaped hastula.|$|E

40|$|Teratorhabditis palmarum n. sp., an {{associate}} of the palm weevils Rhynchophorus palmarum and R. cruentatus is described. Teratorhabditis palmarum was isolated from newly emerged adults and cocoons of R. palmarum from red-ring diseased coconut palms, Cocos nucifera, in Trinidad and Ecuador, and from red-ring diseased oil palms, Elaeis guineensis, in Colombia. Teratorhabditis palmarum was also associated internally with newly emerged adults of R. cruentatus from mature transplanted <b>cabbage</b> <b>palmettos,</b> Sabal palmetto, in Florida. Dauer juveniles of T. palmarum infested the genital capsule and body cavity of newly emerged adult female and male palm weevils. Adult nematodes isolated from cocoons and dauer juveniles from newly emerged palm weevils were cuhurable on bacterial lawns on several solid media. Females of T. palmarum have a single anteriorly directed ovary; vulva at 93 - 96 % of the body length; short, hemispherical spicate tail; three or four teeth in the metastom; cuticle with distinct transverse punctations that change abruptly {{at the level of}} the procorpus to indentations of alternating size and arrangement; and eggs with cuticular sculpturing. Males have a crenate, peloderan bursa with a 2 + 5 + 3 pattern of bursal rays (7 extend to the margin of bursa); spicules linear, completely fused at the distal tip and dorsally for 50 % of the total spicule length...|$|R

Other plants in the understory include hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), and yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria).|$|R
50|$|Southern {{coastal plain}} hydric hammocks are {{found on the}} flat {{lowlands}} of the southern and outermost parts of the coastal plain, usually over limestone substrates. These forests of evergreen and deciduous hardwood trees occur near the floodplains of spring-fed rivers with relatively constant flows. They can be large areas of broad, shallow wetlands. Common trees include Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), elm (Ulmus americana), sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana), swamp laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), and <b>cabbage</b> palm (Sabal <b>palmetto).</b> Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine) is a typical shrub.|$|R
50|$|On the Gulf coastal plain, {{maritime}} forest {{consists of}} a mosaic of forests and shrublands on barrier islands and strands. It occurs in sheltered areas behind coastal dunes and grasslands. Forests are dominated by a mixture of needle-leaved and broad-leaved evergreen trees, including sand pine (Pinus clausa), slash pine (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), <b>cabbage</b> palm (Sabal <b>palmetto),</b> pignut hickroy (Carya glabra), and sand hickroy (Carya pallida). Wetland areas are dominated by pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) and sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana). Wind and salt spray from the ocean can make these forests appear pruned and sculpted.|$|R
50|$|Ophioderma palmatum, {{variously}} {{known as}} hand fern, dwarf staghorn, or hand tongue, is a terrestrial, fern-like plant. The genus Ophioderma {{is in the}} family Ophioglossaceae of the order Ophioglossales, {{a small group of}} non-flowering vascular plants. The hand fern is an epiphyte, growing in old leaf bases of the <b>Cabbage</b> <b>palmetto</b> (Sabal palm). It is closely related to, and sometimes treated as a subgenus of, the genus Ophioglossum. It has long been known as Cheiroglossa palmata, but recent genetic analysis has determined that it should be treated in the genus Ophioderma.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the park}} is shaded by temperate-zone trees such as red maple, American sweetgum, several species of hickory and oak, {{and one of the}} southernmost natural populations of tulip tree. Many {{subtropical}} plants are also present with <b>cabbage</b> <b>palmetto</b> prominent among them. The forests are supported by poorly drained soils which have developed from marine sands and clays. The topsoils are usually dark gray or black fine sands which are acidic (slightly so in some cases). The gray or brownish gray subsoils range in texture from sand to sandy clay, and are less acid than the topsoils. Some are moderately alkaline with free calcium carbonate.|$|E

5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of <b>cabbage</b> palms (Sabal <b>palmetto).</b> After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may {{be a result of}} the isolation of certain hammocks.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of the boot jack can be approximated {{with a variety of}} other objects that may be on hand, ranging from a convenient piece of furniture to a rifle butt, but these generally cannot remove the boot as easily as a proper boot jack. An adequate naturally occurring bootjack is formed by the base of <b>cabbage</b> palm Sabal <b>palmetto</b> leaf and these leaf bases are consequently called bootjacks. Additionally, the sole of a boot still being worn can also function as an improvised jack, but the wearer using one foot to remove the opposite boot often lacks proper leverage to successfully remove a snug-fitting boot, particularly a tall boot.|$|R
5000|$|Nests of M. mexicanus {{have been}} {{observed}} on saw <b>palmetto</b> (Serenoa repens), <b>cabbage</b> palm (Sabal <b>palmetto),</b> oak trees, Spanish moss, and human constructions. Fiber sources for the paper nests are often located rather close to the nest compared to food sources. However, {{it has been found}} that M. mexicanus nests are often constructed on the eastern-facing side of palm fronds, probably because this orientation increases the activity of the nest early in the day, {{as a consequence of the}} increased luminance and temperature. It was also found that foundresses preferred the outside curl of palm fronds over the inside curl [...] and that the cabbage palm may provide greater protection against birds than other habitats.|$|R
