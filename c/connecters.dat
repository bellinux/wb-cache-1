It replaced a high-speed triple chair built in 1984, which was the only high-speed triple in the eastern USA. The AEII While the gondola reaches the summit of Bear Mountain, the quad reaches slightly below this to an area called the Saddle (where the Saddle Lodge is located), providing access {{to most of the}} Northwoods and all of the North Side. A double chair also serves the southern part of Northwoods, along with several surface lifts around the base. Twister, an intermediate trail in Northwoods, is the resort's longest run and most-used racing course. The North Side is served by a quad and contains several easier trails. Additionally, it provides direct access from the Saddle to the High Peaks area (via Lower Wood In) and North Creek Ski Bowl (via Pipeline). The Topridge area is served by a triple. Its most prominent trails are Topridge, Uncas, and Pine Knot, the latter two of which are heavily used as <b>connecters</b> from the Bear Mountain summit (the top of the gondola) to the Straight Brook Quad. The Cave Glades, located in the Topridge area, are named for a large cave found along them.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{impairments}} {{are difficult}} to relate to clinical symptoms in schizophrenia, partly due to insufficient knowledge on how cognitive impairments interact with one another. Here, we devised a new sequential pointing task requiring both visual organization and motor sequencing. Six circles were presented simultaneously on a touch screen around a fixation point. Participants pointed with the finger each circle one after the other, in synchrony with auditory tones. We used an alternating rhythmic 300 / 600 ms pattern so that participants performed pairs of taps separated by short intervals of 300 ms. Visual organization was manipulated by using line-segments that grouped the circles two by two, yielding three pairs of connected circles, and three pairs of unconnected circles that belonged to different pairs. This led to 3 experimental conditions. In the ‘congruent condition’, the pairs of taps had to be executed on circles grouped by <b>connecters.</b> In the ‘non congruent condition’, {{they were to be}} executed on the unconnected circles that belonged to different pairs. In a neutral condition, there were no <b>connecters.</b> 22 patients with schizophrenia with mild symptoms and 22 control participants performed a series of 30 taps in each condition. Tap pairs were counted as errors when the produced rhythm was inverted (expected rhythm 600 / 300 = 2; inversed rhythm< 1). Error rates in patients {{with a high level of}} clinical disorganization were significantly higher in the non-congruent condition than in the two other conditions, contrary to controls and the remaining patients. The tap-tone asynchrony increased in the presence of <b>connecters</b> in both patient groups, but not in the controls. Patients appeared not to integrate the visual organization during the planning phase of action, leading to a large difficulty during motor execution, especially in those patients revealing difficulties in visual organization.

40|$|When a dowel-type joint {{is part of}} a {{vibrating}} system, the <b>connecters</b> exert {{cycles of}} load on the timber in embedment at various angles to the grain. Where timber is used in long, tall and light structures, the dynamic response to wind load and human-induced vibration can be critical and joints contribute significantly, in terms of damping and stiffness, to the way the structure as a whole behaves. An experimental study is presented here into the behaviour of timber subject to embedment perpendicular to the grain by a dowel-type connector. It examines the energy dissipation and dynamic stiffness in a single dowel embedding into a tight-fitting half-hole in a piece of Douglas Fir softwood. Its conclusions give an insight into the behaviour under dynamic service loads of this basic element of a dowel-type connection. This work contributes to a more thorough understanding of the damping and stiffness characteristics of timber, which can lead to more accurate estimation of the dynamic response of timber structures...|$|E

40|$|Brick and Block Masonry - Trends, Innovations and ChallengesThe seismic {{vulnerability}} of unreinforced masonry (URM) walls to out-of-plane loading is widely acknowledged. Much {{research has been}} undertaken to develop practical techniques to provide ade-quate flexural strength for these URM walls which are often {{an integral part of}} the gravity load resisting struc-ture. In solid URM walls, the surface treatments that provide tensile capacity to the wall have been shown to be very effective flexural retrofit techniques.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we {{consider}} a helical flow organization on {{small and large}} space scales in a forming tropical cyclone and offer a quantitative analysis for early stages in evolution of large-scale helical vortex based on diagnosis {{of a set of}} integral helical and energetic characteristics. Using the data from a near cloud-resolving numerical simulation by Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), a key process of vertical vorticity generation from horizontal components and its amplification by special convective coherent structures- Vortical Hot Towers (VHTs) - is highlighted. The process is found to be a pathway for generation of a velocity field with linked vortex lines of horizontal and vertical vorticity on local and system scales. This reveals itself in generation of nonzero and increasing integral helicity of the vortex system during tropical cyclone formation. Based on these results, a new perspective on the role of VHTs in the amplification of the system-scale circulation is emphasized. They are the <b>connecters</b> of the primary tangential and secondary overturning circulation on the system scales and are elemental building blocks for the nonzero system-scale helicity of the developing vortex throughout the tropical cyclone evolution from genesis to the mature hurricane state.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Air Defense Laboratory (ADL) Simulation is {{a software program}} that models the way an air-defense officer thinks in the threat assessment process. The model uses multi-agent system (MAS) technology and is implemented in Java programming language. This research is a portion of Red Intent Project whose goal is to ultimately implement a model to predict the intent of any given track in the environment. For any air track in the simulation, two sets of agents are created, one for controlling track actions and one for predicting its identity and intent based on information received from track, the geopolitical situation and intelligence. The simulation is also capable of identifying coordinated actions between air tracks. We used three kinds of aircraft behavior in the simulation: civilian, friendly and enemy. Predictor agents are constructed in a layered structure and use "conceptual blending" in their decision-making processes using mental spaces and integration networks. Mental spaces are connected to each other via connectors and <b>connecters</b> trigger tickets. Connectors and Tickets were implemented using the Connector-based Multi Agent System (CMAS) library. This simulation {{is one of the}} first applications to use cognitive blending theory for a military application. We demonstrated that agents can create an "integration network" composed of "mental spaces" and retrieve any mental space data inside the network immediately without traversing the entire network by using the CMAS library.
