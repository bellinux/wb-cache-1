50|$|The {{reinforced}} sidewall Goodyear EMT (Extended Mobility Tire) {{was introduced}} with the 1994 Chevrolet Corvette. Michelin also introduced a similar tire {{in the mid-1990s}} called the Zero Pressure System, and the ZP designator differentiates this type of run flat tire from a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|E
50|$|A PAX tire may be patched {{from the}} inside as a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire.</b> If the tire is replaced, and the inner support ring is undamaged, the inner support ring need not be replaced. A new gel pack is {{generally}} applied when the tires are demounted and repaired or replaced.|$|E
50|$|Grousers are devices {{intended}} {{to increase the}} traction of continuous tracks, especially in loose material such as soil or snow. This is done by increasing contact with the ground with protrusions, similar to <b>conventional</b> <b>tire</b> treads, and analogous to athletes' cleated shoes. On tanks and armoured vehicles, grousers are usually pads attached to the tracks; but on construction vehicles they may {{take the form of}} flat plates or bars.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} technique and materials used by the manufacturers, tire life may {{be as good as}} <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> and traction may also be as good.|$|R
50|$|They {{are often}} {{converted}} road vehicles, keeping their normal wheels with rubber tires, but fitted with additional flanged steel wheels for running on rails. Propulsion is typically through the <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> the flanged wheels being free-rolling; the rail wheels are raised and lowered as needed. Purpose-built road-rail vehicles also exist.|$|R
50|$|Such tires {{required}} {{the introduction of}} a Tire Pressure Monitoring System, sensors and instrumentation in the car, which would indicate to the driver a condition of dangerously low <b>tire</b> pressure. With <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> low tire pressure can be noticed due to sidewall deformation; With reinforced sidewall zero-pressure run-flat type tires, there is no warning when a tire was going flat. This low or no-pressure condition was almost impossible to detect by the driver with a zero pressure run flat, until the tire failed.|$|R
50|$|The PAX system weighed {{approximately}} the same as four conventional tires plus a spare. So although comparable PAX tires were heavier than conventional counterparts, they were not that much heavier (Michelin claims four PAX System assemblies are equal to the weight of 4.7 standard tire-wheel assemblies). However, rotating mass and unsprung weight of the wheels and tires on the ground increased, which is a disadvantage. In addition, no spare tire had to be carried, so that PAX-equipped vehicles weighed no more than conventionally equipped vehicles, and had more storage space without the spare tire. Michelin said that the retail replacement cost of the PAX tires would be approximately equal {{to the cost of}} five conventional tires. The true cost was approximately US$1200 or $1600 for snow tires in 2008 for Odyssey which is higher than some conventional tires. PAX tires allegedly had a smoother ride and provided better gas mileage than the comparable <b>conventional</b> <b>tire</b> but owner impressions vary greatly. PAX tires provided peace of mind and real safety and added mobility that no <b>conventional</b> <b>tire</b> could but limited availability and cost of PAX tires and service reduced owner satisfaction. As with the zero-pressure type run flats, a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) was mandatory. TPMS became mandatory on all cars soon afterward.|$|E
50|$|The Tweel {{consists}} of a band of <b>conventional</b> <b>tire</b> rubber with molded tread, a shear beam just below the tread that creates a compliant contact patch, a series of energy-absorbing polyurethane spokes, and an integral inner rim structure. Both the shear beam and the polyurethane spokes can be {{designed to provide a}} calibrated directional stiffness in order that design engineers are able to control both how the Tweel handles and how it handles loads. The inner hub structure may be either rigid or compliant, depending on the application requirements, and as such may contain a matrix of deformable plastic structures that flex under load and subsequently return to their original shape. By varying the thickness and size of the spokes, Michelin can manipulate the design elements to engineer a wide array of ride and handling qualities. The tread can be as specialized as any of today's tires and is replaceable when worn.|$|E
5000|$|Potential {{benefits}} of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire {{has the potential to}} be able to brake better - a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical and lateral stiffness are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire.</b> [...] Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of nose gear chine tires in eliminating or minimizing the engine spray ingestion problem encountered on several occasions by the Merlin 4, a twin-engine propjet airplane. A study of the photographic and television coverage indicated that under similar test conditions the spray from the chine tires presented less of a potential engine spray ingestion problem than the <b>conventional</b> <b>tires.</b> Neither tire configuration appeared to pose any ingestion problem at aircraft speeds in excess of the hydroplaning speed for each tire, however, significant differences were noted in the spray patterns of the two sets of tires at sub-hydroplaning speeds. At sub-hydroplaning speeds, the <b>conventional</b> <b>tires</b> produced substantial spray above the wing which approached the general area of the engine air inlet at lower test speeds. The chine tires produced two distinct spray plumes at sub-hydroplaning speeds: one low-level plume which presented no apparent threat of ingestion, and one which at most test speeds was observed to be below the wing leading edge and thus displaced from the intakes on the engine nacelle...|$|R
50|$|PAX {{tires are}} {{measured}} in the metric system exclusively unlike the mixed English and metric measurements prevalent in <b>conventional</b> <b>tires.</b> For example a <b>conventional</b> passenger car <b>tire</b> might have the designation 245/45-18, indicating a tread section 245 mm wide, with an aspect ratio of 45% (i.e., the sidewall height is 45% {{the width of the}} tread section), mounted on an 18 inch conventional wheel. The similarly sized PAX tire was designated 245-680R460A, indicating the same 245 mm tread section, but a 680 mm overall diameter (a specification not in the <b>conventional</b> passenger car <b>tire</b> nomenclature), the R, meaning radial construction, a 460 mm wheel seat diameter (approximately 18.1 inches) and A for asymmetric, meaning that the wheel is asymmetric, or PAX system.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were modified with front end guards along with {{front and rear}} utility bumpers, winches, safari roof racks, high-powered off-road lights and extra underbody plating for the engines. Two of the vehicles towed a dual axle utility trailer. Two were equipped also with caterpillar track systems supplied by Mattracks. The rubber track systems were only used when off-road conditions became too demanding for <b>conventional</b> <b>tires.</b> The rear stabilizer bar failed on both vehicles fitted with the Mattracks system. The {{vehicles were}} also equipped with gas stoves (to prepare food) and high-capacity auxiliary fuel tanks (mounted in the rear cargo bay) and sometimes run on poor-quality gasoline.|$|R

The physical properties of the NR/BR/APPS-EPDM blends are compared with an NR/BR/EPDM blend and a <b>conventional</b> NR/BR <b>tire</b> sidewall. It is demonstrated that the application of APPS-EPDM leads to a significant improvement of the tensile properties, tear strength, and fatigue properties. The properties of the NR/BR/APPS-EPDM blends are equivalent or even superior to those of <b>conventional</b> NR/BR <b>tire</b> sidewall compounds.

40|$|A {{new type}} of holonomic omnidirectionul vehicle which {{consists}} of wheel mechanisms without free rollers but with <b>conventional</b> <b>tires</b> is presented. We first present a concept of the new driving wheel mechanism with a <b>tire</b> in the <b>conventional</b> style such QS a rubber tire or a pneumatic tire,"Offset Steered Driving Wheel". The configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between a wheel axle and a steering axle along a direction of wheel traveling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of Offset Steered Driving Wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating a wheel axis and a steering axis independently. The wheel is non-holonomic system however, we introduce a control strategy to avoid a non-holonomic constraint...|$|R
50|$|Load {{sensitivity}} is the behaviour of <b>tires</b> under load. <b>Conventional</b> pneumatic <b>tires</b> do not {{behave as}} classical friction theory would suggest. Namely, the load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range {{is such that}} the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases.|$|R
40|$|The harsh {{climate of}} the arctic {{has always been one}} of the most {{difficult}} areas to drive cars in. The severe loss in traction due to snow and icing on the roads, has led to an increased risk of collisions. The winter tires for cars has developed through the years after their introduction in the 1930 ’s. There have been three revolutionary changes made since then; implement of studs, changing in tread pattern and optimizing rubber characteristics. The implementation of studs is being shied away from today. This is a result of the ever-increasing focus on air pollution and environmental hazards, caused by the studs increase in road wear. It is believed that the tread design and rubber characteristics are close to their limit of further grip improvement, and thus the industry should look in new directions. This Master’s thesis purpose replacing the conventional air-filled tires with a non-air-filled tire to improve the grip in arctic conditions. The grip obtained for tires are determined by the weight of the car and the friction between the tire and the road. The friction coefficient, used to determine friction, is a function of the contact pressure. This thesis aims to obtain a concentrated pressure on the pressure profile for the airless tire, compared to a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire.</b> A finite element analysis, using ANSYS Workbench 18. 0, is performed on two distinct models. The different pressure profiles of the models are analyzed and used for discussion on whether the airless tire has the potential of increased grip, under the same loading conditions as a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire...</b>|$|E
40|$|The top {{priority}} of car-tire suppliers {{is to improve}} wetland grip force of the using tires, reduce the rolling resistance and the rolling noise of tires. It is urgent for the tire industry to research and develop high-performance tires to solve the above problems. They must use the high- performance synthetic rubber and auxiliary rubber to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies and equipment. Silica, a kind of important tire auxiliary rubber, can significantly reduce the rolling resistance of tires, improve the grip force and properties resistant to ice, wetness or slippery of tires. In this paper, based on the <b>conventional</b> <b>tire</b> rubber forming technologies of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding, a study is made on the conical screw, the dewatering barrel, the drying barrel, the pin layout scheme, the expanding die head, cutter and the control system. The nonlinear pin rubber forming equipment integrating the functions of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding is designed and applied to tire auxiliary rubber forming. The experiment shows that the forming device can realize the one-step forming, with high forming efficiency, low cost and less labor. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{omnidirectional}} {{vehicle with}} anisotropic friction wheels is presented. The proposed wheel has {{a series of}} bendable “nodes ” on its circumference, {{each of which is}} made of two materials with differing friction properties: one material exhibits high friction, and the other exhibits low friction. The high friction section of the node generates a high traction force, while the low friction section enables the wheel to passively slide. The wheels are arranged such that the robot wheel exhibits high traction in its driving direction (much like a <b>conventional</b> <b>tire),</b> but low traction when sliding laterally. Due to this “anisotropic friction ” property, the proposed wheel enables a vehicle to realize omnidirectional motion (i. e. the vehicle can move any direction within the plane—forward, back, or laterally). While many other omnidirectional wheel drives exist, the proposed wheel is simpler than any other existing design because the wheel is composed of a single, moldable element. This paper summarizes the design of the proposed wheel and presents a comparison between a small omnidirectional vehicle that uses the proposed wheel and an omnidirectional vehicle that uses conventional wheels. 1...|$|E

5000|$|A belted bias tire {{starts with}} two or more bias-plies to which {{stabilizer}} belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides smoother ride {{that is similar to}} the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the [...] "Polyglas" [...] trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass. The [...] "belted" [...] tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires. The belts may be fiberglass or steel. This technology was a temporary, not invented here stop-gap, introduced by U.S. manufacturers to forestall the radial tire.|$|R

With the software Recurdyn, we analyzed the marching behavior of internal supporter tire at different speeds, and compared with that of <b>conventional</b> pneumatic <b>tire.</b> The experiment result shows that as the internal supporter tire has a reasonable structure, its stress is well-distributed.

30|$|Planetary {{exploration}} rovers {{are required}} to traverse rough terrain such as those found in craters and cliffs, which are scientifically important locations for exploration. Rovers {{are required to}} travel over these rough terrains and must avoid tipping over and becoming stuck. The surface of the Moon, which is the target of this study, is covered with regolith that is soft and slippery. This regolith, which {{is made up of}} fragments of rock broken from the moon and other celestial bodies, undergoes chemical changes caused by the granular phenomenon. As this regolith is different from weathering soil on Earth, a conventional wheel would not achieve the necessary traction efficiency for movement on this surface. The lunar environment is a vacuum and is exposed to radiation from space. Moreover, the temperature differences between day and night are intense. In such environments, <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> meant for use on Earth, cannot be used. Therefore, wheels made of a rigid material, such as metal, are used for lunar and Mars rovers.|$|R
50|$|However, Firestone {{failed to}} respond {{effectively}} to radial technology due to their routinised system. They attempted to tweak their existing processes to allow for radial manufacturing, thereby causing production and quality problems.As US demand for tires plateaued, mainly due to radial tires lasting longer than <b>conventional</b> <b>tires,</b> Firestone’s CEO stubbornly assumed that demand was ever-growing and {{made no move to}} close plants. They made tires for which there was not enough demand because their budgets encouraged excessive investments in capacity, driven by frontline managers who did not want their own plants to close. Additionally, Firestone was shackled by its relationships with its employees. Its loyalty-focused hiring and promotion process resulted in Firestone failing to recruit newcomers to introduce fresh opinions. Even as the market environment changed, Firestone insisted on hiring “people like us.” In 1972, all its top managers had never worked anywhere else and one-third continued their father’s legacy as Firestone executives.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSES: The first {{generation}} of wide base tires introduced in the early 1980 s was found to cause {{a significant increase in}} pavement damage compared to dual-tire assemblies. However, wide base tires have evolved considerably, and a new generation of wide base tire is thought to be comparable to <b>conventional</b> dual <b>tires</b> for pavement damage. A challenge associated with using wide base tires is the accurate quantification of pavement damage induced by these tires.

2500|$|With {{production}} of the Z8 completed by November 2002, for 2003 the Z8 production {{was replaced by the}} Alpina V8 Roadster. The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition. Instead of the original six-speed manual and 4.9L (S62) engine featured in earlier Z8's, the Alpina came only as an automatic, using a five-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a downgraded 4.8L Alpina-tuned V8 motor from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S (M62). In order to complete the car's transition from sports car to boulevardier, relaxed suspension tuning was used. The standard Z8's run-flat tires on [...] wheels were discarded in favor of <b>conventional</b> <b>tires</b> with softer sidewalls, on [...] wheels. A new, softer grade of Nappa leather replaced the Z8's less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic. Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the wheel.|$|R
