50|$|Having conquered Majorca, James I {{decided against}} an {{invasion}} of the neighbouring island because he needed the forces for the conquest of Valencia.

25|$|Vice President José Alencar (2003–11) made {{controversial}} {{remarks in}} 2009, telling {{the press that}} Brazil should have nuclear weapons {{as a means to}} protect itself. According to Alencar, nuclear weapons were useful as a means <b>of</b> <b>dissuasion,</b> particularly {{in the case of a}} vast country with valuable natural resources such as Brazil. Additionally, Alencar linked the possession of a nuclear bomb to higher international relevance, stating that a poor country like Pakistan had its voice heard in international affairs because of its nuclear arsenal. Once his observations were mass-produced, Brasília affirmed that Alencar had expressed his own personal views, which did not reflect Brazil’s official position.|$|R

Miss Chancellor raised a warning finger; she had an air <b>of</b> <b>dissuasion</b> almost as solemn as her former pressure; her passionate impatience appeared to have given way to other considerations, to be replaced by the resignation that comes with deeper reflexion. It was tinged in this case, indeed, by such bitterness as might be permitted to a young lady who cultivated the brightness of a great faith.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{use of the}} Maremmano dog is as {{a guardian}} {{for the protection of}} sheep flocks against wolves. Columella, writing in the first century AD, recommends white dogs for this purpose, as the shepherd can easily distinguish them from the wolf, while Varro suggests that white dogs have a [...] "lion-like aspect" [...] in the dark. The dogs work in groups; three or four dogs are an adequate defense against wolves and stray dogs. Their function is mostly one <b>of</b> <b>dissuasion,</b> actual physical combat with the predator being relatively rare. Nevertheless, working dogs may be fitted with a roccale (or vreccale), a spiked iron collar which protects the neck in combat. The ears of working dogs are normally cropped.|$|R

40|$|The massive {{success of}} Universal’s Dracula (Universal, 1931, dir. Tod Browning) and Frankenstein (Universal, 1931, dir. James Whale) {{launched}} a fashion for horror films. Over {{the first half}} of the 1930 s, instead of petering out like many one-year cycles, horror became an increasingly stable niche market. However, in the spring of 1936, there was an abrupt hiatus in the horror cycle when, despite a number of recent successful horror films, Universal took horror productions off its schedule, and other studios followed. In autumn 1938, a phenomenally popular theatrical reissue of Dracula and Frankenstein as a double bill offered evidence of a continuing high public demand for horror. Universal almost immediately put another big budget Frankenstein sequel, Son of Frankenstein, on to its production schedule. This reawakened the interests of other studios in horror and horror-inflected films. Horror film production resumed, with greater quantities of films than ever before. Modern scholarly accounts, such as those of Rhona Berenstein, David J. Skal and Edmund Bansak, tend to credit this abrupt break in an apparently profitable film cycle directly to an alleged 1935 ban on horror films in the United Kingdom. This explanation, although currently standard among horror scholars, is erroneous; based upon a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature and operations of 1930 s British censorship: the British ‘ban’ on horror films never existed. This article proposes that the most important factor in the film industry’s two year abandonment of horror was active <b>campaigning</b> and <b>dissuasion</b> <b>of</b> studios from horror production, on the part of the Production Code Administration (PCA), run by the Motion Picture Producers’ and Distributors’ Association (MPPDA). The evidence leads us to a rather more complex picture of the PCA’s regulation and censorship methods and their treatment of horror. It also provides us with an informative case study of the often complex power struggles and negotiations that went on ‘behind the scenes’ in 1930 s film censorship...|$|R
50|$|The next day, as nine friars, {{including}} Arias, {{were celebrating}} in Narvacan, for {{the suppression of}} a big group of Zambal fighters, another aggression erupted in northern Ilocos. Despite the looming danger, no amount <b>of</b> <b>dissuasion</b> by his peers prevented Arias from hurrying back to Bacarra. At his arrival, he met people shouting Almazán as their King and rushed to get the friar but to no avail. Juan Boaya, one of the mutineers, agreed {{to help in the}} silent departure of Arias. He told the servants to take the friar to Laoag right away. The rebels, however, caught up with the friar. The warriors beheaded Arias and brought his severed head to Magsanop. Magsanop immediately delivered the head to Almazán and gave the King an account of the incident. Cristobal and all who participated in the insurrection were fetched for the celebration.|$|R
60|$|All {{this has}} {{actually}} been the case, but in a degree which {{it would have been}} impossible to anticipate. That two youths, of the respective ages of eighteen and twenty, should have conceived for themselves a totally independent and sincere method of study, and enthusiastically persevered in it against every kind <b>of</b> <b>dissuasion</b> and opposition, is strange enough; that in the third or fourth year of their efforts they should have produced works in many parts not inferior to the best of Albert Durer, this is perhaps not less strange. But the loudness and universality of the howl which the common critics of the press have raised against them, the utter absence of all generous help or encouragement from those who can both measure their toil and appreciate their success, and the shrill, shallow laughter of those who can do neither the one nor the other,--these are strangest of all--unimaginable unless they had been experienced.|$|R
