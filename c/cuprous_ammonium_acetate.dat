30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 b, the DCW of fungus A. fumigatus {{increased}} {{with the increase}} concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>acetate</b> during the tested concentration ranges and reached maximum (17.32  g/L) at the concentration of 4.5  g/L. The effect of <b>ammonium</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration on the production performance of CHA was evaluated simultaneously; the maximum fermentation yield (31.28  mg/L) was obtained at 3.5  g/L of <b>ammonium</b> <b>acetate</b> (Fig.  2 b), which was {{much higher than the}} original fermentation medium and other tested nitrogen concentration. CHA is an alkaloidal metabolite of A. fumigatus CY 018 (Liu et al. 2016). Thus, there should be an intuitive connection between the nitrogen concentration and CHA accumulation. Consequently, {{it is not surprising that}} lower nitrogen concentration was negative for the CHA production. However, higher concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>acetate</b> (> 3.5  g/L) in culture medium had a negative effect on CHA accumulation (Fig.  2 b). In a previous report, inhibition of the production of secondary metabolites by high concentration of nitrogen source was also observed, which suggested the inhibition mechanism was due to the depression of enzymes in primary or secondary pathways related to the product biosynthesis (Wei et al. 2012). Among all the tested nitrogen sources and concentrations, <b>ammonium</b> <b>acetate</b> of 3.5  g/L revealed to the most optimal condition for improving CHA production (32  mg/L) and was selected for further medium optimization in the subsequent experiments.|$|R

30|$|Ions Cu(II) and Mn(II) in a weakly {{alkaline}} {{environment are}} {{in the form of}} acetate complexes.
