In July 1911, three new trams were purchased at a cost of £1,830. They were delivered in 1912. In June 1913, the track cleaning tram was adapted to enable it to water the streets where it ran. The track was by this time in a poor condition. A report estimated a repair cost of £3,477.

However, BAVAs behave very differently in large array environments with impedance anomalies limiting the array 2 ̆ 7 s most useful bandwidth. Two techniques are developed in this thesis to overcome these performance limiting anomalies. First, a double-mirroring technique is introduced to eliminate one of the anomalies at broadside beam. Second, the antenna depth has been limited 3 ̆c λ highest-frequency/ 2 {{in order to move}} the second anomaly beyond the grating lobe onset frequency, and hence beyond the array 2 ̆ 7 s upper frequency bound. The two techniques are used along with metallic <b>crosswalls,</b> metallic poles and magnetic slots to design modular low profile BAVA elements in an array that operates over one-half of a decade of bandwidth and scan up to 60 degrees half angle conical volume. ^ A linearly polarized doubly-mirrored BAVA (DmBAVA) array is fabricated and measured in a parallel plate waveguide simulator. Results from simulations and measurements are in close agreement. Finite arrays of SP- and DP-DmBAVA elements were simulated to explore the active element and array 2 ̆ 7 s radiation patterns. The cross-polarized farfield was less than - 20 dB relative to co-polarized farfield pattern peak at all scan angles. Floquet modes were calculated to prove that no grating lobe problem exists if all the elements are properly excited. The metallic <b>crosswalls</b> in the single-polarized DmBAVA array can be replaced by orthogonal DmBAVA elements to realize a dual-polarized antenna with only a minor degradation in the impedance match. ^ The design methodology presented in this thesis represents a philosophical shift away from traditional design practices. Rather than providing design curves and/or analytical expressions for equivalent circuit models, simple first-order design rules (generated via parametric studies and extensive examinations to the surface currents and electromagnetic fields distribution) provide a framework for reduction of design complexity, and have eliminated the impedance anomalies in BAVA. This will increase the use of BAVA radiating elements in high performance arrays. ...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{display a}} variety of shapes, which have {{biological}} relevance. In most eubacteria, cell shape is maintained by the tough peptidoglycan (PG) layer of the cell wall, the sacculus. The organization of PG synthesis machineries, orchestrated by different cytoskeletal elements, determines the specific shapes of sacculi. In rod-shaped bacteria, the actin-like (MreB) and the tubuline-like (FtsZ) cytoskeletons control synthesis of the sidewall (elongation) and the <b>crosswall</b> (septation) respectively. Much less is known concerning cell morphogenesis in cocci, which lack MreB proteins.

L. lactis IL 1403 wild-type cells form long aseptate filaments during both biofilm and planktonic growth in a synthetic medium.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the pollen of 42 species of Pseuduvaria (Annonaceae) is described. The pollen is consistently inaperturate, isopolar and radially symmetrical. Four basic patterns of exine sculpturing are identified: rugulate, verrucate, scabrate and psilate. The exine stratification of one representative species, P. macrocarpa, is shown to be entirely ectexinal. The ectexine consists of a discontinuous outer tectal layer, a columellar infratectal layer, and an inner lamellar foliated foot layer; the intine is very thin and fibrillar. The pollen is invariably released as acalymmate tetrads, in which the tectum is absent from the proximal walls. The individual pollen grains within the tetrads are connected by <b>crosswall</b> cohesion, involving both exine and intine; this form of cohesion has not hitherto {{been reported in the}} Annonaceae. In addition, pollen grains of neighbouring tetrads are connected in two different ways, viz. short exine connections and non-sporopollenin pollen-connecting threads. Neither of these cohesion mechanisms has previously been reported for the genus. The function of the various forms of cohesion between pollen grains and tetrads in Pseuduvaria is discussed as a mechanism to enhance the efficiency of pollination by enabling the fertilization of multiple ovules following a single pollinator visit. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{colony of}} a {{filamentous}} ascomycete fungus typically grows as a multinucleate syncytium. While this syncytial organization has developmental advantages, it bears {{the risk of}} extensive damage caused by local injury of hyphae. Loss of cytoplasm in injured hyphae is restricted by the fast and efficient sealing of the central pores of hyphal <b>crosswalls,</b> or septa, by a peroxisome-derived organelle called the Woronin body. The formation of septal plugs is also associated with development and leads to separation of {{certain parts of the}} colony. Septal plugs associated with developmental processes or aging hyphae typically occur by the accumulation of sealing material. Here we report that in Neurospora crassa, a protein necessary for hyphal fusion and proper colony development called SO (SOFT) localizes to septal plugs. In response to injury, SO accumulates at the septal plug in a Woronin body-independent manner. However, the presence of the Woronin body affects the speed of accumulation of SO at the septal pore. We determined that SO contributes to, but is not essential for, septal plugging. SO accumulation was also observed at septal plugs formed during hyphal aging and during programmed cell death mediated by genetic differences at heterokaryon incompatibility (het) loci...|$|R

The outer cell wall appeared more complex in “type 021 N” strains than in Thiothrix isolates. Bulbs or clusters of irregularly shaped cells, often present in filaments of “type 021 N” bacteria, appeared to result from <b>crosswalls</b> which formed at angles oblique to the filament axis. The multicellular nature of these sulfur bacteria was apparent in that only the cytoplasmic membrane and peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall were involved in the septation process.

40|$|Aspergillus nidulans grows by apical {{extension}} of multinucleate cells called hyphae that are subdivided by {{the insertion of}} <b>crosswalls</b> called septa. Apical cells vary in length and number of nuclei, whereas subapical cells are typically 40 microm long with three to four nuclei. Apical cells have active mitotic cycles, whereas subapical cells are arrested for growth and mitosis until branch formation reinitiates tip growth and nuclear divisions. This multicellular growth pattern requires coordination between localized growth, nuclear division, and septation. We searched a temperature-sensitive mutant collection for strains with conditional defects in growth patterning and identified six mutants (designated hyp for hypercellular). The identified hyp mutations are nonlethal, recessive defects in five unlinked genes (hypA-hypE). Phenotypic analyses showed that these hyp mutants have aberrant patterns of septation and show defects in polarity establishment and tip growth, but they have normal nuclear division cycles and can complete the asexual growth cycle at restrictive temperature. Temperature shift analysis revealed that hypD and hypE play general roles in hyphal morphogenesis, since inactivation of these genes resulted in a general widening of apical and subapical cells. Interestingly, loss of hypA or hypB function lead to a cessation of apical cell growth but activated isotropic growth and mitosis in subapical cells. The inferred functions of hypA and hypB suggest a mechanism for coordinating apical growth, subapical cell arrest, and mitosis in A. nidulans...|$|R
40|$|During {{cytokinesis}} a new <b>crosswall</b> {{is rapidly}} laid down. This process involves the formation at the cell equator of a tubulo-vesicular membrane network (TVN). This TVN evolves into a tubular network (TN) and a planar fenestrated sheet, which extends at its periphery before fusing {{to the mother}} cell wall. The role of cell wall polymers in cell plate assembly is poorly understood. We used specific stains and GFP-labelled cellulose synthases (CESAs) to show that cellulose, as well as three distinct CESAs, accumulated in the cell plate already at the TVN stage. This early presence suggests that cellulose is extruded into the tubular membrane structures of the TVN. Co-localisation studies using GFP-CESAs suggest the delivery of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) to the cell plate via phragmoplast-associated vesicles. In the more mature TN part of the cell plate, we observed delivery of GFP-CESA from doughnut-shaped organelles, presumably Golgi bodies. During {{the conversion of the}} TN into a planar fenestrated sheet, the GFP-CESA density diminished, whereas GFP-CESA levels remained high in the TVN zone at the periphery of the expanding cell plate. We observed retrieval of GFP-CESA in clathrin-containing structures from the central zone of the cell plate and from the plasma membrane of the mother cell, which may contribute to the recycling of CESAs to the peripheral growth zone of the cell plate. These observations, together with mutant phenotypes of cellulose-deficient mutants and pharmacological experiments, suggest a key role for cellulose synthesis already at early stages of cell plate assembly...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinesis, {{the process}} by which all cells divide, ensures the {{appropriate}} partitioning of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents between daughter cells. The filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, undergoes cytokinesis by septation, a process in which a chitin <b>crosswall,</b> termed a septum, is synthesized between two hyphal compartments. A genetic screen for mutants defective in septation in A. nidulans identified the gene sepA. Mutants containing sepA 1, a temperature-sensitive allele of sepA, fail to form septa at the restrictive temperature. In addition, sepA 1 mutants contain wide hyphae and undergo an aberrant branching pattern at their hyphal tips, two phenotypes indicative of defective polarized growth. ^ We have cloned the sepA gene and determined that the sepA gene product encodes a member of the formin family of proteins. Formins are defined by the presence of conserved domains, and are thought to function as molecular scaffolds in actin filament organization. In A. nidulans, actin filaments are required for hyphal tip growth and are required to form the actin ring which precedes septation. To elucidate the role of SEPA in actin dynamics, we have constructed a sepA deletion mutant and determined that sepA is required for actin ring formation. Furthermore, we have localized SEPA to hyphal tips and sites of septation. Using live imaging, we have found that SEPA localizes as a dynamic crescent and spot at hyphal tips, and as a ring that constricts at the sites of septation. Furthermore, we have determined that SEPA co-localizes with actin at both sites. ^ We have also tested the role of various cis and trans-acting factors in SEPA localization. We demonstrate that actin filaments are required to maintain the proper localization pattern of SEPA. In addition, we have determined that the amino-terminal half of SEPA is sufficient for localization to septation sites and hyphal tips. We have also found that the sepH gene product is required for SEPA localization only at septation sites. Our findings support a model in which SEPA directs the formation of the contractile actin ring during septation and functions simultaneously in the formation of actin filament structures required for polarized growth at hyphal tips. ...|$|E
40|$|Zygotes of fucoid algae {{have long}} been studied as a {{paradigm}} for cell polarity. Polarity is established early in the first cell cycle and is then expressed as localized growth and invariant cell division. The fertilized egg is a spherical cell and, by all accounts, bears little or no asymmetry. Polarity is acquired epigenetically {{a few hours later}} {{in the form of a}} rhizoid/thallus axis. The initial stage of polarization is axis selection, during which zygotes monitor environment gradients to determine the appropriate direction for rhizoid formation. In their natural setting in the intertidal zone, sunlight is probably the most important polarizing vector; rhizoids form away from the light. The mechanism by which zygotes perceive environmental gradients and transduce that information into an intracellular signal is unknown but may involve a phosphatidylinositol cycle. Once positional information has been recorded, the cytoplasm and membrane are reorganized in accordance with the vectorial information. The earliest detectable asymmetries in the polarizing zygote are localized secretion and generation of a transcellular electric current. Vesicle secretion and the inward limb of the current are localized at the presumptive rhizoid. The transcellular current may establish a cytoplasmic Ca 2 + gradient constituting a morphogenetic field, but this remains controversial. Localized secretion and establishment of transcellular current are sensitive to treatment with cytochalasins, indicating that cytoplasmic reorganization is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. The nascent axis at first is labile and susceptible to reorientation by subsequent environmental vectors but soon becomes irreversibly fixed in its orientation. Locking the axis in place requires both cell wall and F-actin and is postulated to involve an indirect transmembrane bridge linking cortical actin to cell wall. This bridge anchors relevant structures at the presumptive rhizoid and thereby stabilizes the axis. Approximately halfway through the first cell cycle, the latent polarity is expressed morphologically in the form of rhizoid growth. Elongation is by tip growth and does not appear to be fundamentally different from tip growth in other organisms. The zygote always divides perpendicular to the growth axis, and this is controlled by the microtubule cytoskeleton. Two microtubule-organizing centers on the nuclear envelope rotate such that they align with the growth axis. They then serve as spindle poles during mitosis. Cytokinesis bisects the axial spindle, resulting in a transverse <b>crosswall.</b> Although the chronology of cellular events associated with polarity is by now rather detailed, causal mechanisms remain obscure...|$|E
40|$|Filamentous fungi undergo {{cytokinesis}} {{by forming}} <b>crosswalls</b> termed septa. Here, {{we describe the}} genetic and physiological controls governing septation in Aspergillus nidulans. Germinating conidia do not form septa until the completion of their third nuclear division. The first septum is invariantly positioned at the basal end of the germ tube. Block-and-release experiments of nuclear division with benomyl or hydroxyurea, and analysis of various nuclear division mutants demonstrated that septum formation is dependent upon the third mitotic division. Block-and-release experiments with cytochalasin A and the localization of actin in germlings by indirect immunofluorescence showed that actin participated in septum formation. In addition to being concentrated at the growing hyphal tips, a band of actin was also apparent {{at the site of}} septum formation. Previous genetic analysis in A. nidulans identified four genes involved in septation (sepA-D). We have screened a new collection of temperature sensitive (ts) mutants of A. nidulans for strains that failed to form septa at the restrictive temperature but were able to complete early nuclear divisions. We identified five new genes designated sepE, G, H, I and J, along with one additional allele of a previously identified septation gene. On the basis of temperature shift experiments, nuclear counts and cell morphology, we sorted these cytokinesis mutants into three phenotypic classes. Interestingly, one class of mutants fails to form septa and fails to progress past the third nuclear division. This class of mutants suggests the existence of a regulatory mechanism in A. nidulans that ensures the continuation of nuclear division following the initiation of cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of endfire {{slotline}} antennas, such as notch or Vivaldi antennas, {{has been}} progressing {{over the last}} few decades. The physics of these antennas is as yet not well understood. Simple models do not predict their behavior accurately, and experimental data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, therefore full wave computer simulations, (finite element and moment method) are used extensively to model their behavior. ^ Dual-polarized arrays of these elements is the main topic of this work. A moment method analysis is developed to analyze these arrays. Many previously unknown results pertaining to their radiation and polarization characteristics are presented. With two orthogonally polarized elements, virtually any arbitrary polarization of wave can be transmitted provided (1) amplitude and phase control is used and (2) neither antenna is blind at the operating frequency and scan angle. Also, an unexpected asymmetry of the radiation was discovered and traced to the stripline feed. ^ Amplitude and phase control can be expensive to implement and may reduce the efficiency of the amplifiers, however. As an alternative, the use of phase-only control is investigated. This works well for generating a reduced set of antenna polarizations, namely, the left and right hand circular polarization, ± 45 ∘ slant linear polarization. Horizontal and vertical polarization can be generated as well if the amplifiers are switched on and off. ^ A new class of resonance was discovered for the dual-polarized array. The physical mechanism is identified and studies are performed showing the variation of resonant frequency with antenna shape, dielectric constant of the substrate and array depth. ^ A new class of single-polarized arrays is also studied.

The conidia spores of both pathogens were narrowly elongate with several transverse septae and each cell contained one nucleus. Spore length and cell number were positively correlated. Spore germination was shown in detail in S. pistaciarum. Spore germination, initially an increase in volume followed {{by an increase in}} length by cell division, and germination by the production of twin-pairs of secondary septate spores and/or hyphal germ tubes. A pattern of cell division, polarity and germination was established and an interactive model was described. The spore growth initially followed linear kinetics and then became exponential. The production of hyphal tips hecame continuous exponential {{at the same time and}} the hyphal growth unit stabilised at 40 - 60 urn. The germination pattern could be altered by manipulation of the nitrogen or phosphate source and levels in the medium. In the resting spore the wall was composed of three layers an outer layer (o) and two inner layers I 1 and I 2. Each primary septum was a duplex layer derived from I 1 and I 2 with an intermediate electron lucent layer. Perforation was simple with paired Woronin bodies. During increase in lengththe development of new (secondary) septa showed the <b>crosswall</b> material was derived from layer I 2 and development was centripetal. The germ-tube wall was formed from wall layer I 2 and wall layers 0 + I 1 were disrupted. Secondary spores were formed enter oblastically. S. pistaciarum and S. pistacina were used in the ultrastructure of host-pathogen investigation, infection of the host by S. pistaciarum was by inoculation with conidia produced on culture whereas with S. pistacina inoculation was obtained from previously infected leaves. The spores germinated on the leaf surface and penetration was made by fine hyphae through the stomatal aperture in both species, growth of pathogen within the leaf was limited to the intercellular spaces. Penetration of the host cell wall did not occur. The hyphae were attached to mesophyll and palisade cells by an accumulation of extra-hyphal sheathing material. The initial host response to infection was shown by an accumulation of electron-dense material and disruption of the tonoplast, followed by disruption of chloroplasts and disorganisation of the host cell cytoplasm. Pycnidia were produced within the lesion. Pycnidial initials were formed in sub-stomatal spaces and spore tendrils were released on the leaf surface. <p...|$|E
