40|$|The {{loss ratio}} (LR) for {{insurance}} companies {{is defined as}} the ratio of incurred claims and earned premiums for a specified class of insurance (CoI). The company may estimate then its capital requirement for that particular CoI by using value at risk (VaR) or conditional VaR (CVaR) of the LR distribution at a specified probability value. The overall objective of the company is to evaluate the aggregate capital requirement through a weighted sum of marginal capital requirements for all the <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> Nevertheless, this procedure may tend to over-estimate the aggregate capital requirement because it does not take into consideration the real dependence among the different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> In other words, perfect dependence does not allow considering diversification effects...|$|E
40|$|Practice {{proved that}} {{strategic}} planning {{is a necessary}} process for insurance companies. This process can help companies to adapt more easily to environmental changes. The strategic planning of the activity of an insurance company cannot be realized without a careful analysis {{of the evolution of}} the market and without studying the company's market position. A classic model used in the portfolio analysis is the Boston Consulting Group model. In this paper we have used the model for studying the activity of the leader of the Romanian insurance market. In 2009 Alliantz Tiriac had 17 types of insurance in the portfolio. Each class of insurance was considered a strategic business unit. We have studied the insurance portfolio by using secondary data from specialized publications, such as the Romanian Insurance Supervisory Commission. Using the data, we have calculated for Alliantz Tiriac, for each class of insurance, the relative market share. The company was leader on the market for five <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> The economic crisis had a severe impact on the evolution of the Romanian insurance market: from the 17 <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> studied: nine had registered a decrease of the market, eight had registered an increase, but only for three of them the growth exceeded 10 %. Using the relative market share and the market growth we have identified the “cash cows”: there are five <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> in this category, among which the “Insurance for land vehicles (CASCO) ” which represented {{more than half of the}} sales (55. 82 %); unfortunately, in the case of this insurance type there was a very significant decrease of the market in 2010 compared to 2009 : - 25. 12 %, the “question marks” – there are three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> in this category, and the “dogs”. Due to the crisis, a large number of the company's products are in this category and there are no “star” products.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a modified version}} of the classical Cramer-Lundberg risk model. In particular, we assume two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> business dependent through the claim number process N i, i = 1, 2 : we consider that the number of claims is generated by a bivariate Poisson distribution (N 1, N 2). We also consider the presence of a particular kind of reinsurance contract, supposing that the first insurer concludes an Excess of Loss reinsurance limited by L i, i = 1, 2, with retention limits b i, i = 1, 2, for the respective <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> business. The aim of this paper is to maximize the expected utility of the wealth of the first insurer, having the retention limits as decision variables.
