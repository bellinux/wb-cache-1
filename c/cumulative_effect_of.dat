5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> heavy traffic and weather.

According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> {{encompasses}} a broader spectrum {{of resources and}} land uses than has typically been evaluated in research. As management pressures in large drainage basins intensify, pristine areas may be subjected to multiple human activities. These activities are distributed through time and space, and their effects can occur {{at the location of}} a particular land use or away from the location. Even though individual land uses may not significantly degrade environmental components such as soil productivity, water quality, or aquatic habitat, the combined <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> several activities may be unacceptable. Theoretically, <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> land management may also provide benefits to portions of ecosystems, such as increased stream productivity generated by nutrient inputs. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> land management must also be evaluated within the context of natural processes and events, such as large storms, wildfire, geochemical weathering, and vegetation succession. This overview provides examples <b>of</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> land management and introduces the papers in this issue that were presented at a special symposium held during the American Society of Agronomy meetings in 1989...|$|R

25|$|The {{causes of}} and {{responsibility}} for this exodus are highly controversial topics among commentators on the conflict and even historians who specialize in this era.

25|$|The <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these conquests was {{to prompt}} the kings to appoint their younger sons to territories: the apanages or privileges.

25|$|The <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this {{campaign}} was severe; {{a quarter of}} all wartime sinkings – 3.1 million tons. There were several reasons for this. The American naval commander, Admiral Ernest King, as an apparent anglophobe, was averse to taking British recommendations to introduce convoys, U.S. Coast Guard and Navy patrols were predictable and could be avoided by U-boats, inter-service co-operation was poor, and the U.S. Navy did not possess enough suitable escort vessels (British and Canadian warships were transferred to the U.S. east coast).|$|E

40|$|Water {{planning}} {{is a fundamental}} tool for achieving the sustainable use of water, {{and it is a}} key element of the National Water Initiative (NWI). Recognising that the interception of water by mining activities has become an increasingly important issue for industry, governments, communities and other water users, the Commission has been undertaking a 1. 8 million project, <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Effects</b> <b>of</b> Mining on Groundwater Resources, to investigate current practices across Australia. The project 2 ̆ 7 s first report Water issues in jurisdictional planning for mining assesses the extent to which state and territory mining and environmental assessment processes are consistent with National Water Initiative (NWI) objectives and considers the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> mining on groundwater. The scope of the appraisal includes all state and territory jurisdictional agencies that have responsibility for planning, water, mining and environmental assessment processes. It also encompasses an assessment of Commonwealth jurisdictional requirements that are relevant to groundwater resources or Commonwealth land. This report finds that although all states and territories have to some degree considered NWI objectives when assessing the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> mining on groundwater, there are significant opportunities for improvement. These include moving to a nationally consistent risk-based approach for considering local and <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> mining on groundwater, improving communication and coordination between agencies involved in planning and approvals, and developing nationally consistent water accounting, data collection, storage and sharing protocols.   This paper is part of a series of works commissioned by the National Water Commission on key water issues. This work has been undertaken by Trina Jensen of Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd on behalf of the Commission...|$|R
25|$|On 17 December, {{extensive}} {{damage was done}} to the Berlin railway system. By this time <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the bombing campaign had made {{more than a quarter}} of Berlin's total living accommodation unusable. There was another major raid on 28–29 January 1944, when Berlin's western and southern districts were hit in the most concentrated attack of this period. On 15–16 February, important war industries were hit, including the large Siemensstadt area, with the centre and south-western districts sustaining most of the damage. This was the largest raid by the RAF on Berlin. Raids continued until March 1944.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, the German {{defensive}} line now only extended from Denmark to Switzerland. This enabled British bombers to fly toward German territory without interception on the way. The German strength was thus reduced, with more aircraft diverted to reconnaissance over the North Sea {{in an attempt}} to pick up Allied bomber formations. In spite of the problems, the Luftwaffe night fighter force was stronger numerically than ever before. It remained intact and presented a theoretical threat to Bomber Command, particularly when the British made deep penetrations. However, since the first half of 1944, the outlook for the force had changed from increasing efficiency to a probability of declining effectiveness as the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> poor training, shortage of fuel, diversion of effort and shortage of manpower became perceptible.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of addressing cumulative {{environmental impact of}} large development projects on rivers has been increasingly highlighted. Consideration to potential impact pathways may be difficult, however, without appropriate analytical methods. By introducing ecological network model, this paper focuses on the quantification of the cause-effect relationships inherent the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> dam construction from a holistic perspective. With Lancang river of Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR) as an example, the risk-based interaction instead of the conventional energy or material flow of ecological network model has been created to conceptualize the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> network model. Based on this model, the network structural and functional analysis were adjusted {{for the assessment of}} potential eco-environmental impact within the ecosystem, thus demonstrating how the risk-based ecological network analysis can be used to characterize the holistic <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> dams on the temporal and spatial scale...|$|R
