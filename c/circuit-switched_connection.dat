40|$|The {{number and}} size of les {{transferred}} over the Internet is sufficiently significant to warrant the investigation of faster and more efficient mechanisms for their transfer. This research begins by comparing the performance of circuit-switching and TCP/IP (which is most commonly used in the Internet) when bulk data is transferred. Experimental and analytical analysis suggests that circuit-switching is indeed better suited for bulk data transfer than TCP/IP. Circuit-switching suffers from the drawback that connections at rates higher than DS 0 (64 Kbps) can only be obtained in provisioned mode. For circuit-switching to be usable for bulk data transfer, it should support on demand circuits at much higher data rates, for example OC 1 (51. 84 Mbps) to OC 768 (40 Gbps). A signaling protocol {{has been designed to}} be implemented in hardware (thus providing high throughput). It enables the setup of high-bandwidth on-demand circuits in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) networks. An accompanying routing protocol to be implemented in software is also designed. Further, design decisions are considered for a transport protocol that enables the reliable transfer of bulk data over a <b>circuit-switched</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Principles for {{designing}} practical self-routing nonblocking N × N <b>circuit-switched</b> <b>connection</b> networks with optimal q(N × log N) hardware at the bit-level of complexity are described. The overall principles behind the architecture {{can be described}} as “Expand-Route-Contract. ” A self-routing nonblocking network with w-bit wide datapaths can be achieved by expanding the datapaths to w + z independent bit-serial connections, routing these connections through self-routing networks with blocking, and by contracting the data at the output and recovering the w-bit wide datapaths. For an appropriate redundancy z, the blocking probability can be made arbitrarily small and the fault tolerance arbitrarily high. By using efficient space domain concentrators, the architecture yields self-routing nonblocking switching networks with an optimal O(N × log N) bits of memory or O(N × log N × log log log N) logic gates. By using a linear-cost time domain concentrator, the architecture yields self-routing nonblocking switching networks with an optimal q(N × log N) bits of memory or logic gates. These designs meet Shannon’s lower bound on memory requirements, established in the 1950 s. The number of stages of crossbars can match the theoretical minimum, which has not been achieved by previous self-routing networks. The architecture is feasible with existing electrical or optical technologies. The designs of electrical and optical switch cores with Terabits of bisection bandwidth for Networks-of-Workstations (NOWs) are described...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA large {{interconnection}} {{network is}} modeled as a closed queueing network. The discussion uses the terminology of a multiprocessor system with partially available buses, connecting several groups of memory modules, {{but the same}} model applies to other engineering systems, such as <b>circuit-switching</b> <b>connections.</b> A particular feature of the model is that it accommodates non-uniform addressing patterns (asymmetric switch), and that the analysis handles bottlenecks well. Exact expressions for the standard performance measures — processing power and memory bandwidth — are presented, using the system partition function, with recursion relations for their computation. For large systems, we derive simple approximations of the performance measures, in terms of asymptotic estimates of the partitions functions and the steady-state probability distribution functions. A new approach is used to estimate the key quantity in the approximation: the relative weights of the system macro-states, {{expressed in terms of}} an equivalent queueing network, where each memory group is replaced by a single-server node with variable service rate. The approach is based on an integral representation of these weights in terms of the Cauchy integrals of their generating functions, and the estimation of these integrals by the saddle-point method.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 132 - 139. Increasing {{demand for}} bandwidth and proliferation of packet based traffic have been causing architectural {{changes in the}} communications infrastructure. In this evolution, metro networks face both the capacity and dynamic adaptability constraints. The increase in the access and backbone speeds result in high bandwidth requirements, whereas the popularity of wireless access and limited number of customers in metro area necessitates traffic adaptability. Traditional architecture which has been optimized for carrying <b>circuit-switched</b> <b>connections,</b> is far from meeting these requirements. Recently, several architectures have been proposed for future metro access networks. Nearly all of these solutions support dynamic allocation of bandwidth to follow fluctuations in the traffic demand. However, reconfiguration policies {{that can be used}} in this process have not been fully explored yet. In this thesis, dynamic wavelength allocation (DWA) policies for IP/WDM metro access networks with reconfiguration delays are considered. Reconfiguration actions incur a cost since a portion of the capacity becomes idle in the reconfiguration period due to the signalling latencies and tuning times of optical transceivers. Exact formulation of the DWA problem is developed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a new cost function is proposed to attain both throughput efficiency and fairness. For larger problems, a heuristic approach based on first passage probabilities is developed. The performance of the method is evaluated under both stationary and non-stationary traffic conditions. The effects of relevant network and traffic parameters, such as delay and flow size are also discussed. Finally, performance bounds for the DWA methods are derived. Yetginer, EmrePh. D...|$|R

40|$|Third-generation (3 G) mobile {{communication}} systems are currently {{one of the}} key communication technologies in research and development due to the high market demand for advanced wireless communication. The current evolution is primarily characterized by a transition from circuit-switched voice-oriented networks to integrated multi-service all IP networks. To effectively design complex {{mobile communication}} systems, the design process should be accompanied by stochastic modeling and quantitative evaluation of different design alternatives. The most popular language for model specification used in industrial projects is the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Although conceived as a general-purpose modeling language, the current version of the UML does not contain building blocks for introducing stochastic timing into UML diagrams. The first part of this thesis presents new results for numerical quantitative analysis of discrete-event stochastic systems specified in Petri net notation or as UML diagrams. An efficient algorithm for the state space generation out of an UML state diagram or activity diagram that allows quantitative analysis by means of the underlying stochastic process is presented. Furthermore, this thesis considers new methodological results for the effective numerical analysis of finite-state generalized semi-Markov processes with exponential and deterministic events by an embedded general state space Markov chain (GSSMC). Key contributions constitute (i) the observation that elements of the transition kernel of the GSSMC can always be computed by appropriate summation of transient state probabilities of continuous-time Markov chains and (ii) the derivation of conditions under which kernel elements are constant. To provide automated tool support, the presented algorithms are included in the software package DSPNexpress-NG available for download on the Web. The support of multimedia services over wireless channels presents a number of technical challenges. One of the major challenges is to effectively utilize the scarce radio bandwidth in the access network by adaptive control of system parameters. The second part of this thesis is devoted to this topic. A Markov model representing the sharing of radio channels by <b>circuit-switched</b> <b>connections</b> and packet-switched sessions under a dynamic channel allocation scheme is evaluated. Closing the loop between network operation and network control, a framework for the adaptive quality of service management for 3 G mobile networks is introduced. Building on this framework, a novel call admission control and bandwidth reservation scheme for the optimization of quality of service for mobile subscribers is presented.

One example of such an evasive action is to suspend transmission for a certain duration of time during which the OS on the receiving end-system must handle other computational processes. With this in mind, we propose to extend the Reliable-Blast UDP (RBUDP) protocol to take such evasive action by using a simple feedback mechanism that is activated via performance monitoring. The new protocol, named RBUDP + dramatically improves the performance of data transfer over LambdaGrids.
