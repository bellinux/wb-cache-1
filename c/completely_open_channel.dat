40|$|We study {{transport}} {{through a}} strongly correlated quantum dot {{and show that}} Coulomb blockade can appear even {{in the presence of}} perfect contacts. This conclusion arises from numerical calculations of the conductance for a microscopic model of spinless fermions in an interacting chain connected to each lead via a <b>completely</b> <b>open</b> <b>channel.</b> The dependence of the conductance on the gate voltage shows well defined Coulomb blockade peaks which are sharpened as the interaction strength is increased. Our numerics is based on the embedding method and the DMRG algorithm. We explain the emergence of Coulomb blockade with perfect contacts by a reduction of the effective coupling matrix elements between many-body states corresponding to successive particle numbers in the interacting region. A perturbative approach, valid in the strong interaction limit, yields an analytic expression for the interaction-induced suppression of the conductance in the Coulomb blockade regime.

30|$|Generally speaking, small cells such as femtocells, {{which provide}} {{improved}} radio coverage and throughput by wireless access, operate in three access modes: open access, closed access, and hybrid access.

Rat platelets showed a glycogen distribution in relation to the <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> system in approximately one-third of all platelets seen in randomly selected photomicrographs. The glycogen particles had a mean diameter of 256 Å, and the density of glycogen deposits was similar to that observed in human platelets. Glycogen related to the <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> system was seen in proximity to granular structures and frequently was membrane bound. Addition of thrombin, ADP or collagen to platelet-rich plasma, as well as storage of platelets at 21 C, was associated with a loss of glycogen in sites adjacent to the <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> system, but many dispersed glycogen particles appeared to be preserved.

The growth of vegetation in a channel system is environmental friendly, but its effect on the flow in an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> junction can be significant. In this work a 3 D RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation) model has been implemented to investigate the flow phenomena in channel junctions with or without vegetation. The model is first validated by two cases: flow in an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> T-junction without vegetation, and flow in a single <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> with vegetation. The model is then applied to simulate flow in an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> T-junction with varying width ratio and vegetation density of the branch channel. The results quantitatively predict the trend of increasing flow in the branch channel with the increase in branch channel width and/or the decrease in vegetation density.
