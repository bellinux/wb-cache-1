5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>overflow.</b>|$|E
25|$|During high {{precipitation}} periods {{a combined}} sewer system may experience a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>overflow</b> event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose {{a serious threat to}} public health and the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|POTWs with {{combined}} sewers {{are required to}} comply with the national <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> <b>Overflow</b> Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994.

About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, an {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} BBC's Panorama concluded that the operation of more than 20,000 <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> <b>Overflow</b> pipes (CSO) was leading to the routine spillage of untreated wastes around Britain's coastline, potentially leading to very dirty water around {{some of the most}} popular beaches in the UK. The CSOs, intended for use in very rare occasions, were not covered by the existing legislation for waste emissions.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the Red Hook Treatment Plant was opened, {{diverting}} more sewage {{input from}} the canal. This $375 million plant collected waste from the existing Bond Street sewer and brought the total of <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>overflow</b> (CSO) points {{in the city to}} 14. With the opening of the new plant, the last dry-weather discharge into a New York City waterway ended, and the CSO points now only function during rain storms. The flushing tunnel was fixed, its fan having reversed direction, in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>overflow</b> points, so {{the fear is that}} the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E

25|$|However, those {{treatment}} system upgrades have not, contrary to federal laws in both countries, yet eliminated <b>Combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>Overflow</b> events. This describes when older sewerage systems, which combine storm water with sewage into single sewers {{heading to the}} treatment plant, are temporarily overwhelmed by heavy rainstorms. Local sewage treatment authorities then must release untreated effluent, a mix of rainwater and sewage, into local water bodies. While enormous public investments such as the Deep Tunnel projects in Chicago and Milwaukee have greatly reduced the frequency and volume of these events, {{they have not been}} eliminated. The number of such overflow events in Ontario, for example, is flat according to the International Joint Commission. Reports about this issue on the U.S. side highlight five large municipal systems (those of Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Milwaukee and Gary) as being the largest current periodic sources of untreated discharges into the Great Lakes.|$|E

It has been described as showing [...] "some degraded conditions", but does not rank among the most polluted watersheds in the Middle Susquehanna Subbasin.

2500|$|Situated on the Delaware River waterfront, {{the city}} of Camden {{contains}} many pollution-causing facilities, such as a trash incinerator and a sewage plant. [...] Despite the additions of new waste-water and trash treatment facilities in the 1970s and 1980s, pollution in the city remains an issue due to faulty waste disposal practices and outdated sewer systems. The open-air nature of the waste treatment plants cause the smell of sewage and other toxic fumes to permeate through the air. [...] This has encouraged local grass roots organizations to protest {{the development of these}} plants in Camden. The development of traffic-heavy highway systems between Philadelphia and South Jersey also contributed to the rise of air pollution in the area. Water contamination has been an issue in Camden for decades. [...] In the 1970s, dangerous pollutants were found near the Delaware River at the Puchack Well Field, where many Camden citizens received their household water from, decreasing property values in Camden and causing health problems among the city's residents. [...] Materials contaminating the water included cancer-causing metals and chemicals, affecting as many as 50,000 people between the early 1970s and late 1990s, when the six Puchack wells were officially shut down and declared a Superfund site.
