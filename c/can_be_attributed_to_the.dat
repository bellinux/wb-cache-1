5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates {{of the size of the}} overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include {{a portrait of the}} priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> B centers.

The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1. The latter is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form.|$|E

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake effect.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System.

5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
