30|$|The {{other two}} cupcake tasks that {{involved}} reasoning about <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (groups of rows of cupcakes) were not generally solvable for INS or eTNS students, {{so they were}} in that way useful for differentiating between eTNS and aTNS. However, we focused on how correct solutions differed, which helped us distinguish between aTNS and ENS students. Overall, we found the following types of evidence in correct solutions of cupcake tasks: Solutions that lacked evidence {{of the construction of}} <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for INS students) included pen marks from counting and recounting units of 1, indicating a focus on counting units of 1 and not the figurative composites. Solutions that showed evidence of constructing <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity (possible for eTNS students) included written counts of <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> indicating the explicit awareness of <b>composites</b> as countable <b>units.</b> Solutions that showed evidence of an anticipatory use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for aTNS students) included (a) the complete or partial curtailment of drawing figurative units of 1 and/or a single symbol to represent a composite unit; (b) using <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> to organize diagrams (Figs.  8 d and 9 a); (c) written coordinations of multiple counts, such as counts of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> and total units of 1; and (d) immediate unpacking of <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> into units of 1, bypassing further operations on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Solutions that indicated the ability to construct and potentially operate on in activity, <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for ENS students) included (a) disembedding (lack of embedding) of a <b>composite</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (ENS) and (b) the absence of written supports (no intermediate calculations or figurative items). It {{is important to remember that}} students may not use the most sophisticated strategies available to them on any particular problem, so that rubrics need to give more weight to the most sophisticated use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> that is evidenced. Moreover, because students’ written responses can only be interpreted as providing positive evidence or absence of evidence, the number sequence classifications for students based on these tasks represent a lower bound in terms of their reasoning with <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
30|$|Tasks {{involving}} discrete {{units in}} which figurative representations of units and (to the observer) <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> were provided seemed to elicit {{a greater variety}} of written solutions. We will use student solutions from two of these tasks to illustrate how use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> can be evidenced with written work. The first task was useful for differentiating the use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity or assimilation. For this task, there are marked differences between the types of figurative support used by the students at different stages. The second task was useful for differentiating the use of <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity or assimilation.|$|R
30|$|Cupcake Task C is {{indicative}} of six tasks on the assessment in which the student is given a situation that involves a <b>composite</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Generally, ENS students can operate effectively in these situations. Because {{of the lack of}} efficiency with which eTNS students conceptualize <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> creating and then operating on <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> creates an unsustainable cognitive load. However, aTNS students’ ability to anticipate the use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> opens the door for them to make sense of these tasks, even if they have trouble carrying out the mental operations to complete them effectively. This was evident in the fact that over 56 % of students categorized as aTNS made a reasonable attempt at solving the majority of these tasks.|$|R

30|$|In our {{analysis}} of students’ written work on the assessment, we found that written work on tasks that included figurative unit items, such as cupcakes, boxes, and/or rows on the cupcake tasks, provided the greatest variety of evidence regarding students’ construction of and operation on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, a situation that would represent a simple division situation (Cupcake Task A) was most useful in helping determine whether the students had constructed <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> and/or were using <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> anticipatorily in planning solution activities. These distinctions are important for distinguishing between INS, eTNS, and aTNS students.|$|R
30|$|The {{construction}} of a TNS is marked by constructing <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> of counting acts (like the <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> of 4 that represented the subsequence from 8 to 12) {{that can be used}} in further operations (like the repeated use of “counting by 3 ” as a unit of measure in Cupcake Task A). In general, <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> are units composed of multiple smaller units such that the student can treat them as a single unit while remaining aware of the constituent units contained within it. Therefore, when solving Cupcake Task A, a student who has constructed a TNS can form the goal of figuring out how many times they count by 3, a <b>composite</b> <b>unit,</b> to get to 39. In general, use of a TNS would be indicated by skip counting or repeated addition to solve multiplication or division problems 2 (Olive, 2001; Ulrich, 2015).|$|R

The tasks were useful in distinguishing between students {{at each of the}} four classifications. In particular, tasks in which an unpartitioned bar was identified with a larger <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> were only successfully assimilated by probable aTNS students, implying that these tasks {{do a good job of}} testing a student’s ability to assimilate with <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, we found that partitions that would scaffold a multiplicative comparison of the two bars did not greatly reduce the difficulty of the problems, implying that students who can assimilate a task with <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> do not have difficulty making and interpreting (what is to the observer) a multiplicative comparison of the <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Our findings imply that the bar tasks could be a powerful addition to assessments measuring a student’s stage in constructing and coordinating units.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the <b>unit</b> <b>graph</b> G(R) and the unitary Cayley graph Γ(R) of a ring R, and relate {{them to the}} {{structure}} of the ring R. Chapter 1 gives a brief history and background of the study of the <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> and unitary Cayley graphs of rings. Moreover, some basic concepts, which are needed in this thesis, in ring theory and graph theory are introduced. Chapter 2 concerns the <b>unit</b> <b>graph</b> G(R) of a ring R. In Section 2. 2, we first prove that the girth gr(G(R)) of the <b>unit</b> <b>graph</b> of an arbitrary ring R is 3, 4, 6 or ∞. Then we determine the rings R with R/J(R) semipotent and with gr(G(R)) = 6 or ∞, and classify the rings R with R/J(R) right self-injective and with gr(G(R)) = 3 or 4. The girth of the <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> of some ring extensions are also investigated. The focus of Section 2. 3 is on the diameter of <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> of rings. We prove that diam(G(R)) ∈ 1, 2, 3,∞ for a ring R with R/J(R) self-injective and determine those rings R with diam(G(R)) = 1, 2, 3 or ∞, respectively. It is shown that, for each n ≥ 1, there exists a ring R such that n ≤ diam(G(R)) ≤ 2 n. The planarity of <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> of rings is discussed in Section 2. 4. We completely determine the rings whose <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> are planar. In the last section of this chapter, we classify all finite commutative rings whose <b>unit</b> <b>graphs</b> have genus 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Chapter 3 is about the unitary Cayley graph Γ(R) of a ring R. In Section 3. 2, it is proved that gr(Γ(R)) ∈ 3, 4, 6,∞ for an arbitrary ring R, and that, for each n ≥ 1, there exists a ring R with diam(Γ(R)) = n. Rings R with R/J(R) self-injective are classified according to diameters of their unitary Cayley graphs. In Section 3. 3, we completely characterize the rings whose unitary Cayley graphs are planar. In Section 3. 4, we prove that, for each g ≥ 1, there are at most finitely many finite commutative rings R with genus γ(Γ(R)) = g. We also determine all finite commutative rings R with γ(Γ(R)) = 1, 2, 3, respectively. Chapter 4 is about the isomorphism problem between G(R) and Γ(R). We prove that for a finite ring R, G(R) ∼= Γ(R) if and only if either char(R/J(R)) = 2 or R/J(R) = Z 2 × S for some ring S. ...|$|R

30|$|In Steffe and Cobb’s (1988) {{study with}} K- 2 {{students}} {{in which the}} number sequences were first theorized, operating with a TNS {{was thought to be}} a transitional stage that students would move through quickly as various tacit quantitative relationships were made explicit upon repeated exposure and reflection. In Steffe and Olive’s (2010) work with grade 3 – 5 students, the stage associated with construction of a TNS clearly lasted many months but was still seen as transitional. In working with middle-grade students (Ulrich, 2012; Ulrich & Phillips, 2015), we have begun to suspect that some students remain at this stage for multiple years: We have found students who can utilize <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in unexpected ways, implying a great familiarity with <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> and yet have not yet moved to the next stage of unit construction and coordination (Ulrich, 2016 b). One indication of a student’s familiarity with <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> is an ability to anticipate the results of constructing <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> before they construct them. For instance, this student would be able to form the goal of counting by 3 s to 39 before constructing a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> of 3 to stand in for a box of cupcakes in Cupcake Task A. Despite this anticipatory use of <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> {{the fact that they are}} constrained to the stage associated with the TNS is made clear through several serious constraints in their mathematical thinking (see Ulrich, 2016 b). Because we are interested in what percentage of middle-grade students are constrained to these kinds of advanced operations with a TNS, we broke the stage associated with a TNS into two substages when designing the written assessment: (1) students who are still early in the stage (eTNS students) and (2) students who can do advanced operations within this stage (aTNS students).|$|R

Subsequently, we show that the proof does not extend to quasi <b>unit</b> disk <b>graphs,</b> a generalization of <b>unit</b> disk <b>graphs.</b> We give an exact formulation of the problem of finding <b>unit</b> disk <b>graph</b> coordinates in terms of a quadratic feasibility problem and explore different approximations in terms of linear programs, quadratic programs and semidefinite programs. ...|$|R

In this task, one bar was said to be 14 units long and the student was asked to draw a bar that was 21 units long. If the student were to utilize 7 -unit lengths to draw the bar, then they would show that they could think of 14 and 21 as made up of multiples of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> before operating and utilize that knowledge to plan a solution strategy. That would, in fact, imply a stage higher than the ENS stage but certainly would be a decisive indication of ENS.

30|$|Two tasks {{involving}} discrete quantities {{presented an}} unknown number of marbles being added to a cup of marbles. These tasks were meant to help differentiate between INS and eTNS. The rest of the tasks involving discrete quantities required multiple applications of a <b>composite</b> <b>unit.</b> In Cupcake Task A (Fig.  1), the <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> were boxes. In Cupcake Tasks B (Fig.  3) and C (Fig.  9), the <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> were rows. In both situations, there were also boxes that represented a <b>composite</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (3 -level unit) that had to be operated on in some way. There were two other problems involving <b>composite</b> discrete <b>units.</b> One involved Legos made into Lego houses. The other involved scoops of ice cream in sundaes. In many of these problems, the ability of a student to do the problem mentally without writing down any intermediate steps or supporting work was taken to indicate a higher number stage construction. However, we recognize that some students might routinely show their work because of teacher expectations and not out of need for figurative material. Therefore, we do not count the use of figurative drawings (e.g., drawing out cupcakes) “against” students for higher stage attributions (i.e., give a negative score for this work). For example, if they do some of the more complex problems mentally, that would indicate ENS, but if they show work, it does not contraindicate ENS.|$|R

In updip areas, {{the base of the}} Upper Floridan is either coincident with the top of the confining units above the Claiborne, Lisbon, or Gordon aquifers, or it lies above any clay bed that marks the boundary between mostly carbonate and mostly clastic units or previously mapped numbered MCUs of Miller (1986). If one or more evaporite units are present, such as middle confining unit MCUIII near Valdosta in south-central Georgia (Miller, 1986) or MCUII in southwestern Florida (Miller, 1986), the base of the Upper Floridan aquifer is coincident with the top of the evaporite unit. In regions where no distinct lower permeability unit is known to be present, the base of the Upper Floridan is extrapolated along a horizon that allows for a stratigraphic grouping of permeable rock into the upper or lower parts of the aquifer system. In southeastern Alabama, northern Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, the stratigraphic units are grouped into the Lisbon-Avon Park <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit.</b> In peninsular Florida, this horizon is coincident with one or more evaporite-bearing or non-evaporite-bearing units of the Middle Avon Park <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit.</b> In the panhandle of Florida and southwest Alabama, the base is coincident with the top of the Bucatunna Clay Confining Unit.|$|R
