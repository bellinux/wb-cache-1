25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line for each slave. A pull-up resistor between power source and <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance).|$|E
25|$|All ranks are {{connected}} to the same memory bus (address+data). The <b>Chip</b> <b>Select</b> signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.|$|E
25|$|Every slave on the {{bus that}} has not been {{activated}} using its <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line must disregard the input clock and MOSI signals, and must not drive MISO.|$|E

25|$|SPI {{controllers}} {{from different}} vendors support different feature sets; such DMA queues are not uncommon, {{although they may}} be associated with separate DMA engines rather than the SPI controller itself, such as used by multichannel buffered serial port (MCBSP). Most SPI master controllers integrate support for up to four <b>chip</b> <b>selects,</b> although some require <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> to be managed separately through GPIO lines.|$|R

25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits per transfer. The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be pulled low before the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> is activated. The <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line must be activated, which normally means being toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|E
25|$|The SD {{protocol}} {{envisioned the}} ability to gang 30 cards together without separate <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card {{to respond to the}} command using its unique serial number.|$|E
25|$|If {{a single}} slave device is used, the SS pin may be fixed to logic low if the slave permits it. Some slaves require a falling {{edge of the}} <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> signal to {{initiate}} an action. An example is the Maxim MAX1242 ADC, which starts conversion on a high→low transition. With multiple slave devices, an independent SS signal is required from the master for each slave device.|$|E

50|$|The SIM (System Integration Module), which {{eliminates}} much {{glue logic}} by providing <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> and address decoding. The SIM {{also provides a}} clock generator, watchdogs for various system operations, configuration of processor pins, a periodic timer, and an interrupt controller.|$|R
25|$|The SPI bus is a {{de facto}} {{standard}}. However, {{the lack of a}} formal standard is reflected {{in a wide variety of}} protocol options. Different word sizes are common. Every device defines its own protocol, including whether it supports commands at all. Some devices are transmit-only; others are receive-only. <b>Chip</b> <b>selects</b> are sometimes active-high rather than active-low. Some protocols send the least significant bit first.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} hardware-level differences. Some chips combine MOSI and MISO {{into a single}} data line (SI/SO); this is {{sometimes}} called 'three-wire' signaling (in contrast to normal 'four-wire' SPI). Another variation of SPI removes the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line, managing protocol state machine entry/exit using other methods. Anyone needing an external connector for SPI defines their own: UEXT, JTAG connector, Secure Digital card socket, etc. Signal levels depend entirely on the chips involved.|$|E
25|$|Some devices {{even have}} minor variances from the CPOL/CPHA modes {{described}} above. Sending data from slave to master {{may use the}} opposite clock edge as master to slave. Devices often require extra clock idle time before the first clock or after the last one, or between a command and its response. Some devices have two clocks, one to read data, and another to transmit it into the device. Many of the read clocks run from the <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line.|$|E
25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own <b>chip</b> <b>select</b> line to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E
25|$|A queued serial {{peripheral}} interface (QSPI) {{is a type}} of SPI controller that uses a data queue to transfer data across the SPI bus. It has a wrap-around mode allowing continuous transfers to and from the queue with only intermittent attention from the CPU. Consequently, the peripherals appear to the CPU as memory-mapped parallel devices. This feature is useful in applications such as control of an A/D converter. Other programmable features in QSPI are <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> and transfer length/delay.|$|R
50|$|The chip has {{a memory}} {{interface}} {{that is similar}} to the original Z80, including the bus request/acknowledge pins, and adds four integrated <b>chip</b> <b>selects.</b> Versions are available with on-chip flash memory and on-chip zero wait-state SRAM (up to 256 KB flash memory and 16 KB SRAM) but there are also external buses on all models. The eZ80 supports a TCP/IP stack and operating system based on the Xinu operating system, as well as a real-time kernel.|$|R

50|$|There {{is little}} {{difference}} between a dual rank UDIMM and two single rank UDIMMs in the same memory channel, other than that the DRAMs reside on different PCBs. The electrical connections between the memory controller and the DRAMs are almost identical (with {{the possible exception of}} which <b>chip</b> <b>selects</b> go to which ranks). Increasing the number of ranks per DIMM is mainly intended to increase the memory density per channel. Too many ranks in the channel can cause excessive loading and decrease the speed of the channel. Also some memory controllers have a maximum supported number of ranks. DRAM load on the CA (Command/Address) bus can be reduced by using registered memory.|$|R

40|$|SDRAM is {{commonly}} used in cost-sensitive applications requiring large amounts of memory. Though SDRAM is inexpensive, the implementation of refresh operations, open row management, and various delays and command sequences requires logic. The Nios SDRAM Controller with an Avalon interface, transparently handles SDRAM initialization, refresh, and all other SDRAM requirements and appears to software as a simple linear memory interface (flat address space) with a wait signal. The SDRAM Controller supports standard SDRAM as described in PC 100. With the SDRAM Controller, users can access SDRAM subsystems with data widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 -bits, various memory sizes, and multiple <b>chip</b> <b>selects.</b> Users may also choose to share the tristate data and address buses with other tristate devices. This feature is valuable in systems which have multiple types of external memory devices, but limited I/O pins. The Avalon tristate interface is required to share pins. ...|$|R
