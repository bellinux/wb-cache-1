25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the aortic valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot <b>coapt.</b> Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve preventing proper valve closure.|$|E

A total of 121 patients underwent midface-lifting andmeloplication with the 82 / 18 L-lactide/glycolide device (<b>Coapt</b> Endotine Mid-face ST 4. 5; <b>Coapt</b> Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif) by both the senior (G. S. K.) and junior (R. N. H.) authors. The senior author’s experience included 110 patients over a 26 -month period. Thirty-two of these cases were isolated procedures. The other 78 were performed in conjunction with various procedures, most commonly rhytidectomy. There were no revisions during this period. Two cases of “puckering ” were noted. Both were immediately corrected, one with fat injection and one with poly-L-lactic acid injection (Sculptra; Dermik Aesthetics, distributed by Besse Medical Supply, West Chester, Ohio). The junior author’s experience included 11 cases over an 8 -month period. Two cases of asymmetry were noted. One was corrected with fat injection, and the other required revision.

Under the condition of pendulous lithotomy and suprapubic cystostomy, the urethral stricture was removed via a midline ventral penile incision followed by elevation of the flap and insertion of an 18 -Fr catheter. Subcutaneous buried interrupted sutures were used to reapproximate the waterproof tubularized neourethra and to <b>coapt</b> with the neourethra and each stump of the urethra, first proximally and then distally.

40|$|Background: Aesthetic {{surgeons}} {{have become}} increasingly aware that elevation of the midface is a significant component of facial rejuvenation. However, adequate fixation remains a problem in midface lift procedures, regardless of the approach. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy and ease of application of the Endotine midface device (<b>Coapt</b> Systems, Palo Alto, CA), as well as patient and surgeon satisfaction with the results of treatment. Methods: The Endotine device consists of a polylactide polymer that incorporates 5 tines, each 4. 5 mm long, to distribute ten-sion over a wide area, maximizing fixation strength and holding power. After the cheek tissue is engaged, upward tension is applied to the anchoring leash, which is then sutured to the deep temporal fascia. Between October 2003 and October 2004, 31 patients underwent Endotine fixation for midface lift. The patient group comprised 7 men and 24 women ranging in age from 40 to 65 years (mean age, 49. 25 years). Four patients had midface lifts as the sole procedure, and 27 had adjunctive facial cosmetic procedures. Results evaluated included ease of use/difficulty of insertion, postsurgical pain, adequacy and sta-bility of fixation, side effects and complications, and patient and surgeon satisfaction.

Mitral Valve Regurgitation (MR) {{is a disease}} in which the valve leaflets fail to fully <b>coapt</b> (close together) allowing blood to flow in the reverse direction. If left untreated, MR progression can lead to serious heart problems including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. A study of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database for the eight year period spanning 2000 - 2007 found that 47, 126 operations were performed for isolated MR alone [2] with an increase of the surgical valve repair rate (versus total valve replacement) from 51 % to 69 % {{in the same time}} interval [2][3]. The NeoChord DS 1000 is a novel surgical instrument that facilitates mitral valve repair for MR on a beating heart. As the demand for further instrumentation for beating heart mitral valve surgery grows, so too will the demand for mitral valve surgical training simulators. There exists an unmet need for such a simulator that incorporates the beating heart, anatomically correct heart anatomy and leaflet motion, physiologically correct flow rates, and the ability to interface with surgical devices. The objective of this thesis is to 1) describe the product development cycle for the DS 1000, a surgical instrument for Mitral Valve repair. A chapter is then provided for 2) adapting the device development cycle to a development cycle for a simulator.

40|$|Background—Using human MV models {{derived from}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) echocardiography, {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) was used to predict mechanical leaflet and chordal stress. Subsequently, valve geometries were altered {{to examine the effects}} on stresses of: (1) varying coaptation area, (2) varying non-coapted leaflet tissue area, and (3) varying interleaflet coefficient of friction (μ). Methods—Three human MV models were loaded with a transvalvular pressure of 80 mmHg using FEA. Initially leaflet coaptation was set to 10 %, 50 %, or 100 % of actual coaptation length to test the influence of coaptation length on stress distribution. Next, leaflet surface areas were augmented by 1 % overall and by 2 % in the noncoapted “belly ” region to test the influence of increased leaflet billowing without changing the gross geometry of the MV. Finally, the coefficient of friction between the <b>coapted</b> leaflets was set to μ = 0, 0. 05, or 0. 3, to assess the influence of friction on MV function.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} a new method of DIEP flap neurotization using a reliably located recipient nerve. We hypothesize that neurotization by this method (with either nerve conduit or direct nerve coaptation) will have a positive effect on sensory recovery. Methods: Fifty-seven deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps were performed on 35 patients. Neurotizations were performed to the third anterior intercostal nerve by directly <b>coapting</b> the flap donor nerve or <b>coapting</b> with a nerve conduit. Nine nonneurotized DIEP flaps served as controls and received no attempted neurotization. All patients were tested for breast sensibility in 9 areas of the flap skin-island and adjacent postmastectomy skin. Testing occurred at an average of 111 weeks (23 – 309) postoperatively. Results: At a mean of 111 weeks after breast reconstruction, neurotization of the DIEP flap resulted in recovery of sensibility that was statistically significantly better (lower threshold) in the flap skin (P < 0. 01) and statistically significantly better than in the native mastectomy skin into which the DIEP flap was inserted (P < 0. 01). Sensibility recovered in DIEP flaps neurotized using the nerve conduit was significantly better (lower threshold) than that in the corresponding areas of the DIEP flaps neurotized by direct coaptation (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: DIEP flap neurotization using the third anterior intercostal nerve is an effective technique to provide a significant increase in sensory recovery for breast reconstruction patients, while adding minimal surgical time.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of the chordae tendineae force distribution on systolic mitral leaflet geometry and mitral valve competence invitro. BACKGROUNDFunctional mitral regurgitation is caused by changes in several elements of the valve apparatus. Interaction among these have to comply with the chordal forcedistribution defined by the chordal <b>coapting</b> forces (FC) created by the transmitral pressure difference, which close the leaflets and the chordal tethering forces(FT) pulling the leaflets apart. METHODSPorcine mitral valves (n = 5) were mounted in a left ventricular model where leading edge chordal forces measured by dedicated miniature force transducers werecontrolled by changing left ventricular pressure and papillary muscle position. Chordae geometry and occlusional leaflet area (OLA) needed to cover the leaflet orifice for a givenleaflet configuration were determined by two-dimensional echo and reconstructed three-dimensionally. Occlusional leaflet area was used as expression for incomplete leafletcoaptation. Regurgitant fraction (RF) was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. RESULTSMixed procedure statistics revealed a linear correlation between the sum of the chordal net forces, ∑[FC−FT]s, and OLA with regression coefficient (minimum − maximum) beta = − 115 to − 65 [mm 2 /N]; p< 0. 001 and RF (beta = − 0. 06 to − 0. 01 [%/N]; p < 0. 001). Increasing FTby papillary muscle malalignment restrictedleaflet mobility, resulting in a tented leaflet configuration due to an apical and posterior shift of the coaptation line. Anterior leaflet <b>coapting</b> forces increased due to mitralleaflet remodeling, which generated a nonuniform regurgitant orifice area.

50|$|During a one-stage or {{two-stage}} CFNG procedure, {{one or more}} non-affected {{facial nerve}} branches are used for reinnervation of the paralysed side. In the one stage procedure a free muscle transplant with a latissimus dorsi graft or a nerve graft (using the sural nerve or saphenous nerve) can be used. The latissimus dorsi graft is used because of its long thoracodorsal nerve. Therefore, it can be <b>coapted</b> directly to the normal functioning facial nerve. The one stage CFNG, implies an end-to-side coaptation of the sural or saphenous nerve to the distal end of the affected facial nerve. In the two-stage procedure, an incision {{in front of the}} ear is made on the non-paralysed side. Upon electrical stimulation, the nerve which produces the best contraction of the zygomatic muscles (and so the appearance of a smile) is selected. This branch is then sectioned. The sural or saphenous nerve as cross facial nerve graft is <b>coapted</b> to this unaffected branch of the facial nerve and tunnelled across the face to the paralysed side through a subcutaneous tunnel. The end of the graft is positioned in front of the tragus (cartilage in front of the ear) on the paralysed side. Nine to twelve months is needed for axonal regeneration in the cross facial nerve graft, because the result of damaged nerve tissue is loss of structure and axonal function. Degeneration appears distally in the paralysed facial nerve but this takes time, this process is called Wallerian degeneration. During the second stage end-to-side or end-to-end nerve coaptation to the proximal end of the paralysed facial nerve is performed with a microscope. And a free muscle transplant is placed, if indicated.|$|R

In this study, the ultrastructural analysis of the lymphoid cells forming a follicular accumulation in the portal tracts, and of {{a relationship between the}} mesenchymal cells and hepatocytes at the destructed limiting plate was attempted. Ultrathin sections of the liver biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with follicular hepatitis were cut immediately adjacent to a semithin section which was stained with toluidin blue and in which the follicular accumulation of lymphoid cells and a destructed limiting plate were observed through a light microscope. The center of the follicules consisted of immunoblasts and reticulum cells of both the nonphagocytic branching and phagocytic varieties. Lymphoblasts, immature and numerous mature lymphocytes, plasma cells and a small number of macrophages were observed surrounding the center. The mitotic figure of these mesenchymal cells was found to be on the increase. Macrophages were also found in the area where the liver cells and the portal tracts adjoined. No hepatocellular degeneration was observed at the sharp border between parenchyma and portal tracts. In the area showing the destructed limiting plate, lymphocytes and, occasionally, plasma cells were adjacent to hepatocytes and/or ductular cells. These mesenchymal cells, especially the lymphocytes, indented the hepatocytes and, sometimes, their plasma menbranes were <b>coapted.</b> The hepatocytes lacked microvilli at the area of coaptation, and the degeneration of their cell organelles that was a marked vesiculation and vacuolization of endoplasmic reticulum accompanying a loss of ribosomes, was observed near the coaptation. In the ductular cells <b>coapted</b> with lymphocytes, similar degeneration of the cell organelles was observed and basement membranes disappeared.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{sequence of}} axon-Schwann cell interaction during regeneration is examined in cat tibia 1 nerves surgically denervated for 8 weeks and, subsequently, <b>coapted</b> to a freshly severed peroneal nerve for 3 weeks. Prior to association with regenerating axons, Schwann cells resident in denervated and reinnervated stumps failed to synthesize proteins co-migrant with PO, PI, and Pz myelin proteins {{in contrast to}} normal nerves. Axonal association with Schwann cells stimulated synthesis of amino acid-labeled proteins co-migrating with myelin-specific proteins prior to elaboration of myelin lamellae. Radioactivity from these peaks was precipitated by antibodies raised against myelin-specific proteins. The synthesis of P 1 and PZ proteins was evident before PO synthesis in reinnervated stumps. Immunocytochemical staining with antibody to PO, PI, Pz, and myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG) appeared only after myelin lamellae had been formed. These data suggest that Schwann cells: (a) synthesize proteins co-migrant with PI, Pz, PO, and MAG in normal cat nerves; (b) cease detectable manufacture of these proteins after axonal loss; (c) regain their capacity to synthesize these proteins upon re-establishment of axonal association; and (d) during regeneration, express the synthesis of P 1 and Pa before that of PO...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} optimum {{mechanical properties}} in glutaraldehyde-treated heart-valve tissue the full collagen crimp geometry originally {{present in the}} relaxed fresh tissue should be retained. By varying the pressure at which glutaraldehyde fixation is carried out, considerable alterations to this crimp geometry can be achieved. The mechanical stiffness of the preserved tissue is consequently affected, and this in turn has a striking influence on both the opening behaviour of the valve {{and the degree of}} strain localisation in the leaflet tissue. A pressure of 100 mmHg eliminated the collagen crimp geometry entirely, and this resulted in the formation of sites of local strain or kinks in the valve leaflets during opening. It is expected that this strain localisation phenomenon will influence the long-term fatigue durability of the treated tissue. Pressures even as low as 4 mmHg result in significant reductions of crimp geometry. Fresh valves should therefore be fixed under a positive head of pressure sufficient only to ensure that the leaflets seal along their <b>coapting</b> free margins. A pressure of less than 1 mmHg was sufficient to achieve this. Leaflets of the commercially available Hancock valve show features similar to valves fixed in glutaraldehyde at about 100 mmHg pressure...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{capacity}} of Schwann cells to support peripheral nerve regeneration, functional recovery after nerve injuries is frequently poor, especially for proximal injuries that require regenerating axons to grow over long distances to reinnervate distal targets. Nerve transfers, where small fascicles from an adjacent intact nerve are <b>coapted</b> to the nerve stump of a nearby denervated muscle, allow for functional return but {{at the expense of}} reduced numbers of innervating nerves. A 1 -hour period of 20 Hz electrical nerve stimulation via electrodes proximal to an injury site accelerates axon outgrowth to hasten target reinnervation in rats and humans, even after delayed surgery. A novel strategy of enticing donor axons from an otherwise intact nerve to grow through small nerve grafts (cross-bridges) into a denervated nerve stump, promotes improved axon regeneration after delayed nerve repair. The efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in a rat model and is now in clinical use in patients undergoing cross-face nerve grafting for facial paralysis. In conclusion, brief electrical stimulation, combined with the surgical technique of promoting the regeneration of some donor axons to ′protect′ chronically denervated Schwann cells, improves nerve regeneration and, in turn, functional outcomes in the management of peripheral nerve injuries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVETo {{determine}} {{predictors of}} systolic anterior motion and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (SAM/LVOTO) after mitral valve repair (MVRep) {{in patients with}} myxomatous mitral valve disease. BACKGROUNDMechanisms {{for the development of}} SAM/LVOTO after MVRep have been described; however, predictors of this complication have not been explored. We hypothesize that pre-MVRep transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can predict postrepair SAM/LVOTO. METHODSUsing TEE, the lengths of the <b>coapted</b> anterior (AL) and posterior (PL) leaflets and the distance from the coaptation point to the septum (C-Sept) were measured before and after MVRep in 33 patients, including 11 who developed SAM/LVOTO (Group 1) and 22 who did not (Group 2). RESULTSGroup 1 patients had smaller AL/PL ratios (0. 99 vs. 1. 95, p < 0. 0001) and C-Sept distances (2. 53 vs. 3. 01 cm, p = 0. 012) prior to MVRep than those in Group 2. Resolution of SAM/LVOTO was associated with increases in AL/PL ratio and C-Sept distance. This reflects a more anterior position of the coaptation point in those who developed SAM/LVOTO. CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that TEE analysis of the mitral apparatus can identify patients likely to develop SAM/LVOTO after MVRep for myxomatous valve disease. The findings are consistent with the concept that SAM of mitral leaflets is due to anterior malposition of slack mitral leaflet portions into the LVOT. The position of the coaptation point of the mitral leaflets is dynamic and a potential target and end point for surgical designs to prevent SAM/LVOTO post MVRep...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMyxomatous {{mitral valve}} {{insufficiency}} is traditionally repaired by posterior leaflet quadrangular resection and reconstruction. A simplified repair technique without leaflet resection is described, and our initial experience is reviewed. MethodsThirty-nine consecutive patients with significant mitral regurgitation underwent repair since January 2000 by placement of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures between the leading (<b>coapting)</b> {{edge of the}} posterior leaflet and the corresponding papillary muscle. An annuloplasty ring was placed, and no leaflet tissue was resected. Patient medical records were obtained and retrospectively reviewed. ResultsTwenty-five men and 14 women (median age, 61 years; range, 40 - 88 years) had their mitral valve repaired {{by a variety of}} surgical approaches, including robotic (18 patients), right thoracotomy (6 patients), and sternal (15 patients). Three patients have required valve replacement: 1 at the initial operation, 1 because of dehiscence of the annuloplasty ring, and 1 after subsequent rupture of a previously normal native chorda. At follow-up (median, 12 months), 92 % (33 / 36) of the remaining patients had an intact mitral repair with no to mild regurgitation, 8. 3 % (3 / 36) of patients had moderate regurgitation, and 92 % of all patients (36 / 39) were in New York Heart Association class I. There were no deaths. ConclusionsMyxomatous mitral regurgitation due to posterior leaflet insufficiency can be repaired without leaflet resection by placement of neochordae. This repair technique is effective and is readily accomplished by traditional and minimally invasive surgical approaches...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Intra-articular {{fractures}} {{were created}} in the distal end of the femur in adult rabbits. Frac-tures were then reduced in three different fashions: in-complete reduction, adequate reduction without corn-pression of the fragments, and ideal reduction, which consisted of reduction with strong compression of the fracture fragments. Animals were killed at intervals ranging from seven weeks to one year, and the cartilage fractures were studied by light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy, using proteoglycan stains. Cartilage fractures that were inadequately re-duced or were adequately reduced without compres-sion healed by fibrocartilage only. Fractures that were reduced with compression across the fragments healed with a tissue which, by light and electron microscopy, appeared to be hyaline cartilage, which showed the col-lagen and proteoglycan orientation and relationships of normal hyaline cartilage. The healing of these defects {{appears to be the}} result of a proliferation of cells emanating from the region of the tidemark, and perhaps of migration of chondrocytes from the surface into the lesion, We postulate that compression of the cartilage surfaces either creates a physical environment that allows certain chondrocytes to heal the defect with hyaline cartilage, or, by <b>coapting</b> the surfaces, pre-vents ingrowth of granulation tissue from the sub-chondral bone that might interfere with repair by hyaline cartilage. This study suggests a hitherto unappreciated capacity for hyaline cartilage to repair structural de-fects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Accurate reduction of intra-articular fractures with interfragmentary compression may create the environment whereby cartilage cell...|$|R

After the foot is manipulated, a long leg cast is applied to hold the correction. Initially, the short leg component is applied. The cast should be snug with minimal but adequate padding. The authors paint or spray the limb with tincture of benzoin to allow adherence of the padding to the limb. The authors prefer to apply additional padding strips along the medial and lateral borders to facilitate safe removal of the cast with a cast saw. The cast must incorporate the toes right up to the tips but not squeeze the toes or obliterate the transverse arch. The cast is molded to contour around the heel while abducting the forefoot against counter pressure on the lateral aspect of the head of the talus. The knee is flexed to 90° for the long leg component of the cast. The parents can soak these casts for 30-45 minutes prior to removal with a plaster knife. The authors' preferred method is to use the oscillating plaster saw for cast removal. The cast is bivalved and removed. The cast then is reconstituted by <b>coapting</b> the two halves. This allows for monitoring of the progress of the forefoot abduction and, in the later stages, the amount of dorsiflexion or equinus correction.|$|R
40|$|Mitraclip® {{implantation}} {{is widely}} used as a valid alternative to conventional open-chest surgery in high-risk patients with severe mitral valve (MV) regurgitation. Although effective in reducing mitral regurgitation (MR) {{in the majority of}} cases, the clip implantation produces a double-orifice area that can result in altered MV biomechanics, particularly in term of hemodynamics and mechanical stress distribution on the leaflets. In this scenario, we combined the consistency of in vitro experimental platforms with the versatility of numerical simulations to investigate clip impact on MV functioning. The fluid dynamic determinants of the procedure were experimentally investigated under different working conditions (from 40  bpm to 100  bpm of simulated heart rate) on six swine hearts; subsequently, fluid dynamic data served as realistic boundary conditions in a computational framework able to quantitatively assess the post-procedural MV biomechanics. The finite element model of a human mitral valve featuring an isolated posterior leaflet prolapse was reconstructed from cardiac magnetic resonance. A complete as well as a marginal, sub-optimal grasping of the leaflets were finally simulated. The clipping procedure resulted in a properly <b>coapting</b> valve from the geometrical perspective in all the simulated configurations. Symmetrical complete grasping resulted in symmetrical distribution of the mechanical stress, while uncomplete asymmetrical grasping resulted in higher stress distribution, particularly on the prolapsing leaflet. This work pinpointed that the mechanical stress distribution following the clipping procedure is dependent on the cardiac hemodynamics and has a correlation with the proper execution of the grasping procedure, requiring accurate evaluation prior to clip delivery...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with supraclavicular injuries of the brachial plexus, the suprascapular nerve (SSN) is frequently reconstructed with a sural nerve graft <b>coapted</b> to C 5. As the C 5 cross-sectional diameter exceeds the graft diameter, inadequate {{positioning of the}} graft is possible. OBJECTIVE: To identify a specific area within the C 5 proximal stump that contains the SSN axons and to determine how this area could be localized by the nerve surgeon, we conducted a microanatomic study of the intraplexal topography of the SSN. METHODS: The right-sided C 5 and C 6 roots, the upper trunk with its divisions, and the SSN of 20 adult nonfixed cadavers were removed and fixed. The position and area occupied by the SSN fibers inside C 5 were assessed and registered under magnification. RESULTS: The SSN was monofascicular in all specimens and derived its fibers mainly from C 5. Small contributions from C 6 were found in 12 specimens (60 %). The mean transverse area of C 5 occupied by SSN fibers was 28. 23 %. In 16 specimens (80 %), the SSN fibers were localized in the ventral (mainly the rostroventral) quadrants of C 5, a cross-sectional area between 9 o`clock and 3 o`clock from the surgeon`s intraoperative perspective. CONCLUSION: In reconstruction of the SSN with a sural nerve graft, coaptation should be performed in the rostroventral quadrant of C 5 cross-sectional area (between 9 and 12 o`clock from the nerve surgeon`s {{point of view in}} a right-sided brachial plexus exploration). This will minimize axonal misrouting and may improve outcome...|$|R
40|$|There are {{currently}} no available options to promote nerve regeneration through chronically denervated distal nerve stumps. Here {{we used a}} rat model of delayed nerve repair asking of prior insertion of side-to-side cross-bridges between a donor tibial (TIB) nerve and a recipient denervated common peroneal (CP) nerve stump ameliorates poor nerve regeneration. First, numbers of retrogradely-labelled TIB neurons that grew axons into the nerve stump within three months, increased {{with the size of}} the perineurial windows opened in the TIB and CP nerves. Equal numbers of donor TIB axons regenerated into CP stumps either side of the cross-bridges, not being affected by target neurotrophic effects, or by removing the perineurium to insert 5 - 9 cross-bridges. Second, CP nerve stumps were <b>coapted</b> three months after inserting 0 - 9 cross-bridges and the number of 1) CP neurons that regenerated their axons within three months or 2) CP motor nerves that reinnervated the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle within five months was determined by counting and motor unit number estimation (MUNE), respectively. We found that three but not more cross-bridges promoted the regeneration of axons and reinnervation of EDL muscle by all the CP motoneurons as compared to only 33 % regenerating their axons when no cross-bridges were inserted. The same 3 -fold increase in sensory nerve regeneration was found. In conclusion, side-to-side cross-bridges ameliorate poor regeneration after delayed nerve repair possibly by sustaining the growth-permissive state of denervated nerve stumps. Such autografts may be used in human repair surgery to improve outcomes after unavoidable delays...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ipsilateral C 7 nerve {{transfer}} is an available procedure in C 5 C 6 2 -root avulsion injury of the brachial plexus. However, concomitant injury of a normal-looking C 7 cannot be ruled out. The efficiency of a concomitant injury of C 7 transfer was investigated. Methods: Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats {{were randomly assigned}} to 5 groups. They all underwent a 2 -stage procedure. In the first stage from dorsal spine approach, left C 5 and C 6 roots were avulsed and C 7 was crushed with jeweler’s forceps with different degrees: group A (n = 6), C 7 not injured; group B (n = 10), C 7 crushed for 10 seconds; group C (n = 10), C 7 crushed for 30 seconds; group D (n = 10), C 7 doubly crushed for 60 seconds; and group E (n = 6), C 7 transected and not repaired. Four weeks later in the second stage, the C 7 was reexplored via volar approach, transected, and <b>coapted</b> to the musculocutaneous nerve. At 12 weeks following the nerve transfer, functional outcomes were assessed. Results: Grooming test, muscle weight, electromyography, and muscle tetanic contraction force all showed that the biceps muscles were significantly worse in group C (moderate crush) and group D (severe crush). Group B (mild crush) and group A (uninjured) showed no difference. Group E (C 7 cut and not repaired) was the worst. Conclusions: An injured but grossly normal-looking ipsilateral C 7 {{can be used as a}} motor source but with variable results. The result is directly proportional to the severity of injury, potentially implying that better results will be achieved when longer regeneration time is allowed...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of {{a sufficient number of}} nerve fibers at a proximal coaptation site is indisputable for the successful repair of nerves; however, the quality of nerve fibers required at this site has yet to be defined. The present study deals with the question of whether it is necessary to trim nerves back to unaffected neuronal tissue or whether the coaptation on recently regenerated nerve fibers, commonly believed to produce a poor quality of repair can, in fact, produce adequate nerve regeneration. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits received a standardized crush lesion on the peroneal nerves of both hind legs. Four weeks later, the nerves of the left hind legs (n = 20) were transected 10 mm distal to the previous crush lesion and <b>coapted</b> to the freshly regenerated nerve fibers. For comparison, on 10 right hind legs, the nerves were transected at the site of previous crushing (Group A, superimposition) or 10 mm proximal to the site of crushing on unscathed nerve fibers (Group B). Eleven weeks later, the quality of nerve regeneration was assessed by the toe-spreading reflex, electrophysiologic data, muscle weight, and histomorphologic evaluation. In the animals of Group A, the quality of nerve regeneration following coaptation on the regrown axons did not differ in any of the examined parameters from the quality of nerve fibers outgrown from the site of the superimposed lesion. Both lesions led to a completely functional reinnervation. Also in Group B, nerve action potential recording and histologic data on both sides did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} number and maturation of nerve fibers equidistant from the suture site, shortly before muscle entrance. With this coaptation model, it could be demonstrated in the peroneal nerve of rabbits, that coaptation to recently regenerated nerve fibers leads to a significant functional regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Objective The low welding {{strength}} of laser-assisted vascular anastomosis (LAVA) has hampered the clinical application of LAVA {{as an alternative}} to suture anastomosis. To improve welding strength, LAVA in combination with solder and polymeric scaffolds (ssLAVA) has been optimized in vitro. Currently, ssLAVA requires proof-of-concept in a physiologically representative ex vivo model before advancing to in vivo studies. This study therefore investigated the feasibility of ex vivo ssLAVA in medium-sized porcine arteries. Methods Scaffolds composed of poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were impregnated with semisolid solder and placed over <b>coapted</b> aortic segments. ssLAVA was performed with a 670 -nm diode laser. In the first substudy, the optimum number of laser spots was determined by bursting pressure analysis. The second substudy investigated the resilience of the welds in a Langendorf-type pulsatile pressure setup, monitoring the number of failed vessels. The type of failure (cohesive vs adhesive) was confirmed by electron microscopy, and thermal damage was assessed histologically. The third substudy compared breaking {{strength of}} aortic repairs made with PLGA and semisolid genipin solder (ssLAVR) to repairs made with BioGlue. Results ssLAVA with 11 lasing spots and PLGA scaffold yielded the highest bursting pressure (923 ± 56 mm Hg vs 703 ± 96 mm Hg with PCL ssLAVA; P =. 0002) and exhibited the fewest failures (20 % vs 70 % for PCL ssLAVA; P =. 0218). The two failed PLGA ssLAVA arteries leaked at 19 and 22 hours, whereas the seven failed PCL ssLAVA arteries burst between 12 and 23 hours. PLGA anastomoses broke adhesively, whereas PCL welds failed cohesively. Both modalities exhibited full-thickness thermal damage. Repairs with PLGA scaffold yielded higher breaking strength than BioGlue repairs (323 ± 28 N/cm 2 vs 25 ± 4 N/cm 2, respectively; P =. 0003). Conclusions PLGA ssLAVA yields greater anastomotic strength and fewer anastomotic failures than PCL ssLAVA. Aortic repairs with BioGlue were inferior to those produced with PLGA ssLAVR. The results demonstrate the feasibility of ssLAVA/R as an alternative method to suture anastomosis or tissue sealant. Further studies should focus on reducing thermal damage...|$|R
