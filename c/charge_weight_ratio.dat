40|$|The {{kinetics}} of composite particle formation during attritor milling of insoluble binary elemental powders {{have been}} examined. The {{effects of processing}} conditions (i. e., mill power, temperature, and charge ratio) on these kinetics were studied. Particle size distributions and fractions of elemental and composite particles were determined as functions of milling time and processing conditions. This allowed the deduction of phenomenological rate constants describing the propensity for fracture and welding during processing. For the mill-operating conditions investigated, the number of particles in the mill generally decreased with milling time, indicating a greater tendency for particle welding than fracture. Moreover, a bimodal size distribution is often obtained {{as a result of}} preferential welding. Copper and chromium 'alloy' primarily by encapsulation of Cr particles within Cu. This form of alloying also occurs in Cu-Nb alloys processed at low mill power and/or for short milling times. For other conditions, however, Cu-Nb alloys develop a lamellar morphology characteristic of mechanically alloyed two-phase ductile metals.

The Rietveld refinement technique was successfully applied for structural characterization of the cell materials as function of fatigue introduced. The capacity loss determined from the electrochemical investigation has been found proportional {{to the number of}} cycles, which the cell underwent, and was 21. 9 % and 12. 8 % for the cell cycled for 1000 times at 25 ◦C and 50 ◦C, respectively. This capacity fade has a close correlation to the structural changes in cathode and anode materials with the cell fatigue. A change of the lithium occupation and lattice parameters of the LixCoO 2 were observed with proceeding battery fatigue. Transformation of the graphitic anode into LiC 6 and LiC 12 was identified after the batteries were fully <b>charged.</b> Their <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> was found to be dependent on the number of executed cycles.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have explored the way younger people perceive <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> {{using a variety}} of methodologies; however, very few {{researchers have}} used a more direct ratio estimation procedure, in which participants estimate an actual ratio between two or more weights. Of the few researchers who have used a direct method, the participants who were recruited were invariably younger adults. To date, there has been no research performed to examine how older adults perceive weight-ratios, using direct estimation or any other technique. Past research has provided evidence that older adults have more difficulty than younger adults in perceiving small differences in weight (i. e., the difference threshold for older adults is higher than that of younger adults). Given this result, one might expect that older adults would demonstrate similar impairments in <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> estimation compared to younger adults. The current experiment compared the abilities of 17 younger and 17 older adults to estimate <b>weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> using a direct ratio estimation procedure.

Methods We set up a controlled-experiment with two factors: nitrogen (control and addition of 10 g·m– 2 ·a– 1 NH 4 NO 3) and precipitation (natural precipitation as control and reduction of 30 %). We collected seeds of five tree species of Gutian Mountain in the fall of 2006, sowed them in the spring of 2007 and grew the tree seedlings under the treatments. We periodically investigated traits of growth, biomass and allocation for three years. Important findings Nitrogen significantly promoted growth in height, stem basal diameter and biomass of Elaeocarpus glabripetalus, Liquidambar formosana and Schima superba, but only increased branch and leaf biomass of Pinus massoniana and branch biomass of Cyclobalanopsis glauca.
