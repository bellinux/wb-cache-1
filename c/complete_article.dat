40|$|ABSTRACTIntroduction:The medical congresses are an {{efficient}} way, although restricted, {{to expose the}} scientific production of a particular specialty. However, the number of <b>complete</b> <b>articles</b> published resulting from papers presented at congresses and published as abstracts is {{much lower than the}} number of papers presented during the meetings.

An observational retrospective study was conducted consulting the following biomedical databases: Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo) and US National Library of Medicine on the National Institutes of Health (PubMed), {{with the help of the}} Google search engine, based on the article title and the list of authors. Results:From 701 studies analyzed, 635 (90. 6 %) were from Brazilian institutions, 60 (8. 6 %) from foreign institutions, and six (0. 8 %) did not identified their home institutions. There were found 63 (8. 8 %) <b>complete</b> <b>articles</b> published and indexed to consulted databases. International journals were the destination of 38 (60. 3 %) publications.
