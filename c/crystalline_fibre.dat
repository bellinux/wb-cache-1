Polyethylene fibres with strengths up to 7. 2 GPa can be produced in a gel-spinning and hot-drawing procedure. In this procedure the polyethylene is dissolved in paraffin oil, {{in order to reduce the}} number of intermolecular entanglements which is necessary in order to obtain high draw ratios and tensile properties, and subsequently a fibre is spun from this solution, which is extracted and hot-drawn. The hot-drawing process, in which the molecules are aligned in the fibre direction, however, is a time consuming procedure, and the question arose whether it would be possible to apply the recently developed high-speed spinning technique on the elastic polyethylene solutions. In this process the spinline is stretched to very high ratios and at very high rates, and a fully oriented and <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibre</b> is obtained in a one step procedure.

The recent confirmation of this for hermatypic corals has raised concern over the future of coral reefs because [CO 3] is a decreasing function of increasing pCO 2 in the atmosphere. As one of the overriding features of coral reefs is their diversity, understanding the degree of variability between species in their ability to cope with a change in [CO 3] is a priority. We cultured four phylogenetically and physiologically different species of hermatypic coral (Acropora verweyi, Galaxea fascicularis, Pavona cactus and Turbinaria reniformis) under 'normal' (280 µmol/kg) and 'low' (140 µmol/kg) carbonate-ion concentrations. The effect on skeletogenesis was investigated quantitatively (by calcification rate) and qualitatively (by microstructural appearance of growing <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibres</b> using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)). The 'low carbonate' treatment resulted in a significant suppression of calcification rate and a tendency for weaker crystallization at the distal tips of fibres. However, while the calcification rate was affected uniformly across species (13 - 18 % reduction), the magnitude of the microstructural response was highly species specific: crystallization was most markedly affected in A. verweyi and least in T. reniformis.

The surface energy of all silk materials is mostly determined by long range dispersive interactions such as van der Waals forces. The surface energy increases and surface energy heterogeneity widens after milling. All samples have amphoteric surfaces and the concentration of acidic groups increases after milling while the surfaces remain predominantly basic. We also examined powder compression and flow behaviours using a rheometer. Increase in surface energy, surface area, and static charges in sub-micron air jet milled particles contributed to their aggregation and therefore improved flowability. However they collapse under large pressures and form highly cohesive powder. Alkaline hydrolysis resulted in more <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibres</b> which on milling produced particles with higher density, lower surface energy and improved flowability.

40|$|When a {{polymeric}} biomaterial {{is employed}} within a living system an interface is created between the solid {{surface of the}} polymer and an aqueous environment. The processes that occur at this interface will determine if the biomaterial is accepted by the patient and often will determine if the specific function of the biomaterial can be achieved. Increasingly, novel biomaterials are expected to perform more sophisticated functions and, therefore, their surfaces must be designed to realize precise interfacial events, such as specific interactions with proteins and cells or controlled biodegradation. To design polymeric biomaterials with specific surface properties {{it is necessary to}} develop surface analytical techniques that can accurately characterize these properties. The work described in this thesis has aimed to investigate the potential contribution of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to this characterization. The advantages of utilizing AFM in the study of polymeric biomaterials lie in the ability of the instrument to visualize insulating surfaces at a high resolution within a variety of environments, including gaseous and liquid environments. Therefore, it is possible to image the nanoscopic organization of polymeric biomaterials within environmental conditions that are similar to the conditions encountered within living systems. Initial studies have concentrated on imaging the surface morphology of poly(ethylane oxide) (PEG) samples in air. These studies highlighted the high resolution capability of the AFM on untreated polymer samples. On sphemlitic samples, the AFM has visualized the lamellar organization of <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibres.</b> These lamellae had widths of between 10 and 30 nm and height variations of less than 15 nm. The ability of the AFM to resolve such structures, without the introduction of an etching or staining procedure required by transmission electron microscopy, relies on the sensitivity of the instrument to changes in the height of the topography. This sensitivity has been further utilized to image polymer strands with recorded widths of 8 nm. This width represents an overestimation of the true dimensions of the strand due to the finite size of the AFM probe apex and using the circular probe model it has been calculated that the strands have true widths of less than 0. 8 nm, indicating that they are composed of one or two PEG molecules. Further studies on PEG have demonstrated the ability to control polymer surface morphology through changes in the temperature of thin film preparation and changes in the method of polymer solution deposition. The work on PEG surface morphology acts as the foundation for the remaining studies, which employ the AFM to study biodegradable polymers within aqueous environments. This in situ application of the AFM has recorded the changes in surface morphology that occur to poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) during surface erosion in alkaline conditions. These studies have visualized the preferential degradation of amorphous regions of sphemlites over the <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibres</b> for solution cast and melt-crystallized samples. It has been found that rapid cooling during the solidification of PSA increases the amount of amorphous material at the surface of samples. However, once this outer layer has been eroded the underlying material is dominated by <b>crystalline</b> <b>fibres.</b> In situ AFM studies have also demonstrated the pH dependence of the rate of PSA surface erosion. The AFM techniques developed to visualize the evolution of surface changes during PSA erosion have then been employed to investigate the degradation of immiscible blends of PSA and the polyester poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA). PLA degrades at a slower rate than PSA and therefore, as these blends eroded the surface morphology became dominated by PLA, revealing the phase separation of the material. For solution cast samples on mica substrates it was found that at high PSA content the PSA formed a continuous network around islands of PLA. However, as the relative content of PLA increased the morphology reversed and the PLA formed the network around islands of PSA. The interest in studying biodegradable polymers is derived from their application in surface eroding drug delivery systems. Having demonstrated the potential of the AFM to visualize dynamic interfacial changes occurring to these polymeric biomaterials, the in situ studies were extended to investigate the release of a model protein drug from a degrading polymer film. The system under investigation was a poly(ortho ester) film containing particles of bovine serum albumin. The AFM visualized the initiation of dissolution of some protein particles within minutes of the exposure of the sample to a pH 6 environment. Other particles, however, displayed retarded dissolution behaviour and did not appear to dissolve until the sample had been exposed to the pH 6 environment for over 1 hour. To assist the interpretation of these studies computational methods of calculating changes in volume during polymer degradation and protein dissolution have been developed on the Genesis II system. In the final experiments of this thesis, the application of a novel combined atomic force microscopy/surface plasmon resonance instrument is described. This instrument allows the simultaneous acquisition of topographical data by the AFM and kinetic data by the surface plasmon resonance instrument (SPR). The instrument is first applied to a simple poly(ortho ester) system to demonstrate that the changes surface morphology and polymer film thickness can be simultaneously monitored. Then, the PSA/PLA blends were re-analysed. This analysis highlighted the synergistic information obtained by the combined AFM/SPR and revealed new data on the relationship between polymer phase separation and biodegradation kinetics. NB.

Fibre crops like hemp (Cannabis sativa), flax (Linum usitatissimum), ramie (Boehmeria nivea), jute (Corchorus olitorius, C. capsularis), kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) are therefore important natural resources which can help develop a sustainable economy. Despite the importance of bast fibres, not all the features related to their initiation and growth are fully explored and understood. In this review we {{will focus on the}} current knowledge concerning bast fibre initiation and development by using a transcriptomic angle, {{in the light of the}} great advances that Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has fostered in the last years. We discuss the results obtained recently on different fibre crops and we conclude our survey with a perspective on future molecular studies aimed at valorising neglected fibre crops, e. g. nettle (Urtica dioica) ...|$|R
40|$|Hollow fibers {{formed from}} water glass and metal salts of IIA(Ca), VIIB(Fe, Co, Ni) and IB(Cu) groups were characterised in this study. Fragile fibres {{obtained}} herein broke down {{into small pieces}} during isolation and drying. Quantitative information about morphology, chemical composition and surface structure of the fibres were obtained. The diameter and wall thickness of the fibers were around 50 μ and 3 μ. respectively. They had particulate inner and smooth outer surfaces. Fibers had variable composition with metal (II) oxide/SiO 2 ratio in the range 0. 31 to 1. 02. While group VIIB metal (II) fibres were amorphous, group IIA and IB metal (II) fibers were partially <b>crystalline</b> All the <b>fibres</b> had pores both in micro pore and meso pore region. The B. E. T. surface area fron N 2 adsorption data was {{in the range of}} 10 - 249 m 3 g- 1 and 8 - 176 m 2 g- 1 from Langmuir an B. E. T. models respectively...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{has been}} induced in rodents by the inhalation, {{instillation}} or implantation of solid materials, including mineral <b>fibres,</b> <b>crystalline</b> silica and other poorly-soluble particulates. In this section, hypotheses {{that seek to}} explain the mechanisms of cancer induction by these substances are reviewed {{with the objective of}} identifying whether they provide any insight to mechanisms that might be involved in the induction of cancer by other types of solid, implanted materials. Asbestos fibres Naturally occurring asbestos fibres, talc containing asbestiform fibres and nonasbestiform fibres (erionite) have been classified as carcinogenic to humans (IARC, 1977, 1987 a,d). Inhalation of these fibrous minerals causes scarring and cancer of the lungs and pleura (reviewed in Kane, 1996 a). The histopathology and pathogenesis of these fibrotic and carcinogenic processes in the lungs and mesothelium are somewhat different. Inhalation of asbestos and erionite fibres at high doses causes diffuse interstitial fibrosis or asbestosis that is usually more prominent in the lower lobes of the lungs. This fibrotic reaction develops slowly but progressively, beginning 10 years afte...|$|R
40|$|The {{teeth of}} sea urchins {{comprise}} {{a variety of}} different structural entities, all of which are composed of magnesium-bearing calcite together {{with a small amount of}} organic material. The teeth are worn down continuously, but in such a way that they remain sharp and functional. Here we describe aspects of the structural, compositional and micromechanical properties of the teeth of Paracentrotus lividus using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectrometry, atomic absorption. X-ray diffraction and microindentation. The S-shaped single <b>crystalline</b> calcitic <b>fibres</b> are one of the main structural elements of the tooth. They extend from the stone part to the keel. The diameter of the fibres increases gradually from less than 1 micron at the stone tip to about 20 microns at the keel end, while their MgCO 3 contents decrease from about 13 mol% to about 4. 5 mol%. Each fibre is coated by a thin organic sheath and surrounded by polycrystalline calcitic discs containing as much as 35 mol% MgCO 3. This structure constitutes a unique kind of gradient fibre-reinforced ceramic matrix composite, whose microhardness and toughness decrease gradually from the stone part to the keel. Primary plates are also important structural elements of the tooth. Each primary plate has a very unusual sandwich-like structure with a calcitic envelope surrounding a thin apparently amorphous CaCO 3 layer. This central layer, together with the primary plate/disc interface, improves the toughness of this zone by stopping and blunting cracks. The self-sharpening function of the teeth is believed to result from the combination of the geometrical shape of the main structural elements and their spatial arrangement, the interfacial strength between structural elements, and the hardness gradient extending from the working stone part to the surrounding zones. The sea urchin tooth structure possesses an array of interesting functional design features, some of which may possibly be applicable to materials science...|$|R
40|$|Many {{natural and}} {{synthetic}} fluids are viscoelastic materials, {{in the sense}} that the stress endured by a macroscopic fluid element depends upon the history of the deformation experienced by that element. Notable examples include polymer solutions and melts, liquid <b>crystalline</b> polymers, and <b>fibre</b> suspensions. The remarkable rheological properties of viscoelastic liquids cannot be described by the Navier-Stokes equations, but rather are governed by the flow-induced evolution of molecular configurations [1]. Models of kinetic theory provide a coarse-grained description of molecular configurations wherein atomistic processes are ignored altogether [2]. They are meant to display in a more or less accurate fashion the important features that govern the flow-induced evolution of configurations. In recent years, kinetic theory of entangled systems, such as concentrated polymer solutions and polymer melts, has known major developments that go well beyond the classical reptation tube model developed by Edwards, de Gennes, and Doi [3]. In addition to reptation, other physical mechanisms such as convective constraint release, contour length fluctuations, and tube stretch, have been shown to play an important role. The most recent tube models take account of these effects and correct many of the deficiencies of the basic theory (for a review, see [4]) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{hybrid of}} liquid <b>crystalline</b> polymer (LCP) <b>fibres</b> and glass fibres (GF) provide a {{combination}} of modulus and toughness to semi-crystalline linear-low-density-polyethylene (LLDPE). LCP and GF fibres reinforced composites were studied using two-body abrasion tesr under different applied loads. Two sets of fibre reinforced LLDPE, 10 and 20 vol%, were investigated. The contents of LCP and glass fibres were varied as 25, 50, 75 and 100 vol % of overall volume of fibres in LLDPE. The effect of replacing glass fibre with LCP fibre on wear is reported. Wear loss increased with the applied loads and glass fibre contents in LLDPE. The replacements of glass fibres with LCP fibres improved abrasive wear resistance of composite. The composite containing 20 vol % of glass fibres in LLDPE showed the specific wear rate nearly double to that of LCP fibre reinforced LLDPE. Incorporation of LCP fibre improved wear resistance of glass fibre reinforc d LLDPE. Worn surfaces were studied using SEM. Glass fibres were broken in small debris and removed easily whereas LCP fibres yielded to fibrillation during abrasive action. The overall wear rate was governed by the composi-tion and test conditions...|$|R
