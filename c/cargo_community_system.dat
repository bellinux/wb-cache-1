40|$|Electronic {{linkages}} between organisations enabled by interorganisational information systems (IOS) such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Internet- based applications or <b>cargo</b> <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Recently, many {{studies have examined the}} impact of electronic integration in logistics chains. However, {{there is a need to}} examine which factors on the perceived level of an interorganisational partnership are important for the management of information systems. We extend further the information processing model based on Galbraith [1] and Bensaou and Venkatraman [2] in a logistics network context. Their theoretical concept gives some explanations about a fit between information processing requirements, as determined in partnership design, and the information processing capabilities realised in information systems. This was further explored conducting a survey amongst German network organisations of freight forwarders in groupage service or contract logistics as a starting point because of their common usage of different interorganisational information systems. Surprisingly, our study shows only a slight influence of interorganisational tasks on the management of information systems. Moreover, our findings suggest that employment of IOS across firms observed is limited by structural factors (i. e. asset specificity) and nature of interorganisational relationship (i. e. trust, power). These factors are positively associated with satisfaction about information systems usage and performance.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a synopsis {{of the responses}} of forwarder and airline air cargo executives to a survey administered in late 1999 and early 2000. The study was directed at understanding information technology adoption and use in the U. S. scheduled air cargo sector. The report investigates dimensions of perceptions of IT, IT adoption, operational performance and airline-forwarder relations in the U. S. scheduled air cargo industry. Technologies include EDI, electronic commerce, <b>cargo</b> <b>community</b> <b>systems,</b> barcoding, tracking and tracing, radio, wireless, and automated vehicle location systems. The study finds that IT adoption is not evenly distributed and varies across several dimensions. It suggests that a strategy of “one size fits all” for information systems is problematic. The development of information systems that do not support firms to invoke their desired modes of differentiation does not engage the existing structure of the industry. Forwarders and airlines and larger and smaller firms have different goals and strategies. To the extent that larger firms have different trust and cooperative relations with their airline partners, they will integrate information systems differently into their supply chains. Smaller firms {{may not be able}} to integrate information systems in the same manner as larger firms. Across dimensions of size and other attributes, these firms require appropriate information technology solutions...|$|R
40|$|Air cargo {{parties are}} {{becoming}} increasingly {{aware of the importance}} of IT and, increasingly, they understand the value that IOS could provide for the total value chain performance. However, whereas in other sectors IOS has scored big successes, there are only fragmented examples of successful global systems in the air <b>cargo</b> <b>community</b> and the penetration of IT in the air cargo industry is by no means pervasive. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of global IOS in the air <b>cargo</b> <b>community.</b> It draws on extensive fieldwork in Europe and in Hong Kong SAR, in addition to reviews of relevant trade and academic literature. The paper provides interesting data on the IT-related dynamics in this specific business network. The objective of this research study is to describe the situation in the air <b>cargo</b> <b>community</b> in such a manner that from this the underlying causes for IT systems 'failures' or `success' can be extracted. By providing an insight into the existing information systems and the evolving dynamics in the air <b>cargo</b> <b>community,</b> we present a number of determinants of IT initiatives in the global air cargo industry. The paper explores the determinants from a theoretical perspective as well as on the basis of empirical data. It concludes with suggestions for further research...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of the Business Intelligence (BI) {{competencies}} of port <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> {{before they}} are bought and deployed is a vital importance for establishment of a decision-support environment for managers. This study proposes a new model which provides a simple approach to {{the assessment of the}} BI competencies of port <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> in organization. This approach helps decision-makers to select an enterprise system with appropriate intelligence requirements to support the managers’ decision-making tasks. Thirtyfour criteria for BI specifications are determined from a thorough review of the literature. The proposed model uses the fuzzy TOPSIS technique, which employs fuzzy weights of the criteria and fuzzy judgments of port <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> to compute the evaluation scores and rankings. The application of the model is realized in the evaluation, ranking and selecting of the needed port <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> in a port and maritime organization, in order to validate the proposed model with a real application. With utilizing the proposed model organizations can assess, select, and purchase port <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> which will provide a better decision-support environment for their business systems...|$|R

According to the complex information system of multi-living agent theory and method, this paper presents a new method for intelligent community research that based on multi-living agent. The new research method analyzes smart <b>community</b> <b>system</b> and smart home care application that optimize smart community construction effectively. It is obvious that the connection of agents in the smart <b>community</b> <b>system</b> is a good solution to handle information silos, forming data sharing system and improving smart community performance. The new research method in this thesis provides solutions to resolve data fusion problem of information silos, which is a general problem in complex information <b>system.</b> The smart <b>community</b> development should be in a better way through this method.

Communication helps agents share knowledge and cooperate. Agent communication may present at various forms; {{it can be the}} exchange of comprehensible messages, a request to perform an action, or cooperation negotiation. Agent communication has common properties like in any other distributed <b>community</b> <b>systems,</b> but it is the use of Agent Communication Language (ACL) that differentiates agent communication from that in other distributed <b>community</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we present an evaluation of some typical Message Transport Protocol (MTP) implementations for agent communication.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present a}} {{framework}} for measuring the quality of <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> for children, based on key attributes of systems performance for children's services. We present a research agenda for refining the model, evaluating indicators across the performance domains identified, developing normative standards for performance, and assessing the empirical basis for performance criteria. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Systems performance can be measured. A systems approach to evaluating <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> for children needs to incorporate the multilevel service delivery networks, programs, and systems of care for children. A model of <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> performance for children includes key dimensions of structure, financing, and accountability. Attributes within these dimensions serve as indicators that communities can use to evaluate systems quality. Performance standards can {{be based on the}} evidence from field demonstrations as well as from normative assessments. RECOMMENDATIONS: The model of <b>community</b> <b>systems</b> performance should be refined and developed using empirical findings of analyses of children's systems. A set of indicators that capture vital aspects of performance and that are relevant, scientifically valid, and feasible should be developed and tested in field studies. Once indicators are evaluated for use in performance monitoring, communities will be able to implement performance monitoring...|$|R
