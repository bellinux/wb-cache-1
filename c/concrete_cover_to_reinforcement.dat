This study was conducted specially for this purpose and comprise two major programs: (1) a survey program which covers the design and consultative practices offered by engineering offices, and quality control procedures adopted by ready-mix concrete plants, and (2) a site inspection program for testing of concrete and reinforcement specimens and measurements of as-built sections and <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> at selected sections.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{durability}} of reinforced concrete structures is {{highly dependent on}} the characteristics of the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and its thickness. The failure to obtain cover thickness is the factor with the largest influence on the premature corrosion of the reinforcement, which in turn is the main deterioration form of reinforced concrete structures. Studies indicate that the designed cover is not reached in the current constructions that adopt this structural solution, configuring a chronic, and not a sporadic problem. One of the observed causes for the failure in obtaining the minimum standardized cover is the incorrect use of spacers and the use of inadequate spacers. This is made more serious by the absence of a Brazilian standard to regulate the product and its use and, consequently, the absence of a quality certification from the responsible regulating agency. Focusing on spacers, requirements and performance criteria were proposed, in addition to methods for their assessment, with most being taken and adapted from international standards. Subsequently, some spacers available on the market were effectively tested according to the proposed methodology. No spacer model proved to be satisfactory according to the established performance approach. However, for each criteria and assessment methods proposed, there was, at least, one spacer model at the market which satisfied them, so {{it can be said that}} the criteria and methods are suitable for spacers performance evaluation. Faced with the performance diversity of the spacer models on offer, the need for a regulatory Brazilian standard for this product was confirmed in order to delimit the quality of spacers available on the market and to eliminate this variable as one of the causes for not obtaining the correct covering...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in concrete reduces the service {{life of a}} structure, as well as causes a reduction in its structural capacity. The factors that affect the rate of corrosion of reinforcement in concrete include the following: a) Presence of harmful chemicals (such as chlorides, acids, and sulfates), {{as well as the}} concentration of these chemicals. b) Availability of moisture and oxygen. c) Concrete density and permeability. d) Thickness of concrete cover. While the rate of corrosion of reinforcing bars can be reduced by providing proper concrete cover, additional measures are needed to ensure adequate and efficient protection in harsh environments. Such measures include the use of corrosion resistant concrete (CRC) and the use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as epoxy-coated reinforcement (ECR). Caltrans’Amendment to Section 5. 12. 3 of theAASHTO LRFD Specifications gives guidance to the Design Engineer in determining minimum required <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to prevent corrosion. This section also offers guidance on other corrosion mitigation measures. Prior to using Table 5. 12. 3 - 1, the Design Engineer should have the following information concerning the bridge site: i) Chloride content, acidity (pH value) and sulfate content of the surface water, ground water, and/or soil. ii) Mean lower low water (MLLW) level and mean higher high water (MHHW) level. The above information is obtained from the foundation report and the log of test borings (LOTB) report.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} reinforcement bars in reinforced concrete structures exposed to severe marine environments usually {{is attributed to}} the aggressive nature of chloride ions. In some cases in practice corrosion has been observed to commence already {{within a few years}} of exposure even with considerable <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reinforcement</b> and apparently high quality concretes. However, {{there are a number of}} other cases in practice for which corrosion initiation took much longer, even in cases with quite modest <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> and modest <b>concrete</b> quality. Many of these structures show satisfactory long-term structural performance, despite having high levels of localized chloride concentrations at the reinforcement. This disparity was noted already more than 50 years ago, but appears still not fully explained. This paper presents a systematic overview of cases reported in the engineering and corrosion literature and considers possible reasons for these differences. Consistent with observations by others, the data show that concretes made from blast furnace cements have better corrosion durability properties. The data also strongly suggest that concretes made with limestone or non-reactive dolomite aggregates or sufficiently high levels of other forms of calcium carbonates have favourable reinforcement corrosion properties. Both corrosion initiation and the onset of significant damage are delayed. Some possible reasons for this are explored briefly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Unbonded {{post-tensioned}} (UPT) {{flat plate}} concrete slabs are popular for modern continuous multiple bay floor assemblies due to economic and sustainability benefits (reductions in slab thickness and building self-weight) and structural advantages (decreased deflections over larger spans). Only limited {{research has been}} conducted on the performance of UPT flat plate slabs under fire conditions, yet the inherent fire endurance of these systems is sometimes quoted as a benefit of this type of construction. One concern for these structures in fire is that high temperature stress relaxation of the unbonded prestressed reinforcement may cause considerable and irrecoverable prestress loss, with subsequent structural consequences. This paper uses a computational model which has been developed to predict the transient high temperature stress relaxation (i. e., prestress loss) for typical UPT multiple span flat plate slabs in fire, to study the potential prestress relaxation behaviour under various plausible temperature conditions as might occur during exposure to a standard fire. The model is validated using experimental data from relaxation tests performed on locally heated unbonded seven-wire prestressing stand. The initial prestress level, <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> the prestressed <b>reinforcement,</b> and ratio of heated length to overall tendon length are varied to investigate the potential implications for prestress loss, and subsequently for flexural and punching shear capacity.

Three bridges in the Florida Panhandle with approximately 40 years of service in aggressive marine service were examined. A newly constructed marine bridge utilizing concrete cylinder piles was also examined to verify corrosion performance of piles manufactured with modern building materials and construction compared to piles built several decades ago. Survey of the marine bridges showed minimal corrosion distress despite low design <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> steel hoop <b>reinforcements</b> (20 - 40 mm). Typical concrete distress included minor rust staining but not necessarily indicating corrosion of reinforcement steel. Thin longitudinal cracks were frequently observed but were likely caused by mechanical damage from pile driving rather than stemming from corrosion distress. Chloride ion diffusivity was low, {{in the order of}} 1 x 10 - 13 m 2 /s. Other measured parameters such as concrete resistivity, porosity, and water absorption indicate low permeability. Chloride analysis of cracked and uncracked concrete cores from the older bridges in this study did not show pronounced preferential chloride penetration. Chloride analysis from the contemporary marine bridge did show some preferential transport of chloride ions at shallow depths through cracks with further evidence of lower electrical resistivity indicating enhanced electrolyte transport.

The experimental work comprised forty-eight beam specimens in eight series of tests. Most of the beams were 250 mm wide, 350 mm deep and had a clear span of approximately 2 metres. The largest beam was 250 mm wide, 600 mm deep and had a clear span of 3. 1 metres.

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{concrete}} {{have been used}} for buildings since the time of Egyptian civilisation. The art of cement manufacture was however lost during the Middle Ages. The rediscovery of the art in the nineteenth century and the subsequent development of reinforced and prestressed concrete have seen concrete become the most commonly used construction material throughout the world. While concrete structures perform well in many situations, lack of durability in others over {{the last two or three}} decades in particular has emerged as a significant issue for asset owners internationally. While there is a number of mechanisms by which concrete deteriorates, chloride induced corrosion of bridge and marine structures and carbonation induced damage of buildings are perhaps the most significant. The various concrete deterioration mechanisms and, to a lesser extent, <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> have been researched and reported extensively, particularly in the last twenty years. The research has however tended to focus on specific aspects of the durability performance of concrete structures. From an asset owner's perspective, it is the interaction of the various aspects of the deterioration processes that determines management strategies for affected structures and code and specification requirements for new structures. The literature relating to the interaction of the chloride and carbonation deterioration mechanisms and <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is however limited. The Tasmanian Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources is responsible for the management of a substantial bridge asset with a high proportion of its value in close proximity to salt water. The durability of its concrete structures is a significant management issue. A series of corrosion investigations and structural surveys have provided a substantial body of data which has been analysed and reported in this thesis to assist with the management of the asset and provide the basis for enhancements to specifications and codes. This work has highlighted the high variability in the parameters used to describe the durability related properties of in situ aged <b>concrete</b> and in <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The high variability leads to high probabilities of corrosion initiation, particularly for chloride induced corrosion, that are reflected in the durability related performance of the bridge asset. A high and continuing demand for maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement of corrosion affected structures is indicated. The high variabilities also suggest that incremental changes to existing approaches to durability in aggressive environments will not achieve the improvements in performance required to increase materials related reliability to levels that are consistent with, albeit lower than, levels of structural reliability. Approaches to enhance the durability, reflecting the significant level of change required, of concrete structures are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{corrosion}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of deterioration of reinforced concrete structures exposed to aggressive environments. Deterioration caused by reinforcement corrosion reduces the serviceability and load bearing capacity of the concrete structures to an extent of serious structural failure. Consequently, this increases the resources required for the maintenance and rehabilitation over time. Due to uncertainties associated with the performance deterioration, it is difficult to accurately assess the residual strength and remaining useful life of corrosion damaged concrete structure. Therefore, the reliability-based performance assessment techniques based on stochastic deterioration modelling has significant potential for assessing the present and future performance of these structures. This can be ultimately helpful in sustainable and cost-effective infrastructure management. This research presents new analytical methods for evaluating concrete crack evolution, estimating rebar bond strength degradation and predicting residual flexural strength of concrete structures affected by reinforcement corrosion. At first, cracking in <b>cover</b> <b>concrete</b> due <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> corrosion is investigated by using rebar-concrete model and realistic concrete properties. The bond strength evolution of the corroded rebar is then evaluated at different stages of cover cracking by considering adhesion, confinement and corrosion pressure acting at the bond interface. Furthermore, the residual flexural strength of concrete beams is predicted with consideration of bond failure between the rebar and concrete. The gamma process is adopted for stochastic modelling of concrete crack growth and strength deterioration with uncertainties. Then, a time-dependent reliability analysis is undertaken to evaluate the probability of failure in serviceability and load carrying capacity of corrosion damaged concrete beams. Optimal repair planning during the service life is also determined by balancing the cost for maintenance and the risk of structural failure. Finally, the results evaluated from the proposed methods are examined by available experimental and field data and the applicability is demonstrated by numerical examples. The results obtained show that the proposed methods are capable of evaluating the performance and can also provide risk-cost balanced repair strategy during the lifetime of corrosion damaged concrete structures. The knowledge gained from this research contributes to the better understanding of the mechanics of performance deterioration associated with reinforcement corrosion. Furthermore, the methods presented in this study could be helpful in assessing the actual state of performance deterioration and making decision regarding the optimal repair...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Concrete</b> <b>cover</b> {{cracking}} due <b>to</b> <b>reinforcement</b> corrosion {{is widely}} {{accepted as a}} limit-state indicator in defining the end of functional service life for existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures undergoing corrosion. Many of the currently available durability prediction models are incapable of providing realistic estimates of remaining service lives of RC structures beyond the corrosion initiation point. Therefore, the need to incorporate {{the length of the}} corrosion propagation stage in a comprehensive durability prediction approach has recently received much research attention. Previous research focus however was mostly limited to the case of uniformly corroding reinforcement with only few studies addressing the commonly encountered case of localized rebar corrosion. It was empirically shown in a previous study that localized corrosion can have a mitigating effect on time <b>to</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> cracking due <b>to</b> the larger required depth of rebar corrosion penetration (Critical penetration or Xcrit). The present research was focused on developing a model for predicting Xcrit for various degrees of corrosion localization including new cases of highly localized corrosion. Accelerated corrosion testing of controlled anodic regions along axial rebars in sound concrete cylinders suggested that localized corrosion can increase Xcrit by up to about a factor of 10. The effect of corrosion localization on the orientation of corrosion-induced surface cracks was also addressed. Testing of freely corroding pre-cracked RC pipe specimens in a chloride-containing environment indicated that steel corrosion can be localized at intersection regions with the pre-existing cracks and uniformly distributed around the reinforcing steel perimeter. Numerical modeling was undertaken to substantiate the experimentally observed trends on a theoretical basis for various degrees of corrosion localization. A mechanical model was developed to improve understanding of the underlying mechanism responsible for corrosion-induced stresses. A thick-walled multiple-cylinder approach was employed to simulate crack initiation and propagation to account for the residual strength property of concrete after cracking by applying the principles of applied elasticity. For a given <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> depth, the amount of Xcrit was shown by modeling to be largely determined by the length of corroding region and the capacity of the induced cracks to accommodate produced rusts. The properties of both concrete-rebar interface and corrosion products were also found to {{have a significant impact on}} Xcrit. Based on the model and experimental trends and comparisons with literature data, an improved relationship for the estimation of Xcrit was proposed. An electrochemical model was also formulated to address the possible role of corrosion aggravation due to macrocell coupling in counteracting the mitigating effect of increased Xcrit on time <b>to</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> cracking. Findings confirmed that corrosion localization can reasonably be considered a mitigating factor for extending the corrosion propagation stage, and provided more precise quantification to that effect...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiscale analytical model that predicts {{the lifetime of}} concrete members with externally bonded FRP reinforcement. The lifetime is dictated by the debonding of external reinforcement, which takes place within the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover,</b> where microcracks (initial flaws) propagate due to the shear stresses that the bond subjects the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to.</b> The lifetime is estimated from the propagation of such cracks until a critical crack length is eventually reached, which causes the external FRP <b>reinforcement</b> <b>to</b> lose the bond (delayed debonding). The model provides a closed form-solution for the life-through estimation of the external reinforcement, which consists {{of the interaction between}} bond shear stresses and lifetime (maximum bond shear stress versus delayed time, i. e. the ultimate domain). Crack growth is modeled at the mesoscale, where the velocity of the cracks depends on the mode II stress intensity factor, but not on the microstructure. The model assumes that the carbonation process has reduced the plasticity and cohesion of the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> zero; thus, the predictions are slightly conservative (lower bound model).

40|$|Vertical {{impedance}} measurements provide significant {{quantitative information}} {{about the ability of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> slow the penetration of chloride ions that can corrode steel reinforcement in a bridge deck [1]. The primary limitations preventing the widespread adoption of vertical impedance for assessment of concrete bridge decks are (1) the necessity to have a direct electrical connection to the embedded steel reinforcement and (2) the low speeds of data acquisition. This work presents solutions to both limitations. In previous work, our group developed a vertical impedance testing apparatus that was used to collect data from a continuously moving platform in the field [2]. While that apparatus greatly increased the speed of data collection, it required a direct electrical connection to the reinforcing steel; making a direct electrical connection to the rebar generally requires drilling through the concrete surface and tapping the reinforcing steel, which is a time-consuming process and therefore a major limitation to rapid data acquisition. In this work, a method using a large area electrode as a reference electrode for vertical impedance testing is proposed and validated using numerical finite-element simulations to demonstrate how a direct rebar connection can be eliminated. Based on these successful simulations, this work additionally reports how a large area electrode was constructed and incorporated in a continuously moving platform. When used in a multichannel arrangement, the use of a large area electrode allows rapid measurements of a full lane width of a bridge deck in a single pass. This development simplifies the entire vertical impedance testing process and greatly reduces the total time necessary to obtain measurements.

The better performance of the FGC beams was also evident from the absence of any corrosion-induced cracking and the very low tendency of the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> delaminate as measured by a concrete-embeddable fiber optic sensor...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: The {{effects of}} thermal loads on the {{structural}} performance of FRP reinforced concrete elements are analyzed in this paper. The difference in transverse {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between FRP and concrete causes {{the presence of}} tensile stresses within the concrete and, eventually, the formation of cracks when the temperature increases. As part of an inter-university experimental program, initial results are presented in the paper. They address the evaluation of temperature variations on concrete elements reinforced with AFRP and GFRP rebars, varying the thickness of the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> and the shape of the cross-section, in absence of transverse reinforcement. Results obtained confirm the influence of temperature variations on the state of strain and stress within FRP reinforced concrete elements and the necessity of a minimum <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> be provided {{in order to avoid the}} formation of through cracks. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical predictions, the latter obtained by means of analytical and numerical models, are presented. The progress of the experimental investigation will provide an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of theoretical models and their use for practical detailing...|$|R
40|$|Chloride {{extraction}} of concrete is a short-term electrochemical treatment against corrosion of reinforcing steel. The {{aim is to}} remove chloride ions from the <b>concrete</b> <b>cover</b> in order <b>to</b> reinstate passive behaviour. Physically sound concrete is left in place. To make this method more predictable and reliable, a laboratory study was carried out. Concrete specimens with penetrated chloride were subjected to electrochemical chloride extraction. The influence on chloride extraction was studied of: cement type (Portland, blast furnace slag), water-cementratio, <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reinforcement,</b> steel geometry, amount of charge passed and type of electrolyte. Additionally, some potential ‘killing’ factors {{and the effect of}} the treatment on corrosion pits were studied. Chloride profiles before and after treatment were measured. The durability of the final situation is predicted from calculation of the redistribution by diffusion of the remaining chloride ions. For various cement types and cover depths, the minimum amount of electrical charge was determined to obtain corrosion protection for at least 10 years. The presence of bending cracks in the specimens or tie wires close to the concrete surface did not {{have a significant effect on}} the extraction result. The test results suggest that active corrosion pits are extinguished by the treatmen...|$|R
