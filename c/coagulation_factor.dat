25|$|Coagulation {{is highly}} conserved {{throughout}} biology; in all mammals, coagulation involves both a cellular (platelet) and a protein (<b>coagulation</b> <b>factor)</b> component. The system in humans {{has been the}} most extensively researched and is the best understood.|$|E

40|$|After {{the first}} {{observations}} about blood coagulation by Hippocrates, it took {{until the early}} 1900 s before the classic theory of blood coagulation was presented. As more and more other <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> were discovered, the four-factor coagulation scheme became more complex, but better understood, leading to the current coagulation cascade. As {{during the last decade}} it turned out that <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> might do more than just promoting (or inhibiting) blood coagulation, new scientific avenues were pursued focusing on coagulation-independent properties of individual <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors.</b> This led to the current understanding that <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors,</b> like tissue factor (TF), FVII, FX, and thrombin, are important players in inflammation, vascular development, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> exert their pleiotropic effects in pathophysiology remains one of the major challenges in the field. This overview presents current insight in how the main <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> might induce inflammation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Prothrombin time (PT) is {{the leading}} test for {{monitoring}} oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT). We sought to determine INR taking into account only active <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> FII, FVII and FX without inhibition in patient plasmas and calibrator kits. We measured PT using a combined thromboplastin reagent. The calculation {{was based on a}} new PT method, which measures active <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> (F II, F VII, FX) and corrects the errors caused by inactive <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors.</b> On this basis, an INR result with and without inhibition for individual patient samples was also calculated and applied to 200 plasma samples obtained from OAT patients. Conspicuous variation in inhibition between the four calibration kits was noted. The kinetics of this inhibition was closest to a noncompetitive pattern. The need of correction for INRs of single patients increases with higher INRs. At the same level of patient INRs the coagulation inhibiton varies markedly. It has been known that different thromboplastin reagents possess variable sensitivities, but this may depend on sensitivity in inactive <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors.</b> PT methods today measure the sum of active <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> and inhibition of inactive <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors.</b> ISI calibrators contain variable amounts of inactive <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors,</b> which renders harmonisation of INR results. Application of the Acf-PT (INRAcf) presented in this work develops the PT methodology to measure the true coagulation activity in vivo for patient warfarin therapy without inhibition. INRInh can evidently also be used for the diagnostics and follow-up of certain liver diseases...|$|R

25|$|Type 3 is {{the most}} severe form of vWD (homozygous for the {{defective}} gene) and is characterized by complete absence of production of vWF. The von Willebrand factor is undetectable in the vWF antigen assay. Since the vWF protects <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> VIII from proteolytic degradation, total absence of vWF leads to extremely low factor VIII level, equivalent to that seen in severe hemophilia A with its clinical manifestations of life-threatening external and internal hemorrhages. The inheritance pattern of vWD type 3 is autosomal recessive, while the inheritance pattern of hemophilia A is X-linked recessive.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> {{is part of}} {{the contact}} {{activation}} or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus hemophilia A, a deficiency of factor VIII, which {{is part of the}} contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. The exceptions are prothrombin, fibrinogen, and some variants of FX that can be detected only by either aPTT or PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.|$|E

M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed by serology testing. Liver enzymes were elevated on admission without any past medical history. After treatment with azithromycin for 3 days, pneumonia improved, but the hepatitis was acutely aggravated. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was prolonged and depression of multiple <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> developed. Liver biopsy revealed features consistent with acute hepatitis.

Here, we investigated the impact of size and surface functional groups on the platelet homeostasis. ZnO NPs were synthesized in two different sizes (20 and 100 nm) and with three different functional surface groups (pristine, citrate, and L-serine). ZnO NPs were incubated with plasma collected from healthy rats to evaluate the coagulation time, kinetics of thrombin generation, and profile of levels of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> in the supernatant and coronated onto the ZnO NPs. Measurements of plasma coagulation time showed that all types of ZnO NPs prolonged both active partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time in a dose-dependent manner but there was no size- or surface functionalization-specific pattern. The kinetics data of thrombin generation showed that ZnO NPs reduced the thrombin generation potential with functionalization-specificity in the order of pristine > citrate > L-serine but there was no size-specificity. The profile of levels of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> in the supernatant and coronated onto the ZnO NPs after incubation of platelet-poor plasma with ZnO NPs showed that ZnO NPs reduced the levels of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> in the supernatant with functionalization-specificity. Interestingly, the pattern of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> in the supernatant was consistent with the levels of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> adsorbed onto the NPs, which might imply that ZnO NPs simply adsorb <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> rather than stimulating these factors. The reduced levels of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> in the supernatant were consistent with the delayed coagulation time and reduced potential for thrombin generation, which imply that the adsorbed <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> are not functional...|$|R
25|$|The precise {{function}} of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al., Nelsestuen et al., and Magnusson et al.) isolated the vitamin K-dependent <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had {{a form of}} prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as Î³-carboxyglutamate (Gla).

25|$|In 1966, Dayhoff {{pioneered the}} use of {{computers}} in comparing protein sequences and reconstructing their evolutionary histories from sequence alignments. This work, co-authored with Richard Eck, was the first application of computers to infer phylogenies from molecular sequences. It was the first reconstruction of a phylogeny (evolutionary tree) by computers from molecular sequences using a maximum parsimony method. In later years, she applied these methods to study a number of molecular relationships, such as the catalytic chain and bovine cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the src gene product of Rous avian and Moloney murine sarcoma viruses; antithrombin-III, alpha-antitrypsin, and ovalbumin; epidermal growth factor and the light chain of <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> X; and apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I and C-III.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} {{haemostasis}} evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which {{need to be}} considered when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive for the effect of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM is not meant to replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. Sulfatide has anticoagulation activity when it binds to fibrinogen, which prevents fibrinogen from converting to fibrin. Sulfatide {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, sulfatide also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, sulfatide is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> XII; second, sulfatide binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, sulfatide and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of sulfatide. Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous sulfatide is necessary to fully understand the role of sulfatide in coagulation and thrombosis. Sulfatide is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

The motifs <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> 5/8 type C or discoidin and thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) present in SCO-spondin consensus were initially described in blood proteins, where they were shown {{to play a role in}} coagulation or platelet aggregation. SCO-spondin and F-spondin share a similar pattern of expression in the floor plate, flexural organ and subcommissural organ and could have a redundant activity. The biological function of F-spondin and SCO-spondin on the deflection of commissural axons in the neural tube was assessed respectivelly by experiments of gain and loss of function and by analyses of mutants with defective floor plate. F-spondin and SCO-spondin were both shown to promote neurite outgrowth of various neuronal cell populations, in cell culture.|$|E

30|$|Systemic {{inflammation}} {{is followed}} by activation of the coagulation system, and conversely, components of the coagulation system significantly affect the inflammatory response [22].

The <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> also play a direct role in host defense.
