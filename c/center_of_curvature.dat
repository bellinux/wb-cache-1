5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

25|$|Notice that {{velocity}} always {{points in}} the direction of motion, in other words for a curved path it is the tangent vector.

25|$|In {{accordance}} with Newton's first law of motion, an object moves {{in a straight}} line {{in the absence of any}} external forces acting on the object. A curved path may however ensue when a physical acts on it; this force is often called a centripetal force, as it is directed toward the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> of the path. Then in {{accordance with}} Newton's third law of motion, there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object, such as a constraint that forces the path to be curved, and this reaction force, the subject of this article, is sometimes called a reactive centrifugal force, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the centripetal force.|$|E

2500|$|The {{signs of}} the lens' radii of {{curvature}} indicate whether the corresponding surfaces are convex or concave. The sign convention used to represent this varies, but in this article a positive R indicates a surface's <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> is further along {{in the direction of}} the ray travel (right, in the accompanying diagrams), while negative R means that rays reaching the surface have already passed the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature.</b> Consequently, for external lens surfaces as diagrammed above, [...] and [...] indicate convex surfaces (used to converge light in a positive lens), while [...] and [...] indicate concave surfaces.

For the reduced linkage, the problem <b>of</b> finding coordinated <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> may be solved by successive application of Bobillier's Theorem in different four-bar loops. In order to show applicability also for linkages not containing four-bars, the method will be demonstrated for an eight-bar linkage containing only pentagonal loops.

2500|$|A {{centripetal}} force (from Latin centrum, [...] "center" [...] and petere, [...] "to seek") {{is a force}} that makes a body follow a curved path. Its direction is always orthogonal to {{the motion of the}} body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> of the path. Isaac Newton described it as [...] "a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre".

6000|$|Now, {{there are}} two kinds of harmonies of lines. One in which, moving more or less side by side, they variously, but evidently with consent, retire from or {{approach}} each other, intersect or oppose each other; currents of melody in music, for different voices, thus approach and cross, fall and rise, in harmony; so the waves of the sea, as they approach the shore, flow into one another or cross, but with a great unity through all; and so various lines of composition often flow harmoniously through and across each other in a picture. But the most simple and perfect connection of lines is by radiation; that is, by their all springing from one point, or closing towards it; and this harmony is often, in Nature almost always, united with the other; as the boughs of trees, though they intersect and play amongst each other irregularly, indicate by their general tendency their origin from one root. An essential part of the beauty of all vegetable form is in this radiation; it is seen most simply in a single flower or leaf, as in a convolvulus bell, or chestnut leaf; but more beautifully in the complicated arrangements of the large boughs and sprays. For a leaf is only a flat piece of radiation; but the tree throws its branches on all sides, and even in every profile view of it, which presents a radiation more or less correspondent to that of its leaves, it is more beautiful, because varied by the freedom of the separate branches. I believe it has been ascertained that, in all trees, the angle at which, in their leaves, the lateral ribs are set on their central rib is approximately the same at which the branches leave the great stem; and thus each section of the tree would present a kind of magnified view of its own leaf, were it not for the interfering force of gravity on the masses of foliage. This force in proportion to their age, and the lateral leverage upon them, bears them downwards at the extremities, so that, as before noticed, the lower the bough grows on the stem, the more it droops (Fig. 17, p. 67); besides this, nearly all beautiful trees have a tendency to divide into two or more principal masses, which give a prettier and more complicated symmetry than if one stem ran all the way up the center. Fig. 41 may thus be considered the simplest type of tree radiation, as opposed to leaf radiation. In this figure, however, all secondary ramification is unrepresented, for the sake of simplicity; but if we take one half of such a tree, and merely give two secondary branches to each main branch (as represented in the general branch structure shown at b, Fig. 18, p. 68), we shall have the form Fig. 42. This I consider the perfect general type of tree structure; and it is curiously connected with certain forms of Greek, Byzantine, and Gothic ornamentation, into the discussion of which, however, we must not enter here. It will be observed, that both in Figs. 41 and 42 all the branches so spring from the main stem as very nearly to suggest their united radiation from the root R. This is by no means universally the case; but if the branches do not bend towards a point in the root, they at least converge to some point or other. In the examples in Fig. 43, the mathematical <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> a, is thus, in one case, on the ground, at some distance from the root, and in the other, near the top of the tree. Half, only, of each tree is given, for the sake of clearness: Fig. 44 gives both sides of another example, in which the origins of curvature are below the root. As the positions of such points may be varied without end, and as the arrangement of the lines is also farther complicated by the fact of the boughs springing for the most part in a spiral order round the tree, and at proportionate distances, the systems of curvature which regulate the form of vegetation are quite infinite. Infinite is a word easily said, and easily written, and people do not always mean it when they say it; in this case I do mean it: the number of systems is incalculable, and even to furnish anything like a representative number of types, I should have to give several hundreds of figures such as Fig. 44.[60] ...|$|E
