40|$|The boom in {{commercial}} bank lending to {{less developed countries}} (LDCs) {{in the past ten}} years, which was seen as a timely response to oil price shocks and industrial recessions, has culminated in external debt crises in several major LDCs. This outcome suggests the need to identify an appropriate role for external debt among other macroeconomic policy responses for confronting external financial shocks. ^ This study attempts to define such a role, using dynamic and optimal control simulations of a macroeconometric model of the Philippines. A large-scale disaggregated model was estimated, with full articulation of Philippine commodity sectors, the interaction of international financial flows with domestic monetary aggregates, and the external debt accounts. The study also clarified conceptual issues for measuring debt capacity, and defined measures for the sustainability of the debt situation. ^ Dynamic simulations show that given an external financial shock, recourse to short-term external debt without the accompanying set of coordinated fiscal and monetary policies to distribute the burden of adjustment among the various macroeconomic goals, would likely result in an unsustainable debt situation. Dynamic simulations also evaluate institutional responses such as debt restructuring, rescheduling, and debt cancellation. ^ Optimal control simulations derive a pattern of policy responses that avoid an unsustainable debt situation, given the same external financial shock. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 package assigns an important role to <b>official</b> <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> to de-fuse an incipient debt crisis, and highlight the importance of determining whether the shock is temporary or is a permanent revision of the external balance position. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 package includes fiscal and monetary policies that encourage provate sector investment and autonomous portfolio capital inflows. This prescription is difficult to implement because in a period of uncertainty, the private sector could not usually be the leading growth sector. These and other real world constraints on the optimal solution suggest the need for other macro policy actions on the part of industrial countries for a satisfactory solution to the debt problem. Dynamic simulations measure the multiplier effect of such actions on the debt situation {{in the case of the}} Philippines. ...|$|R

40|$|The emerging-market {{crises of}} the 1990 s were {{characterized}} by crashes in exchange rates, credit flows, and output, and the currency crashes caused the other two. Because local banks and firms had large foreign-currency debts, the sharp depreciations of their countries' currencies had huge balance-sheet effects that led to an implosion of domestic credit flows, causing sharp falls in investment and output. It is wrong to blame the IMF for these calamitous outcomes. Nevertheless, the strategy adopted by the IMF {{for dealing with the}} Asian crisis was partly responsible for the severity of the crisis. By calling for extensive structural reforms, it delayed the restoration of investor confidence by causing investors to believe that recovery could not occur until the reforms were implemented. And though it assembled huge amounts of official funding, it made far less funding available up front [...] too little to arrest the collapse of the Asian currencies.

China releases little information, and outside estimates of the size and nature of Chinese aid vary widely. In an effort to overcome this problem, AidData, based at the College of William and Mary, has compiled a database of thousands of media reports on Chinese-backed projects in Africa from 2000 to 2011. The database includes information on 1, 673 projects in 50 African countries and on $ 75 billion in commitments of <b>official</b> <b>finance.</b> This paper describes the new database methodology, key findings, and possible applications of the data, which is being made publicly available for the first time.

Policymakers, journalists, and public intellectuals claim that Beijing is using its largesse to cement alliances with political leaders, secure access to natural resources, and create exclusive commercial opportunities for Chinese firms—all at the expense of citizens living in developing countries. We argue that much of the controversy about Chinese “aid” stems from a failure to distinguish between China’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) and more commercially-oriented sources and types of state financing. Using a new database on China’s <b>official</b> <b>financing</b> commitments to Africa from 2000 - 2013, we find the allocation of Chinese ODA to be driven primarily by foreign policy considerations, while economic interests better explain the distribution of less concessional flows.
