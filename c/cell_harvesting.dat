40|$|Peripheral blood (PB) CD 34 + cells {{enumeration}} {{is currently}} the most reliable method to guide the timing of stem <b>cell</b> <b>harvest.</b> However, its usage is restricted by being technically challenging, costly, and time-consuming. Immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) determination, which is simpler and cheaper and has a faster turn-around time, has been proposed for a similar purpose. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the value of IRF in guiding stem <b>cell</b> <b>harvest</b> and examine the correlation between IRF and PB CD 34 + cells count. Daily pre-harvest tests, i. e. PB CD 34 + cells and IRF from 21 patients scheduled for autologous PBSC transplant were assessed. Stem <b>cells</b> <b>harvests</b> were commenced when the PB CD 34 + cell count were more than 10 cell/ul. A total of 205 pre-harvest tests were analysed. Following stem cell mobilisations, both the IRF and PB CD 34 + cell counts rose with a variable pattern. In this study, we observed that the IRF peaks preceded the PB CD 34 + count by 2 days. On the day of stem <b>cell</b> <b>harvest,</b> all the peak IRF values were> 0. 3. The PB CD 34 + cell counts correlated with the <b>harvested</b> stem <b>cell</b> yield, whereby r 2 = 0. 77, p 0. 3 may be used as a cut-off value for the initiation of PB CD 34 + quantifi cation prior to stem <b>cell</b> <b>harvest...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the Langendorff preparation, {{the heart}} {{is removed from the}} animal's body, {{severing}} the blood vessels; it is then perfused in a reverse fashion via the aorta, usually with a nutrient rich, oxygenated solution (e.g. Krebs-Henseleit solution or Tyrode's solution). The backwards pressure causes the aortic valve to shut, forcing the solution into the coronary vessels, which normally supply the heart tissue with blood. This feeds nutrients and oxygen to the cardiac muscle, allowing it to continue beating for several hours after its removal from the animal. This is a useful preparation because it allows the addition of drugs (via the perfusate) and observation of their effect on the heart without the complications involved with in vivo experimentation, such as neuronal and hormonal effects from living animal. This preparation also allows the organ to be digested into individual cells by adding collagenase to the perfusate. This can be done before the experiment as a technique for <b>cell</b> <b>harvesting,</b> or after the experiment to measure its effects at the cellular level.|$|E

The BioProcess Systems Alliance (BPSA) is the single use association advocating broader application of single-use to include cGMP Good manufacturing practice use which will require FDA support. The agency has stated in public forums it is a major backer of single use technology in general, as the technology provides significant benefits and value, including mitigation of cross contamination and reduced industry costs. The FDA has stated it will not issue guidance to the industry on single use but may issue Q and As on its web site. When an FDA approved single use production site is approved, the gates will open for broader and faster single use adoption worldwide. Already single use has shown itself to be a huge cost saver and to increase process flexibility and operational efficiency for biosimilar applications and for biotech startups and CROs. Emerging markets are expected to embrace single use vs stainless given their lack of legacy infrastructure and desire to drive capex and opex costs out of the biotech operation.

Methodology and Results: The fungi present on the soil samples collected from two automobile workshops in Akure, Nigeria were investigated using standard microbiological techniques. These fungal isolates were screened for the ability to degrade Bonnylight crude oil. The bioremediation of Bonnylight crude oil was observed spectrophotometrically using the broth culture (non- <b>harvested</b> <b>cells)</b> and <b>harvested</b> <b>cells</b> of the fungi isolated from the contaminated sites {{for a period of}} 20 days on minimal salt broth. Mycotypha microspora, Penicllium italicum, Botryris cinerea, Gliocladium deliquescence, Verticillium albo–atrum and Aspergillus niger were isolated from the contaminated site while Neurospora crassa, A. parasiticus, A. niger and Gonatobotryum apiculatum were isolated from uncontaminated sites. All the fungal isolates were capable of active degradation in varying degrees. Conclusion: The study shows that all the isolated fungi were capable of degrading the crude oil in varying degrees. The active crude oil utilizing fungi in this study were Aspergillus niger (both harvested and non <b>harvested</b> <b>cells)</b> and Gliocladium deliquescence (non <b>harvested</b> <b>cells)</b> and Penicillium italicum (<b>harvested</b> <b>cells).</b> Aspergillus niger has best degrading ability than other fungi in non <b>harvested</b> and <b>harvested</b> <b>cell</b> condition.

This study aimed at developing a non-invasive methodology to determine objectively and automatically the optimal time-point at which to inhibit the enzymatic reaction during <b>cell</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The harvesting process was monitored under a microscope and image {{analysis was used to}} measure the cells' morphology (circularity) from the images. System identification techniques were used to model the cells' circularity in response to the harvesting solution and to quantify the time when the cells become circular and reach a plateau phase (inhibition time). ARX models were used to accurately model the process both in culture flasks and in a bioreactor (R 2 ≥ 0. 98 and 0. 95 respectively) and to quantitatively determine the inhibition time. First-order Recursive-ARX models were applied to predict the inhibition time in real-time. When the model parameters converged the median error was 21 s (Min 0 s, Max 75 s).
