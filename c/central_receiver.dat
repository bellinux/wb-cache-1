40|$|The {{design of}} <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> in {{solar thermal power}} plants is {{critical}} for eﬃcient plant operation and sufficient operational lifetimes. The high, non-uniform concentration ratios used in <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> lead to high, non-uniform receiver temperatures. For the same operational conditions, small changes to the receiver design {{can make a big}} impact on the expected lifetime of the receiver. This is due to limitations of the receiver materials to high temperatures and thermal cycling. In this study, we investigate the effect of several engineering concepts on the resultant surface temperatures of tubular billboard receivers. Four tubular billboard designs are investigated along with the sensitivity these designs have to high temperatures resulting from changes in the aiming point of the heliostat array. We examined a receiver with single diameter tubes, an ideal ﬂow receiver, a receiver using various diameter tubes and a receiver made of tube panels in series. The single-diameter and multi-diameter receivers were found to have high temperatures and high sensitivity under non-standard irradiation. The multi-pass receiver was found to out-perform the other designs by reducing both the maximum surface temperatures under standard irradiance and the risk of high temperatures from irradiance changes. The results provide insights into tubular billboard receiver design, material selection and design for extended life...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConcentrating {{solar power}} {{currently}} relies on high temperature <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> that utilize liquid cooling and operate in power steam cycles. However, highly efficient <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> are being designed {{to operate at}} higher temperatures in a gas turbine power cycle. To address this, San Diego State University's (SDSU) Combustion and Solar Energy Laboratory is experimenting with a lab-scale Small Particle Heat Exchange Receiver (SPHER) {{in order to understand}} performance and develop experience for designing and operating a full-scale 5 MW design. The full-scale design will be tested at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility at Sandia National Laboratories as part of the Department of Energy SunShot Initiative grant. The SPHER relies on carbon nanoparticles as an absorption medium and air as a working fluid. The carbon particles are generated onsite by the Carbon Particle Generator (CPG) and are mixed with dilution air prior to entering the SPHER. Lab scale on-sun testing is carried out with a 15 kWe solar simulator. The lab scale experimental goal is to achieve an outlet flow of 650 °C at 5 bar absolute operating pressure. To model the performance of the SPHER, CFD analysis is being used for comparison to lab scale testing. The lab scale SPHER is being modeled in ANSYS Fluent with coupled codes for oxidation and radiation input. In this paper, we present results of testing the lab-scale receiver and compare the measured outlet temperatures to predictions from the computer model. Finally, correlations are drawn for future experimenation and feasibility...|$|R
50|$|The {{consumer}} is this person (Collins, 2016).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 111 - 114) <b>Central</b> <b>receivers</b> {{for solar}} power towers {{have recently been}} under intense investigation. They can convert solar radiation into electricity by supplying heat to a thermodynamic cycle. In particular, air-cooled solar <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> can power gas turbine engines for electrical generation. Solar heating of the compressed air is realized in a pressurized volumetric receiver. A new type of receiver module consists of an insulated pressure vessel, closed by a quartz glass window and a mixture of small particles in air as working medium. The process {{has so far been}} investigated mainly in Spain, Israel, Germany and United States with different designs with varying power outputs, all below 400 kW. However, the critical part of the whole assembly is the window which transmits solar flux into the receiver. To overcome the drawbacks of the previously designed windows a new geometry was developed and an appropriate method of building it economically and commercially is suggested. The main focus of this project is to analyze different materials obtainable from the market, Optimize the window design of one large window and Ideal mounting arrangement. A part of this work is carried out by using Finite Element Analysis of quartz glass windows of different shapes using the commercial software Hypermesh and Solidworks. The analysis will be performed taking in to account the load and boundary conditions for the window design. The operating conditions for the receiver will provide a uniform 5 bar pressure distribution on the window. The high pressure makes receiver window design difficult, further analysis was done with considering different seal arrangements for window design and a better seal arrangement with reduced stresses on to the window is suggested. Finally a unique morphed geometry of the window was produced and a seal arrangement for it was suggested. Project is been multi-disciplinary in nature with structural analysis followed by modeling and optimization of the different geometries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe falling {{particle}} receiver is {{a technology}} that can increase the operating temperature of concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, improving efficiency and lowering the costs of energy storage. Unlike conventional receivers that employ fluid flowing through tubular receivers, falling particle receivers use solid particles that are heated directly as they fall through a beam of concentrated sunlight for direct heat absorption and storage. Because the solar energy is directly absorbed by the particles, the flux limitations associated with tubular <b>central</b> <b>receivers</b> are mitigated. Once heated, the particles may be stored in an insulated tank and/or used to heat a secondary working fluid (e. g., steam, CO 2, air) for the power cycle. Thermal energy storage costs can be significantly reduced by directly storing heat at higher temperatures in a relatively inexpensive, stable medium. This paper presents an overview of recent advancements being pursued in key areas of falling particle receiver technology, including(1) advances in receiver design with consideration of particle recirculation, air recirculation, and interconnected porous structures; (2) advances in particle materials to increase the solar absorptance and durability; and (3) advances {{in the balance of}} plant for falling particle receiver systems including thermal storage, heat exchange, and particle conveyance...|$|R
50|$|A {{solar power}} tower {{consists}} of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors (heliostats) that concentrate sunlight on a <b>central</b> <b>receiver</b> atop a tower; the receiver contains a fluid deposit, which can consist of sea water. Optically a solar power tower {{is the same as}} a circular Fresnel reflector. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500-1000 °C (773 - 1273 K) and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system. An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower. Power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems, but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability.|$|E
