5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{who wrote the}} note. Leach {{has said that the}} handwriting {{on the front of the}} document most closely resembles that of either Menella or Violet Dodgson, Dodgson's nieces. However, Morton N. <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> in an article published in the Times Literary Supplement in 2003 that in the 1960s, Dodgson's great-nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques told him that Jacques had written the note himself based on conversations he remembered with Dodgson's nieces. Cohen's article offered no evidence to support this, however, and known samples of Jacques' handwriting do not seem to resemble the writing of the note.|$|E
25|$|He {{belongs to}} a Jewish family which {{attended}} a Reform Judaism synagogue. He became a bar mitzvah and was confirmed in that synagogue. While attending Boston University, he became an evangelical Christian, and he later joined the Unification Church (which disapproves of homosexual behavior), where he says he remained celibate for long periods. In 1982, Cohen married Jae Sook, a South Korean woman suggested to him by church leader Sun Myung Moon. <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> that, {{during the first three}} years of his marriage, he underwent psychotherapy but was unable to find the help he needed, and therefore he found some healing with a boyfriend in New York City.|$|E
5000|$|Caryn James of The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "leaden" [...] and [...] "competently made but dull", but praised Marg Helgenberger and Scott <b>Cohen,</b> <b>saying</b> they [...] "rose above the script" [...] while calling Ronny Cox bland and Kris Kristofferson drab.|$|R
2500|$|During the 2006 campaign, Herenton {{endorsed}} <b>Cohen,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Steve <b>Cohen</b> is the best-qualified {{candidate for}} this leadership role". [...] While Cohen's commanding {{win in the}} 2008 primary suggested that he has won strong support among the district's African-American community, Herenton was easily his highest-profile opponent to date.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times quoted Richard <b>Cohen</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "the essay cherry-picked quotations. 'Rosenfeld mischaracterized what I wrote', Cohen said. 'I've been {{critical}} of Israel at times, but I've always been a defender of Israel.' He did add, however, that {{a wide range of}} writers were named, some of whom have written inflammatory words about Israel. 'He has me in a very strange neighborhood.'" ...|$|R
500|$|In February 1923, Hemingway and Hadley visited Italy; in Rapallo {{they met}} Pound, who almost {{certainly}} commissioned the prose pieces for the literary magazine The Little Review during their visit. Still {{upset at the}} loss of his work, Hemingway had not written since the previous December, but he slowly wrote six new paragraphs, submitting them for the March deadline. Hemingway scholar Milton <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> at that point Hemingway knew the pieces for The Little Review would [...] "govern the remainder of the book that Pound had commissioned." ...|$|E
500|$|Esham's lyrical style, which author Sara <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> [...] "utilize {{shocking}} (and blatantly {{over the}} top) narratives {{to give an}} over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit", {{was derived from the}} style of the Geto Boys. Smith's lyrics have focused on themes such as death, drug use, evil, paranoia and sex, and have included references to Satan. Smith refers to his performance style as [...] "acid rap," [...] comparing the lyrics to hallucinations induced by LSD. Esham's style has also been described as horrorcore hip hop.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. <b>Cohen</b> <b>says,</b> “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E
5000|$|The musical {{adaptation}} was beset {{with problems}} from the beginning. Rodgers and Charnin had composed a full score before the libretto was written, so {{they ended up}} having to replace {{a significant number of}} songs throughout rehearsals. The original director, Charnin, was replaced by Cy Feuer after tryouts in Philadelphia, with producer Alexander H. <b>Cohen</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "they had to go 'for radical surgery' [...] ". The original choreographer, Graciela Daniele, was replaced by Danny Daniels.|$|R
50|$|Cohen {{believes}} {{that people are}} driven, typically, not to create identity, but to preserve that which they have in virtue, for example, of 'nationality, or race, or religion, or some slice or amalgam thereof' (pp. 156-159). Cohen does not claim that 'Marx denied {{that there is a}} need for self-definition, but claims that he failed to give the truth due emphasis' (p. 155). Nor does <b>Cohen</b> <b>say</b> that the sort of self-understanding that can be found through religion etc. is accurate (p. 158). Of nationalism, he says 'identifications can take benign, harmless, and catastrophically malignant forms' (p. 157) and does not believe 'that the state is a good medium for the embodiment of nationality' (p. 164).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{answer a}} {{question}} of Li, Ngo, and Rhoades concerning a set of q-series related to the q-hypergeometric series σ from Ramanajun's lost notebook.

2500|$|The book On the Warrior's Path quotes Feyerabend, {{highlighting}} {{the similarities between}} his epistemology and Bruce Lee's worldview. In a 2015 retrospective on [...] Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts in social science, the philosopher Martin Cohen cites several of Feyerabend's sceptical positions on conventional claims at scientific knowledge and agrees with Feyerabend that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what this notion of paradigm shifts' might mean, and that Kuhn essentially retreated from the more radical implications of his theory, which were that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive. <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> that although in their lifetimes, Kuhn and Feyerabend made up two viciously opposed sects, they agreed that science consists of long periods of settled agreement (so-called 'normal science') punctuated by radical, conceptual upheaval (so-called paradigm shifts).|$|E

5000|$|Cohen thought [...] "it wasn't a bad movie" [...] {{except for}} the casting of Boone; Cohen felt Boone's face was so {{distinctive}} {{the concept of the}} film did not work. <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> there was some talk of remaking the film years later as a vehicle for Andrea Bocelli but it did not proceed because of concerns over Bocelli's acting ability. The film was executive produced by Aaron Spelling, who <b>Cohen</b> <b>says</b> stole Cohen's idea for The Mod Squad.|$|E
50|$|Dan Humphrey’s {{character}} has garnered much media recognition. Alfonso Espina of The Huffington Post declared that Dan was the “Nick Carraway character we viewers could live vicariously through.” Jason Gay of Rolling Stone praised Badgley’s characterisation, claiming that “while another actor {{may have played}} Dan as a blah straight man, Badgley imbued him with an occasionally obnoxious know-it-all-ness.” The New Yorker cited Dan as “the token-boho character”; while, New York Magazine described Badgley’s Dan as “the moralistic outsider, or what passes for one on a show produced by the guy who created The O.C.”. Jarett Wieselman of Entertainment Tonight asserted that “charming and disarming in equal measure, Badgley's incarnation of the Brooklyn-boy gone bad was always a comedic and emotional highlight.” Melena Ryzik of The New York Times compared Dan Humphrey’s character to The O.C.'s Seth <b>Cohen,</b> <b>saying</b> they both fulfilled the role of “the darkly comic observer”. Similarly, Julie Weiner of Vanity Fair claimed that Dan was a Schwartzian archetype of Seth in that both characters were “attractive bookish outsiders”.|$|R
5000|$|Former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton {{announced}} that he would challenge Cohen in the 2010 Democratic primary for the seat. In a guest column in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Herenton wrote that while he hoped the campaign would focus on issues rather than race or religion, that [...] "it remains a fact that the 9th Congressional District provides the only real opportunity to elect a qualified African-American to the all-white 11-member delegation representing Tennessee in Washington." [...] Herenton also denied having supported Cohen in his 2006 bid against Jake Ford, writing [...] "I did not support Steve Cohen the individual for the 9th Congressional District. I supported an idea that was bigger than him as an individual. I supported the principle of fairness."During the 2006 campaign, Herenton endorsed <b>Cohen,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Steve <b>Cohen</b> is the best-qualified candidate for this leadership role". [...] While Cohen's commanding win in the 2008 primary suggested that he has won strong support among the district's African-American community, Herenton was easily his highest-profile opponent to date.|$|R
5000|$|Boadt was {{selected}} {{to serve as the}} scripture editor of the Paulist Press, a publishing house established by the Paulist Fathers in 1881. His 1984 book Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction was intended to explain the Old Testament to Christians. He deeply believed in the principle that Christians could best understand their faith by studying Judaism and suggested that Christians [...] "could gain some feeling for the Old Testament by attending a Friday night Sabbath service at a local temple or synagogue". Other books he authored include the 1980 work Ezekiel's Oracles Against Egypt: A Literary and Philological Study of Ezekiel 29-32, the 1986 book Introduction to Wisdom Literature, Proverbs and the 1999 text Why I Am a Priest: Thirty Success Stories. Boadt noted that he oversaw the 2003 publishing of Moses: A Memoir by Joel <b>Cohen,</b> <b>saying</b> that the imprint receives many books that were [...] "too Jewish" [...] for a Catholic readership, but that this book struck the right balance. He was named President of the Paulist Press in 1998, holding that position until shortly before his death and overseeing the publishing of an average of 80 books annually.|$|R

5000|$|After {{discovering}} {{that he has}} this [...] "gift" [...] (which {{only a few people}} possess), Ezra starts to use it to improve his status at school. Ezra's friends Shelby (Brittany Curran), Joel (Kunal Sharma) and Dylan (Jeff Braine) also start to get more popular.

He eventually is forced to decide if he agrees with his grandmother (Joyce <b>Cohen)</b> in <b>saying,</b> [...] "Not all superheroes fight crime".|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 January 2011 {{that the show}} would not be returning for a fifth series. The decision caused viewer complaints, prompting BBC One controller Danny <b>Cohen</b> to <b>say,</b> [...] "Lark Rise to Candleford has been a truly wonderful part of the BBC One schedule and we are incredibly grateful to writer Bill Gallagher and the team. But we feel {{the time is right}} to make room for new dramas which we hope will be taken to the nation's hearts in the same way." ...|$|R

5000|$|A teaser for {{the series}} was {{released}} ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 IMAX screenings, as well as online, in early May 2017. It followed {{the release of a}} cast photo, which Dana Schwartz at Observer.com called [...] "pretty lame ... Overall, the look of the entire royal family is 'group that met on Craigslist to try to win a costume contest, with varying levels of commitment.'" [...] James Whitbrook of Gizmodo said [...] "some of these costumes work way better than others": Black Bolt [...] "probably comes out the best", Crystal [...] "gets some points for effort", but Medusa looks [...] "like she's trying to do a particularly low-budget cosplay of Game of Thrones Sansa Stark." [...] Analyzing the response to the series on Twitter, marketing firm Amobee counted 27,000 tweets concerning the series between May 4 and May 9, with 17 and 7 percent of that specifically mentioning [...] "hair" [...] or [...] "wig", respectively, referencing Swan's hair in the photo which was particularly criticized. 35 percent of the tweets were deemed negative, and just 26 percent positive, with Amobee principle brand analyst Jonathan <b>Cohen</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "The high level of audience engagement in Marvel TV shows is a double-edged sword for the company. On one hand, there's great anticipation around any nugget of information for an upcoming TV series. On the other hand, when a segment of that audience is disappointed, that reaction is magnified".|$|R
5000|$|On 30 May 1971 Richard Burton {{wrote in}} his diary that Villain [...] "a goodish film but so far isn't doing {{very well in the}} States but has not yet opened in Britain and the Commonwealth were it should do better". On 21 August 1971 he wrote that the film's {{director}} was [...] "whassisname" [...] and that he:Received a cable... from executive Nat <b>Cohen</b> <b>saying</b> the notices for film... superb and great boxoffice, and another cable said we expect a million pounds from UK alone. That means about $1/2 m for me if I remember correctly. There is no accounting for differing tastes of Yanks and English critics. Villain was received badly in the US and with rapture in the UK. I know it is cockney and therefore difficult for Yanks to follow but one would have thought the critics to be of sufficiently wide education to take it in their stride. The English critics, after all, are not embarrassed when they see a film made in Brooklynese. Anyway I am so delighted that it is doing well in UK. Otherwise I would have doubted E's and my judgement in such matters. I thought it was good and she said she knew it was good. The American reaction was therefore a surprise.Coincidentally, Burton was mentioned in James Barlow's 1968 novel, The Burden Of Proof, upon which the film was based. In the book, the prosecutor asks a female witnesses if she [...] "likes the actor Richard Burton".|$|R
