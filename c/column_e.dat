The kinetic constants of the DNA relaxation reaction of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I were determined as well. I also used isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the energetics of DNA supercoiling by using the unwinding properties of DNA intercalators, ethidium and daunomycin. After comparing the enthalpy changes of these DNA intercalators binding to supercoiled and nicked or relaxed plasmid DNA pXXZ 06, I determined the DNA supercoiling enthalpy is about 12 kcal/mol per turn of DNA supercoil, which is in good agreement with the previously published results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree {{categories}} of fossil aggregates are {{recognized in the}} Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale biota from SW China: (1) elliptical aggregates with randomly distributed exoskeletal remains of typically small- to medium-size bivalved arthropods (e. g., ostracode-like bradoriids, phyllocarid- like waptiids), hyoliths, and trilobites are interpreted as coprolites, possibly produced by anomalocaridids (e. g., waptiid-rich coprolites) and/or unknown epibenthic predators; (2) elongate, ribbon-like aggregates composed of oriented small hyolith shells, interpreted as the feces of infaunal carnivorous worms such as priapulids; and (3) concentric aggregates, typically with a central nucleus (e. g., remains of medusoid eldoniids or bivalved arthropod carapaces) and peripheral exoskeletal fragments, possibly generated by bottom currents whirling around carcasses. These new coprolite data add to morphofunctional information obtained from fossil organisms and indicate that predation occurred {{at different levels of}} the water column with: (1) endobenthic predators (diverse priapulid fauna) feeding near the sediment-water interface; (2) epibenthic predators/scavengers (almost exclusively arthropods); (3) predators living in the lower levels of the water <b>column</b> (<b>e.</b> g., anomalocaridids); and (4) mid-water predators exploiting upper levels in the water <b>column</b> (<b>e.</b> g., eldoniids, ctenophores, chaetognaths). Communities living at or close to the water-sediment interface (epibenthic sensu stricto, meiobenthic, and demersal animals) were exposed to a multidirectional predatorial pressure from infaunal, epifaunal, and mid-water predators. Although predation was diverse, nothing indicates that the food chain extended beyond the level of primary carnivores. Animals already had acquired complex behaviors such as hunting (e. g., anomalocaridids, priapulids) and predator avoidance in which sensory systems were involved. The example of theMaotianshan Shale indicates that the burst of anatomical innovations (new body plans) that characterizes the early Cambrian alsowas accompanied by the rapid development of new feeding strategies and by an unprecedented expansion of ecological interactions (prey-predator relationships) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} field observations in Squaw Creek watershed, located in central Iowa, {{to investigate the}} impact of a heavy rain event (rainfall of 71 mm in 24 h) on E. coli levels in the streambed sediment and overlying water. We assessed relationships between streamflow and E. coli and nutrient levels in the water column and streambed sediment. The results showed that during a heavy rain event, E. coli levels in the water column varied considerably, ranging from 360 to 37, 553 CFU per 100 mL with a mean of 7, 598 CFU per 100 mL. Elevated streamflow resulted in greater levels of E. coli in the water column. Streambed sediment E. coli levels ranged from 896 to 6, 577 CFU per 100 g with a mean of 3, 355 CFU per 100 g. Regression analysis found exponential relationships between streamflow and E. coli levels in the water column (R 2 = 0. 56) and between streamflow and E. coli levels in the streambed sediment (R 2 = 0. 45). R 2 values of the exponential relationship between streamflow and water <b>column</b> <b>E.</b> coli levels increased considerably when regressions for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph were performed separately (R 2 = 0. 64 and 0. 94, respectively). The exponential relationship between total suspended solids (TSS) and water <b>column</b> <b>E.</b> coli levels yielded an R 2 of 0. 38, while TSS and streamflow yielded an exponential relationship with an R 2 of 0. 64. The results presented here provide information on in-stream bacteria dynamics of an agricultural watershed during the first heavy rain of the season. We anticipate that the results will improve the understanding of in-stream E. coli transport during rain events and provide insight for policy makers to allocate E. coli loads in impaired water bodies...|$|E
