5|$|During the 1974 {{legislative}} session, Ford {{proposed a}} six-year study of <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> and gasification {{in response to}} the 1973 oil crisis. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
5|$|Attacks on airfields and {{transportation}} infrastructure in southern Japan continued {{until the end}} of the war. By this time the Fifth Air Force's bombers had flown 138 sorties against airfields in Kyushu and the Seventh Air Force had conducted a further 784. Road and railway bridges were attacked by both fighters and bombers, and the city of Kagoshima was frequently bombed. Seventh Air Force B-24 Liberators also bombed the railway terminals in the port of Nagasaki on 31July and 1August. While these raids were focused on tactical targets, the Okinawa-based aircraft made several strategic attacks against industrial facilities; these included an unsuccessful raid on a <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> plant at Ōmuta on 7August. Bombers of the Fifth and Seventh Air Forces also made firebombing attacks against Tarumizu on 5August, Kumamoto on 10August and Kurume the next day. The FEAF staged its last attacks against Japan on 12August; aircraft were dispatched on 14August but recalled while en route to their targets. Overall, the two air forces flew 6,435 sorties against targets in Kyushu during July and August for the loss of 43 aircraft to Japanese anti-aircraft guns and fighters.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chlorobenzene}} and other non-polar solvent treatments on liquefaction behaviour are extremely varied and depend both upon the <b>coal</b> and <b>liquefaction</b> regime used. The treatments {{give rise to}} significant, but non-uniform, conformational changes in the macromolecular structure of bituminous coals. Solvent swelling, NMR and vitrinite reflectance measurements have indicated {{that the increase in}} microporosity is accompanied by the formation of additional hydrogen-bonds, with aromatic moieties possibly being less ordered...|$|R
50|$|Coal seam gas {{extraction}} within the Surat and Bowen Basins of Queensland, Australia {{forms the basis}} of the company's main operations. QGC has constructed an <b>coalbed</b> methane <b>liquefaction</b> plant on Curtis Island off the coast of Gladstone in Central Queensland. The company has built a 540 km, 42 in diameter pipeline from Miles to Gladstone, making it the longest buried pipeline of its type in Australia. Work was delayed after QGC was found to have contravened state environmental laws.|$|R
50|$|Other {{forms of}} {{conventional}} energy resources {{are also being}} used in new ways. <b>Coal</b> gasification and <b>liquefaction</b> are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that oil reserves, at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived. See alternative fuels.|$|R
25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not {{to be dependent on}} foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half of}} 2009, the <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic fuel, created via <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction,</b> {{requires}} no engine modifications {{for use in}} standard automobiles. As a byproduct of oil embargoes during Apartheid in South Africa, Sasol, using the Fischer-Tropsch process, developed relatively low-cost coal-based fuel. Currently, about 30% of South Africa's transport-fuel (mostly diesel) is produced from coal. With crude-oil prices above US$40 per barrel, this process is now cost-effective.|$|E
25|$|For example, China and India are {{currently}} heavily investing in {{natural gas and}} <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> facilities. Nigeria is working on burning natural gas to produce electricity instead of simply flaring the gas, where all non-emergency gas flaring will be forbidden after 2008. Outside the U.S., more than 50% of oil is consumed for stationary, non-transportation purposes such as electricity production where it {{is relatively easy to}} substitute natural gas for oil.|$|E
40|$|The {{elimination}} of lead from used motor oils is performed by ultrasonic lixiviation using nitric acid, the lead being recuperated as lead sulfate during the acid regeneration. Beside {{the treatment of}} waste oils by the traditional methods, this new processing way gives alternative routes, not used usually for waste oils, such as introduction through the blowpipes of a blast furnace, addition to the coal in coke oven plants, coprocessing with <b>coal</b> in <b>liquefaction</b> or gasification plants, or even in copyrolysis with coal.

40|$|Liquefaction {{experiments}} were undertaken using subbituminous Black Thunder mine coal {{to observe the}} effects of aqueous SO{sub 2 } coal beneficiation {{and the introduction of}} various coal swelling solvents and catalyst precursors. Aqueous SO{sub 2 } beneficiation of Black Thunder coal removed alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, increased the sulfur content and increased the catalytic liquefaction conversion to THF solubles compared to untreated Black Thunder <b>coal.</b> The <b>liquefaction</b> solvent had varying effects on coal conversion, depending upon the type of solvent added. The hydrogen donor solvent, dihydroanthracene, was most effective, while a coal-derived Wilsonville solvent promoted more coal conversion than did relatively inert 1 -methylnaphthalene. Swelling of coal with hydrogen bonding solvents tetrahydrofuran (THF), isopropanol, and methanol, prior to reaction resulted in increased noncatalytic conversion of both untreated and SO{sub 2 } treated Black Thunder coals, while dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which was absorbed more into the coal than any other swelling solvent, was detrimental to coal conversion. Swelling of SO{sub 2 } treated <b>coal</b> before <b>liquefaction</b> resulted in the highest coal conversions; however, the untreated coal showed the most improvements in catalytic reactions when swelled in either THF, isopropanol, or methanol prior to liquefaction. The aprotic solvent DMSO was detrimental to coal conversion...|$|R

25|$|It {{serves as}} an {{important}} reaction in both <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> and gas to liquids technology {{as well as many}} other chemical processes aimed at producing compounds based on hydrocarbon chains. It works by combining carbon monoxide and hydrogen that are produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass in a process known as gasification, and the Fischer–Tropsch process then turns these gases into a synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel. The Fischer–Tropsch process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø {{established}} a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, although it only remained in operation until 1924. Production {{rose through the}} 1920, reaching a peak 99,000 tonnes per year. <b>Coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> was attempted from 1924 to 1927, but proved unprofitable. The labor union, Kings Bay Arbeiderforening, was founded in 1925, {{although many of the}} workers had previously ad-hoc organized themselves. In 1919 Northern Exploration Company laid pressed that they had claims on Blomstrandhalvøya. The case ended with the Government of Norway buying their claims in 1925, parts of which were sold to Kings Bay.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Trade and Industry {{carried out}} {{geological}} surveys in 1922 and renewed the purchase agreement.

The identified deficiencies fall into the same few categories for all processes considered. These categories are presented with associated physical parameters found in the various processes studied. Development of instruments to meet these deficiencies is recommended along with development of control valves and optimal control schemes in order to assure the possibility of automatic control of the large scale coal conversion and combustion systems...|$|R
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} iron-containing {{magnetic}} ionic liquids (ILs), including imidazole-based, pyridine-based, and pyrrolidine-based ILs, were synthesized respectively, and {{were used to}} dissolve <b>coal</b> direct <b>liquefaction</b> residues (CDLR) to obtain asphaltene fractions under the conditions of given time, temperature, and mass ratio of ILs to CDLR. The extracts from CDLR were characterized by ultimate analysis, proximate analysis, FT-IR, and C- 13 NMR. The results show that physicochemical properties of the extracts obtained with different magnetic ILs consisting of different cationic rings are different, and pyridine-based magnetic IL is an effective extractant to extract asphaltenes from CDLR among the three magnetic ILs. The extracts might be good precursors for preparing high-value-added carbon materials because of their higher carbon content, lower H/C, and ash content...|$|R
25|$|Coal {{can also}} be {{converted}} into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> and its future potential is available.|$|E
25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present U.S. use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. <b>Coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coal</b> (by <b>liquefaction</b> technology) {{is one of}} the {{backstop}} {{resources that}} could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel, with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to oil sand projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.|$|R

40|$|Coal is a complex, {{heterogeneous}} solid {{that includes}} interdispersed mineral matter. However, knowledge of organic-mineral matter interactions is embryonic, {{and the impact}} of these interactions on <b>coal</b> pyrolysis and <b>liquefaction</b> is incomplete. Clay minerals, for example, are known to be effective catalysts for organic reactions. Furthermore, clays such as montmorillonite have been proposed to be key catalysts in the thermal alteration of lignin into vitrinite during the coalification process. Recent studies by Hatcher and coworkers on the evolution of coalified woods using microscopy and NMR have led them to propose selective, acid-catalyzed, solid state reaction chemistry to account for retained structural integrity in the wood. However, the chemical feasibility of such reactions in relevant solids is difficult to demonstrate. The authors have begun a model compound study to gain a better molecular level understanding of the effects in the solid state of organic-mineral matter interactions relevant to both coal formation and processing. To satisfy the need for model compounds that remain nonvolatile solids at temperatures ranging to 450 C, model compounds are employed that are chemically bound to the surface of a fumed silica (Si-O-C{sub aryl}linkage). The organic structures currently under investigation are phenethyl phenyl ether (C{sub 6 }H{sub 5 }CH{sub 2 }CH{sub 2 }OC{sub 6 }H{sub 5 }) derivatives, which serve as models for {beta}-alkyl aryl ether units that are present in lignin and lignitic coals. The solid-state chemistry of these materials at 200 [...] 450 C in the presence of interdispersed acid catalysts such as small particle size silica-aluminas and montmorillonite clay will be reported. Initial focus will be on defining the potential impact of these interactions on <b>coal</b> pyrolysis and <b>liquefaction...</b>|$|R
