5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most <b>common,</b> the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most <b>common</b> berry plant is lingonberry; <b>common</b> bilberry and bog bilberry are also <b>common,</b> but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were <b>common</b> throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants <b>common</b> in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are <b>common</b> in the capital, {{including}} smooth newts {{living by}} the Tate Modern, and <b>common</b> frogs, <b>common</b> toads, palmate newts and great crested newts.

5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are <b>common,</b> {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. <b>Common</b> heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park.

The house sparrow, <b>common</b> starling, and <b>common</b> blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are <b>common</b> and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, the <b>common</b> law {{courts were}} {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than the <b>common</b> law courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the <b>common</b> law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of the <b>common</b> law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old <b>common</b> law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the <b>Common</b> Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the <b>Common</b> Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three <b>Common</b> Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Commons</b> concept, {{developed}} in the early 1990 ’s, has evolved over time, taking different shapes and involving different resources and services as it has evolved, including the Information <b>Commons,</b> the Learning <b>Commons,</b> the Library <b>Commons</b> and the Research <b>Commons.</b> There are numerous similarities among the various iterations of the <b>Commons</b> and some clear differences.
