5|$|Release of The X-Files seasons on Blu-ray, {{restored}} in high-definition, {{was rumored to}} begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first-season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high-definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of The X-Files in high definition, marking {{the first time that}} the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu-ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the wrong fonts for the title sequence and season 8 was affected by <b>color</b> <b>balance</b> issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes. These issues let to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct <b>color</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In color science, {{chromatic}} adaptation is {{the estimation of}} the representation of an object under a different light source from {{the one in which}} it was recorded. A common application is to find a {{chromatic adaptation}} transform (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral (<b>color</b> <b>balance),</b> while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
25|$|Filters on {{a camera}} lens, or color gels over the light source(s) {{may be used}} to correct <b>color</b> <b>balance.</b> When {{shooting}} with a bluish light (high color temperature) source such as on an overcast day, in the shade, in window light, or if using tungsten film with white or blue light, a yellowish-orange filter will correct this. For shooting with daylight film (calibrated to 5600K) under warmer (low color temperature) light sources such as sunsets, candlelight or tungsten lighting, a bluish (e.g. #80A) filter may be used. More-subtle filters are needed to correct for the difference between, say 3200K and 3400K tungsten lamps or to correct for the slightly blue cast of some flash tubes, which may be 6000K.|$|E
50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>balancing</b> {{an image}} affects {{not only the}} neutrals, but other colors as well.

It is also technically important for basis imagery of geographic information acquiring and geographic information product updating. This paper mainly focuses on one key technique of mosaicking, <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> for wide range Remote Sensing imagery. Due to huge amount of data, large covering rage, great variety of climate and geographical condition, <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> for wide range remote sensing imagery is a difficult problem. In this paper we use Ecogeographic regionalization to divide the large area into several regions based on terrains and climatic data, construct the algorithmic framework of a <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> method according to the regionalization result, which conduct from region edge to center to fit wide range imagery mosaicking. The experimental results with wide range HJ- 1 dataset show that our method can significantly improve {{the wide range of}} remote sensing imagery <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> effects: making images well-proportioned mosaicking and better in keeping images' original information. In summary, this <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> method based on regionalization could be a good solution for nationwide remote sensing image <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> and mosaicking...|$|R

25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the <b>color,</b> <b>balance</b> and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking.|$|E
500|$|When the europium-doped yttrium {{orthovanadate}} red phosphor {{was discovered}} in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause {{a revolution in the}} color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain <b>color</b> <b>balance.</b> With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors.

2500|$|Color balance: Additionally, as the OLED {{material}} used {{to produce}} blue light degrades significantly more rapidly than the materials that produce other colors, blue light output will decrease relative to the other colors of light. This variation in the differential color output will change the <b>color</b> <b>balance</b> of the display and is much more noticeable than a decrease in overall luminance. This can be avoided partially by adjusting <b>color</b> <b>balance,</b> but this may require advanced control circuits and interaction with the user, which is unacceptable for users. More commonly, though, manufacturers optimize {{the size of the}} R, G and B subpixels to reduce the current density through the subpixel in order to equalize lifetime at full luminance. [...] For example, a blue subpixel may be 100% larger than the green subpixel. The red subpixel may be 10% smaller than the green.|$|E

40|$|Automatic <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> {{approaches}} for different applications {{have been studied}} by different research communities in the past decade. However, {{in this paper we}} address <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> for the purpose of change detection. Images of a scene taken at different times may have variations in lighting and structural content. For such multitemporal images, an ideal color correction approach should be effective at transferring the color palette of the source image to the target image for the unchanged areas while being able to transfer the global color characteristics for the changed area without creating visual artifacts. Towards this goal, we propose a new local <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> approach that uses adaptive windowing. We evaluated the proposed method against other state-of-the-art ones using a database consisting of aerial image pairs. The test image pairs were taken at different times, under different lighting conditions, and with different scene geometries and camera positions. On this database, our proposed approach outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Photographic {{emulsion}} film sometimes {{appears to}} exaggerate {{the color of the}} light, as it does not respond to lighting color in the way human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white {{may turn out to be}} very blue or orange in a photograph. The <b>color</b> <b>balance</b> may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral color print. [...] The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the [...] "wrong" [...] light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger. [...] Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.|$|E

50|$|In {{photography}} and image processing, <b>color</b> <b>balance</b> is the global adjustment of {{the intensities of}} the colors (typically red, green, and blue primary colors). An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors - particularly neutral colors - correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called gray balance, neutral balance, or white balance. <b>Color</b> <b>balance</b> changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for color correction.

40|$|<b>Color</b> <b>balancing</b> is an {{important}} domain {{in the field of}} photography and imaging. Its use is necessitated because of the color inconsistencies that arise due to a number of factors before and after capturing an image. Any deviation from the original color of a scene is an irregularity which is dealt with <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques. Images may deviate from their accurate representation because of different illuminant ambient conditions, non-linear behavior of the camera sensors, the conversion of file format from a wider color gamut of raw camera format to a file format with a narrower color gamut and so on. Many approaches exist to correct the color inconsistencies. One of the basic techniques is to do a histogram equalization to increase the contrast in an image by utilizing the whole dynamic range of the brightness values. To remove color casts introduced due to false illuminant selection at the time of image capture many white balancing techniques exist. The white balancing can be employed before image capture right in the camera using hardware filters with dials to set illuminant conditions in the scene. A lot of research has been done regarding the effectiveness of white balancing after image capture. The choice of color space and the file format is quite important to consider before white balancing. Another side to <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> is <b>color</b> transfer whereby the image statistics of one image are transferred to another image. Histogram matching is quite widely used to match the histogram of a source image to that of a target. Other statistics for color transfer are to match the mean and standard deviation of a source image to a target image. These two approaches for color transfer are analyzed and tested in this thesis on images displaying the same scene but with different color casts. Color transfer matching {{the means and standard deviations}} is selected because of its superior <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> and ease of implementation. While a lot of <b>color</b> <b>balancing</b> work has been done in 2 D images, no significant work is done in the 3 D domain. There exist 3 D scanners which scan a scene to build its 3 D model. The 3 D equivalent of the 2 D pixel is a scan point which is obtained by reflecting a laser beam from a point in a scene. Hundreds of thousands of such points make up a single scan which displays the scene that was in the view of the 3 D scanner. Because a single scan cannot capture scene behind obstructions or the scenes out of the scanners’ range, more than one scans are undertaken from different positions and time. More than one scans grouped together make up a data structure called a point cloud. Due to these changes in position and time, luminance conditions alter. As a result the scan points from different scans representing the same scene show a considerably different <b>color</b> cast. <b>Color</b> <b>balancing</b> by matching the means and standard deviation is applied on the point cloud. The color inconsistencies such as sharp color gradients between points of different scans, the presence of stray color streaks from one scan into another are greatly reduced. The results are quite appealing as the resulting point clouds show a smooth gradient between different scans...|$|R
