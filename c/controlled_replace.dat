Cadillac engineers retuned body mounts and structure for a smoother, quieter, ride. For straight, fade-resistant stopping power, four-wheel disc brakes were standard.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{stabilizing}} {{the position of}} a ball on a straight beam is a common element of laboratory courses in <b>control.</b> <b>Replacing</b> the straight beam with a circular beam and moving the center of rotation off of the beam produces a harder control problem. This experiment was developed here at UMCP by Sheng, Renner, and Levine [1]. They designed and implemented a stabilizing controller based on a linearized model of the plant and an LQR optimal regulator. Here, the set of initial states that is stabilizable is explored. Also, nonlinear controls based on ideas from feedback linearization and backstepping are developed...|$|R

The Flash-Matic used directional flashlight in the transmitter device, and photo cells in the television set itself. One of the major shortcomings of this technology was that if the television set was exposed to direct sunlight, it could inadvertently trigger one of the remote control functions. The company president sent the engineers {{back to the drawing}} board to come up with a better solution.|$|R
