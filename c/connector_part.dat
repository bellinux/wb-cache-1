Here {{we present}} {{a model of a}} subtype of {{one-line}} jokes (not puns) that describes the relationship between the <b>connector</b> (<b>part</b> of the setup) and the disjunctor (often called the punchline). This relationship {{is at the heart of}} what makes this common type of joke humorous. We have implemented this model in a system, DisS (Disjunctor Selector), which, given a joke set-up, can select the best disjunctor from a list of alternatives. DisS agrees with human judges on the best disjunctor for one typical joke, and we are currently testing it on other jokes of the same sub-type. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{replication}} of the ϕ 29 bacteriophage inside a bacterial host cell, a DNA packaging motor transports the viral DNA into the procapsid against a pressure difference {{of up to}} 40 ± 20 atm. Several models have been proposed for the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we have used molecular dynamics simulations to examine {{the role of the}} <b>connector</b> <b>part</b> of the motor, and specifically the one-way revolution and the push-roll model. We have focused at the structure and intermolecular interactions between the DNA and the connector, for which a near-complete structure is available. The connector is found to induce considerable DNA deformations with respect to its canonical B-form. We further assessed by force-probe simulations to which extent the connector is able to prevent DNA leakage and found that the connector can act as a partial one-way valve by a check-valve mechanism via its mobile loops. Analysis of the geometry, flexibility, and energetics of channel lysine residues suggested that this arrangement of residues is incompatible with the observed DNA packaging step-size of ∼ 2. 5  bp, such that the step-size is probably determined by the other components of the motor. Previously proposed DNA revolution and rolling motions inside the connector channel are both found implausible due to structural entanglement between the DNA and connector loops that have not been resolved in the crystal structure. Rather, in the simulations, the connector facilitates minor DNA rotation during the packaging process compatible with recent optical-tweezers experiments. Combined with the available experimental data, our simulation results suggest that the connector acts as a check-valve that prevents DNA leakage and induces DNA compression and rotation during DNA packaging...|$|E

40|$|A {{morphing}} {{trailing edge}} flap system for wind turbine blades The development of a morphing trailing edge system for wind turbines, also called a flap system, is presented. The functionality is simple as the flap deflection is controlled by pressurized air or a fluid {{in a number of}} voids in the flap made of an elastic material. It is thus a robust system as no mechanical or metal parts are used. The prototypes tested in the laboratory and on a blade section in a wind tunnel in the period from 2007 - 2010 demonstrated the functionality and the aerodynamic performance of the flap concept. In a recent research and development project INDUFLAP from 2011 - 2014 the flap system has been further developed in corporation with the industrial partners Hydratech Industries (DK) and Rehau (DE). A new {{trailing edge flap}} design with spanwise voids (channels) and with a chord of 15 cm suitable for a 1 m chord blade section was developed. It was then manufactured by extrusion and glued together with a load carrying part with a <b>connector</b> <b>part</b> that allows an easy attachment on the blade section. After tests in the laboratory the flap was mounted on a 2 m long blade section mounted on a newly developed test rig. A 10 m long boom with the blade section was installed on a 100 kW turbine hub where the original blades were taken down. It means that the flap system was tested under realistic rotating conditions with real atmospheric turbulent inflow and with a g loading up to 10 g which represents the conditions on the outer part of a MW turbine blade. The measured performance of the flap system shows that 3 deg. flap deflection gives the same lift change as 1 deg. pitch of the whole blade section...|$|E
40|$|A {{computerized}} interactive harness engineering {{program has}} been developed to provide an inexpensive, interactive system which is designed for learning and using an engineering approach to interconnection systems. PCACE is basically a database system that stores information as files of individual connectors and handles wiring information in circuit groups stored as records. This directly emulates the typical manual engineering methods of data handling, thus making the user interface to the program very natural. Data files can be created, viewed, manipulated, or printed in real time. The printed ouput is in a form ready for use by fabrication and engineering personnel. PCACE also contains {{a wide variety of}} error-checking routines including connector contact checks during hardcopy generation. The user may edit existing harness data files or create new files. In creating a new file, the user is given the opportunity to insert all the connector and harness boiler plate data which would be part of a normal connector wiring diagram. This data includes the following: 1) connector reference designator, 2) <b>connector</b> <b>part</b> number, 3) backshell part number, 4) cable reference designator, 5) cable part number, 6) drawing revision, 7) relevant notes, 8) standard wire gauge, and 9) maximum circuit count. Any item except the maximum circuit count may be left blank, and any item may be changed at a later time. Once a file is created and organized, the user is directed to the main menu and has access to the file boiler plate, the circuit wiring records, and the wiring records index list. The organization of a file is such that record zero contains the connector/cable boiler plate, and all other records contain circuit wiring data. Each wiring record will handle a circuit with as many as nine wires in the interface. The record stores the circuit name and wire count and the following data for each wire: 1) wire identifier, 2) contact, 3) splice, 4) wire gauge if different from standard, 5) wire/group type, 6) wire destination, and 7) note number. The PCACE record structure allows {{for a wide variety of}} wiring forms using splices and shields, yet retains sufficient structure to maintain ease of use. PCACE is written in TURBO Pascal 3. 0 and has been implemented on IBM PC, XT, and AT systems under DOS 3. 1 with a memory of 512 K of 8 bit bytes, two floppy disk drives, an RGB monitor, and a printer with ASCII control characters. PCACE was originally developed in 1983, and the IBM version was released in 1986...|$|E

50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of <b>connector</b> <b>parts</b> that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|Automated visual {{inspection}} systems are an indispensable component of modern manufacturing processes. A machine visual system eliminates any errors related to human fatigue and accommodates increases in production without increasing {{the long term}} cost. In this thesis a machine-based {{visual inspection}} system for cardiac pacing and defibrillation leads was developed and tested. The main objective {{of this research is}} to develop the methods and algorithms necessary to inspect dimensions of cardiac pacing and defibrillation lead connectors. To create the inspection vision system it is necessary to select a proper illumination technique, camera, lenses and image processing algorithm. This thesis presents the design of such a vision system for the dimension inspection of the connector of a particular lead. In the algorithms, pattern recognition is used over filtered images to identify connector features. The connector dimensions are checked to corroborate that they comply with the ISO standard. To determine the error percentage we measure each connector with a caliper and compared those values with the ones given by the vision system. The error percentage values are between 0 % and 13 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the French concessive {{connectors}} "pourtant", "cependant", "quand même", "tout de même", "néanmoins" and "toutefois" with a group of Swedish concessive counterparts, namely "ändå", "i alla fall", "dock" and "emellertid". The analysis is based on a translation corpus comprising nine French novels and nine Swedish novels and their translations into Swedish and French, respectively. All the novels were published between 1992 and 2000. It is argued that by contrasting the French concessive connectors with a corresponding set of Swedish connectors, new insights can be gained which are difficult to obtain by a monolingual approach. Although the main focus of the study is on the French connectors, the study is also meant to improve our understanding of the Swedish concessive <b>connectors.</b> <b>Part</b> 1 of the study presents an outline of the theoretical framework. First of all, a tertium comparationis or common denominator is defined for all the connectors. The tertium comparationis is then used as a basic function in the descriptive model applied in the analysis of the connectors. The descriptive model is divided into three levels of discourse: the propositional, the textual and the interpersonal level. The basic function belongs to the propositional level and can be described as a concessive relation between propositional contents (e. g. "Il pleut". "Pourtant il sort"). At the textual level, the connectors establish a relation between adjacent speech acts (e. g. "Je sais bien qu’il pleut, mais sortez quand même") or between thematic segments. Finally, the relations on the interpersonal level concern the communicative situation and the attitudes of the interlocutors (e. g. "C’est quand même bizarre"). Part 2 of the study is concerned with the description of the functions and individual features of the French <b>connectors,</b> while <b>part</b> 3 deals with the Swedish counterparts. All the analyses are organised in the same way, beginning with a presentation of prior work followed by a contrastive analysis of the examples drawn from the French-Swedish corpus, going from source text to translation. The final part of the study (part 4) comprises bidirectional analyses of the French and Swedish connectors. This means that the connectors are analysed in both directions simultaneously, from original text to translation and from translation to original text...|$|R
