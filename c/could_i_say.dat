5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had {{asked him how he}} was going to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E

6000|$|Well, Sir, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> I {{knew well}} enough {{that there was}} not a tittle of solid {{evidence}} against the man Nicolet, nor had I the power to move the police of His Majesty the King from their decision. In my heart of hearts I had the firm conviction that the ginger-polled ruffian knew all about Carissimo and all about the present whereabouts of that rascal Theodore.

5000|$|Mohanraj's writing {{frequently}} explores {{issues of}} cultural identity. She has noted in interviews {{that she feels}} the complexity of such issues in her own life: [...] "When people ask me what my identity is, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I'm Sri Lankan-American ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was raised Catholic but now I'm agnostic. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I've been called a queer, because although I've been with a man the past 17 years, I'm bisexual." [...] She is also something of a sexuality activist; she founded and moderates the Internet Erotica Writers' Workshop, and was a former moderator for soc.sexuality.general.|$|R
