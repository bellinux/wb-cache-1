40|$|Dorsoventral (D/V) {{patterning}} in Drosophila oogenesis is {{initiated by}} the transmission of a TGF-α-like ligand, Gurken (Grk), from the oocyte to the anterodorsal follicle cells, activating the EGF receptor (Egfr) signaling pathway. The zinc-finger transcription factor CF 2 is a negative regulator of the rhomboid (rho) gene that encodes an essential membrane-bound component of the dorsalizing pathway. Expression of CF 2 itself is negatively regulated by the activated Egfr. In this report, we demonstrate that CF 2 is the target of down-regulation by the MAPK kinase cascade, and that this down-regulation is independent of the Rho function. These results suggest that D/V patterning involves a two-step signaling process: the initial Egfr signal, which represses CF 2 and induces rho expression; and the subsequent Egfr[*]+[*]Rho signal, which determines the dorsal cell fates. Furthermore, we show that CF 2 down-regulation occurs at the post-translational level through a mechanism involving <b>coupled</b> cytoplasmic <b>retention</b> and degradation...|$|R

Particular attention {{is given to}} the effect of saturation processes applied under a constant total state of stress. For the sake of generality, multiple failure mechanisms are considered and are interpreted in the light of a unified theoretical framework. The analyses rely on the scheme of infinite slope and on the use of a coupled hydro-mechanical constitutive model. Simple shear test simulations are used to investigate the role of stress anisotropy, initial suction and soil properties. The simulations show that the predicted mechanism of activation depends on the material constants that reproduce the <b>coupling</b> between <b>retention</b> properties and stress-strain behavior. These constants affect the magnitude of the triggering perturbations and can play a relevant role in collapsible/liquefiable deposits.

We present evidence that while a low permittivity interfacial layer forms between the Pt electrode and PZT films, this does not occur in PMZT. We propose that Mn dopants are able to reduce oxygen vacancy mobility in PZT films and Mn 2 + ions consume the oxygen vacancies generated during repeated switching, forming Mn 4 + ions.

The Pentagon {{is planning to}} gradually increase the Navy's SEAL force {{over the next several}} years to meet increasing global demands. The move was authorized by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in a program decision memorandum (PDM) in December 2002. The PDM, which directed the growth of Special Operations Forces across the board, called on the Navy to bring the equivalent of two new SEAL Teams to the force between FY- 06 and FY- 08. Even though funding has been allotted to this task, there may not be enough manpower to fill these slots. Training issues <b>coupled</b> with <b>retention</b> issues have brought the growth process to a standstill. The purpose of this thesis is to identify which major variables and/or combinations of small variables need to be changed in order to increase NSW enlisted SEAL manning. The three major areas that will be looked at are recruitment, training, and retention. The focus will be to determine where NSW can do better at managing personnel in these areas. The end product will be a detailed analysis that will offer suggestions for program changes that can be implemented to increase NSW forces while raising the quality of operators at the same time.

In all, we studied 14 di¡erent genotypes, plus a control strain which was not mutated. Most genotypes showed CA during 200 genera-tions of experimental evolution, where we de¢ne CA as a ¢tness increase which is disproportionately large relative to that in evolving control lines, <b>coupled</b> with <b>retention</b> of the original deleterious mutation(s).

CAwas faster for synergistic than for multiplicative pairs, presumably because the marginal gain which results from CA for one of the component mutations is greater in that case. The most surprising result in our view, is that compensation should be so readily achieved in an organism which is haploid and has little genetic redundancy.

40|$|An acidophilic {{xylanase}} of Aureobasidium pullulans (XAPI) was recombinantly produced, characterised and its functionality in bread making {{compared with}} that of Bacillus subtilis Xyn A xylanase (XBS), an enzyme frequently used in bread making. Prominent characteristics of XAPI were its high specific activity towards arabinoxylan (AX), its relative preference for hydrolysis of water-unextractable AX (WU-AX), its optimal activity under acidic conditions and its sensitivity towards TAXI (Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor) and XIP (xylanase inhibiting protein). Optimally developed dough containing XAPI had a considerably drier feel after mixing and was less sticky after fermentation than dough treated with XBS. Both xylanases improved bread loaf volume by 24 % under the conditions of the process. In spite of the higher dosage of XAPI necessary to obtain this result, the similar loaf volume increase coincided with less solubilisation of WU-AX and even lesser degradation of solubilised AX (S-AX) and water-extractable AX (WE-AX) by XAPI than by XBS during the bread making process. This is probably due to different dynamics and extent of xylanase inhibition in the dough matrix for both xylanases. AX solubilisation by the acidophilic XAPI was not boosted by the drop in pH in the dough during fermentation. Results show that significant bread loaf volume increase {{goes hand in hand with}} excellent dough properties when a limited solubilisation of WU-AX during mixing is <b>coupled</b> to <b>retention</b> of a high molecular mass of S-AX and WE-AX during the rest of the process.

It is clearly shown that higher order differential terms must be included in the governing equations of diffusion and propagation to represent the temporary retention effect. Specifically third and fourth order terms are associated to the retention effect in propagation and diffusion processes respectively. Control parameters regulating the relative influence of the diffusion and the retention terms in the governing equations come up naturally from the analysis.

Uptake of all compounds occurred in darkness, but was frequently enhanced under natural illumination. The photosystem 2 inhibitor, 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethyl urea (DCMU) generally failed to inhibit light-stimulated DOM uptake. Occasionally, light plus DCMU-amended treatments led to uptake rates higher than light-incubated samples, possibly due to phototrophic bacteria present in subsurface anoxic layers. Uptake was similar with either 3 H- or 14 C-labeled substrates, indicating that recycling of labeled CO 2 via photosynthetic fixation was not interfering with measurements of light-stimulated DOM uptake. Microautoradiographs showed a variety of pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria and, to a lesser extent, cyanobacteria and eucaryotic microalgae involved in light-mediated DOM uptake.

Samples were compacted on the dry side of optimum to cover a wide range of compaction water contents and vertical stresses. Three water content regions were identified in the compaction plane depending on whether post-compaction suction increased, decreased or remained constant as the degree of saturation was increased at constant water content. Hydraulic paths of specimens subjected to loading-unloading cycles at constant water content have clearly shown that post-compaction suction may increase as the degree of saturation increases.

Furthermore, in-stream retention and removal grew from 14 to 27  Tg N yr − 1 and 3 to 5  Tg P yr − 1. One of the major causes of increased retention is the growing number of reservoirs, which now account for 24 and 22  % of global N and P retention/removal in freshwater systems, respectively. This increase in nutrient retention could not balance the increase in nutrient delivery to rivers with the consequence that river nutrient transport to the ocean increased from 19 to 37  Tg N yr − 1 and from 2 to 4  Tg P yr − 1. Human activities have also led to a global increase in the molar N : P ratio in freshwater bodies...|$|R

Nitriles are {{precursors}} {{of important}} amides and organic acids (e. g. acrylamide, nicotinamide, mandelic acid and acrylic acid) which are used, inter alia, as food additives, in plasticisers, detergents, make-up, medicine and as chemical intermediates {{in the production}} of various important polymers. Traditionally, chemical processes are used to convert nitriles to amides and organic acids but these processes are non-specific causing various by-products to form. Chemical processes are also environmentally unfriendly and require harsh conditions. Nitrile conversions through an enzymatic route, on the other hand, have the distinct advantages of excellent chemo-, regio- and stereo selectivities, mild process conditions and reduced downstream processing costs. The enzymatic process is mediated via an initial nitrilase catalysed conversion to amide, followed by an amidase catalysed conversion to acid. This research focused on {{the latter part of the}} enzymatic transformation of nitriles, which is the amidase catalysed biotransformation of an amide to an acid, specifically with respect to the development of a membrane immobilised amidase continuous process which has the major advantage of enzyme <b>retention</b> <b>coupled</b> with product separation. The research was conducted in three parts namely the characterisation of the free amidase, the development of the experimental bioreactor system and the quantification of the membrane immobilised amidase process...|$|R
40|$|Sulfatase {{modifying factor}} 1 (SUMF 1) encodes for the formylglicine {{generating}} enzyme, which activates sulfatases by modifying a key cysteine residue within their catalytic domains. SUMF 1 is mutated in patients affected by multiple sulfatase deficiency, a rare recessive disorder {{in which all}} sulfatase activities are impaired. Despite the absence of canonical retention/retrieval signals, SUMF 1 is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it exerts its enzymatic activity on nascent sulfatases. Part of SUMF 1 is secreted and paracrinally taken up by distant cells. Here we show that SUMF 1 interacts with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ERp 44, two thioredoxin family members residing in the early secretory pathway, and with ERGIC- 53, a lectin that shuttles between the ER and the Golgi. Functional assays reveal that these interactions are crucial for controlling SUMF 1 traffic and function. PDI <b>couples</b> SUMF 1 <b>retention</b> and activation in the ER. ERGIC- 53 and ERp 44 act downstream, favoring SUMF 1 export from and retrieval to the ER, respectively. Silencing ERGIC- 53 causes proteasomal degradation of SUMF 1, while down-regulating ERp 44 promotes its secretion. When over-expressed, each of three interactors favors intracellular accumulation. Our results reveal a multistep control of SUMF 1 trafficking, with sequential interactions dynamically determining ER localization, activity and secretion...|$|R
40|$|Restorative {{dentistry}} {{has undergone}} an important paradigm shift {{during the last}} two decades. Due to increased emphasis on preserving healthy tooth tissue the early concept of amalgam and cast restorations based on macro-mechanical <b>retention</b> <b>coupled</b> with inevitable tissue lost was replaced by the philosophy of minimally invasive dentistry. The introduction of predictable adhesive technologies has made this concept achievable. An adhesive tooth restorative technique enables diseased or lost tooth tissue be replaced by adhering the restorative material directly to the remaining sound tooth tissue. Due to their improved esthetic qualities, strength and wear resistance, resin composites are nowadays the restorative materials of first choice for replacement of lost natural tissues. It is generally accepted, that polymerization shrinkage of resin composite is a still unsolved problem in clinical dentistry. Therefore, the main objective of this project was to evaluate selective properties of a new low shrinking composite and to compare them with commonly used ones. This thesis mainly focuses on the influence of the low polymerization shrinkage and shrinkage stress formation on the marginal adaptation. The other factors such as different adhesive application protocols, different adhesive system combinations and dentinal fluid simulation in relation to the marginal adaptation are studied as well. Furthermore, the staining susceptibility of a Silorane resin composite is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{generally}} recognized that unsaturated soil behavior is governed by two constitutive variables (matric suction and net normal stress) and that the hydromechanical behavior of unsaturated soil is <b>coupled,</b> a water <b>retention</b> curve obtained from tests under zero stress and assuming no volume change is still fairly common. A relatively limited number of studies on the stress path-dependent water retention curve (SDWRC), particularly under {{a broader range of}} stress paths, exist in the literature. In this paper, the SDWRC, shrinkage curve, and swelling curve of a compacted silt subjected to isotropic and deviatoric stress paths are presented. The test results show that the air-entry value (AEV) increases, but the hydraulic hysteresis loop decreases with an increase in net mean stress. Furthermore, for a given stress level, the K- 0 -compressed specimen exhibits higher AEV, but a smaller hysteresis loop than that of the isotropically compressed specimen. A non-linear shrinkage curve is observed and the gradient of the post-yield shrinkage curve depends on the degree of saturation and net mean stress, but is independent of the stress path. For the range of suction studied, the gradient reduces with a decreasing degree of saturation, but with an increasing net mean stress. Finally, the test results are compared with the prediction of a model based on two independent constitutive stress variables...|$|R
