5|$|In the {{airplane}} terrorism mystery film Non-Stop, Parker plays a <b>computer</b> <b>programmer,</b> who {{by the end}} of the film, is revealed as one of the two criminal masterminds behind the film's extortion plot. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times notes that Parker's talents are well-employed in his supporting role. In Every Secret Thing, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found Parker and his detective partner to Elizabeth Banks to have been overwhelmed in their roles. Travers also found the detectivework to be uncompelling. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found Parker's performance to have had its moments.|$|E
40|$|Many {{argue that}} formal degrees are not {{necessary}} {{to be successful in}} the technology industry, and further argue that self-taught <b>computer</b> <b>programmers</b> are more productive than formally taught <b>computer</b> <b>programmers.</b> This sentiment is supported by the examples of industry leaders such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. This study examines the possible effects of this attitude on the returns to education for <b>computer</b> <b>programmers.</b> The empirical analysis finds that the wage return to formal education for <b>computer</b> <b>programmers</b> is less than for most other occupations including STEM and degree-dominated professions. These differences are attributed to the smaller impact of signaling through educational attainment on wages in the technology industry as well as the perceived ability to substitute the human capital accumulated through formal education with self-teaching and experience...|$|R

5|$|Jurassic Park's lead <b>computer</b> <b>programmer,</b> Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's {{corporate}} rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system {{to gain access}} to the embryo storage room where he steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game {{designer}} who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered {{a number of}} commercial failures; an irate Barron (Dalip Tahil) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be {{more powerful than the}} protagonist. His colleague, <b>computer</b> <b>programmer</b> Jenny uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon) is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend Akashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a <b>computer</b> <b>programmer</b> from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a <b>computer</b> <b>programmer</b> who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
