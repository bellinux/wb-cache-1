5|$|The fifth match {{featured}} the TNA debut of Samoa Joe, who was pitted against Sonjay Dutt in a bout lasting 6 minutes and 22 seconds. Joe won the encounter by submission after performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver {{and followed by}} placing Dutt in his <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin. Joe {{performed}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed Sabin in his signature submission hold the <b>Coquina</b> Clutch. Instead of submitting, Sabin instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising his arm {{three times before}} giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} of two quarterfinal matches aired on July22, Samoa Joe fought Sonjay Dutt in a match lasting 9 minutes and 32 seconds. Joe won after forcing Dutt to submit with his {{signature}} <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold. The second bout pitted A.J. Styles against Michael Shane. Before the match began, Shane announced he was changing his stage name to Matt Bentley. Styles won after America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) interfered. Harris distracted the referee, allowing Storm to kick Bentley in the face.|$|E
40|$|Lacustrine {{carbonate}} rocks form important hydrocarbon accumulations {{along the}} Brazilian continental margin, {{some of which}} are contained in oil fields in which <b>coquinas</b> are one of the main reservoirs (viz. Campos Basin). The complexity and heterogeneity of these deposits make them a challenge in terms of reservoir description. For the necessary classification and paleoenvironmental interpretation of the <b>coquinas,</b> it is essential to evaluate many aspects including biological (such as carbonate productivity), sedimentological (energy regime in the depositional environment, transport of bioclasts, terrigenous supply), taphonomic (fragmentation of shells, abrasion) and diagenetic processes. The facies analysis applied in this study is considered a more appropriate classification approach to understand these <b>coquinas,</b> since it is more flexible and comprehensive than the existing classifications for carbonate rocks. The material investigated here consists of rock samples of the <b>coquinas</b> from the Atol Quarry of the Morro do Chaves Formation (Barremian/Aptian), Sergipe-Alagoas Basin. These rocks that crop out in the Atol quarry complex can be considered as a case study for similar <b>coquinas</b> reservoirs found in the Brazilian continental margin basins. Six sedimentary facies were described, using the main taphonomic (fragmentation of shells) and compositional (presence of micrite and siliciclastic matrix) features as a diagnostic criteria. Two carbonate facies, two mixed carbonate-siliciclastic facies and two siliciclastic facies (mudstones) were identified. From the facies succession, combined with {{a review of the literature}} on the subject, the following depositional paleoenvironments were defined: high-energy lake platform, lacustrine delta in a high-energy lake platform and lake-centre. In this paper, a new facies model for the studied <b>coquinas</b> succession is proposed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Coquinas</b> {{accumulate}} in high-energy marine and lacustrine environments where currents and waves {{result in the}} vigorous winnowing, abrasion, fracturing, and sorting of the shells, which compose them. As a result, they typically exhibit well-developed bedding or cross-bedding, close packing, and good orientation of the shell fragments. The high-energy marine or lacustrine environments associated with <b>coquinas</b> include beaches, shallow submarine raised banks, swift tidal channels, and barrier bars.|$|R
50|$|The Judith River Formation is {{composed}} of mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. Coal beds, bentonite and <b>coquinas</b> are also observed.|$|R
5|$|Joe, Shelley, Styles, and Williams {{advanced}} to the semifinals. The first match {{took place on the}} August5 episode of Impact! between Joe and Shelley. Joe slammed Shelley back-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then choked him unconscious with the <b>Coquina</b> Clutch at 9 minutes and 4 seconds to win and advance to the finals. In the second semifinal match on August10, Styles defeated Williams with a small package pin at 9 minutes and 19 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The first bout {{was between}} Samoa Joe and Jushin Liger. It lasted 7 minutes and 27 seconds. Joe was {{accompanied}} by two Polynesian dancers during his entrance, who performed for the crowd. Liger gained a near-fall on Joe at 6 minutes. Afterwards, Joe slammed Liger in the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. He then followed by applying his <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold. As the referee waited for Liger to submit, he became limp, causing the referee to lift and drop Liger's arm three times, resulting in the knock-out victory for Joe.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The Unlikely Alliance (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe) against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). The match {{duration}} was twelve minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Angle {{was forced to}} sit out of the match for five minutes, giving The Unlikely Alliance the three on two advantage. Joe won the encounter after he forced Tomko to submit with his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission maneuver.|$|E
50|$|The Floresta Formation is characterised by a lower {{sequence}} of shales and ochre to beige siltstones with alternating <b>coquinas,</b> while {{the upper part}} consists of siltstones with sandy beds.|$|R
50|$|The Colorado Group {{consists}} of shale {{for the most}} part, and incorporates conglomerate, sandstone and siltstone, and beds of chalk, chalky limestone, <b>coquinas,</b> phosphorite and concretionary beds including calcite, siderite and pyrite.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the cells is coccoid with 1.5-2.0 μm in diameter. Jeotgalicoccus <b>coquinae</b> {{is part of the}} Gram-positive bacteria. The Oxidase test as well as the Catalase test is positive, {{revealing}} an aerobic respiratory metabolism.|$|R
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, <b>coquina,</b> and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de <b>coquina,</b> perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Christopher Daniels {{in the eighth}} match of the show. Mid-way through the contest, Joe avoided a moonsault by Daniels by casually walking away, a {{trademark}} action of his persona. Daniels earned a near-fall after forcing Joe against the mat with a modified Death Valley Driver {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle. Joe followed up with his own near-fall by slamming Daniels back-first against the mat from the turnbuckle with a powerbomb. Daniels then performed his signature Best Moonsault Ever maneuver, gaining another near-fall. Their fight spilled to the ringside area where Joe positioned Daniels' head against the guardrail and kicked it against the rail. This move resulted in Daniels bleeding from the forehead, which Joe targeted {{for the rest of the}} bout. At this time, A.J. Styles came down to the ringside area. Joe performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and followed up by attempting to place Daniels in his trademarked <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission maneuver, which Daniels fought off. Joe then dropped Daniels from the top of a turnbuckle onto a chair and continued to target Daniels' bleeding forehead. With Daniels unconscious in the storyline, A.J. Styles threw in the towel for Daniels to stop the match at 15 minutes and 30 seconds, resulting in Joe being declared the victor.|$|E
50|$|Moguer's cuisine {{features}} cuttlefish (chocos) with beans, skate in paprika, school shark {{marinated in}} adobo, , bean clams (<b>coquinas)</b> {{and other species}} of clam (almejas), wedge sole, true sole, and croakers. Its fruity white wines and a wine made from oranges are produced under the Denominación de Origen (DO) Condado de Huelva.|$|R
25|$|The Sepetiba Formation is the {{uppermost}} {{formation in the}} Santos Basin. It has a variable thickness due to the proximal erosion of {{the uppermost}} part. The formation consists of whitish grey fine to coarse grained carbonitic sands. They are feldspar-rich, glauconitic <b>coquinas</b> consisting of bivalve fragments and foraminifera. The depositional environment {{is thought to be}} coastal.|$|R
2500|$|The Piçarras Formation is [...] {{thick and}} {{consists}} of clastic and carbonate rocks. The formation includes reddish polymictic conglomerates, with clasts of basalt and quartz in a clay-sandy matrix. It also includes white, reddish lacustrine <b>coquinas</b> (shelly limestones) and sandstones, siltstones and shales of stevensite composition. Its age, based on the ostracod assemblages, is Hauterivian to Aptian.|$|R
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Samoa Joe next. Styles' mouth was busted open during the bout. The two wrestlers fought at ringside {{during the opening}} minutes before {{entering}} the ring. Back in the ring Joe and Styles fought {{back and forth with}} each trading near-falls. Finally, Styles slammed Joe face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver. Joe kicked out of the following pin, leading to an exchange which allowed Joe to place Styles in his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold. After a brief period of time, Styles passed out and the referee awarded Joe the victory and thus became the new TNA X Division Champion at 18 minutes and 58 seconds in. After the match, Joe bashed Styles in the face with the TNA X Division Championship belt and then set up to slam him on a steel chair in the ring but was foalied by Christopher Daniels coming to Styles' defense. A brawl ensued between Joe and Daniels, leading to security breaking it up.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout was if Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission on Angle, which was forced to be released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came to a conclusion when Joe lifted up Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then covered for the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The Gladstone Formation is {{a unit of}} the Blairmore and Luscar Groups. The {{lower portion}} of the {{formation}} consists of fine-grained sandstone interbedded with siltstone, mudstone and claystone. The upper portion consists of limestone beds and <b>coquinas</b> of fresh water shells, interbedded with calcareous mudstone, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Thin coal beds are present in northern areas.|$|R
50|$|The Fernie Formation is {{composed}} primarily of brown and dark gray to black shales {{that range from}} massive with conchoidal fracture to laminated and highly fractured or papery. Phosphatic sandstone and limestone, including cherty limestone, occur locally in the lower parts of the formation; siltstone, sandstone, <b>coquinas</b> and oolitic limestone interbeds can occur in the center; glauconitic sandstone and siltstone can {{be present in the}} upper parts.|$|R
25|$|The {{conglomerates}} and sandstones of {{the formation}} are representative of an alluvial environment. The <b>coquinas</b> represent a shallow lacustrine environment. Similar to the Atafona Formation of the Campos Basin, the sandstones, stevensite-bearing siltstones and shales represent an alkaline lacustrine environment affected by volcanic activity. The shales represent deeper lacustrine waters in more distal areas. The alternation of the two facies implies a series of alluvial progradation-retractions into the Cretaceous carbonate lakes. The low textural and compositional maturity of conglomerates and sandstones implies the basin was supplied from areas close to the basin margins.|$|R
5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what he calls a Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Harris at TNA's Victory Road PPV {{event on}} July 17, 2007 and Tomko, Styles, and he {{losing to the}} team of Andrew Martin, Sting, and Abyss at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August 12, 2007 in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match to become number one contender to the TNA Title, Cage restarted his feud with Samoa Joe. The two met at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, where Cage defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer. There, Joe defeated Cage to end his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit. Cage and Joe fought one {{more time on the}} October 18, 2007 episode of Impact!, with a spot in the 2007 Fight for the Right tournament to become number one contender to the TNA Championship. Cage defeated Joe to gain entry. Cage made {{it all the way to}} the final round of the tournament, where he fought Kaz on the November 8, 2007 episode of Impact!. Cage defeated Kaz, but due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage's behalf, the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event in a ladder match. Cage, however, failed to win the tournament final the second time around at Genesis.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match pitting {{the team}} of Alex Shelley, Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong, and Samoa Joe against {{the team of}} Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. Matt Bentley was {{accompanied}} by Traci to the ring. The duration of this bout was 23 minutes and 15 seconds. Daniels took over the leadership role of his team, naming them Team Ministry. In this match, each person from each team had to be eliminated by pinfall or submission until all members of one team were gone. The wrestler(s) that remained won the bout for their team. Strong was the first eliminated after being pinned by Aries following a 450° aerial splash. Aries was eliminated soon-after by Daniels, who pinned him with a roll-up while he was distracted by Joe. The third elimination was Dutt, who submitted to Shelley's signature Border City Stretch submission hold. Not long after, Shelley was pinned by Bentley after being kicked in the face. Joe forced Bentley to submit with his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold, bringing the match down to Daniels and Joe versus Sabin. Daniels won the bout for his team by pinning Sabin after slamming Sabin face-first into the mat with his signature Angel's Wings maneuver. An argument ensued between Daniels and Joe after the contest, with Joe angry in the storyline that Daniels eliminated Sabin {{when he wanted to}} instead. This led to Joe attacking Daniels and bashing him over the head with a steal chair. Joe followed up by slamming Daniels into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then a second time on a steal chair. This left Daniels bloodied {{in the center of the}} ring with TNA's medical crew tending to his injuries.|$|E
50|$|By 2003 41 {{oil and gas}} fields had discovered, which lie at the {{distances}} 50 to 140 km from the cost and at water depths varying from 80 to 2,400 m. Of these fields 37 are being developed by Petrobras. By 2003 the oil production from the basin had reached 1.21 million barrels per day. The production comes {{from a variety of}} reservoirs including siliciclastic turbidites, fractured basalts, <b>coquinas,</b> calcarenites (limestones). The total cumulative production from the Campos Basin by 2003 was 3.9 billion barrels of oil with remaining reserves of 8.5 billion barrels.|$|R
50|$|The Floresta Formation (Formación Floresta, Df) is a {{geological}} {{formation of the}} Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The sequence of siltstones, shales, <b>coquinas</b> and sandstone beds dates to the Devonian period; Late Emsian, Eifelian and Early Givetian epochs, and has a maximum thickness of 600 m. The unit is highly fossiliferous; brachiopods, bryozoans, gastropods, trilobites, corals and bivalves {{have been found in}} the Floresta Formation. Some fragments of Placoderm fish fossils were found in the Floresta Formation, while the overlying Cuche Formation is much richer in fish biodiversity.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{otoliths}} from the Sallomacian <b>coquinas</b> of Orthez and Sallespisse yielded 40 teleostean fish species of which two are new to science: Ilisha nijsseni and Diplodus kaerrerae. Among these, at least 8 are still living or very near to extant species. The association is dominated by a neritic shallow water fauna, much comparable to the extant fauna of the west-african coast between the Canary Islands and Senegal. The fossil species Brachydeuterus latior, Dentex (Polysteganus) aff. gregarius and Umbrina pyrenaica of the Sallomacian of Aquitaine are considered vicariants of the extant west-african species Brachydeuterus auritus, Dentex (Polysteganus) maroccanus and Umbrina cirrhosa. No {{attempt was made to}} interpret the fauna biostratigraphically, because the faunas of the underlying and overlying strata are still unknown...|$|R
5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature <b>Coquina</b> Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
25|$|Historic {{records and}} {{structural}} {{studies indicate that}} the main house and detached kitchen were built in 1798. Both are constructed of <b>coquina</b> rock quarried on nearby Anastasia Island. <b>Coquina</b> rock construction positions {{the house in the}} upper tier of St. Augustine residences of the Second Spanish Period. It is an exceptional example of St. Augustine Plan architecture. This hybrid style blends elements of Spanish Colonial architecture with more elegant Federal-style architecture introduced during Florida's British Period (1763-1784). The property's detached <b>coquina</b> kitchen with beehive oven is the only original 18th century detached kitchen in St. Augustine.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the sugar mill include the ruins of <b>coquina</b> block and brick structures, and an {{assortment}} of sugar processing equipment including the gear mechanisms of the rolling sugar cane press, the iron boiling kettles, and the steam furnace and piston mechanisms used in operating the cane press. This assembly is one of the earliest extant examples in the United States of the machinery required to produce sugar, molasses, and rum.|$|E
40|$|The Cutri Formation of Mallorca {{consists}} of sediments which formed during the rifting of the Neotethys Ocean. It comprises thick carbonate turbidite sequences (interbedded with bioturbated marls, calcisilts and Posidonia bivalve <b>coquinas)</b> interpreted to have formed along a line source. The most abundant deposits are oolitic-peloidal grainstones and packstones, with sedimentary structures indicating primary deposition by high-density turbidity flows and debris flows which fed slope and {{base of slope}} sediments into a current-swept basin. With continued filling and diminishing sediment supply, a basin-plain association developed, comprising fine-grained and thin-bedded turbidites intercalated with bioturbated marls. A diagenetic history is developed that determined porosity was destroyed very quickly, mainly through compaction. The sedimentological and diagenetic history is compared to examples of resedimented carbonates that do provide good reservoir quality to try and understand the reason for porosity preservation compared to the Cutri Formation...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{barnacle}} <b>coquinas</b> (barnamols) {{formed around}} New Zealand&# 039;s North and Chatham Islands {{during the late}} Pliocene to early Pleistocene. The inner-shelf megabalanine Fosterella is the primary constituent of these lithofacies, which also include epifaunal bivalves, bryozoans and less modified balanids like Notobalanus and Notomegabalanus. The status of genus Fosterella is reviewed, 3 species are retained and a new genus, Porobalanus, is proposed for Fosterella hennigi, a species restricted to the Early Pliocene of Cockburn Island, Antarctica. Significantly, Fosterella did not survive the New Zealand Pleistocene, although Notobalanus and Notomegabalanus, which have fossil records extending back to the Early Miocene, remain important components of present day cool-temperate Southern Hemisphere faunas. Extinction of Fosterella, in shelf waters off Argentina, is explained {{through a combination of}} changing circulatory and sedimentary regimes, competition for food and space, predation and physiological constraints. The driver of these factors was rapid regional cooling...|$|R
40|$|The Santa Lucía Formation {{represents}} the major phase in Devonian reef {{development of the}} Cantabrian Zone (Cantabrian Mountains, northwest Spain). In the present study {{the transition from the}} carbonate platform deposits of the Santa Lucía Formation to the overlying euxinic basinal deposits of the Huergas Formation is described. These transitional strata are connected to the Basal Choteč Event and represent a condensed sedimentation of micritic dark-grey and black limestones with an upward increase of dark shale intercalations with iron mineralisation surfaces and storm-induced brachiopod <b>coquinas.</b> The transitional beds are grouped into a new unit, the Cabornera Bed, which consists of limestone, limestone-shale and shale facies associations, representing a sediment-starved euxinic offshore area just below the storm wave base. Four stages in reef decline can be recognised: a reef stage, an oxygen-depleted, nutrient-rich stage, a siliciclastic-influx stage and a pelagic-siliciclastic stage. Additional geochemical and geophysical investigations are needed to verify the results presented herein...|$|R
