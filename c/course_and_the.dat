5|$|The canyon {{was most}} likely formed by San Diego Creek cutting through the rising San Joaquin Hills over a span of about 1.22 million years. At some point, however, the creek changed <b>course,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water gap it had formed was walled off by the {{mountains}} and became a separate watershed. The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna Canyon and the San Diego Creek watershed is very small, allowing for the canyon's modern use as a transportation route.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} golf {{courses in the}} city and the {{surrounding}} area.

The University of North Dakota operated the 9-hole Ray Richards Golf Course. However were forced to sell the course in 2016 leaving it abandoned. The 18-hole Grand Forks Country Club is directly south of the city. There are also golf courses in nearby East Grand Forks, Minnesota and Manvel, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{distinction of being the}} race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a <b>course,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars.

They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications {{are similar to the}} first game. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice <b>course,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted practical training in the outdoors in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. The course was attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E

Past Schuss Mountain, M-88 turns east at Alden highway and enters the community of Mancelona, passing the Fairview Cemetery. The highway runs along on State Street into downtown. M-88 ends at an intersection with US131/M-66 running along Williams Street, and State Street continues eastward as C-38.|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 the hot springs failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baths filled in less time than before.|$|E
5|$|The {{time scale}} and {{sequence}} {{over which the}} river's present <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean – possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, forming the Monterey submarine canyon. The uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains began about 4.5million years ago, diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an antecedent stream) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.|$|E

5|$|The wall facing {{towards the}} Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, {{stretched}} {{for a total}} length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during {{the construction of the}} railway line, its <b>course</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, and was about 10metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14gates and 110towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained the quarters allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (mitaton) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own wharfs (skalai) beyond the sea walls.|$|E
