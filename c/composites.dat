40|$|Advanced <b>composite</b> {{materials}} have seen major market growth {{in recent years}} due to their high strength and low weight properties. These materials are often made using a process that creates a <b>composite</b> laminate by stacking several <b>composite</b> layers together. However, the design, analysis and optimization of laminate <b>composite</b> materials are often a labor intensive process when done manually. This thesis discusses CAD independent algorithms that are integrated into commercial CAD tools to streamline these processes. Methods {{have been developed to}} automatically create 3 D ply geometry for a laminate <b>composite</b> lay-up, streamline the creation of a laminate <b>composite</b> finite element model and optimize the <b>composite</b> lay-up for a multi-layered laminate <b>composite</b> part. Integrating a CAD independent geometry kernel into the NX laminate <b>composite</b> design automation application significantly improves the run time of that application. In addition, the automated <b>composite</b> finite element tool creates laminate <b>composite</b> finite element models that are more detailed than those made with zone based methods. This tool will save engineers, who are making laminate <b>composite</b> finite element models manually, dozens of hours of work per model.

40|$|<b>Composite</b> beams are {{connected}} to steel or <b>composite</b> columns through various types of <b>composite</b> joints, which provide different degrees of flexural continuity from the columns to the <b>composite</b> beams. The flexural rigidities, the deformation capacities and the moment capacities of <b>composite</b> beam-column joints have significant effects on the structural behaviour of the semi-continuous <b>composite</b> beams and <b>composite</b> frames. Among various types of <b>composite</b> beam-column joints, <b>composite</b> joints with end-plates are most commonly used in modern <b>composite</b> buildings because of their high moment capacities and rotation capacities. In this paper, generalised three-dimensional finite element models are proposed to study the structural performance of practical <b>composite</b> joints with end-plates with the careful incorporation of the flexibility of shear connectors and tensile reinforcement. In order to ensure the general applicability of the proposed numerical models, the studies include both the <b>composite</b> joints in semi-continuous beams under gravity loads and the joints in sub-frames under lateral loads; and propose a generalised finite element model for the stiffness and load carrying capacity prediction of <b>composite</b> end-plate joints under various load cases as well.
