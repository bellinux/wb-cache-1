When the wire radius is sufficiently small, the hydrodynamic transitions in the boiling curve disappear and the curve becomes monotonic. Three modes of heat removal are identified for the monotonic curve and described analytically: a natural <b>convection</b> <b>mode,</b> a mixed film boiling and natural <b>convection</b> <b>mode,</b> and a pure film boiling mode. Nucleate boiling does not occur on the small wires. The study was motivated by an interest in predicting the behavior of large hea ters at low gravity.

40|$|Crop {{cultivation}} in greenhouses under semi-arid {{climatic conditions}} {{is subject to}} various stresses, in particular during the winter season at night, when the interior air is poorly controlled, leading to prolonged periods of low temperature. The aim is then to evaluate and control the heat exchanges of the enclosure {{in order to prevent}} low indoor air temperatures and reduce the thermal load of the greenhouse. The objectives of this study are to investigate the convective and radiative heat exchanges at the cover in order to establish new correlations for the convective heat transfer coefficients in semi arid regions. The climatic parameters were measured inside and outside a closed empty glasshouse without crop, for three different nights during the winter season in the semi-arid land of Algeria. A physical model for analysing the convective heat transfers was implemented, and new correlations were established, parameterised, calibrated and validated thoroughly. A significant difference was observed between the correlations obtained by this study and the models obtained for other greenhouse designs under different climatic conditions. Results show that the <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> along the inside wall of the cover is free turbulent.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{mathematical}} model for describing three-dimensional natural convection in porous media filling a vertical annular cylinder. We apply a linear stability analysis to determine the onset of convection and the preferred convective mode when the annular cylinder is subject to {{two different types of}} boundary conditions: heat insulated sidewalls and heat conducting sidewalls. The case of an annular cylinder with insulated sidewalls has been investigated earlier, but our results reveal more details than previously found. We also investigate the case of the radius of the inner cylinder approaching zero and the results are compared with previous work for non-annular cylinders. Using pseudospectral methods we have built a high-order numerical simulator to uncover the nonlinear regime of the convection cells. We study onset and geometry of <b>convection</b> <b>modes,</b> and look at the stability of the modes with respect to different types of perturbations. Also, we examine how variations in the Rayleigh number affects the <b>convection</b> <b>modes</b> and their stability regimes. We uncover an increased complexity regarding which modes that are obtained and we are able to identify stable secondary and mixed modes. We find the different convective modes to have overlapping stability regions depending on the Rayleigh number. The motivation for studying natural convection in porous media is related to geothermal energy extraction and we attempt to determine the effect of convection cells in a geothermal heat reservoir. However, limitations in the simulator do not allow us to make any conclusions on this matter...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} with self consistent plate-mantle models capturing multiple physical features, such as elasticity, non-Newtonian flow properties, and temperature dependence, is that the individual behaviours cannot be considered in isolation.

These difficulties can be avoided if a stress limiter is introduced {{in the form of}} a power law rheology or yield criterion.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the thermal {{performance}} of a greenhouse exposed to semi-arid conditions by investigating experimentally the heat transfers occurring through the walls and ground. A closed unheated Venlo greenhouse without crop {{in the area of}} Batna (southern Mediterranean basin) was considered. The study focuses on the effects of (i) the thermal inertia of the soil, (ii) the radiative losses through the cover, and (iii) the <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> and flow regime on the heat transfer coefficients. Experiments were conducted from January to March 2008 under clear or cloudy skies, and low or high wind velocities. From the results, it is concluded that the heat stored in the ground of the greenhouse represents a significant heat source which can compensate the energy losses through the walls, especially during a night preceded by a high diurnal insulation. This process can maintain an average inside - outside temperature difference during the night within the range [1. 59 – 2. 81] K. Results also show that the radiation losses are the main component of the energy losses of the greenhouse, mainly through the outside wall surface of the cover. Conversely, the radiative heat exchange along the inner wall represents the main heat supply to this wall. The <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> inside the greenhouse induced by the air movement seems to play a significant role on the convective exchange coefficient inside the greenhouse. These coefficients {{both inside and outside the}} greenhouse were estimated and analyzed, and a good agreement with the models reported in the literature was found.

40|$|Nuclear systems {{codes are}} being {{prepared}} for use as computational tools for conducting performance/safety analyses of the Very High Temperature Reactor. The thermal-hydraulic codes are RELAP 5 /ATHENA for one-dimensional systems modeling and FLUENT and/or Star-CD for three-dimensional modeling. We describe a formal qualification framework, the development of Phenomena Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRTs), the initial filtering of the experiment databases, and a preliminary screening of these codes {{for use in the}} performance/safety analyses. In the second year of this project we focused on development of PIRTS. Two events that result in maximum fuel and vessel temperatures, the Pressurized Conduction Cooldown (PCC) event and the Depressurized Conduction Cooldown (DCC) event, were selected for PIRT generation. A third event that may result in significant thermal stresses, the Load Change event, is also selected for PIRT generation. Gas reactor design experience and engineering judgment were used to identify the important phenomena in the primary system for these events. Sensitivity calculations performed with the RELAP 5 code were used as an aid to rank the phenomena in order of importance with respect to the approach of plant response to safety limits. The overall code qualification methodology was illustrated by focusing on the Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS). The mixed <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> of heat transfer and pressure drop is identified as an important phenomenon for Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS) operation. Scaling studies showed that the mixed <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> is likely to occur in the RCCS air duct during normal operation and during conduction cooldown events. The RELAP 5 /ATHENA code was found to not adequately treat the mixed convection regime. Readying the code will require adding models for the turbulent mixed convection regime while possibly performing new experiments for the laminar mixed convection regime. Candidate correlations for the turbulent mixed convection regime for circular channel geometry were identified in the literature. We describe the use of computational experiments to obtain correction factors for applying these circular channel results to the specialized channel geometry of the RCCS. The intent is {{to reduce the number of}} laboratory experiments required. The FLUENT and Star-CD codes contain models that in principle can handle mixed convection but no data were found to indicate that their empirical models for turbulence have been benchmarked for mixed convection conditions. Separate effects experiments were proposed for gathering the needed data. In future work we will use the PIRTs to guide review of other components and phenomena in a similar manner as was done for the mixed <b>convection</b> <b>mode</b> in the RCCS. This is consistent with the project objective of identifying weaknesses or gaps in the code models for representing thermal-hydraulic phenomena expected to occur in the VHTR both during normal operation and upsets, identifying the models that need to be developed, and identifying the experiments that must be performed to support model development...|$|E
