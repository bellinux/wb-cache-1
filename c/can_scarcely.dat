5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
25|$|His {{praise of}} the poet Thomas Campbell has been cited as one major {{instance}} where Hazlitt's critical judgement proved wrong. Hazlitt <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> conceal his enthusiasm for such poems as Gertrude of Wyoming, but neither the poems nor Hazlitt's judgement of them have withstood the test of time. His friends Hunt and Lamb get briefer coverage, and—Hazlitt was never one to mince words—they come in for some relatively gentle chiding amid the praise. One American author makes an appearance, Washington Irving, under his pen name of Geoffrey Crayon.|$|E

He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena." ...|$|E

500|$|When Small Heath finally {{returned}} to League football, their forwards, [...] "conspicuous for some really beautiful passing" [...] on a soft and slippery playing surface, {{gave them a}} 6–2 victory over Bootle.

500|$|Skyscrapers, {{particularly}} those in New York, attracted considerable comment, much of it negative. On his return to New York, writer Henry James condemned the buildings in The American Scene as simply [...] "giants of the mere market", [...] "mercenary monsters" [...] doomed to be torn down in turn as other, even larger, buildings took their place. In Chicago {{the combination of the}} environmental pollution and skyscrapers meant that, as Charles Warner complained, [...] "one <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> see across the streets on a damp day, and the huge buildings loom up in the black sky in ghostly dimness".|$|E
500|$|Volkogonov {{claimed that}} [...] "there <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> {{have been another}} man in history who managed so profoundly to change so large a society on such a scale". Lenin's {{administration}} laid the framework for the system of government that ruled Russia for seven decades and provided the model for later Communist-led states that came to cover {{a third of the}} inhabited world in the mid-20th century. Thus, Lenin's influence was global. A controversial figure, Lenin remains both reviled and revered, a figure who has been both idolised and demonised. Even during his lifetime, Lenin [...] "was loved and hated, admired and scorned" [...] by the Russian people. This has extended into academic studies of Lenin and Leninism, which have often been polarised along political lines.|$|E

500|$|It {{has also}} been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000drachmae (somewhat over 1.5talents) on the {{condition}} that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to Demosthenes, his new pupil. Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge. According to Sir Richard C. Jebb, a British classical scholar, [...] "the intercourse between Isaeus and Demosthenes as teacher and learner <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> have been either very intimate or of very long duration". Konstantinos Tsatsos, a Greek professor and academician, believes that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians. Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the Illiterate Book-Fancier, Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in Demosthenes' own handwriting. These references hint at his respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Chronicle declared: We cannot {{sufficiently}} {{express our}} {{opinion of the}} coolness, intrepidity, and skill, with which the Commander of this Fleet, unaccustomed as he was {{to the practice of}} naval engagements, provided against every emergency, and prepared his plans, either for attack or defence, as the manoeuvres of the French Admiral might render it expedient for him to adopt either the one of the other. His conduct was worthy of the experience and science of our most approved and veteran Admirals, while the ardour and promptitude with which his orders were obeyed and his plans executed by the several Captains under his command, may have been rivalled, but <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> be exceeded in the most renowned of our naval exploits.

While his family moved back to Oakland, he began serving as a fire control officer on the Idaho. He left the Idaho in June 1923, returning to shore duties for two years before taking up the position of First Lieutenant on the [...] in May 1925.

500|$|The cathedral is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Standing [...] high, it was Ani's tallest structure. It is very large by {{standards}} of Armenian architecture. Architecture historian Murad Hasratyan suggests that its relatively large size and rich ornaments symbolize the revived Armenian statehood under the Bagratids. Christina Maranci suggested what {{she describes as}} an [...] "extremely tentative" [...] hypothesis that the relatively {{large proportion of the}} cathedral may have been a [...] "reflection of Trdat's memory of the vast continuous spaces" [...] of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the dome of which he repaired. However, it is considered small if judged by a European standard, wrote H. F. B. Lynch and added, [...] "it is nevertheless a stately building. It bears the imprint of that undefinable quality, beauty, and <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> fail to arouse a thrill of delight in the spectator."

500|$|The most {{dramatic}} interview between Mary and Knox {{took place on}} 24 June 1563.

Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. [...] "What have ye to do with my marriage?" [...] she asked, and [...] "What are ye within this commonwealth?" [...] "A subject born within the same, Madam," [...] Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, [...] "Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping." [...] He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and [...] "betray my Commonwealth". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1686 to 1712) is {{reported}} to have spent £1,000 during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel, particularly in the chancel (at the east end), but also including the addition of a screen separating {{the main part of the}} chapel from the ante-chapel (at the west end) in 1693. The screen bears the coat of arms of Sir Leoline Jenkins (principal 1661–1673) and, until 1899, also bore Thelwall's coat of arms. His arms were moved to a position above the door (where, says one writer, [...] "they <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> be seen") when an organ by J. J. Binns was installed in the ante-chapel in 1899. The current organ, by William Drake, was installed in 1994 to replace the Binns organ. The screen has open ovals rather than blank ovals– an example, said Pevsner, of [...] "the importance given to openwork carving" [...] in the later 17th century. After the installation of the screen, little changed in the chapel until the middle of the 19th century, save for some donations of items such as a brass desk and two silver candlesticks.|$|E

500|$|Thảo was posthumously {{promoted}} by the ARVN {{to the rank of}} one–star general and awarded the title of Heroic war dead (...) [...] After the Fall of Saigon {{and the end of the}} Vietnam War, the communist government awarded him the same title and paid war pensions to his family, claiming him as one of their own. In 1981, the communists had his body exhumed and reburied in the [...] "Patriots' cemetery" [...] in Ho Chi Minh City (previously Saigon). Tảng believed Thảo [...] "was a man who throughout his life fought single-mindedly for Vietnam's independence". Tảng, who later abandoned communism, said that Thảo [...] "was a nationalist, not an ideologue", and credited him with turning the military tide towards the communists by helping to bring down Diệm and fomenting chronic instability and infighting for 18 months. Hồ Chí Minh had reacted to Diệm's death by saying [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> believe that the Americans would be so stupid". A communist report written in March 1965, soon after Thảo's revolt had caused Khánh to depart, stated that [...] "The balance of force... has changed very rapidly in our favor....

500|$|Cambridge's faster {{stroke rate}} saw them gain on the Dark Blues {{and by the}} time the passed HMS Stork, they held a quarter-length lead, {{although}} by Chiswick Steps the lead was gone and Oxford led by a quarter of a length. [...] They passed below Barnes Bridge with that lead as both crews headed into rough water. [...] According to the special correspondent writing in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "a sea awaited them". [...] Both crews took on water in the difficult conditions but the Dark Blues prevailed. [...] Oxford won by two lengths in a time of 20 minutes 30 seconds, their second consecutive win. [...] It was the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race and the fastest since the 1935 race. [...] The victory took the overall record in the event to 47–42 in Cambridge's favour. [...] The correspondent for The Manchester Guardian described it as [...] "excellent", and [...] "a great race in the best traditions" [...] The Observer correspondent suggested that [...] "the race will rank as one of the closest and most exciting in which the two Universities have ever engaged." [...] The former Oxford rower, G. I. F. Thomson, writing in The Observer, claimed [...] "one <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> have hoped for a more interesting or thrilling race". [...] Oxford's number seven and boat club president Cherry said [...] "I hope this will show that last year's victory was not a flash in the pan". [...] His counterpart, T. B.

500|$|Pullin had a wide {{knowledge}} of the game, and remembered past events and players very clearly. His readers appreciated his expertise and frequently wrote to him with queries. A tribute in the Yorkshire Post after his death suggested that Pullin enjoyed this correspondence and felt very close to his readers. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated that [...] "his writings were at all times discriminative, informative and voluminous". The Manchester Guardian noted that Pullin wrote {{at a time when}} many famous cricketers played. It stated that, of these times, he [...] "wrote with a keenness of judgement, a descriptive style, and a fund of anecdote that made the games live again". E.W. Swanton described him as [...] "a thick, bearded fellow" [...] and [...] "a faithful old war-horse". The Yorkshire Post said that Pullin [...] "stood for all the best in sporting critics of the older school... He was proud, and rightly proud, of the high position which he held in sporting journalism and in the administrative circles of the games on which he wrote". The newspaper judged that he wrote about cricket and rugby players [...] "with a clarity akin to genius... There <b>can</b> <b>scarcely</b> be a football or cricket ground in England where he was not known and welcomed, and his striking appearance and still more striking personality became traditional in the Press box which he graced. To the players of the games he was generous in praise and kindly in his criticism." [...] Gerald Pawle was told when he became a journalist in 1931 that Pullin originally sent reports to his newspaper by pigeon. Pawle writes: [...] "For the vast Yorkshire cricketing public Old Ebor wrote at inordinate length, unhampered by any consideration of literary style—he was one of the severely factual school—and it amazed me how any pigeon ever struggled into the air when shackled to one of his weighty effusions." ...|$|E
