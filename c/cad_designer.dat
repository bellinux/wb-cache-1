Some export the NURBS surfaces and {{leave it to the}} <b>CAD</b> <b>designer</b> to complete the model in CAD (e.g., Geomagic, Imageware, Rhino 3D). Others use the scan data to create an editable and verifiable feature based model that is imported into CAD with full feature tree intact, yielding a complete, native CAD model, capturing both shape and design intent (e.g. Geomagic, Rapidform). Still other CAD applications are robust enough to manipulate limited points or polygon models within the CAD environment (e.g., CATIA, AutoCAD, Revit).|$|E

The originality in this process is {{the expression of a}} CAD model environmental impacts in function of <b>CAD</b> <b>designer</b> DoFs, aiming at help non environment experiment designer to eco-design products in CAD phase. For this, first, we present the concept of DoFs and we use it to identify the <b>CAD</b> <b>designer</b> action zone. Second, we establish the impact matrix of DoFs in each life phase, then; we develop the global impact matrix. The assembly of EIs by linear summation of the matrix columns shows the most impacting ones. Finally, we consider a case study to valid our proposed approach and results are shown in function of DoFs...|$|E

40|$|Representing dynamic interdependencies between design objects is an {{essential}} part of modeling the critical software communications found in today 2 ̆ 7 s increasingly complex software systems. Current software development methodologies, software development environments (SDEs), and computer aided design (CAD) systems lack the ability to represent and manipulate these interdependencies, even though the specific information needing representation is often well understood by the designer. Representing dynamic interdependencies in an object-oriented design environment focuses on the ability to specify relationships between objects that are not ancestrally related. For example, a <b>CAD</b> <b>designer</b> altering the pitch of a gas turbine engine 2 ̆ 7 s fan blade may need to consider the stress where the blade is mounted to the turbine disk. Changes in the stress (caused by the change in fan blade pitch) are said to propagate to the attachment of the fan blade to the disk. Propagation modeling seeks to represent such interdependency knowledge as an important part of the design process. From a software engineering perspective, propagation modeling, as applied to the software design process, holds potential as a means to more precisely define and then consistently maintain design interdependencies. Our research pursues an increase in the engineering rigor of the software design and development process by expanding the object-oriented paradigm to include the mechanisms necessary to support application-wide information consistency. The general context of our effort is the development of a framework for supporting the design, analysis, and development of propagation modeling capabilities in an object-oriented environment. Our framework offers propagation modeling constructs for both design and development, with support for dynamic, designer-defined propagation modeling choices. Included in our framework are constructs that promote information consistency through automatic and on-demand design analyses, which alert the designer to potential design flaws and inconsistencies, in support of the detailed evaluation of a design. ...|$|E

The conference in which this paper was delivered consisted of the worlds leading holographic experts – scientists, engineers and artists, interested in advancing the technology. This formed the ideal platform to gather crucial information regarding the future of holography and significantly – Its future - illustrated {{in the form of}} three-dimensional mind maps. This paper combined a question and answer section which asked questions such as ‘What current application of holography are you working on?’ and ‘When do you predict it will become available within design practice?” The aim was to develop my argument that future design processes will need methods of three-dimensional print requiring timeliness of response, flexibility, access to information and fully rendered digital holograms on demand especially for digital holography. These characteristics imply a more geographically distributed and collaborative kind of information dissemination activity than is commonplace today as a complex network of 3 D <b>CAD</b> <b>designers</b> are already in place and primed for holographic exploitation. The papers was titled after the late Professor Steven Benton’s hologram, “Crystal Beginnings” because its design fits many of the criteria that satisfy our visual needs, therefore making it the ideal starting reference point in our attempts to clarify design issues many 3 D <b>Cad</b> <b>designers</b> face with new holographic technology. Its design comes close {{to the idea of a}} ‘three-dimensional mind map’ which could help to define key research issues associated with digital convergence and this is also explored in the paper.

The first uses a pipelining approach and achieves speedups of 1. 3 x on two processing cores. The second uses a parallel moves approach and achieves speedups of 2. 2 x on four cores. Unlike all previous parallel moves algorithms, ours is deterministic and always gives the same answer as the serial version of the algorithm, without any significant reduction in performance. We also describe a process to quantify multi-core performance effects, such as memory subsystem limitations and explicit synchronization overhead, and fully describe these effects on a CAD tool for the first time. Memory limitations alone are found to cost up to 35 % of total runtime. Unlike previous algorithms, our algorithms have negligible explicit synchronization overhead.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{strategy}} for design representation that uses dynamically decentralized design objects, distributed over the web and instantiated just-in-time, instead of the traditional centralized, static and local CAD model. It addresses the problem of coping with dynamic information changes that architects face when designing with increasingly time-sensitive product information from multiple suppliers. The dissertation describes the new distributed architecture for design representation, and outlines a corresponding new process model {{to address the needs}} of AEC (Architectural, Engineering and Construction) industries'architectural designers during design and procurement phases. The feasibility of the process was tested in a prototype system that combines existing state-of-the-art technologies. The prototype integrates the direct manipulation functionality of Autodesk's i-Drop technology with the Internet communication protocols HTTP and TCP/IP, and a VBA macro running from within AutoCAD 2000 i. In the proposed model, libraries of AEC objects, representing suppliers'products, are located in multiple suppliers'databases and are made available to <b>CAD</b> <b>designers</b> remotely over the Web. Suppliers using the system are expected to produce product information as XML documents. This standardizes the interface with the remote designers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to expose the EDA {{community}} to the emerging class of circuits operating with single quanta of energy (e. g. photons or electrical carriers). We describe recent developments in the field of single-photon detection and single-photon imaging based on the avalanche effect. Single-photon detection is useful in a number of applications, from time-of-flight based 3 D vision systems to fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, from low-light cameras to quantum random number generators, from positron emission tomography to time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. These applications have speed and accuracy requirements that conventional systems cannot provide if not at a very high cost. EDA has not yet adapted to the revolution introduced by avalanching devices and, though tools capable of simulating these devices exist, there is little or no capability to do so in a coherent flow, let alone at system level.

40|$|A Multi-Disciplinary Product Structure (MPS) logically organizes {{product model}} information, {{enabling}} enterprise users {{to be more}} effective in interacting with large amounts of design data. MPS creates discipline specific views (system engineering, CAD, cost analysis, weight analysis, performance analysis, failure analysis, electrical analysis, etc.) of the same underlying product representation thereby reducing the complexity and overhead of searching through and working with the entire set of product information. This capability becomes critical as the amount of information available on the product structure becomes large. It also facilitates a more natural representation of different design aspects without forcing designers to tightly couple functional and physical representations. MPS exploits all the capabilities of Windchill to enable this multi-disciplinary collaborative design. The result is a simplified process for managing configuration and change during the entire lifecycle of the product. The MPS provides the ability for users to generate discipline specific views under each of the lifecycle views, such as: as-planned, as-designed, as-manufactured, etc. Discipline specific views enable systems engineers to see a functional view of the as-designed product while <b>CAD</b> <b>designers</b> can see the physical view of the as-designed product.

40|$|Technology {{has been}} the engine of growth for the United States economy over the last decade, and it is {{reasonable}} to expect that appropriate selection and management of technology within the firm would continue to be highly critical to its success well into the future. Operations managers constantly struggle to seek answers to the right set of managerial actions {{that can be used to}} leverage technology for process effectiveness. This study takes a step in that direction by empirically examining the management of computer aided design (CAD) technology and outcomes of the product design process within manufacturing firms. In particular, the level of functionality and sophistication of the CAD system are examined with respect to the use of several structural and infrastructural management levers such as the degree of a firm’s formalization and decentralization, the extent of the use of teams, the extent of training of <b>CAD</b> <b>designers,</b> and the equity of the incentives within the product design process. The influence of these management levers upon the CAD system performance is analyzed through the use of moderated regression analysis conducted on a cross-sectional data of 143 firms representing the vehicular industry in the USA. Our findings indicate that CAD functionality and sophistication are positively related to product design quality, flexibility, and overall performance. The impact of management levers on this relationship is a mixed one. Decentralization has no impact on the CAD technology–performance relationship, formalization has some positive effects, and the use of teams is helpful only in moderating the influence of sophistication on overall performance. Equity of incentives enhances desig...|$|R

The purpose of the report is to describe the procedure of constructing a calculation template in Excel for the designing of a retaining wall, based {{on the principles of}} Lean design. The intention of making processes more efficient in order to save time and improve quality exists within most businesses. In management literature, one reappearing tool for making processes more efficient in the construction consulting industry is called Lean design. Lean design can be applied to all design and calculation processes for different types of bridges and structures. This report describes the background to Lean design and {{the process of trying to}} implement its principles in the making of a calculation template for the designing of a retaining wall. The purpose is to enable a more efficient designing process, where calculations are standardized, and the results of the process are comprehensibly presented to other actors within the consulting business, such as reviewers and <b>CAD</b> <b>designers.</b> The template is to be used for designing retaining walls in different situations depending on, for instance, construction and soil material, geometry and loads. Consequently, a major part of this report has been devoted to standardizing calculations for load effects and bearing capacity in the construction, depending on different possible settings. Designing is regulated by Eurocodes and national annexes, why it is important to refer to relevant chapters in the regulations. The regulations depend on settings and the field of application for the construction. Therefore, some generalizations of the design process have been made. However, during the process it has been clear that implementation of Lean design is one possible way of making construction design more efficient when it comes to time and quality...|$|R

The alteration consists of two steps: mutate followed by perturb. The perturb step exactly preserves as many circuit characteristics as possible. While perturbing, reproduction of interconnect locality, a characteristic that is difficult to measure reliably or reproduce exactly, is controlled using a new technique, ancestor depth control (ADC). Perturbing with ADC produces circuits with postrouting properties that match the best techniques known to-date. The mutate step produces targetted mutations resulting in controlled changes to specific circuit properties (while keeping other properties constant). We demonstrate one targetted mutation heuristic, scale, to significantly change circuit size with little change to other circuit characteristics.
