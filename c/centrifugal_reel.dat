50|$|Grain to be {{processed}} into flour is first ground, typically {{in one or more}} steps, then the bran is separated from the flour produced by grinding the grain. The flour produced from the grain is further separated by size through sifting (or bolting). A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>reel</b> or flour dresser is used to perform this separation, producing the finished flour and a number of byproducts, such as bran and dust. A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>reel</b> is a cylinder which a cloth filter is stretched. Inside of the cloth-covered cylinder are beaters which stir and toss the ground grain against the cloth. A brush moving across the outside of the cylinder removes the flour and keeps the cloth functioning. A flour dresser is constructed similarly to the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>reel,</b> but lacks the beaters. A typical mill process involves passing the flour coming off the millstones through successive dressers so as to achieve optimum separation of flour from bran and germ components of the grain.|$|E
5000|$|Dalton Bros first flour Mill - North East Corner of Summer and Sale Streets ("The {{formal opening}} of Messrs. Dalton Bros. new flour mill took place to-day, and was celebrated with a banquet, at which over 300 persons sat down. Mr. James Dalton {{occupied}} the chair, {{and there were}} present Messer's. Torps, M.L A., J. T, Lane, P. M.., the Mayors of Orange and East Orange, {{and most of the}} leading citizens. The mill was started by the Misses Jane and Winifred Dalton, daughters of the proprietors. The erection of the mill was started 12 month ago, the building being from plans by Messer's. A. D. Nelson and Co., Sydney, who contracted for the erection of all the machinery. The machinery was made by Messer's Hind and Lund, of Preston, Lancashire, England. In the meantime while, the construction of the mill was going on the ironwork was being constructed by Messer's A. D. Nelson in Sydney. The machinery is considerably heavier than that in any other mill in New South Wales There are five brake roller mills 40in. Long and 10in. in diameter. The reduction plant contains nine sets of rollers, each 25in. long and 10in. in diameter, and each of the mills has four rollers. There are 17 acts of elevators. On the second floor is the Atlas purifiers, so constructed as to dispense with storeroom and dust collectors. On the third floor are the centrifugals and scalpers. On the floor are more <b>centrifugals</b> and brake <b>reels.</b> In the basement the shafting for driving the reduction and brake rolls extends the full length of the building. One feature of the machinery is that the motive power is in every case direct from the engine to each line of shafting. The new building contains 300,000 bricks, and 12,000 yards of earth were excavated for the foundations. The plant {{is said to be the}} largest and most expensive in the colony" [...] - from The Sydney Morning Herald - Tuesday 19 April 1892). The mill ceased production in 1908 when the Dalton Bros new mill was opened (below).|$|R
