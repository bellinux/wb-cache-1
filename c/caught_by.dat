5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{important}} squid species, and are widely consumed as human food. They are usually caught in large numbers by trawling, seine fishing, or fixed net traps. In small-scale fishing, they are <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> jigging, drive-in nets, slingshot-driven spearguns, or with squid pots.|$|E
5|$|Christmas is approaching, and Bart {{wants the}} new video game Bonestorm, but Marge refuses to buy it. Discouraged, Bart visits the local Try-N-Save {{discount}} store where Jimbo Jones and Nelson Muntz {{convince him to}} steal {{a copy of the}} game.

5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|England fell to 4/46 after Lindwall and Johnston's new ball burst, but Compton and Yardley {{fought back}} to take the score to 133 without further loss. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing the batsman for 53. Soon after, Johnston removed Evans for nine, <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> a diving Miller after lashing out at a wide ball outside off stump to leave the hosts at 7/145.|$|E
5|$|England {{moved to}} 4/277 when a mini-collapse occurred. Yardley made seven {{before he was}} removed by Johnston, <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> a leaping Harvey while {{attempting}} a big shot. Johnston then removed Ken Cranston, caught behind for a duck to leave England at 6/278. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> Miller at cover, the hosts were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. England recovered to reach 8/362 {{at the close of}} the fourth day. The next day, Yardley declared at 8/365, leaving Johnston with the pick of the bowling figures, 4/95 from 29 overs. This left the tourists a target of 404 from 345 minutes. Australia went on to break the world record Test run-chase record by scoring 3/404 to take a 30 lead with 15 minutes to spare.|$|E

5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Australian weasel shark is {{commonly}} <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> prawn and fish trawlers operating off northern Australia. Smaller numbers are also captured in gillnets and on longlines. As this species has {{a relatively high}} reproductive rate and losses to fisheries are not severe enough to affect its population, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the fishery is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Jones and Norwood {{became the}} first pair of Alabama {{receivers}} to each score a pair of touchdowns in the same game since three were <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> Al Lary and two by Ed Lary in the 1950 season. Late in the game, backup running back Jalston Fowler suffered a knee injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Hilltoppers to 2–0.|$|E
