50|$|In {{computing}} {{and related}} {{technologies such as}} networking, failover is switching to a redundant or standby <b>computer</b> <b>server,</b> system, hardware <b>component</b> or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application, <b>server,</b> system, hardware <b>component,</b> or network. Failover and switchover are essentially the same operation, except that failover is automatic and usually operates without warning, while switchover requires human intervention.|$|R

It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism. Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows, where it was known as [...] "Microsoft Windows Network" [...] before the subsequent introduction of Active Directory. Corresponding Windows services are LAN Manager Server (for the <b>server</b> <b>component)</b> and LAN Manager Workstation (for the client component).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Power {{optimization}} {{and power}} control are challenging issues for <b>server</b> <b>computer</b> systems. To obtain power optimization in an enterprise server, {{one needs to}} observe temporal behavior of workloads, and how they contribute to relative variations in power drawn by different <b>server</b> <b>components.</b> This depth of analysis helps to validate and quantify various energy/performance trends important for power modeling. In this paper we discuss an adaptive infrastructure to synthesize models that dynamically estimate the throughput and latency characteristics based on component level power distribution in a server. In this infrastructure, we capture telemetry data from a distributed set of physical and logical sensors {{in the system and}} use it to train models for various phases of the workload. Once trained, system power, throughput and latency models participate in an optimization heuristics that re-distribute the power to maximize the overall performance/watt of an enter-prise server. We demonstrate modeling accuracy and improvement in energy efficiency due to coordinated power allocation among <b>server</b> <b>components.</b> I...|$|R
