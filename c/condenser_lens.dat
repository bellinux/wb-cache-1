A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors.

25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing.

The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane.

50|$|In mirror {{electron}} microscopy, electrons are slowed in the retarding {{field of}} the <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> to the limit of the instrument and thus, only allowed {{to interact with the}} “near-surface” region of the sample. It is very complicated to understand the exact contrast variations come from, but the important things to point out here are that height variations at the surface of the region change the properties of the retarding field, therefore influencing the reflected (specular) beam. No LEED pattern is formed, because no scattering events have taken place, and therefore, reflected intensity is high.|$|E
5000|$|These {{components}} lie in {{this order}} between the light source and the specimen {{and control the}} illumination of the specimen. The collector/field lenses act to collect light from the light source and focus it at {{the plane of the}} condenser diaphragm. The <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> acts to project this light, without focusing it, through the sample. This illumination scheme creates two sets of conjugate image planes, one with the light source image and one with the specimen.

50|$|A CCD {{image sensor}} like those used for digital {{photography}} is {{placed at the}} point where the two images are superimposed. A broadband “white light” source is used to illuminate the test and reference surfaces. A <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> collimates the light from the broadband light source. A beam splitter separates the light into reference and measurement beams. The reference beam is reflected by the reference mirror, while the measurement beam is reflected or scattered from the test surface. The returning beams are relayed by the beam splitter to the CCD image sensor, and form an interference pattern of the test surface topography that is spatially sampled by the individual CCD pixels.|$|E

25|$|The {{electron}} beam, {{which typically}} has an energy ranging from 0.2 keV to 40 keV, is focused {{by one or}} two <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> to a spot about 0.4nm to 5nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of scanning coils or pairs of deflector plates in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the x and y axes so that it scans in a raster fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.|$|R
50|$|Alignment {{of optical}} {{components}} on the specimen image plane is typically performed by first loading a test specimen and bringing it into focus {{by moving the}} objective or the specimen. The field diaphragm is then partially closed; {{the edges of the}} diaphragm should be in the same conjugate image planes as the specimen, therefore should appear in focus. The focus can be adjusted by raising or lowering the <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> and diaphragm. Finally, the field diaphragm is reopened to just beyond the field of view.|$|R
50|$|The maximum NA {{is limited}} by the {{refractive}} index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a <b>condenser</b> <b>lens</b> with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under oil immersion (or, more rarely, under water immersion), with a layer of immersion oil placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An oil immersion condenser may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser mat not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the top lens and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically oil immersion condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the top lens and the slide.|$|E
50|$|The TEAM {{is based}} on a {{commercial}} FEI Titan 80-300 electron microscope, which can be operated at voltages between 80 and 300 keV, both in TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) modes. To minimize the mechanical vibrations, the microscope is located in a separate room within a sound-proof enclosure and is operated remotely. The electron source is a Schottky type field emission gun with a relatively low energy spread of 0.8 eV at 300 keV. In order to reduce chromatic aberrations, this spread is further lowered to 0.13 eV at 300 keV and 0.08 eV at 80 kV using a Wien-filter type monochromator. Both the illumination lens, which is located above the sample and is conventionally called the <b>condenser</b> <b>lens,</b> and the collection lens (called the objective lens) are equipped with fifth-order spherical aberration correctors. The electrons are further energy filtered by a GIF filter and detected by a CCD camera. The filter makes it possible to select electrons scattered by specific chemical elements and so identify individual atoms in the sample being studied.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for rapid capture {{of high quality}} bidirectional reflection distribution functions(BRDFs) of surface points. Our method represents the BRDF at each point by a generalized microfacet model with tabulated normal distribution function (NDF) and assumes that the BRDF is symmetrical. A compact and light-weight reflectometry apparatus is developed for capturing reflectance data from each surface point within one second. The device consists {{of a pair of}} <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses,</b> a video camera, and six LED light sources. During capture, the reflected rays from a surface point lit by a LED lighting are refracted by a <b>condenser</b> <b>lenses</b> and efficiently collected by the camera CCD. Taking advantage of BRDF symmetry, our reflectometry apparatus provides an efficient optical design to improve the measurement quality. We also propose a model fitting algorithm for reconstructing the generalized microfacet model from the sparse BRDF slices captured from a material surface point. Our new algorithm addresses the measurement errors and generates more accurate results than previous work. Our technique provides a practical and efficient solution for BRDF acquisition, especially for materials with anisotropic reflectance. We test the accuracy of our approach by comparing our results with ground truth. We demonstrate the efficiency of our reflectometry by measuring materials with different degrees of specularity, values of Fresnel factor, and angular variation. 1...|$|R
