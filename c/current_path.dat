5|$|State Route 98 (SR 98) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. It is a loop of Interstate 8 (I-8) running west to east south of the Interstate through the border city of Calexico. It passes through the city of Calexico and ends east of Holtville. The highway {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933, and signed as Route 98 by 1938. The highway was paved and rerouted to its <b>current</b> <b>path</b> during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the <b>current</b> <b>path,</b> while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|An early road {{following}} the <b>current</b> <b>path</b> {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} 2 µm by 4 µm {{thin-film}} Cu-Mn-Ir spin-valve sensors and high Tc YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x dc SQUIDs to take magnetic images of test samples with <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> that meander between 1 and 5 metallization layers separated by 1 µm to 10 µm vertically. I describe {{the development and}} performance of a 3 D magnetic inverse for reconstructing <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> from a magnetic image. I present results from this inverse technique that demonstrate {{the reconstruction of the}} 3 D <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> from magnetic images of samples. This technique not only maps active <b>current</b> <b>paths</b> in the sample but also extracts key parameters such as the layer-to-layer separations. When imaging with 2 µm by 4 µm spin-valve sensors I typically applied currents of 1 mA at 95 kHz and achieved system noise of about 200 nT for a 3 ms averaging time per pixel. This enabled a vertical resolution of 1 µm and a lateral resolution of 1 µm in the top layers and 3 µm in the bottom layer. For our roughly 30 µm square SQUID sensors, I typically applied currents of 1 mA at 5. 3 kHz, and achieved system noise of about 200 pT for a 3 ms averaging time per pixel. The higher sensitivity compared to the spin-valve sensor allowed me to resolve more deeply buried <b>current</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Arundel Expressway was {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1956 as a freeway connecting Baltimore and Annapolis to relieve congestion on MD 2. By 1966, the highway was planned to begin at MD 173 at the city limits of Baltimore, intersect a planned cross-Patapsco section of the Baltimore Beltway, follow its <b>current</b> <b>path</b> to Pasadena, then continue paralleling MD 2 south to near U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301. The portion of the Arundel Expressway inside the Beltway was removed from plans in 1967, with the Beltway instead serving to connect the expressway with highways into Baltimore. The portion of the freeway south of Pasadena was planned to have intermediate interchanges at MD 648 in Severna Park and Jones Station Road (now College Parkway) in Arnold, and a toll plaza {{just south of the}} MD 100 interchange. The portion of the Arundel Expressway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. Instead of a BaltimoreAnnapolis freeway following the MD 2 corridor, in June 1979 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it was constructing the freeway along the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors.|$|E
5|$|When M-40 {{was created}} around by July 1, 1919, it {{originally}} ran from Niles to Dowagiac and Decatur roughly along the <b>current</b> <b>path</b> of M-51. Then it {{traveled to the}} northeast where it entered Paw Paw and continued north to Allegan. By 1921, M-40 is shown on maps extending south of Niles to the Indiana state line, but not extending to Allegan. The segment from Niles south {{was used for the}} routing of US31 in 1926. A section of the highway was realigned in the same time period near Paw Paw. After the change, M-40 followed the contemporary US12 instead of Paw Paw Road. A rerouting of M-89 in 1927 shifted it to run from Allegan southeast to Plainwell instead of east to Martin; M-40 replaced M-89 on the Allegan–Martin roadway. In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin was removed and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was extended to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. The last segment of unpaved highway was paved in late 1945 or early 1946. This segment was near Dunningville in central Allegan County.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of electrical charges produces {{a magnetic field}} (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning <b>current</b> <b>path</b> passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less resistive path. One theory suggests that lodestones, natural magnets encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.|$|E

This includes photography by tourists and railfans. Although there have been US Supreme Court decisions stating that casual photography is covered by the First Amendment, the case law is mixed. While {{it is clear that}} under the law PATH employees may not force a casual photographer to destroy or surrender their film or images, confiscations and arrests have occurred.

25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a <b>current</b> <b>path,</b> although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to build}} a line from Bay Ridge through East New York to Valley Stream, in 1870, the New York and Hempstead Railroad was incorporated. The line was leased by the South Side Railroad {{after two years of}} grading and excavating, but because of the {{financial}} panic of 1873 the project was drawn to a halt. This concept was resurrected when the New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad was created in 1875, with its line following the <b>current</b> <b>path</b> of the Bay Ridge Branch freight branch of the LIRR. The line was finished up to Bath Junction {{by the end of the}} Summer 1876, where it crossed the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad, the predecessor of the BMT West End line of the New York City Subway. In August 1876, the two railroads made a temporary agreement that allowed passenger trains to run from Bay Ridge to Coney Island.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve on the poor {{harmonic}} performance of the two-level converter, some HVDC systems have been built with three level converters. [...] Three-level converters can synthesize three (instead of only two) discrete voltage levels at the AC terminal of each phase: [...] +½ Ud, 0 and -½ Ud. [...] A common type of three-level converter is the diode-clamped (or neutral-point-clamped) converter, where each phase contains four IGBT valves, each rated at half of the DC line to line voltage, along with two clamping diode valves. The DC capacitor is split into two series-connected branches, with the clamping diode valves connected between the capacitor midpoint and the one-quarter and three-quarter points on each phase. To obtain a positive output voltage (+½ Ud) the top two IGBT valves are turned on, to obtain a negative output voltage (-½ Ud) the bottom two IGBT valves are turned on and to obtain zero output voltage the middle two IGBT valves are turned on. In this latter state, the two clamping diode valves complete the <b>current</b> <b>path</b> through the phase.|$|E
