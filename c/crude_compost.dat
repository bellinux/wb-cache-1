40|$|A cellulolytic, {{thermophilic}} actinomycete (previously {{isolated from}} municipal refuse compost samples) {{was identified as}} Thermomonospora curvata. A determination {{was made of the}} optimal conditions for cellulase production by T. curvata when grown at 55 C in a medium containing mineral salts, cellulose, and yeast extract. The pH and temperature optima (pH 6. 0 and 65 C) for the cellulase produced by T. curvata were identical to those previously observed for the cellulase extracted from <b>crude</b> <b>compost</b> samples. Such similarities, together with the prevalence of T. curvata in compost samples and its ability to grow at composting temperatures, indicate that this actinomycete could possibly be considered as a major cellulose decomposer in the municipal refuse composting process...|$|E
40|$|Several {{research}} {{studies have shown}} the importance of using compost for containers seedlings production. In this context, the present study attempts to hydro-physically optimize growing media formed of Acacia cyanophylla <b>crude</b> <b>compost</b> mixed {{with olive oil and}} livestock manures wastes Co-compost. The contribution of co-compost was carried out according to different proportions to determine mixtures that have the best physical characteristics (total porosity, aeration and retention porosity, dry bulk density) and moisture content (pF curves, water availability and time of rewetting) for optimum forest seedling growth. The results have shown that the incorporation of 20 % rabbit manures Co-compost, 50 % olive wastes Co-compost, 50 % ovine manures Co-compost and 50 % cattle manures Co-compost with Acacia cyanophylla compost have shown relatively better results. The raw Acacia cyanophylla compost has showed good air content and insufficient moisture content. Mixed with Olive wastes Co-compost, he has proved an unsatisfactory air content, but water availability was good...|$|E
40|$|Agaricus bisporus, grown under {{standard}} composting conditions, {{was evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to produce lignin-degrading peroxidases, which have been shown to have an integral role in lignin degradation by wood-rotting fungi. The activity of manganese peroxidase was monitored throughout the production cycle of the fungus, from the time of colonization of the compost through the development of fruit bodies. Characterization of the enzyme was done with a <b>crude</b> <b>compost</b> extract. Manganese peroxidase was found to have a pI of 3. 5 and a pH optimum of 5. 4 to 5. 5, with maximal activity during the initial stages of fruiting (pin stage). The activity declined considerably with fruit body maturation (first break). This apparent developmentally regulated pattern parallels that observed for laccase activity and for degradation of radiolabeled lignin and synthetic lignins by A. bisporus. Lignin peroxidase activity was not detected in the compost extracts. The correlation between the activities of manganese peroxidase and laccase and the degradation of lignin in A. bisporus suggests significant roles for these two enzymes in lignin degradation by this fungus...|$|E
40|$|Crude {{glycerin}} as {{by-product of}} bio diesel fuels. For every 1 ton of biodiesel produced, approximately 100 kg of glycerol is also created. It is unworthily waste for most small-scale producers {{due to the}} large investment in technology necessary for the refining process, although {{it is possible to}} refine crude glycerin into a marketable product. In order to reuse it efficiently, we conducted a field trial to confirm an effect of crude glycerol as an accelerator material in composting of felled wood tips. Addition of 1 % and 10 % of crude glycerol gave high fermentation temperature by 5 ℃ and 10 ℃ than that of control for one month. As a result of fertilizer component analysis, <b>crude</b> glycerol treated <b>compost</b> has equivalent components to control.

3000|$|The use of {{microorganisms}} in remediating environmental contaminants such as crude oil sludge {{has become a}} promising technique owing to its economy and the fact it is environmentally friendly. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as the major components of oil sludge, are hydrophobic and recalcitrant.

40|$|The {{use of the}} Peat (T) {{mixed with}} of methacompost of poultry (MCA) with / without {{addition}} of <b>crude</b> forestry <b>compost</b> (CSB) in the substrate of culture prepared has been an experiment in soilless nursery. The growth and survival of tomato plants, among other things, were studied in two experiments, one mixes on MCA + T {{and the other on}} mixtures CSB + T + MCA, as compared with the reference substrate (T). The tests performed confirmed that the incorporation of MCA and CSB with T provides slightly better growth in height of tomato plants while limiting bleeding Force by imports of peat substrates. Statistically, there was not observed {{a significant difference between the}} height of plants. Height growth of tomato plants was influenced by the type of partial substitute. In this regard, we find that plants grown on substrates mixture have stunted growth due to the apparent phytotoxicity of methacompost of poultry, physical quality and especially its water unsuitable behavior. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of environmental toxicants with organic substances deserve increasing attention. These interactions affect the speciation and dynamics of toxicants, and subsequently affect the toxicity, mobility, and fate of toxicants in the environment. Furthermore, they indirectly affect {{the quality of}} crops and human health, when the toxicants are absorbed and accumulated by plants. The objectives of this study were to investigate the binding strength of arsenic and organic substances, as well as the effects of organic substances on the mobility and reduction of arsenate. In addition, the influence of organic fertilizer application on arsenic mobility in soil and arsenic content of rice (Oryza Sativa L.) plant in paddy field condition were also studied with lysimeter experiment. Arsenate containing solution was prepared to react with the <b>crude</b> <b>compost</b> extract (CCE) which was extracted from swine compost with deionized (DI) water, and to incubate for 48 hours at 25 ℃. The formation of As-organic complex was investigated by dialysis and ion-exchange methods. The results show that arsenic bonds to organic substances in the presence of cations, which act as a cation bridge in As-humic complex. The effect of organic substances on the adsorption of arsenate by soil was conducted by using CCE as a complex anion source in batch experiment. Two higher arsenic content of calcareous slate alluvial soils of an Inceptisol (Fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermics, Typic Epiaquept, Chiwulan series, with arsenic content of 23. 7 mg kg- 1), and of an Entisol (Sandy-skeletal, mixed, hyperthermic, Lithic Udorthents, Shuipientou series, with arsenic content of 12. 9 mg kg- 1) were used. The adsorption of arsenate by both soils decreases in the presence of CCE when the amount of arsenate added in the reaction systems are lower than the arsenic adsorption maximum of both soils. However, the adsorption increases in the presence of CCE. When the amount of arsenate added in the reaction system are higher than the arsenic adsorption maximum of both soils. These may be attributed to competitive adsorption for binding sites on the soils between arsenic oxyanion and organic anions. The data of arsenate reacted with 1 % of CCE reveal that As(V) is capable of reducing to As(III). The reduction of As(V) at 25 ℃, but not at 4 ℃ and 60 ℃ verifies the biotic process. The same soil samples as used in batch experiment were used in lysimeter experiment. Rice plants were grown in the soils amended with various fertilizers in lysimeter column. The leachates of lysimeters were collected for arsenic determination every two weeks during the growing period of rice plants. The As contents of soil samples including surface soils (0 - 20 cm in depth), bottom soils (20 - 40 cm in depth), as well as rice plants were also determined after the rice plants were harvested. The results show that prolonged flooding of the soils in the lysimeter columns leads to a markedly decrease in soil redox potential for all treatments. This may result in the precipitation of the free arsenics in soil solution as solid arsenics or arsenate sulfides. Quite low arsenic concentrations (leaf > stem > brown rice. By comparing the arsenic contents in rice roots of each treatment, it was found that both treatments with no fertilization and with organic fertilizer fertilization were higher than those with chemical fertilizer fertilization and with half chemical-half organic fertilizer fertilization. As a result of phosphate deficiency in soils with no fertilization and with organic fertilizer fertilization. Arsenic may become the substitute for the phosphate and be absorbed by rice roots. Moreover, the organic anions may compete with arsenic oxyanions for the adsorption sites on the soils, and subsequently increase the release of arsenic from the soils. These thus increase the arsenic absorption by rice plants from soils with no fertilization and with organic fertilizer fertilization. In conclusion, organic substances may decrease the adsorption of arsenic by soils, and/or cause the reduction of As(V) to more toxic and mobile form of As(III), leading to both groundwater and crop contamination by arsenic. Therefore, the consideration of the application of organic fertilizer to high arsenic content soils deserve close attention. 環境毒物與有機物之交互作用會影響毒物之物種變化與動態，進而影響其在環境中之生物毒性、移動性與宿命，間接影響作物品質與人體健康。本研究之目的在於探討砷與有機物之結合以及有機物對砷被土壤吸附與有機物對砷酸還原之影響，再者，亦探討有機肥施用對砷含量偏高土壤中砷移動與作物中砷含量之影響。經由吸附試驗、透析法與離子交換法等探討砷酸與堆肥之水抽出液中有機物之結合，發現砷酸可與堆肥水抽出液中腐植質結合，此砷酸與有機物之結合是藉由陽離子鍵橋之鍵結。以淇武蘭系(Fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermics, Typic Epiaquept) 及水汴頭系 (Sandy-skeletal, mixed, hyperthermic, Lithic Udorthents) 二種砷含量偏高之石灰性黏板岩沖積土(砷含量分別為 23. 7 mg kg- 1 及 12. 9 mg kg- 1) ，利用批次平衡試驗探討有機物對砷酸被土壤吸附之影響，結果顯示土壤溶液中有機陰離子與砷酸相互競爭吸附位置，當砷酸添加量低於土壤砷之最大吸附量時，堆肥抽出液之加入，可降低土壤對砷酸之吸附；當砷酸添加量高於土壤砷之最大吸附量時，砷酸之加入，可降低土壤對有機物之吸附。不同濃度堆肥水抽出液與砷酸反應之結果，發現砷酸與有機物共存之系統中，砷酸可還原為亞砷酸，依據反應在室溫 (25 ℃) 下可發生，在 4 ℃ 及 50 ℃ 無法發生之現象，可推知此反應為生物性還原反應。利用盆栽試驗施用不同肥料種植水稻，探討前述二種砷含量偏高土壤中砷之移動性及生物累積性，發現水田狀態下，不論施用有機及或無機肥料，土壤皆呈強還原性，游離砷還原為元素態砷或形成硫化砷沉殿。稻株中砷含量由高而低依序為：根>葉>莖>糙米。稻根中砷含量以不施肥者最高，其次為施用有機肥者，而以施用化肥及半有機半化肥者為最低，由於不施肥者缺乏磷肥供應，施用有機肥者磷肥供應速率太慢或供應量不足，作物吸收砷以替代磷，再者，土壤中有機陰離子與砷酸陰離子產生競爭吸附，促進砷之釋出，致使作物吸砷量增高。由於有機物可降低砷在土壤中之吸附或使砷酸還原為亞砷酸，增加砷在土壤中之移動性及生物毒性，提高作物吸砷量及地下水砷含量，因此，吾人須慎重考量關於砷含量偏高土壤施用有機肥之問題。封面 摘要 英文摘要 目錄 表次 圖次 第一章 前言 第二章 前人研究 一、砷之特性 二、砷在本省環境中之分佈 三、砷在環境中型態之轉變 四、砷之吸附 五、砷物種之型態與毒理 六、土壤有機物之特性 七、砷與有機物之交互作用 八、陰離子與陰離子間之吸附 九、環境中砷物種之分離與測定 第三章 砷與有機物之反應 一、前言 二、材料與方法 三、結果與討論 四、結論 第四章 有機物對砷酸被土壤吸附之影響 一、前言 二、材料與方法 三、結果與討論 四、結論 第五章 堆肥抽出液對砷之還原 一、前言 二、材料與方法 三、結果與討論 四、結論 第六章 有機質肥料施用對水稻田滲濾水中砷含量、土壤中砷移動性及水稻對砷吸收之影響 一、前言 二、材料與方法 三、結果與討論 四、結論 第七章 總結 參考文獻 附...|$|E

In this study, crude oil sludge was composted for 16  weeks during which surfactants were added {{in the form of}} a solution. Results Molecular characterisation of the 16 S rRNA genes indicated that the isolates obtained on a mineral salts medium belonged to different genera, including Stenotrophmonas, Pseudomonas, Bordetella, Brucella, Bacillus, Achromobacter, Ochrobactrum, Advenella, Mycobacterium, Mesorhizobium, Klebsiella, Pusillimonas and Raoultella. The percentage degradation rates of these isolates were estimated by measuring the absorbance of the 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol medium. Pseudomonas emerged as the top degrader with an estimated percentage degradation rate of 73. 7 % after 7  days of incubation at 28  °C. In addition, the presence of the catabolic gene, catechol- 2, 3 -dioxygenase was detected in the bacteria isolates as well as in evolutionary classifications based on phylogeny.
