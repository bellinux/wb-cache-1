5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of 2n=20. In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of 2n=40, and {{hypothesized}} {{that it was}} of hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E
5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} per individual varies {{from one to}} over 70 among the species in the genus. The genome of M. pilosula is contained on {{a single pair of}} chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number possible for any animal, and workers of this species are homologous. Like M. pilosula, M. croslandi also contains a single chromosome. While these ants only have a single chromosome, M. pyriformis contains 41 chromosomes while M. brevinoda contains 42. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> for M. piliventris and M. fulvipes is 2 and 12, respectively. The genus Myrmecia retains many traits that are considered basal for all ants (i.e. workers foraging alone and relying on visual cues).|$|E
5|$|Published <b>chromosome</b> <b>counts</b> {{exist for}} two species, Aiphanes minima and A.horrida; haploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>counts</b> vary from 15 to 18.

25|$|Karyotypes {{describe}} the <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope.

The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{round to}} egg-shaped seed {{capsules}} open when dry into two halves, exposing numerous small (0.5–1mm), brown seeds. If moisture is present the silique closes, protecting the seed and opening again upon dryness {{to allow for}} wind dispersal. Many species have a net-like pattern on their seed surface {{to allow them to}} land on water surfaces without sinking, since many non-epiphytic butterworts grow near water sources. The haploid chromosome number of butterworts is either n = 8 or n = 11 (or a multiple thereof), depending on species. The exception is P. lusitanica, whose <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> is n = 6.|$|E
500|$|Until Owen {{published}} a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. [...] In {{the late eighteenth}} century, for example, the aye-aye was classified under the squirrel genus Sciurus. [...] By emphasizing its primate features, such as its postorbital bar, stereoscopic vision, and opposable hallux, over its rodent-like teeth, Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates. [...] In 1996, Ankel-Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the aye-aye's diminutive deciduous incisors indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the toothcombed primates. [...] However, {{the placement of the}} aye-aye within the primates remained problematic until very recently. [...] The karyotype of the aye-aye is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives, the lorises {{and the rest of the}} lemurs, with a diploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of 2n=30. [...] Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and an indeterminate taxon within the primates. In 1931, Schwarz labeled the aye-aye as an offshoot of Indriidae, claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic, whereas Reginald Innes Pocock had previously placed the aye-aye outside of the lemurs. [...] In that same year, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [...] Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs, despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remaining}} two species, B. lamellata und B. gigantea, make up {{what is known}} as the B. gigantea complex.

The original haploid <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of this complex is x=8. The diploid number is therefore 2n=16, whereas the tetraploid species B. liniflora is 2n=32.|$|E
2500|$|Horse-donkey hybrids {{are almost}} always sterile because horses have 64 {{chromosomes}} whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes. Mules are much more common than hinnies. This {{is believed to be}} caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the <b>chromosome</b> <b>count</b> of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jenney). [...] The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different mating behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys. Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce, and it is unquestioned that mules are more common in total number.|$|E
