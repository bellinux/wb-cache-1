5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a <b>crimped</b> hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess wire <b>crimp</b> terminations is discussed. The {{development of}} a prototype instrument, based on a modified, commercially available, <b>crimp</b> tool, is demonstrated for applying this technique when wire <b>crimps</b> are installed. The <b>crimp</b> tool has three separate <b>crimping</b> locations that accommodate the three different ferrule diameters. The <b>crimp</b> tool in this study is capable of <b>crimping</b> wire diameters ranging from 12 to 26 American Wire Gauge (AWG). A transducer design is presented that allows for interrogation of each of the three <b>crimp</b> locations on the <b>crimp</b> tool without reconfiguring the device. An analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse is shown to correlate to both <b>crimp</b> location in the tool and the AWG of the crimp/ferrule combination. The detectability of a number of the <b>crimp</b> failure pathologies, such as missing strands, partially inserted wires and incomplete <b>crimp</b> compression, is discussed.

40|$|Minimization of {{response}} times and costs and maximization of {{the efficiency and}} quality in producing a product are imperative for survival in the competitive manufacturing industry. Sheet metal forming is a widely used and costly manufacturing process, to which these considerations apply. This work will be done to study the finite element (elastic-plastic) analysis of sheet metal <b>crimp</b> forming process using the finite element software. Ansys simulation is carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of <b>crimp</b> forming process. Simulation of elastoplastic behavior of aluminum sheet is carried out with non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal <b>crimping</b> process. Maximum stress regions are identified. This can be improved by suitable curvature radius which is possible once FEM process is understood. In the present work contact elements are generated between <b>crimp</b> and <b>crimp</b> nut and the sliding dies for forming process. The contact pressure, vonmises stress and load requirements are captured for different angle of <b>crimp</b> sheets. The results shows drop in <b>crimp</b> load requirements with <b>crimp</b> metal inclination. Also a uniformity of contact is observed between <b>crimp</b> nut and <b>crimp</b> metal which is desirable feature for leak proof joints. Also iterations are carried out to find 3 layer <b>crimp</b> formation {{which is the best}} formation method for leak proof joints by adjusting the <b>crimp</b> metal and <b>crimp</b> nut lengths.

The residual deformation and internal {{stress of the}} self-crimp yarn can be eliminated after the moist heat treatment, {{in order to develop}} the favorable <b>crimp</b> extension and <b>crimp</b> recovery of the self-crimp yarn, and to give the loomage soft handle and good dimension stability. <b>Crimp</b> shrinkage, <b>crimp</b> module, etc, of the different types of PET/PTT yarn, were tested, and the axial morphology of the yarn was observed, to investigate the effect of linear density, moist heat temperature on PET/PTT yarn...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{ultrasonic}} inspection provides a means of assessing electrical <b>crimp</b> quality that ensures the electrical and mechanical integrity of an initial <b>crimp</b> before the installation process is completed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating {{at right angles to}} the wire axis and through the junction of a <b>crimp</b> termination was shown to correlate with the results of destructive pull tests, which is a standard for assessing <b>crimp</b> wire junction quality. Of additional concern are <b>crimps</b> made at high speed assembly lines for wiring harnesses, which are used for critical applications, such as in aircraft. During high-speed assembly it is possible that many faulty <b>crimps</b> go undetected until long after assembly, and fail in service. The position and speed of the <b>crimping</b> jaw become factors as the high-speed <b>crimp</b> is formed. The work presented in this paper is designed to cover the more difficult and more subtle area of high-speed <b>crimps</b> by taking into account the rate change of the measurements. Building on the previous work, we present an analysis methodology, based on transmitted ultrasonic energy and timing of the first received pulse that is shown to correlate to the gauge of the crimp/ferrule combination and the position of the <b>crimping</b> jaw. Results demonstrating the detectability of a number of the <b>crimp</b> failure pathologies, such as missing strands, partially inserted wires and incomplete <b>crimp</b> compression, are presented. The ability of this technique to estimate <b>crimp</b> height, a mechanical measure of <b>crimp</b> quality, is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Numbats {{breed in}} February and March, {{normally}} producing one litter a year, although they {{can produce a}} second if the first is lost. Gestation lasts 15 days, and results in the birth of four young.

25|$|At small strains, elastin confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, <b>crimped).</b> With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E
25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a <b>crimped</b> or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E

30|$|The {{waviness}} or {{distortion of}} a yarn that {{is due to}} interlacing in the fabric is termed as <b>crimp.</b> In woven fabrics, the <b>crimp</b> {{is measured by the}} relation between the length of the fabric sample and the corresponding length of yarn when it is removed there from and straightened under suitable tension. <b>Crimp</b> may be expressed numerically as percentage <b>crimp</b> or <b>crimp</b> ratio. Position of whip roller has significant effect on Crimp% of woven fabric as warp yarn tension is an important player in case of crimp%.

500|$|Another trait {{unique to}} {{domestic}} sheep {{as compared to}} wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly <b>crimped,</b> to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even {{among members of the}} same flock, so wool classing {{is a step in the}} commercial processing of the fibre.Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding. Ewes typically weigh between , and rams between [...] When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. This means that the dental formula for sheep is either [...] or [...] There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.|$|E
