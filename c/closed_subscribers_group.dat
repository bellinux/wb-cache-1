The Femtocell is the right answer to fulfill the cellular telecommunication system requirements nowadays. The Femtocell is used to cover the areas with a low signal from the Macrocell and also the areas that need a bigger data rate. When using the Femtocell it can produces sometimes interference signals to the Macrocell in uplink {{as well as in}} downlink communication because not all of the users can be connected to the Femtocell in a <b>Closed</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Group</b> Femtocell system.

In order to overcome this problematic situation, our approach proposes the use of ONs for the infrastructure capacity extension through femtocells. Femtocells are fully featured but low power BSs that operate in licenced spectrum in order to connect mobile terminals to the network of an operator through residential broadband connections [16]. Therefore, the signal strength improves significantly resulting in better QoS.

In this case, the information required to perform the inter-cell user association might exchange among the cells in only some tiers. For example, it is not allowed that a user is offloaded to a cell for a <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) {{if it is not}} a member of the corresponding CSG [30].

30|$|The UL {{signalling}} based scheme {{introduced in}} this paper has several advantages {{with respect to the}} state-of-the-art scheme from [6]. First of all, the macro cell can use the reported information from small cells in the on state, e.g., their current system load, during the connection establishment procedure, to help selecting the best small cell candidate for a UE. Furthermore, the fact that the macro cell is responsible for the UE small cell connection triggering event makes it possible for the macro cell to send a wake-up signal configuration message to the UE before the UE sends the wake-up signal, which can limit the effect of the wake-up signal so that it only affects a limited number of small cells, such as small cells belonging to a specific <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG), or small cells offering a specific amount of bandwidth.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} {{problem is}} the provision of high-quality services within vehicles on the move. One possible solution {{to address the problem}} in the future will be the deployment of a relay within the vehicle. The relay can be connected to the vehicular rooftop antenna, in order to establish a robust (relay/backhaul) link to the cellular network. On the other hand, relays allow for optimum coverage conditions inside the vehicle and a certain control of the consumed resources through the usage of <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups.</b> Since the use of a relay eliminates the vehicle penetration loss (VPL) and provides additional antenna gains due to better characteristics of the rooftop antenna, this solution improves significantly the link budget [20] and allows for a more efficient resource utilization of the cellular network. However, in current LTE networks, an additional overhead burden due to signaling exists (around 10 %), and therefore, the benefit from the use of those relays is to be demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|Femtocell base {{stations}} (FBSs) are low-power nodes to provide high throughput and customized services to users, and together with macrocells, they form heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Deploying femtocells {{is an effective}} and efficient way to increase wireless network capacity, and it provides great benefits to network operators by producing new services. Along with their small size, low cost, and plug-and-play features[1, 2], femtocells are considered as a big thing[3] in both existing and future mobile communications. On the other hand, with their marked development, femtocells tend to be large-scale and self-organized[4], which brings a big challenge for interference management. More specially, to satisfy femtocell occupants’ self-interests, most of them prefer to configure their networks as <b>Closed</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Group</b> (CSG) mode, i.e., users cannot access a specific femtocell without authorization and hence will cause interference to nearby macrocell users (MUEs). Moreover, nearby femtocells would interfere with {{each other as they}} become denser, thereby deteriorating network performance.|$|R
40|$|In Long Term Evolution (LTE) /LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks, hybrid access femtocells {{have been}} {{introduced}} as a tradeoff between closed and open access femtocells. However, quality of service (QoS) provisioning in hybrid access femtocells has become more challenging due to different user priority and traffic classes. Existing studies do not consider the LTE/LTE-A protocols and QoS priority of different traffic classes. In this work, a resource management scheme for prioritizing <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) members and QoS provisioning in LTE/LTE-A hybrid access femtocells is proposed.

40|$|To {{meet the}} surging demand for throughput, 5 G {{cellular}} networks {{need to be}} more heterogeneous and much denser, by deploying more and more small cells. In particular, the number of users in each small cell can change dramatically due to users' mobility, resulting in random and time varying uplink interference. This paper considers the uplink interference in a 5 G heterogeneous network which is jointly covered by one macro cell and several small cells. Based on the Lévy flight moving model, a mobility-aware interference model is proposed to characterize the uplink interference from macro cell users to small cell users. In this model, the total uplink interference is characterized by its moment generating function, for both <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) and open <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed interference model is a function of basic step length, which is a key velocity parameter of Lévy flights.

30|$|The FAPs {{can operate}} in three {{different}} access control modes: closed access, open access, and hybrid access [2, 3]. A closed access mode corresponds to the case when only small group of users are allowed to connect to the FAPs.

This option is suitable for FAPs owners who {{do not wish to}} share their backhaul link for which they have to pay. On the other hand, an open access mode is allowing all passersby users to access the FAPs. The FAPs operating in open access can help to alleviate traffic load of macrobase stations (MBS) by serving some of its users. The last access mode, that is, hybrid access mode, is a sort of compromise between the closed and open access. A certain part of the FAPs bandwidth is always dedicated for users belonging to the CSG, {{while the rest of the}} bandwidth can be utilized by all passing users.|$|R

30|$|The {{implementation}} of our interference coordination approach demands {{the exchange of}} control information between victim FUE and interfering FAP. In our system model, we consider that this signaling exchange is done over the air in a single-hop fashion, relaxing the requirement of having a backhaul femto gateway (FGW) connection that supports real time control message exchange using a two-hop approach (i.e., relaying the control information from serving to interfering FAP). Note that actually, 3 GPP Rel. 10 supports an X 2 -like interface between FAPs. However, the information exchange over X 2 is time constrained due to delay issues, especially when dealing with FAPs that belong to different <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> (CSGs). Although {{it will take some}} years until Rel. 10 products become widely available in the market, the main limitation for using control messages over X 2 is that the quality of this interface is not expected to improve considerably in the future (especially for residential customers that use xDSL connections as backhaul). Thus, standardizing effective over the air control mechanisms is important, to be able to implement interference coordination schemes within femtocell environments in a simple way.|$|R
40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} in cellular {{networks that}} comprise multiple base stations types imposes new challenges in network planning and deployment of future generation of cellular networks.

30|$|In the literature, {{existing}} research works on capacity analysis of small cells are studied by considering different frequency allocation schemes and interference issues. In terms of uplink capacity analysis in hierarchical networks, both the <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) access mode and open access mode are considered in orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} (OFDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA)-based femtocell networks in [8]. Furthermore, the macrocell users’ density is proposed as a key factor to the optimal selection of CSG and open access modes, where the open access mode is preferred when macrocell users’ density is small. Moreover, open access mode is applied in {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA)-based femtocell networks in [11]. A distributed orthogonal frequency allocation scheme is proposed by using the optimal frequency allocation ratio between femtocell and macrocell networks in [12] to minimize the interference among different layers in hierarchical networks. In [13], both the joint and disjoint subchannel allocation schemes are proposed for two-tier networks with quality-of-service constraints in terms of success probabilities and per-tier minimum rates. Considering the frequency allocation in hierarchical networks, a hybrid orthogonal frequency allocation scheme is proposed in [14], which considers about the distance between femtocell and macrocell and the interference constraint area (ILCA) factor.|$|R
30|$|Open access allows all {{the users}} in the network to connect within the {{coverage}} range. Closed access only allows particular users into the femtocell service with less sharing of bandwidth. This particular <b>group</b> is named <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG). There is another mode called hybrid access where a limited femtocell service are available for all the users but only the CSG are allowed to use the highest service. In a dense network, open access is a reason for increased number of handover and mobility events. It also shares bandwidth that might decrease the satisfaction level of femtocell owners. It increases {{the capacity of the}} network, thus sacrificing network stability. Closed access thus avoids frequent handover and mobility events, but under its superior coverage, it continuously influences the unwanted user to send out handover requests. This induces a new set of cross-tier interference. Hybrid access deals with both problem by adjusting resources according to the number of femtocell owners and subscribers [3, 4]. However, for different density of users and femtocell locations, most of the algorithms are outperformed in practical implementation. Then again, owners buy femtocell for their personal benefits. They do not like to share the bandwidth with the random number of user unless they are within their residence.|$|R
30|$|From the {{practical}} implementation {{point of view}} {{there are a few}} key issues that need to be addressed. First, the method relies on a control-only connection over the air in the cross-link, which should be included in 3 GPP standardization to implement the proposed interference coordination method when dealing with closed-access FAPs (the exchange of control information over an X 2 like interface seems more reasonable when FAPs belong to the same <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group).</b> Second, in order to balance the rates, the two FAPs {{should be aware of the}} current rates that are supported at both femtocells, to be able to calculate the corresponding scheduling threshold value and choose the number of bits for TBF purposes (along with the corresponding egoistic/altruistic beamforming strategy). In a practical system, however, this could be handled so that the victim user sends a silence request (SR) and the selected TBF weight information (for interference mitigation) whenever the strength of the cross-link is high, and the interfering FAP decides on the interference mitigation strategy to be applied independently (i.e., based on the requirements of the FUE that it serves). The optimality of the proposed method greatly depends on the selected criterion (e.g., max-min rate or sum rate) and is, to a large extent, a practical system design issue.|$|R
30|$|A more {{challenging}} interference situation is obtained {{by dividing the}} UEs and BSs into two <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> (CSGs) operating on a shared band. The UEs of the two CSGs are still distributed evenly over the floor, but are only allowed to connect to own CSG BS, which may be much further away than the closest BS. Figure 4 (b) shows the resulting throughput distributions. As expected, the PF scheduler is struggling with coverage due to the very high amount of interference between the two CSGs. Interference awareness is able {{to get rid of}} the coverage issue completely and make the shared band operation for two CSGs possible. The difference between the IA scheduler and the global optimum is very small compared to the gain relative to PF scheduler, and we may conclude that very high gain in system utility can be obtained with the proposed distributed scheme. Note that one can estimate a rough upper bound on the performance of a system where the two CSGs use orthogonal bands by scaling the no CSG results of Figure 4 (a) by half. It can be seen that the shared band solution with IA scheduler would beat the orthogonal bands PF scheduler by a significant margin.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} of xDSL backhaul capacity {{is a vital}} issue {{that needs to be}} addressed. Recent 3 GPP standardization activities assert that it shall be possible for the network to set different criteria for access control in a hybrid cell for a <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) and non-CSG members [10]. These different criteria incur conflicting results and this problem can be tackled by specific admission control policies, as addressed in our related work in [11]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no other work in the literature dealing with the efficient integration of femtocell and IP traffic. The proposed CA-FEI framework can be considered as complementary to [12], which presents a scheme for dynamic service-level agreement negotiation between the ISP provider and the femtocell operator, aiming to tackle the problem of xDSL line’s varying capacity. In general, our proposed scheme adopts a hybrid partitioning policy [13] and can be classified within the family of admission control schemes designed for the integration of heterogeneous networks, such as [14 – 17]. However, such schemes are not directly applicable in our case as either (a) they consider significantly different system models, which in most cases include networks that have their own separate links to the core network or (b) they support basic QoS features that are not compatible with the strict QoS requirements of a femtocell.|$|R

In this paper, an energy-effcient cell breathing and offoading mechanism in both macrocellular and heterogeneous networks is studied. First, the need for {{limiting the number of}} Macro-BSs switched off and the control of cell sizes are analyzed. An approach based on the use of a traffic threshold from a technique previously proposed by our team is applied in order to control the BS switching-off aggressiveness. One reason for limiting this aggressiveness is the trade-off we point out between the existing RAN power consumption and the transmission power in uplink for mobile devices.

30|$|A {{cellular}} network is a radio network {{made up of}} a number of radio cells. Each cell is served by a base station (BS) to provide radio coverage over a limited area. A macrocell has the widest range of cell size and is served by high-power BS with antennas mounted above rooftops. A femtocell has the coverage of 10 – 50 m and is served by an indoor BS to support stationary or low-mobility users at homes or in small offices. The BS of femtocell is usually user-installed with a connection to the cellular operator network through a wired broadband backhaul such as digital subscriber line (DSL). Furthermore, the cells of different sizes can be deployed in a hierarchical cell structure (HCS) to provide multi-tier network connectivity [1, 2]. Macrocells are deployed as one radio tier to cover wide areas, and femtocells are embedded inside macrocells as another radio tier to supply sporadic overage. This overlaying approach has benefits on capacity gain, better coverage, and reduced battery consumption of handsets [3]. In this article, we consider a two-tier 3 GPP long term evolution (LTE) network made up of macrocells and underlaid femtocells. Within the overlapped coverage areas in such a two-tier system, a user equipment (UE) can access either macrocell or femtocell and can switch its access tier by performing vertical handoff. Specifically, when a femtocell is configured in the <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) manner (also called “closed access”), only the users included in the femtocell’s access control list are allowed to use the femtocell resources. On the other hand, a femtocell can also be configured in the open access manner, in which any user is allowed access to the femtocell. For simplicity in this article, a UE is called an MUE when it is associated with a macrocell BS (namely eNodeB or eNB in LTE network), and it is called a HUE when it is associated with a femtocell BS (namely Home eNodeB or HeNB in LTE network).|$|R

Achieving phase synchronization for indoor femtocells will {{be beneficial for}} time division duplexing (TDD) operation and inter-cell interference cancellation and management techniques, but challenging to achieve as global positioning system does not work indoors. In this thesis, we propose coordinated transmission and reception algorithms to reduce interference across BSs, and thereby achieve better network-wide phase synchronization over the air. We also cover the problem of selecting component carriers for dense small cell network, by improving the throughput of cell-edge user equipment's (UEs). We propose three strategies: Selfish, Altruistic and Symmetric for primary carrier selection and remove the outage of the macro UEs near the <b>closed</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) femtocells. Further, we propose dynamic frequency selection algorithm for component carrier selection, where decisions to select or drop a carrier are based on gain/loss predictions made from UE handover measurements. Thereby, we maximize the sum utility of the dense femtocell network, which includes mean-rate, weighted fair-rate, proportional fair-rate and max-min utility.   Mobile backhaul dimensioning is studied to improve the handover and provide the cost-effective backhaul opportunity for femtocells deployed in emerging markets. In a packet-switched wireless system e. g. LTE, data packets are needed to be efficiently forwarded between BSs during handover over the backhaul. We improve the packet forwarding handover mechanism by {{reducing the amount of}} forwarded data between BSs. Another challenge lies in equipping the femtocells with backhaul, where copper cable, optical fiber or microwave radio links are expensive options for unplanned emerging market case.

Moreover, we aimed to analyze the system performance (metrics) in the presence of Inter-cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) techniques based on Time Domain Resource Partitioning (TDRP) and Frequency Domain Resource Partitioning (FDRP). As part of the initial objectives, we aimed to characterize the new interference scenarios consequent from the presence of CSG cells and contrast the performance of the system with the case when we have Open Access (OA) LPNs in the system. Furthermore, we simulated cases where the User Equipment (UEs) had the capability to perform Cell-specific Reference Signal Interference Cancellation (CRS-IC) in contrast to the studies where the UEs were not capable of performing CRS-IC. The simulations were performed in a heavily loaded traffic scenario (15 Mbps & 10 LPNs per macro cell area) with 20 % of the total users clustered around CSG LPNs. It was observed that in the presence of UEs capable of performing CRS-IC, incorporation of the CSG cells brings about 20 % increase in the overall macro cell area T. P for DL and about 47 % increase in the same for UL. Furthermore, the system capacity (i. e. the no. of UEs supported) was also seen to increase (17 % for DL and 15 % for UL respectively). However for the same scenario, when the system contained UEs not capable of performing CRS-IC, CSG cells tend to degrade the system capacity (10 % degradation), followed by 18 % decrease in the overall macro cell area throughput in DL. This is mainly due to high interference (due to CRS transmission) experienced by the un-authorized macro UEs in the DL. With regard to the case when ICIC techniques are employed in the system, we simulate the Almost Blank Sub-frame (ABS) technique with CSG LPN cells muting their transmission in alternate sub-frames and contrast it to the FDRP scenario where the transmission from the LPN cells is limited to 50 % of the total bandwidth (with no muting employed). In general it was observed that, in a macro-femto deployment with CSG cells, ICIC techniques do not improve the performance of macro UEs considerably, when compared to the scenario without ICIC schemes in the system (even for the case when there is high UE clustering in the CSG LPNs - 60 % UE clustering).

40|$|Context With {{the rapidly}} growing demand for {{cellular}} networks’ capacityand coverage, effective planning of Network Infrastructure (NI) has been amajor challenge for the telecom operators. The mobility patterns of different <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> in the networks {{have been found to}} be a crucialaspect in the planning of NI. For a telecom operator, it is important to havean estimate of the efficiency (in terms of the Network Capacity - numberof subscribers that the network can handle) of the existing NI. For thispurpose, Lundberg et. al., have developed an optimization based strategycalled as Tetris Strategy (TS), based on the standard subscriber groupingapproach called MOSAIC. The objective of TS is to calculate the upperbound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Objectives The major objective of this thesis is to compare the efficiencyvalue of the NI when the <b>subscribers</b> are <b>grouped</b> (clustered) based on theirmobility patterns (characterized by a mobile trajectory) with the efficiencyvalue obtained when the <b>subscribers</b> are <b>grouped</b> based on the standardsubscriber grouping approach - MOSAIC. Methods Literature Review (LR) has been conducted to identify the stateof the art similarity/distance measures and algorithms to cluster trajectory data. Among the identified ones, for conducting experiments, LongestCommon Subsequences has been chosen as a similarity/distance measure,and Spectral and Agglomerative clustering algorithms have been chosen. All the experiments have been conducted on the subscriber trajectory dataprovided by the telecom operator, Telenor. The clusters obtained from theexperiments have been plugged into TS, to calculate the upper bound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Results For the highest radio cell capacity, the network capacity valuesfor Spectral clustering, Agglomerative clustering and MOSAIC groupingsystem are 207234, 148056 and 87584 respectively. For every radio cellcapacity value, the mobility based clusters resulted in a higher network efficiency values than the MOSAIC. However, both spectral and agglomerativealgorithms have generated a very low quality clusters with the silhouettescores of 0. 0717 and 0. 0543 respectively. Conclusions Based on the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that,mobility based <b>grouping</b> of <b>subscribers</b> in the cellular network provide highernetwork efficiency values compared to the standard <b>subscriber</b> <b>grouping</b> systems such as MOSAIC...|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 The demand for cellular communications is anticipated {{to continue its}} hasty growth in the forthcoming future, triggered by new bandwidth hungry applications such as voice over LTE, high-definition video streaming, and multimedia file sharing in mobile phones. This has placed enormous pressure on cellular communications in terms of demand for Quality of Service (QoS), capacity, and resource management. Henceforth, the apposite utilization of obtainable spectrum is required. Public Safety (PS) organizations’ capability to exchange information is crucial to meliorate the coordination in emergency junctures. Recent catastrophes have underlined the need to enhance broadband and seamless connectivity to the PS organizations. This thesis outlines the governing issues necessitated in this, and also additional requirements of the network are addressed regardless of dynamic channel conditions and locations. In this thesis, subscribers are divided into groups viz., PS <b>groups</b> and regular <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups.</b> A new scheme, beyond the type of services being used by subscribers, priorities and fairness, is developed. In order to abridge operational costs and efforts, SONs (Self Organizing Networks) are implemented in this thesis and the prospects have been discussed. Additionally, Group Scheduling is implemented to achieve better performance for PS and regular <b>subscribers</b> <b>groups.</b> An advanced scheduling algorithm for group scheduling is developed which provides better QoS for multi-services and a better trade-off between Quality of Service and radio resource management. This scheduling algorithm provides a better balance between multi-QoS purveying to support mixes of sensitive traffic and best effort traffic. This phenomenon is used to choose the best <b>subscriber</b> and the <b>group.</b> Several metrics have been devised and are used for this purpose. Extensive simulation results are shown for both the conditions viz., normal and emergency conditions.
