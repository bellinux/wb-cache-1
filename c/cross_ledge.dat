5|$|The liner {{had several}} mishaps during her {{passenger}} career. On 2 March 1903, {{an article in}} The Washington Post reported that Merion had run aground shortly after leaving Queenstown while en route to Liverpool from Boston. The ship was freed from her perch near Chicago Knoll by the rising tide, but when she got underway again became stuck fast in almost the same spot. At press time, two British Admiralty tugs had been dispatched to free the ship. Almost exactly a year later, Merion collided with the steamer Clan Grant off Tuskar Rock on 30 March 1904 and was damaged. On 24 December 1912, Merion collided with a tanker off the Delaware coast and sustained damage which included two flooded compartments. The ship was beached below <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge,</b> but was refloated and made way under her own power back to Philadelphia, after discharging her cargo and passengers.|$|E

5000|$|This {{light was}} built to replace the <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light, which stood {{somewhat}} to the south-east. A projection from <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> shoal forces a slight turn in the ship channel, and {{it was felt that}} a light on this projection (the [...] "elbow") would be more useful than the older light, which stood at some distance from the present channel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] disclaimed the other. [...] "I only pulled you back. You'd {{have got}} badly {{hammered}} if you'd tried to <b>cross</b> that <b>ledge.</b> I'd noticed the inshore swirl close below {{it when we}} were packing along the bank, and remembered that we could land in it." ...|$|R
50|$|Roca Redonda is a flat-topped, steep-sided islet located roughly 25 km {{northwest}} of the island of Isabela, in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. It measures 100 m long and 50 m wide with a maximum elevation of 67 m. Its isolation and inaccessibility coupled with its rocky cliffs riddled with crevices and <b>crossed</b> by <b>ledges</b> has made Roca Redonda a haven for nesting seabirds.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light was a {{lighthouse}} {{on the north}} side of the ship channel in Delaware Bay off of Cumberland County, New Jersey on the East Coast of the United States, southwest of Egg Island Point. It was replaced by the Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light and the Miah Maull Shoal Light in the early 1900s and razed by the United States Coast Guard in 1962.|$|E

50|$|The light {{survived the}} years without serious incident, though much riprap was placed about {{it over the}} years to protect it from the ice. In the end, however, it was made {{obsolete}} by the construction of new lights closer to the shipping channel. The activation of the Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light in 1910 marked the same shoal more effectively, and the <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light was abandoned in the same year.|$|E
50|$|The Tully Trail is a 22 mi scenic loop trail {{located in}} the towns of Royalston, Orange, and Warwick, Massachusetts near the New Hampshire border. The route <b>crosses</b> several <b>ledges</b> with {{sweeping}} views of the surrounding rural countryside and passes three waterfalls (Royalston Falls, Spirit Falls, and Doane's Falls). Tully Mountain, Jacobs Hill, and Tully Lake are also located on the trail. The Tully Trail coincides briefly with the 110 mi Metacomet-Monadnock Trail. The route follows a mostly protected corridor of state, federal, and non-profit owned land.|$|R
5000|$|As was {{the case}} with the Calvary at Landrévarzec, this calvary is also {{triangular}} in shape and concentrates in the main on depictions of the apostles and also has a [...] "Notre-Dame de Pitié" [...] at the base of the <b>cross.</b> On <b>ledges</b> on the shaft of the central cross are statues of the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and John the Evangelist. At the summit of the central cross, Jesus is shown on the cross with angels collecting his blood into chalices. Around the pedestal platform are statues of the apostles although some there originally have gone and some have no heads. St Peter can be recognised by the very large key which he holds. The calvary dates to 1556.|$|R
5000|$|All {{sorts of}} {{different}} objects, {{ranging from the}} familiar brass disks to liquor bottles, clay pots, and rock cairns, have been used {{over the years as}} survey markers. Some truly monumental markers have been used to designate tripoints, or the meeting points of three or more countries. In the 19th century, these marks were often drill holes in rock <b>ledges,</b> <b>crosses</b> or triangles chiselled in rock, or copper or brass bolts sunk into bedrock.|$|R
50|$|This {{light and}} the Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light were {{intended}} to replace the <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light, and appropriations for both were first requested in 1904. In {{the case of this}} light construction was delayed by the inability of the first contractor to set the caisson before exhausting the budget, so that the caisson was not set in place until 1909. A wooden shed was mounted and a light first exhibited that September, but the superstructure was not completed until 1913, again due to financial requirements.|$|E
50|$|On 20 October 1953, {{navigating}} {{in thick}} fog and without operable radar, the Steel Apprentice struck Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light head-on, knocking {{most of the}} lighthouse into the Delaware Bay.|$|E
50|$|Velshi {{was married}} briefly in his 20s. In 2009 he married his second wife, New York-born hedge-fund manager, Lori Wachs, the {{president}} of Philadelphia-based <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Investments, whom he met {{when she was a}} guest on his show.|$|E
50|$|The Swift River Reservation is a 439 acre {{open space}} {{preserve}} located in Petersham, Massachusetts, United States. The property, {{named after the}} East Branch of the Swift River (a tributary of the Ware River), is managed by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations and offers 7 mi of trails available for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and <b>cross</b> country skiing. <b>Ledges,</b> river corridor, woodlands, scenic vistas, and wetlands characterize the preserve.|$|R
5000|$|Bulldog Canyon in the Tonto National Forest, {{the first}} leg of the trail, was {{dedicated}} in April 1996. Two years later the 72-mile Cave Creek segment was completed and the Sears-Kay Ruin, an ancient Hohokam village atop a hill overlooking Cave Creek, became the first [...] "Point of Discovery." [...] This passes the Seven Springs Campground, an oasis developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, as it winds its way to Bloody Basin Road. It then crosses the Agua Fria National Monument or, for the more adventurous, turns north on a rocky trail that <b>crosses</b> shale <b>ledges</b> and rivers to Dugas and to the San Dominique Winery before crossing grasslands, riverbeds, and over Mingus Mountain to enter Martin Canyon, known as Smiley Rock because of a pumpkin sized rock on the trail that appears to have eyes, nose, and a mouth.|$|R
60|$|We left Barfonchen on the 7th November, and {{ascended the}} river, near which {{we put up}} a woodcock. Emerging from the woods at Chumanako (alt. 12,590 feet), where there is another stone hut, the {{mountains}} become bleak, bare, and stony, and the rocks are all moutonneed by ancient glaciers. At 13,000 feet the ground was covered with ice, and all the streams were frozen. <b>Crossing</b> several rocky <b>ledges,</b> behind which were small lakes, a gradual ascent led to {{the summit of the}} Chola pass, a broad low depression, 14,925 feet above the sea, wholly bare of snow.|$|R
50|$|Completion of the {{original}} Brandywine Shoal Light in 1850 led the Lighthouse Board to draw up plans to erect similar lights at Ship John Shoal and <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge.</b> Both of these were intended {{to be of the}} then-new screw-pile design. During construction of the <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light in the winter of 1856, however, ice carried away the entire structure, prompting reconsideration of the suitability of this type of foundation. In the 1870s caisson foundations became available, and in 1873 Congress appropriated funds toward the construction of a caisson light on the shoal. Wooden piles were driven and the caisson placed in 1874; however, insufficient time remained in the working season to complete the light, and a temporary structure was placed to allow display of a light from November of that year.|$|E
50|$|The Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light was a {{lighthouse}} {{on the north}} side of the ship channel in Delaware Bay in Cumberland County, New Jersey, on the east coast of the United States, west of Egg Island Point. It was destroyed by a ship collision in 1953 and replaced by a skeleton tower on the same foundation.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the light}} was painted brown, and a fourth-order Fresnel lens {{imported}} from France was used. This lens was later replaced by an American-made model which served until the early 2000s. Around 1940 the superstructure was painted red, a color it has retained ever since. The keepers of this light controlled that of the Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light when the latter was automated in 1951. In 1973 {{the light was}} automated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Waa-hoo, waa-hoo!" [...] ringing {{down the}} slope, pealed against the cliff behind me, {{and sent the}} wild echoes flying. Satan, of his own accord, headed up the incline. Surprised at this, I gave him free rein. How he did climb! Not {{long did it take}} me to {{discover}} that he picked out easier going than I had. Once I saw Jones <b>crossing</b> a <b>ledge</b> far above me, and I yelled our signal cry. The answer returned clear and sharp; then its echo cracked under the hollow cliff, and crossing and recrossing the ravine, it died at last far away, like the muffled peal of a bell-buoy. Again I heard the blended yelping of the hounds, and closer at hand. I saw a long, low cliff above, and decided that the hounds were running at the base of it. Another chorus of yelps, quicker, wilder than the others, drew a yell from me. Instinctively I knew the dogs had jumped game of some kind. Satan knew it as well as I, for he quickened his pace and sent the stones clattering behind him.|$|R
50|$|After {{they begin}} the hike, the couple {{comes in contact}} with Nick (Olyphant), a solo hiker who claims to be an Iraq War veteran. Nick saves Cydney's life when she slips while {{attempting}} to <b>cross</b> a narrow <b>ledge.</b> The trio approaches a group of frightened female hikers discussing a double murder in Honolulu. The victims had their teeth pulled out and fingertips removed. Cliff suspects the hitchhiking couple are the murderers, and Cydney and Cliff discuss {{whether or not they}} should turn back, but decide to continue hiking with Nick. They subsequently meet up with Nick's sexy girlfriend, Gina (Sanchez) at the Secret Falls Waterfall.|$|R
60|$|The Normans {{heard this}} with great interest, {{and it was}} {{resolved}} {{that several of the}} most trusted persons, among whom were the Archbishop of Rouen, Abbot Martin of Jumieges, and the Count of Harcourt, should go immediately in search of this precious hoard. Richard accompanied them up the narrow rough stone stairs, to the large dark apartment, where his father had slept. Though a Prince's chamber, it had little furniture; a low uncurtained bed, a <b>Cross</b> on a <b>ledge</b> near its head, a rude table, a few chairs, and two large chests, were all it contained. Harcourt tried the lid of one of the chests: it opened, and proved to be full of wearing apparel; he went to the other, which was smaller, much more carved, and ornamented with very handsome iron-work. It was locked, and putting in the key, it fitted, the lock turned, and the chest was opened. The Normans pressed eagerly to see their Duke's greatest treasure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> {{is part of}} a long {{system of}} shoals which delimits the {{northern}} boundary of the channel through Delaware Bay. A lightship was placed here beginning in 1823, but the Lighthouse Board, encouraged by the success of the Brandywine Shoal Light further down the bay, decided to construct a screw-pile lighthouse on the shoal. Construction began in 1856 but was interrupted the following winter by floating ice, which destroyed the entire structure. The board reconsidered, and the lightship remained on station.|$|E
50|$|This light, {{the last}} {{offshore}} lighthouse to be erected in Delaware Bay, marks {{one of a}} series of shoals along the eastern side of the shipping channel, between the Elbow of <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light and the Brandywine Shoal Light. The name of the shoal commemorates Nehemiah Maull, a river pilot who was drowned in 1780 when the ship in which he intended to sail to England in order to make a claim on an inheritance was wrecked on the then-unnamed shoal.|$|E
50|$|The Lighthouse Board {{remained}} {{convinced that}} a permanent light was needed at the spot, and in 1873 succeeded in getting Congress to appropriate funds. Construction began the following year and was completed in 1875. <b>Cross</b> <b>Ledge</b> Light was unlike any other light in the area. It sat upon a hexagonal pier constructed of granite blocks, upon which sat an octagonal two story Second Empire frame house with the lantern at the crown of its mansard roof. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. Before the house could be completed, the lightship, having taken refuge behind the Delaware Breakwater, was nonetheless dragged out to sea by ice in February 1875; {{it was able to}} resume station until the light was completed, however.|$|E
5000|$|Rising 775 {{feet above}} sea level, this {{limestone}} height was named for George W. Bonnell, who came to Texas with others to fight for Texas independence, 1836. Was commissioner of Indian affairs in Republic of Texas under President Sam Houston. Moved in 1839 to Austin; there published the [...] "Texas Sentinel", 1840. Member Texan-Santa Fe expedition, 1841. Was captured but released in time to join Mier expedition, 1842. Was killed in camp on Rio Grande, Dec, 26, 1842. Frontiersman W.A.A. [...] "Bigfoot" [...] Wallace killed an Indian he met face to face while <b>crossing</b> a narrow <b>ledge</b> 50 feet above river, 1839. He also took refuge in a Mount Bonnell cave to recover from [...] "flux", but was missing so long his sweetheart eloped. In the mid-1800s Mormons built a mill on the Colorado river at foot of Mount Bonnell. Mill was destroyed by flood and the Mormons moved on west. Mount Bonnell was site of picnics and outings in 1850s and 1860s. As it is today. Legend has it that an excursion to the place in the 1850s inspired the popular song [...] "Wait for the Wagon and We'll All Take a Ride". As a stunt in 1898, Miss Hazel Keyes slid down a cable stretched {{from the top of}} Mount Bonnell to south bank of then Lake McDonald below.|$|R
