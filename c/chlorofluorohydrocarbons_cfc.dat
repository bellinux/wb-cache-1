40|$|It is a now {{well-established}} {{fact that}} chlorofluorohydrocarbons, once emitted to the atmosphere, {{can lead to}} ozone depletion in the stratosphere due to their long atmospheric life times. When looking for new candidates for replacing the <b>chlorofluorohydrocarbons</b> (<b>CFC)</b> as refrigerants partly fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFC) and mixtures of these have been proposed. These substances are said {{not to participate in}} ozone degradation and - hydrogen being only partly substituted - show reduced atmospheric life time. Components with higher hydrogen content, however, tend to be combustible at atmospheric conditions. To prevent this to occur, mixtures made up of HFC have come to life as promising candidates. In some earlier papers, flammability limits and minimum ignition energies have been reported for pure and mixed HFC [l- 41. All these mixtures, however, imply only partly fluorinated candidates. Therefore, {{it would be interesting to}} investigate the flammabilitybehavior of a fully fluorinated compound (FC) mixed with a nonhalogenated compound and compare it to the above-mentioned. In some recent papers, mixtures including a FC have been discussed as a possible candidate for refrigeration application [5, 6]. In this paper, we report about measured flammability limits for blends (octafluoropropane + propane, R 218 + R 290) and (octafluoropropane + methane, R 218 + R 50) in mixture with air...|$|E
40|$|Heat pump {{technology}} {{provides an}} efficient and sustainable solution for both heating and cooling. A traditional heat pump {{can be defined}} as a mechanical-compression cycle refrigeration system powered by electricity. Traditional refrigerants used in heat pumps are ammonia or chlorinated and fluorinated hydrocarbons. Because many of these <b>chlorofluorohydrocarbons</b> (<b>CFC??)</b> are ozone-depleting components, evaluation of more environmentally friendly refrigerants like pure hydrocarbons is important. The efficiency of a heat pump is traditionally measured by the ratio of delivered heat at a high temperature divided by the electricity (or work) input. This is defined as the coefficient of performance (COP). There are several simulation tools available for the simulation of heat pumps. Traditional process simulation tools like Aspen HYSYS or Aspen Plus are useful because they have data for several components inside the program, and many thermodynamic models like equations of states available. It is of interest to calculate the efficiency of a heat pump system when varying temperature conditions, refrigerants, simulation programs and thermodynamic models. There are few references to such comparisons in the open literature. The circulation medium (refrigerant) alternates by the help of a compressor and an expansion valve between the temperatures 22 and 7, 24 and 5 or 24 and - 15 °C. The lowest temperature is the evaporation temperature and the highest is the condensing temperature. The pressures were specified as the saturation pressures at the given temperatures. The evaluated components are ammonia, R- 11, R- 12, R- 22 and propane. The equations of state Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and the activity model Non-Random-Two-Liquid (NRTL) were used in the process simulation programs Aspen HYSYS and Aspen Plus. COP values have been calculated to values between 3 and 9. The highest COP was calculated for the lowest temperature difference. The components giving the highest COP value between the temperatures 22 and 7 °C were ammonia and R- 12, and R- 22 gave the highest COP between - 15 to 22 °C. Propane (which is not a CFC) gave slightly lower COP values than the other components. The differences between the thermodynamic models and the different programs were normally low. However, some differences between Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS for the same model were calculated. The calculated deviations between the same models using different programs are difficult to explain. Different model parameters in different programs may explain differences between the same models in different programs. Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS are evaluated to be powerful tools for heat pump calculations. The calculated differences between heat pump efficiencies with different components at different conditions are thought to be reasonable...|$|E
