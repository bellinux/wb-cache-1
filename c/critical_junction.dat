25|$|Addition of Northern Powerhouse Rail and Station to the Manchester Piccadilly {{system will}} be the last step of the process of {{transforming}} the station in to a transport super hub. The NPR station and its construction will need to be considered throughout the design and implementation of the other station improvements which form the station concept but which are delivered earlier. The NPR station is proposed to stay underground on its way east as it passes through Manchester city. This provides opportunities and offers location and orientation alternatives. Staying under the existing Piccadilly station or positioning NPR under the HS2 station box will maximise interchange efficiencies and travel distances. The orientation will also dictate the number of vertical connection cores also referred to as “drums” and their locations. The drums will have the function to connect all levels of transport to one and other at <b>critical</b> <b>junction</b> points.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three <b>critical</b> <b>junctions</b> in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those <b>critical</b> <b>junctions</b> are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a remarkable increase in the exhibition and screening of Palestinian art and film in festivals, galleries and cinemas around the world. Since the mid 1990 s this Palestinian work {{has been marked by}} a distinct turn toward the employment of humour. This shift signals a radical departure from the aesthetic modes that previously dominated Palestinian art and film. Despite this change of direction, there remains a lack of scholarly analysis dealing with this phenomenon. This thesis offers the first comprehensive study of humour in Palestinian art and film, analyzing both the impetus behind this shift toward laughter and its consequences. This thesis is also the first study to investigate Palestinian art and film in a single extensive text, revealing the ways in which both art forms developed in response to critical moments in Palestinian history.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] paradigm of design is changing. Designers now need to be equipped with {{the skills and knowledge}} that will enable them to participate in the global move towards a sustainable future. The challenges arise as Design for Sustainability deals with very complex and often contradictory issues. Collaborative learning experiences recognise that these complex issues can be addressed with the pooling of diverse knowledge, perspectives, cultures, skills and tools. Unless, however the process of collaboration is explored in detail, the opportunity for reflection, learning and improvement is lost. This paper proposes that by introducing and analysing collaboration within third level design education, the capacity for responsible design practice can be developed, leading to a transformative shift in how designers are taught as students and subsequently practice as professionals. Over two multidisciplinary projects devised and undertaken by design students from the University of Limerick (Ireland), Hogeschool Utrecht (Netherlands) and Virginia Commonwealth University (USA), the collaborative path is mapped and <b>critical</b> <b>junctions</b> identified. From this process of mapping and visualisation, collective narratives of the overall project experience are constructed (through the eyes of the participants and planners).
