5|$|Charles Augustus May (1818–1864) was an American {{officer of}} the United States Army {{who served in the}} Mexican War and other campaigns over a 25-year career. He is best known for {{successfully}} leading a cavalry <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Mexican artillery at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{indicates}} Milo led the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Sybarites {{wearing his}} Olympic crowns, draped in a lionskin and brandishing {{a club in}} a manner similar to the mythic hero Heracles (see adjacent image).|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1911, Earp {{was arrested}} in Los Angeles and charged with {{attempting}} to fleece J. Y. Peterson, a realty broker, in a fake faro game. Since money had not changed hands, the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Earp was reduced to vagrancy and he was released on $500 bail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Piazon {{were later}} dropped, {{although}} the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Andrey Ventura still stand.|$|R
50|$|The Republican-dominated House brought {{impeachment}} <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Lieutenant Governor Martin Trapp and narrowly {{failed to}} approve impeachment <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> {{both the state}} treasurer and Oklahoma Governor James Roberts. The Democratic-dominated Senate did not sustain the impeachment <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Trapp.|$|R
5000|$|However, Henley {{chose not}} to dismiss the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad because of Hartmanns {{controversial}} conduct. [...] He did rule that Frakt was authorized to submit arguments for dropping the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad directly to Susan J. Crawford, the Convening Authority, as to whether <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad were justified.|$|R
5|$|This {{proved to}} be Gatting's last match as captain. He had captained England in 23 Test matches since taking <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> India in 1986, but won only two.|$|E
5|$|After an {{investigation}} that lasted six years and cost $6 million, police laid charges against Croitoru and Andre Gravelle. Croitoru was charged with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. After spending seven months in prison, Croitoru was released on $100,000 bail. He was arrested on December 2, 2005 for violating his bail terms, and police filed another extortion <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> such films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were ten}} <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> 13 men: Robbery (all except for John Wheater), Conspiracy to Rob (against all of them), Receiving (3 <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Roger Cordrey and 3 other <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Bill Boal and 1 against Brian Field) and for perverting {{the course of}} justice (John Wheater only) ...|$|R
25|$|After eight Democratic-controlled Legislatures, Republicans {{took the}} {{majority}} from 1921-1922 and elected George B. Schwabe as Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The Republican-dominated House brought impeachment <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Lieutenant Governor Martin Trapp and narrowly failed to approve impeachment <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> {{both the state}} treasurer and Oklahoma Governor James Roberts. The Democratic-dominated Senate did not sustain the impeachment <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Trapp.|$|R
50|$|In March 1995, a Rabbinic Court met at Yeshiva University at Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik's {{suggestion}} to hear Balkany's <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Luchins. The court, consisting of three highly respected Yeshiva University Roshei Yeshiva, dismissed all <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Luchins.|$|R
5|$|An intense {{propaganda}} campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of {{the leaders}} of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
50|$|Kanaan, El-Assaad and Jamal {{were charged}} in {{relation}} to a shooting incident on Eveleigh Street, Redfern, in Sydney's inner-south. The <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jamal were dropped and the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Kanaan and El-Assaad also appear to have been dropped.|$|R
5000|$|On September 19, 2007, The Georgia Court of Appeals heard {{arguments}} from attorney Ken Choe who {{urged them to}} vacate the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Ms. Hadaway. On March 24, 2008 the contempt <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Elizabeth Hadaway were officially reversed ...|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{dropped the}} <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> him without comment on 29 August, {{and he was}} released from prison. The <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Temesgen's publisher were also dropped, but Temsegen stated it was uncertain when Feteh would be able to restart publishing.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, {{prosecutors}} {{opened an}} investigation into charges of corruption dating to Pérez Balladares' time in office. He was placed under house arrest the following year, making him the first former Panamanian president to be arrested, and in October 2010 was charged with money laundering. A judge dismissed the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> him in April 2011. In February 2012, Pérez Balladares was convicted of slandering comptroller Alvin Weeden by calling him a narcocriminal, and sentenced to a $3,000 fine or a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
5|$|Testimony in {{the trial}} {{concluded}} on May 15, 1826; summations concluded four days later. Despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury deliberated only an hour before convicting Beauchamp of Sharp's murder. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution to write a justification for his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.|$|E
50|$|However, Henley {{chose not}} to dismiss the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad because of Hartmanns {{controversial}} conduct. He did rule that Frakt was authorized to submit arguments for dropping the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad directly to Susan J. Crawford, the Convening Authority, as to whether <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Jawad were justified. On September 12, Hartmann was removed from his position as Legal Advisor, and three days later Frakt submitted a plea to the Convening Authority to dismiss the charges, which included matters in mitigation and extenuation, legal arguments, and letters and a petition from concerned citizens. On September 23, Crawford rejected this appeal and reaffirmed her earlier decision to refer <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Mohammad Jawad to trial.|$|R
500|$|On 1 June 2007, Murilo Mendes, a Brazilian {{federal judge}} in the small city of Sinop, Mato Grosso, near the crash site of the Boeing, indicted the two Embraer pilots and four Brasilia-based air traffic {{controllers}} for [...] "exposing an aircraft to danger." [...] On 8 December 2008, he dismissed <b>charges</b> of negligence <b>against</b> the pilots, but left in place a charge of [...] "imprudence". He also dismissed all <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> {{two of the four}} Brasilia-based controllers and reduced the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the other two, but supported bringing new <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> a fifth controller, based in São José dos Campos, the Embraer's departure point. On 12 January 2010, his ruling was overturned by Judge Candido Ribeiro in a federal court in Brasilia, reinstating the negligence <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> the pilots.|$|R
2500|$|Combs' arrest {{resulted}} in the 1995 <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> him being reinstituted. A Floyd County judge entered a plea of [...] "innocent" [...] on Combs' behalf after he failed to appear at his arraignment, which his attorney said was due to his memory disorder. A 1997 Associated Press story described Combs as a recovering alcoholic. All <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Combs were dismissed in August 1997 because his memory disorder {{made it impossible to}} prove his intent to break the law. Drug possession <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Combs' son were also dropped.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|After two {{costly and}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to seize the}} fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, {{on the last day}} of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
50|$|After a judge {{threw out}} the {{manslaughter}} <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Haste due to a technicality in {{the proceedings of the}} first grand jury, a second grand jury voted not to file <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Haste, leading the Graham family to demand a federal investigation into the unjustified police shooting.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{an appeal}} filed {{on behalf of}} the Marine Corps, {{claiming}} that the judge abused his power when he dismissed dereliction of duty <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Chessani in killings. On March 17, 2009, a military appeals court upheld the dismissal of the war crimes <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Chessani.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Dodik {{stated that}} the Tuzla {{massacre}} was staged and questioned the Markale massacres at Sarajevo. The Tuzla municipality filed <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Dodik over these statements. The city of Sarajevo filed criminal <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> Dodik for abuse of power, and inciting ethnic, racial and religious hatred.|$|R
5|$|Born in Warsaw and {{following}} in his father's footsteps, he {{became interested in}} politics {{at an early age}} and soon became involved in the military and the revolutionary affairs in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help in the cause of the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux tapestry, {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E
50|$|McAnespie {{was acquitted}} of all <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|R
