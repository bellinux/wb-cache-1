40|$|The {{reliability}} {{study in}} Electricity network in Sri Lanka is seldom carried out. Moreover {{in areas where}} this is carried out, it is limited to calculate SAIFI; SADI by means of using the failure data collected from the <b>consumer</b> <b>service</b> <b>centres.</b> This {{is not enough to}} evaluate and improve the reliability levels of the network. The failures of Medium Voltage lines and equipment result in revenue losses to the utilities as well as to consumers. In Sri Lanka the utilities are concerned about collection of revenue but not much about reliability issues. This study focuses on the following: 1. Introduction of Reliability concepts to utilities in Sri Lanka 2. Development of a computer based model to calculate reliability levels 3. Proposing methods to improve the reliability such as better maintenance practiced and policies, augmentation of lines and switching arrangements. The methodology in this project was developed using the MS Excel Programme for Medium Voltage Network of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Centre</b> (CSC) Area, Boralesgamuwa and tested for that of Fulleorton CSC Area, Kalutara. This methodology could be used for any part of the Medium Voltage Netwerk and extended to Localised Low Voltage Systems for evaluation and improvement of reliabilit...|$|R

The <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> energy performance context situation is obtained by collecting <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> current context data related to the business applications scheduled to run on <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> resources, <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> IT computing resources and the <b>service</b> <b>centre</b> facilities.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether there is}} herding by general equity unit trusts as investors in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector in South Africa. It also investigates whether herding was more prevalent during the financial crisis period in South Africa between 2008 and 2010, than during a non-crisis period. Using a herding measure developed by Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1992) (LSV), {{it was found that}} there was indeed herding behaviour by general equity unit trusts in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector. A herding rate (i. e. the proportion of trades by general equity unit trusts in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector in excess of the expected random and independent proportion) of 7. 75 % is calculated. Possible reasons for herding in the <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> sector include; <b>consumer</b> <b>services</b> companies being profitable investments and a small number of investment analysts in South Africa. It was also observed that herding behaviour was not more prevalent during the financial crisis period (12. 14 %) than the non-crisis period (6. 36 %), as these two periods were not statistically different from one another, even though the average herding rates differed...|$|R
