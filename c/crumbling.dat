50|$|<b>Crumbles</b> {{became popular}} in Britain during World War II, when the <b>crumble</b> topping was an {{economical}} alternative to pies due to shortages of pastry ingredients {{as the result}} of rationing. To further reduce the use of rationed flour, fat and sugar, breadcrumbs or oatmeal could be added to the <b>crumble</b> mix. The dish was also popular due to its simplicity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{proportion}} of <b>crumbled</b> copra meal and enzyme inclusion on bird performance and gastro-intestinal response was studied. Three diets with two enzyme treatments were each fed to four replicates of 10 broilers from 1 to 42 days of age. The diets contained 300 g kg <b>crumbled</b> copra meal and- 1 were fed {{either as a}} finely ground or <b>crumbled</b> or a mixture of 50 / 50 finely ground and <b>crumbled</b> copra meal, each with or without an enzyme supplement (Hemicell plus Allzyme SSF). Feeding the <b>crumbled</b> copra meal diet, which had the largest <b>crumble</b> sizes, increased body weight, live weight gain, feed intake and water consumption of birds. The gizzard size of birds fed <b>crumbled</b> copra meal in their diets was significantly larger and heavier than for birds fed the fine mash copra meal diet. The inclusion of enzyme significantly increased body weight and live weight gain of birds fed until 6 weeks of age. The duodenum, ileum and overall size of intestines of birds fed the supplemented copra meal diet were larger and heavier than those of birds fed the diet without enzyme supplementation. Including <b>crumbled</b> copra meal in the diet had a beneficial effect in increasing the productivity of birds and supplementation of a copra meal based diet with enzymes was additionally beneficial...|$|R

5|$|By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building {{had proved}} to be an {{excessive}} burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the <b>crumbling</b> structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{significant}} European {{success in}} the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were <b>crumbling,</b> supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of feed processing (pelleting) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality in male broilers. Pelleted feed was compared to mash feed with the same specification. In addition, the effect of feed texture (feed particle size) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality, by using <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and mash was evaluated. Six thousand day-old Ross 788 male broiler chickens, originating from a specific broiler breeder flock (37 weeks old) were divided into three treatment groups of 2000 birds by systematic random sampling. The experiment was an 8 x 3 block design, with 250 broilers randomly and equally assigned to each pen. The birds were kept in a controlled environmental house and vaccinated against NCD, IB, IBD and Pneumovirus. The experiment {{was carried out}} at 1517 m above sea level, on the Highveld of South Africa. At this altitude and together {{with the fact that}} the experiment was carried out during winter (June and July 1997), no inducing methods were necessary. Mortalities were recorded daily and post mortems were done on all dead chickens and the cause of death recorded. Dead chickens were weighed individually and the weight recorded. Bacteriology was done on all the chickens that died from infectious causes to identify the specific bacteria. The bodyweight per pen was determined by weighing all the chickens per pen on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 and weighing at least 20 % of the chickens per pen on day 4, 11, 18, 25, 32 and 39. The feed conversion and mortality corrected feed conversion were determined on day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. The mean live mass in kg, the percentage survivors, the feed conversion and age in days were used to calculate the production efficiency factor for each treatment group at 42 days of age. Chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets had the highest bodyweight (2304, 0 g) at 42 days of age. They were followed by the chickens on the mash diet (2054, 1 g) and the lowest bodyweight was recorded on the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (1993, 5 g). The difference in bodyweight for the three treatment groups was significant (p# 0, 05). The pelleting process therefore did not result in better bodyweight, but the bodyweight were determined by the particle size of the feed (feed texture). The percentage weight gain per week, decreased from week one to week six. During the first week and to a lesser extent during the second week, there was a big difference in percentage weight gain between treatment groups. The chickens on the <b>crumbles</b> and pellets grew the fastest (230, 1 % during week one and 159 % during week two). The weight gain for the chickens on the all-mash diet was 187, 7 % for week one and 153, 1 % for week two. The slowest weight gain was in the chickens on the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (179, 7 % during week one and 143, 5 % during week two). The weekly weight gain in the three treatment groups from week three to week six was similar. The difference in weight gain over the first two weeks, was probably due to the difference in feed texture, because the chickens on the <b>crumbles</b> grew the fastest and the chickens on the ground <b>crumbles</b> the slowest. Eleven percent of the <b>crumbles</b> and 5 % of the pellets were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the mash 25, 0 % and in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets 41, 5 % of the particles were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the <b>crumbles</b> 44 % and in the pellets 76, 7 % particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. In the mash 7, 5 % and in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets 3, 5 % of the particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. The best FC (1, 900) and mortality corrected FC (1, 852) were achieved on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets. It differed significantly (p# 0, 05) from the FC (1, 946) and mortality corrected FC (1, 921) of chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, as well as the FC (1, 963) and mortality corrected FC (1, 945) of chickens on mash. There was no significant (p> 0, 05) difference in the FC and mortality corrected FC in the ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and mash rations. The pelleting process on its own, did not significantly improve feed efficiency. Grinding of <b>crumbles</b> and pellets abolished the feed efficiency responses observed when the physical form was preserved. Particle size (feed texture) was therefore the most important factor determining feed efficiency. Mortality was the highest in chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets (6, 57 %), followed by 4, 03 % in chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets and 2, 85 % in chickens on mash. These differences in mortality were significant (p# 0, 05). The higher mortality on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was mainly caused by ascites (2, 11 %) and SDS (1, 39 %), which caused 3, 5 % of the mortality. The most important cause of mortality in the group receiving ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was SDS (1, 01 %). Although the total mortality in the chickens on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets was the highest, the better bodyweight and FC in this group resulted in the highest PEF (269, 8) at 42 days. The chickens on mash had a PEF of 242, 4 and in the chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets it was 233, 6. The better results on <b>crumbles</b> and pellets are further accentuated by the net return per 2000 day-old chickens placed of R 1694. 70 when compared to the chickens on ground <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, and R 1196. 36 when compared to the chickens on mash. This study therefore, showed that particle size (feed texture), played the most important role in determining bodyweight and feed efficiency in broilers. To ensure the heaviest bodyweight and most efficient feed conversion on any given feed specification, it is of utmost importance that broilers receive feed as intact <b>crumbles</b> and pellets, with minimum damage to the <b>crumbles</b> and pellets.
