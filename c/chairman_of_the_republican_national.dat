5|$|In 1973, Karl Rove ran for {{chair of}} the College Republicans. He {{challenged}} the front-runner's delegates, throwing the national convention into disarray, after which both he and his opponent, Robert Edgeworth, claimed victory. The dispute was resolved when Rove was selected through the direct order of the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee, {{who at the time}} was George H W Bush.|$|E
5|$|Goldwater {{selected}} William E. Miller, U.S. Representative and <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee, as {{his running}} mate for the general election. Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by those familiar with him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for {{elective}} office. Though a longtime admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been careful to maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
50|$|In April 2005, Brock was {{selected}} as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>of</b> Kentucky. Brock resigned as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>of</b> Kentucky in March 2007 to join DTX Oil as president and CEO.|$|R
50|$|Bell {{first entered}} {{politics}} in the mid-1950s, holding several Republican Party positions. He served as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Central Committee <b>of</b> Los Angeles County, <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> State Central Committee of California, and as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee.|$|R

5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil War, Raymond {{supported}} Lincoln's {{policies in}} general, but protested his delays in aggressively prosecuting the war.

25|$|Born {{and educated}} in Virginia, Scott moved to Philadelphia {{to join his}} uncle's law firm. He was {{appointed}} as Philadelphia's assistant district attorney in 1926 and remained in that position until 1941. Scott won election to represent Northwest Philadelphia in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1940. He lost re-election in 1944, but won his seat back in 1946 and served in the House until 1959. Scott established a reputation as an internationalist and moderate Republican Congressman. After helping Thomas E.

He also served as Dwight D. Eisenhower's campaign chairman in the 1952 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008 elections, the Republican Party, {{reeling from}} the loss of the presidency, Congress and key state governorships, was {{fractured}} and leaderless. Michael Steele became the first black <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee, but was a poor fundraiser and was replaced after numerous gaffes and missteps. Republicans suffered an additional loss in the Senate in April 2009, when Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic Party, depriving the GOP of a critical 41st vote to block legislation in the Senate. The seating of Al Franken several months later effectively handed the Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, but it was short-lived as the GOP took back its 41st vote when Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts in early 2010.|$|E
