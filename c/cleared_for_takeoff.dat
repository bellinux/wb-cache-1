25|$|The {{accident}} was investigated by Spain's Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC). About 70 personnel {{were involved in}} the investigation, including representatives from the Netherlands, the United States, and the two airline companies. Facts showed that there had been misinterpretations and false assumptions. Analysis of the CVR transcript showed that the KLM pilot was convinced that he had been <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff,</b> while the Tenerife control tower was certain that the KLM 747 was stationary {{at the end of the}} runway and awaiting takeoff clearance.

At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the runway threshold the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff.</b> Local procedures and FAA Order 7110.65 require the local controller {{to wait until the}} landing aircraft has passed through the intersection before clearing an aircraft for takeoff on one of the intersecting runways.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2016, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5643, an Airbus A320, was {{involved}} in a serious runway incursion incident during takeoff from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The aircraft was <b>cleared</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> from runway 36L for a domestic flight to Tianjin. As it was accelerating down the runway, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5106, an Airbus A330-343 entered the active runway via taxiway B3. The aircraft had just landed on runway 36R after a flight from Beijing and had reportedly been cleared to taxi to the terminal. It left the runway via B3, crossed taxiway Bravo and entered the active departure runway via taxiway H3. This crossing is located 2110 meters from the threshold of runway 36L and 2400 meters from the point where the A320 commenced takeoff. The A320 was accelerating through 110 knots when the crew noted the A330 entering the runway. The crew selected TOGA thrust and continued their takeoff. The aircraft rotated at about 130 knots and climbed over the A330 with a separation of just 19 meters.|$|E
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's Runway 22 <b>for</b> the <b>takeoff,</b> but used Runway 26 instead. Analysis {{of the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) indicated the {{aircraft was}} cleared to take off from Runway 22, a [...] strip used by most airline traffic at Lexington. Instead, after confirming [...] "Runway two-two", Captain Jeffrey Clay taxied onto Runway 26, an unlit secondary runway only [...] long, and turned the controls over to First Officer James Polehinke <b>for</b> <b>takeoff.</b> The air traffic controller was not required to maintain visual contact with the aircraft; after <b>clearing</b> the aircraft <b>for</b> <b>takeoff,</b> he turned to perform administrative duties and {{did not see the}} aircraft taxi to the runway.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to <b>clearing</b> TWA 159 <b>for</b> <b>takeoff.</b>|$|R

The Tu-154 was taking off and its right wing struck the fairing of the KC-135R No. 1 engine. The force of the impact nearly severed the No. 1 engine, but destroyed a portion of the left wing and the resulting fire caused extensive damage to the KC-135. The Tu-154 lost about 6 feet of its right wingtip, but was able to get airborne and return to the airport for an emergency landing. The tanker crew had been directed to use Taxiway Golf, a taxiway which was not usable for night operations, and the controller failed to note that they reported [...] "holding short" [...] of that taxiway, rather than [...] "clear of" [...] the runway at that point.
