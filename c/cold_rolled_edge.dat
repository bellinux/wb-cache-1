The method leads to <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> with minimal surface discontinuities.

A procedure to obtain optimum <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> parameter is also presented.

40|$|In {{a compact}} range (which employs a {{parabolic}} main reflector to convert the spherical wave originating from a point source to a reflected plane wave) the edge-generated diffractive fields degrade the uniformity of the plane wave. To reduce the energy diffracted from the edge surfaces, terminations {{can be added to}} the parabola, such that the slope of the surface is continuous at the junctions. This paper discusses the problem of designing an optimized <b>rolled</b> <b>edge.</b> Two examples of reflectors with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> are presented, one with elliptic <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> and the other with blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges,</b> both adhering to the same constraints on minimum operating frequency and size.

40|$|Asymmetric rolling of {{thin strip}} has become {{important}} {{due to a}} significant decrease of rolling force, which contributes to obtain the extremely thin strip, to reduce the rolling passes, and to save the energy by a decrease of anneal treatment.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{microstructure}} and texture evolution of a Ti- 5 Al- 5 Mo- 5 V- 3 Cr alloy during cold rolling and annealing treatments. Three samples with different initial microstructures were <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> to a 40 % reduction in thickness. The starting microstructure of one sample was single β phase while two other specimens were α+β phases with different α particle sizes, distributed in β grains. For all three samples, the average size of primary β grains was 150 µm. The <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> specimens were then annealed at 860 °C (10 °C above the β transus temperature) for 5 minutes followed by water quenching. Microstructure development during cold rolling and recrystallization was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Microstructure investigations showed that massive amount of shear bands occurred during the cold rolling of the single β phase sample while only a few shear bands were observed in the α+β <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> microstructures. The <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> texture of the sample comprised of a single β phase contains a gamma fibre (//ND) and a partial alpha fibre (//RD).
