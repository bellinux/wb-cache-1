The best result rendered the Seignette crystal, which is formed from a mixture of different salts. From 1935 <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers</b> were permanently installed on all German submarines.

25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the sound power {{produced}} by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers</b> have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers</b> were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|R
5000|$|A tikker, {{alternately}} spelled ticker, was a vibrating interrupter used {{in early}} wireless telegraphy radio <b>receivers</b> such as <b>crystal</b> radio <b>receivers</b> {{in order to}} receive continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy signals.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers</b> did {{not have}} a tuned circuit at all, and just consisted of a crystal detector connected between the antenna and ground, with an earphone across it. Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad resonance of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the earphone (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set's limited range.|$|R

50|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>receiver</b> is {{very simple}} and can be easy to make or even improvise, for example, the foxhole radio. However, the crystal radio needs a strong RF signal and a long antenna to operate. It {{displays}} poor selectivity since it only has one tuned circuit.|$|E

50|$|His father {{bought him}} a <b>crystal</b> radio <b>receiver,</b> which he assembled, took apart, {{reassembled}} and rebuilt several times. He improved his set each time he rebuilt it and later built a transmitter, while his father obtained the landlord's permission to erect a 30 ft transceiving antenna on the roof.|$|R
50|$|Ely Steinberg {{opened his}} first store in 1921. The first two stores {{were located in}} Cincinnati, Ohio, and focused on musical {{instruments}} and electronic audio equipment, such as The Victrola, an early record player, and <b>crystal</b> radio <b>receivers.</b> Notable customers included Powel Crosley Jr., whose WLW-AM later became Cincinnati's premiere radio station.|$|R
50|$|In more {{sophisticated}} <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers,</b> the tuning coil is replaced with an adjustable air core antenna coupling transformer which improves the selectivity by {{a technique called}} loose coupling. This consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the primary) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the secondary) attached {{to the rest of}} the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{increasing}} interest in the test transmissions, {{it was decided to}} introduce a series of concerts to be given at 5 p.m. each Saturday. The first of these concerts was given on 28 March 1914, and consisted of a mixture of live performers and phonograph records. On this date a second concert was given at 8:30 p.m., which was dedicated to the Belgian royal family. (Belgium's queen, Elisabeth, had shown an early interest in the radio experiments. A <b>crystal</b> <b>receiver</b> had been provided for her use, and she also received instruction in receiving Morse code.) ...|$|E
5000|$|... ==Early Years== Robert Todd Storz (known as Todd {{to avoid}} {{confusion}} with his father) was {{the grandson of}} Omaha brewer Gottlieb Storz. His father, Robert H. Storz, positioned himself as a “mover and shaker” in Omaha, Nebraska. He joined his eldest brother Adolph in running the Storz Brewing Company, and became active in local associations and activities. Indeed, Robert Storz {{played a role in}} getting the U.S. Air Force’s Strategic Air Command (SAC) headquarters to relocate to Omaha in 1957. SAC’s huge and growing payroll portended good business for Storz beer. Having no interest in the beer business, however, young Todd Storz was far more attracted to the potential of broadcast radio. He built a crude AM radio <b>crystal</b> <b>receiver</b> when he was only eight, and from then on, was “hooked” on radio.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{was invented}} in 1904 in the {{wireless}} telegraphy era, the crystal radio receiver could also rectify AM transmissions {{and served as a}} bridge to the broadcast era. In addition to being the main type used in commercial stations during the wireless telegraphy era, it was the first receiver to be used widely by the public. [...] During the first two decades of the 20th century, as radio stations began to transmit in AM voice (radiotelephony) instead of radiotelegraphy, radio listening became a popular hobby, and the crystal was the simplest, cheapest detector. The millions of people who purchased or homemade these inexpensive reliable receivers created the mass listening audience for the first radio broadcasts, which began around 1920. By the late 1920s the <b>crystal</b> <b>receiver</b> was superseded by vacuum tube receivers and became commercially obsolete. However it continued to be used by youth and the poor until World War 2. [...] Today these simple radio receivers are constructed by students as educational science projects.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>crystal</b> radio <b>receiver,</b> employing {{an antenna}} and a demodulating diode (rectifier), {{is actually a}} rectenna - although it discards the DC component before sending the signal to the earphones. People living near strong radio transmitters would occasionally discover that with a long receiving antenna, they could get enough electric power to light a light bulb.|$|R
50|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently in <b>crystal</b> <b>receivers,</b> {{because the}} low voltage input to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|R
50|$|After having built a <b>crystal</b> radio <b>receiver</b> {{at the age}} of ten, Bates further {{developed}} his lifelong love for radio. He joined the British Merchant Navy, but transferred to the Royal Navy in 1939 on the outbreak of war. He saw active service in the Battle of the Atlantic and convoyed merchant and troop ships in the Mediterranean Sea and during the North Africa landings.|$|R
