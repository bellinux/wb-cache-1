Air pluviation is a widely used method to prepare cohesionless soil samples in the laboratory. In the present study, two currently used air pluviation setups, viz, stationary/portable traveling pluviator (PTP) and movable/mechanized traveling pluviator (MTP), are investigated in terms of their ability to prepare uniform and repeatable sand beds {{of a wide range of}} relative densities. The PTP and MTP pluviation setups mainly comprise hopper, orifice, flexible hose, and rigid tube. <b>Chain</b> <b>pulley</b> and rail track are the additional features of MTP, which allow the hopper to travel smoothly in one direction. Pluviation studies are performed by using Indian standard sand (Grade II), and a California bearing ratio (CBR) mold is used to evaluate relative density (RD) and deposition intensity (DI) of samples. The effect of height of fall (HF), DI, and number of diffuser sieves on the RD of the sand sample is studied for both the PTP and MTP pluviation setups. A model tank is used to verify the uniformity of the sand samples with the help of miniature cone-penetrations tests. The test results reveal that a wide range of RD with uniform and repeatable sand samples can be prepared by using MTP compared with PTP. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

Precise {{cable drive}} has been {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gearbox, belt and <b>pulleys,</b> <b>chains</b> and sprocket in Electro-Optical Tracking system. Precise cable drive has several significant advantages including backlash free, high stiffness, high efficiency, no lubrication etc. This paper develops analytical methods to predict the transverse oscillation frequency of precise cable drive to enable designers to better assess dynamic performance in the design study phase. Theoretical formulation of transverse oscillation equation for precise cable drive is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle taking into account flexural rigidity of cable. Furthermore, the transverse oscillation frequency is obtained from the transverse oscillation equation assuming small and linear vibration. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} oscillation properties and cable drive parameters...|$|R
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on <b>chain</b> <b>pulleys</b> are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R

5000|$|This {{installment}} of the series introduces two new features: the <b>pulley</b> system and <b>chain</b> reactions. The <b>pulley</b> system consists of two groups of bubbles attached {{to either side of}} a pulley. Popping some on one side will cause that side to be [...] "lighter" [...] and therefore rise. The other side lowers in response. If a pulley is shaking and a bubble is attached, the resulting heavier side will lower. This requires added strategy to prevent one side moving too far and therefore losing the game. One possible strategy is to form a bubble cluster between two pulleys to prevent them from lowering or rising at all. Then the player can triangulate until acquiring the necessary bubbles to clear both anchor bubbles, while still keeping both ends of the pulley clustered together.|$|R

To it also is attached that little but most important part of a vessel, the rudder. The rudder, or helm, is a small piece of timber extending along the back of the stern-post, and hung movably upon it by means of what may be called large iron hooks-and-eyes. By means of the rudder the mariner guides the ship in whatever direction he pleases. The contrast between the insignificant size of the rudder and its immense importance is very striking. Its power over the ship is thus referred to in Scripture,--"Behold also the ships, which, though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth." [...] The rudder is moved from side to side by a huge handle or lever on deck, called the tiller; but as in large ships the rudder is difficult to move by so simple a contrivance, several ropes or <b>chains</b> and <b>pulleys</b> are attached to it, and connected with the drum of a wheel, at which the steersman stands.
