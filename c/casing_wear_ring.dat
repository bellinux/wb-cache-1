This paper presents a new method for predicting the depth of a wear groove on the intermediate casing. According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the wear groove depth and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove is crescent-shaped. The change of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove depth versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove depth of a planned well is predicted with inversion of the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> should be taken into account in <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> prediction.|$|R
40|$|Aimed at {{studying}} the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{in the highly}} deviated well drilling, the experimental study on the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{was carried out in}} the first place. According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint–casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the wear depth, exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of <b>worn</b> <b>casing,</b> the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the maximum <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> depth with time was obtained. Besides, the relationship between the maximum wear depth and remaining collapse strength was established to predict the maximum wear depth and the remaining strength of the casing after a period of accumulative wear, providing a theoretical basis for the safety assessment of <b>worn</b> <b>casing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{operation}} of drilling well leads to <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{to some degree}} in cased well. The reduced strength of <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> threats {{to the safety of}} well test and completion. In order to calculate <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> depth and prevent the <b>casing</b> <b>wear,</b> the wear efficiency and friction coefficient is measured in the different wear time, the contact force and the rotating speed. The wear efficiency increases with the contact force and the rotating speed. And the bigger the rotating speed, the bigger the friction coefficient. The wear efficiency of P 110 casing is change from 2 to 8 × 10 - 13 1 /Pa. The rotating speed has less influence on the wear efficient. So it is reasonable that the wear efficiency model is adopted to calculate the wear degree of P 110 casing...|$|R

30|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and field monitoring show that lateral vibration has very important effect on <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> in deep & ultra-deep well drilling. The <b>wear</b> mechanism of <b>casing</b> under impact-sliding work conditions {{has been investigated}} and many experiments have been completed with a newly developed full-scale <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> test machine. Test results present that adhesion wear, contact fatigue, and grinding abrasion are the main wear mechanisms under impact-sliding test conditions. The friction coefficient and linear wear rate of the casing rise obviously {{with an increase in}} impact load. And the larger the impact load, the rougher the worn surface of the <b>casing.</b> The linear <b>wear</b> rate decreased slightly but the average friction coefficient increased slightly with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 2, 500 N. Both the linear wear rate of the casing and the average friction coefficient increased substantially with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 4, 000 N. Under lower impact load conditions, grinding abrasion and contact fatigue are the main mechanisms of casing wear; under higher impact load conditions, adhesion wear and contact fatigue are the main mechanisms of <b>casing</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|R

40|$|Accurate <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{prediction}} {{is important for}} well integrity evaluations. Some advanced well constructions have the casing exposed to reservoir fluidsand these casings are often in chrome material for corrosion resistance. Experiencein the oil industry shows that chrome materials are more prone towear than regular carbon-steel casings. Two main sources have been consulted {{to understand the nature}} of the tasks:Leading specialists in the oil industry and research/scientific work performedon <b>casing</b> <b>wear.</b> Investigating the background for existing <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> models,scientists and specialists have made themselves available to support thework in this report. The tasks were approached by three categories: Laboratorytests, logged <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> in a well and modeling the wear. Laboratory tests: In the planning phase of Field Y, extensive <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> testswere performed to develop an understanding of potential wear problems tobe expected under the specific field conditions. In this thesis, the data setfrom these laboratory tests were analyzed for two casing grades - SM 125 Sand SM 13 CrS 110 - and used as input in a <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> model to understandthe correlation between theory and actual <b>wear.</b> Logged <b>casing</b> wear: Multiple caliper logs were run in well X at Field Y tomonitor the wear evolution and to calibrate the wear simulations for wellX. These logs have been analyzed in this report to identify the actual wearextent. Modeling wear: Real operational parameters were fed into DrillNET CasingWearto simulate the wear extent in well X, enabling correlation betweenfield and laboratory results. For the chrome casing, the correlation between laboratory and field is poor. Looking into the background of the wear model it was identified that it is notvalid for chrome materials. Analysis of the tests performed in the laboratorysupported this as the chrome steel showed a linear wear trend - indicating alow or no contact pressure threshold. Today, the industry use the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> model also for chrome casing, bendingone of the key input parameter in the expression for wear; the wear factor. In this practice, the wear factor often varies greatly because it is sensitiveto the many parameters involved in wear prediction and to differences fromtheory to real conditions. For the carbon steel casing, the correlation between laboratory and field resultsis good. The wear model was developed to correct for the non-linearwear pattern for carbon steel. In the work of analyzing logged wear it was found that the industry often usesthe reported wall loss without considering the insecurity of the measurements. The following issues were found to be the main tasks to improve:? Add insecurity of logged results in final well integrity evaluations. ? Establish a standard procedure for wear modeling. ? Develop a wear model for chrome materials, based on extensive laboratorywear testing. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> is to limit the leakage of fluid from the high pressure zone at the impeller outlet to the low pressure region at the impeller inlet. Several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries may be employed for this purpose.

However little is known about how specific <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries affect the suction performance of an impeller. This paper seeks to examine several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries in common use.

40|$|Maintaining casing integrity, {{in terms}} of {{downhole}} zonal isolations and well stability, is extremely important in oil/gas wells. Casing wear occurs not only in directional drilling, but also in vertical drilling with a slight deviation angle. In most hydrocarbon wells, deteriorated casing was reported from the onset of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{by the presence of}} friction force during the rotation of drillpipe. The friction force against the casing wall causes the reduction of casing strength. Furthermore, the rotation of drillpipe combined with corrosive drilling fluids could dramatically degrade the casing strength. We used a finite element analysis to focus on the stress evolution in <b>worn</b> <b>casings.</b> Comparison study between <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> and perfect casing was conducted. Our study showed that the thermal load significantly increases the stress concentration of the <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> in the wellbore. Finite element solutions indicated that the radial stress of the <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> is not affected as much as the hoop stress. Along with the increased burst pressure or the elevated temperature, the unworn portion of the casing also suffers from severe compression stress. This work is important to broadening the understanding of well engineers through addressing the true stress profile of <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> in cemented wellbore...|$|R

40|$|The leakage flow {{paths in}} the {{sidewall}} gaps of centrifugal pumps are of significant importance for numbers of effects. The paper {{is concerned with}} the transient flow in the leakage flow paths with <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance variation. For this purpose, numerical simulations of the whole pump were carried out. The grid dependence and yplus check were performed first. Additionally, experimental data of performance characteristic and pressure fluctuation inside the sidewall gap was used to validate the numerical results. The transient velocity fields inside the sidewall gaps during one blade passage period were simulated. And the leakage through the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> gap was obtained for all operating points investigated. To have a better idea of attenuation and propagation of pressure inside the sidewall gap, the unsteady pressure distributions in the gap were calculated. Additionally, the surfaces of the impeller were divided into four parts. The fluid force on each part was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total radial force. Through comparing the flow fields, the pressure distributions, and the radial force between the pumps with different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearances, the effects of the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance were discussed in detail.

40|$|Hydraulic {{actuators}} {{are commonly}} adopted in machines and structures to provide translating forces with significant magnitudes. Although their application {{dates back to}} the industrial revolution, their bending behavior under compression is typically addressed by simple Euler’s instability analysis on the rod, neglecting effects such as the cylinder inertia and stiffness, the presence of contact elements in the cylinder-rod junction and on the piston, geometrical misalignments and imperfections, and friction moments at the support. Such simplifications lead to unjustified reduced critical load calculations on the component.
