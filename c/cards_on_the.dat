5|$|Benchley had {{continued}} to receive positive responses from his performing, and in 1925 he accepted a standing invitation from film producer Jesse L. Lasky for a six-week term writing screenplays at $500. While the session did not yield significant results, Benchley did get writing credit for producing the title <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Raymond Griffith silent film You'd Be Surprised (released September 1926), and was invited to do some titling for two other films.|$|E

It has an HDMI 1.3 input/output, and Asus says that it can work with most video <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market.|$|E
50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first trial and that of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first trial and that of drawing a red <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R

5|$|The first White House Christmas {{card was}} sent during the {{administration}} of Dwight David Eisenhower in 1953. President Eisenhower was an amateur artist and personally consulted {{with the head of}} Hallmark <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project. Over the course of two terms, the Eisenhower White House issued 38 different cards and prints with many of them bearing the President's own artwork. The tradition was continued during the Kennedy years with Jacqueline Kennedy's artwork featured on a 1963 card issued to raise funds for a national performing arts center.|$|E
5|$|Cooksey {{started the}} 2004–05 season with Oldham Athletic, playing one match, away against Luton Town on 7 August. He was {{released}} by Oldham on 15 September, after he was left out of manager Brian Talbot's plans. He dropped down into the Third Division, newly renamed as League Two and signed for Rochdale a day later on 16 September, despite discussing terms with Carlisle United. He made his debut, away against Mansfield Town in the 1–0 away defeat on 18 September. During his first season with Rochdale, Cooksey picked up six yellow cards and two red <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field. However, his first red card of the season against Notts County was later overturned and downgraded to a yellow after a successful appeal to The FA.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put his <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, let {{his camera}} cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid {{also has a}} less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
50|$|Under the EZ-Link system, when {{a person}} taps his <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entry <b>card</b> reader, the system deducts the maximum fare payable from his bus stop {{to the end of}} the bus route. If he taps his <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exit reader when he disembarks, the system will return an amount based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} bus stages {{to the end of the}} bus route. If he fails to tap <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exit reader when he disembarks, the entry card reader would have already deducted the maximum fare payable to the end of the bus route.|$|R

25|$|Like The Secret Adversary, The Man in the Brown Suit {{is less a}} {{novel of}} pure {{detection}} than it is a thriller typical of its period.
