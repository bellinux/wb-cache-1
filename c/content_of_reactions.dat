40|$|Silica aerogels are porous solid {{materials}} with high insulation poperties. Their open porous nanostructure inhibits diffusion and circulation-processes of air, {{which is one}} of the main reasons for thermal conductivity. Typically thermal conductivity values of silica aerogels are between 0. 01 and 0. 03 W/m*K (expanded polystyrene: 0. 035 – 0. 05 W/m*K). Silica aerogels are brittle and stiff like all the inorganic material (ceramics or glasses). Additionally, they easily brake under vibration and compressive stress. In order to give flexibility it is necessary to shape those materials into fibers with low diameter. Like glass and ceramic also silica aerogel fibers are flexible and can be processed into textile structures like fleece, which could withstand bending stress and vibration. Cellulose based aerogel fibres have already been produced and they show good results in terms of thermal insulation. 1 However, cellulose decomposes at 200 °C. Silica aerogels enable temperatures around 600 °C and even more. Additionally, silica based fibres are resistant against the most common acids. The production of silica aerogel fibers and its textile processing is the aim of this research project. Aerogels are synthezised via sol-gel-process.

Heating mantles may have various forms. In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask. The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat. This type of heating mantle is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a separatory funnel, for example, after the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> a <b>reaction</b> have been removed from a primary heat source.|$|R
