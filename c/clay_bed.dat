60|$|February 21st.--This morning I took my {{way through}} the Porta del Popolo, {{intending}} to spend the forenoon in the Campagna; but, getting weary of the straight, uninteresting street that runs out of the gate, I turned aside from it, and soon found myself on the shores of the Tiber. It looked, as usual, like a saturated solution of yellow mud, and eddied hastily along between deep banks of clay, and over a <b>clay</b> <b>bed,</b> in which doubtless are hidden many a richer treasure than we now possess. The French once proposed to draw off the river, for the purpose of recovering all the sunken statues and relics; but the Romans made strenuous objection, on account of the increased virulence of malaria which would probably result. I saw a man on the immediate shore of the river, fifty feet or so beneath the bank on which I stood, sitting patiently, with an angling rod; and I waited to see what he might catch. Two other persons likewise sat down to watch him; but he caught nothing so long as I stayed, and at last seemed to give it up. The banks and vicinity of the river are very bare and uninviting, as I then saw them; no shade, no verdure,--a rough, neglected aspect, and a peculiar shabbiness about the few houses that were visible. Farther down the stream the dome of St. Peter's showed itself on the other side, seeming to stand {{on the outskirts of the}} city. I walked along the banks, with some expectation of finding a ferry, by which I might cross the river; but my course was soon interrupted by the wall, and I turned up a lane that led me straight back again to the Porta del Popolo. I stopped a moment, however, to see some young men pitching quoits, which they appeared to do with a good deal of skill.|$|E

50|$|When first constructed, it was {{supported}} on timber piles driven 14 {{feet into the}} sand and <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> of the river. These piles were arranged in groups of three, across {{the width of the}} viaduct. Above this was a timber deck and a double track railway, laid on timber baulks. These tracks were both laid as mixed-gauge track, both broad gauge for the SWR and standard gauge for the Llanelly Railway.|$|E
5000|$|The {{water table}} in the Vale of Aylesbury {{is higher than the}} average in England, on account of {{extensive}} water reserves that are stored below the <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> of the whole vale. The designers of the village took this into account by creating a lake in the centre to allow for rise in water levels. Construction went underway and the first houses were ready for sale in 1986 ...|$|E

50|$|Quoiting (pronounced kiteing) was {{a popular}} sport amongst the male villagers. Quoiting greens were found in Renton, Alexandria, Hardgate and many Ayrshire villages. Quoits were heavy iron rings, rounded on one side, flat on the other and weighed 8-12 pounds but could be up to 23 pounds. They were hurled at a steel pin driven into a three-foot square <b>clay</b> <b>bed,</b> with the common length of the green being 18 yards. Renton were Scottish Champions in 1949 and 1986. There is a {{photograph}} of the victorious 1949 team in Renton Railway Station.|$|E
5000|$|Eotyrannus (meaning [...] "dawn tyrant") is a genus of tyrannosauroid {{theropod}} dinosaur hailing {{from the}} Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation beds, included in Wealden Group, {{located in the}} southwest coast of the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. The remains (MIWG1997.550), consisting of assorted skull, axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton elements, from a juvenile or subadult, found in a plant debris <b>clay</b> <b>bed,</b> were described by Hutt et al. in early 2001. The etymology of the generic name refers to the animals classification as an early tyrannosaur or [...] "tyrant lizard", while the specific name honors the discoverer of the fossil.|$|E
50|$|Aplin's Weir lies {{downstream}} of Gleeson's Weir and is {{the last}} weir before {{the mouth of the}} river. Aplin's Weir started out as small stop weir, built in 1927 to prevent incursion of salt water into the water supplies pumped from the upstream Top River wells, located at the end of Thompson Street, Mundingburra. The original stop weir consisted of a curtain of sheet steel which was driven into the sand to the <b>clay</b> <b>bed.</b> This stop weir protruded approximately 1.2 m above the sand level, with a concrete overflow section and also prevented water, released from the upstream Gleeson's Weir, which had previously percolated downstream, from doing so.|$|E

50|$|Soils of {{weathered}} Buntsandstein {{are generally}} acidic to slightly basic and nutrient-poor. For {{the most part}} the land is forested. In the district of Fritzlar there are outcrops of younger Upper Buntsandstein, known as the Röt Formation, because of its red colour. These strata consist of <b>clay</b> <b>beds</b> and various kinds of calcareous beds, interbedded with clayey marls.|$|R
50|$|At {{the top end}} of the line, {{there was}} a mile-long spur, the New Brighton branch, along the flank of Esclusham Mountain serving the Delafield Minera Leadmines (which {{operated}} their own locomotive Henrietta, a Manning Wardle 0-6-0). The mines closed in 1910 and the spur was pulled up, only to be opened again for several years from 1920 to serve silica <b>clay</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Load Brook was {{developed}} from a farm {{to a minor}} industrial site in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A [...] "pot clay" [...] mine (pot clay - a type of fireclay from the Stannington pot <b>clay</b> <b>bed)</b> {{was developed}} to the southwest in the 1850s by William Trickett, a local farmer. Trickett obtained rights to mine pot clay from the landowner, the Duke of Norfolk in 1852 and was mentioned in the Sheffield Trade Directory of 1862 as a clay merchant. William Trickett died in 1890 and the business was continued by his three sons, William, Benjamin and Matthew {{under the name of}} B. Trickett & Co.|$|E
50|$|The place {{contains}} two component groups: the dam and dam wall (or overshot weir) and the battery foundations. The dam wall is expertly constructed of large blocks of rough-shaped stone. The stonework {{reaches a maximum}} height of 5 m above the downstream creek bed surface (the foundations could be buried a further 4 m) and extends across the creek for about 40 m from where an earth wall continues for a further 55 m. The wall contains a lower spillway section. The {{top of the wall}} is concrete rendered for the length of its stone construction. A vertical boiler on a base of stamper dyes is located at the northern end of the wall at a former cyanide plant site. The dam is heavily silted and lined with acacia on the upstream edge of the wall. The <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> of the dam extends north-east for about 250 m.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} awaited festivals {{in the state of}} Bihar, besides Pratihar Shashthi (Chatha Puja), is indeed The Durga Puja. The festival must have beven started either by the biharis on their own accord or by {{influences}} from the neighbouring state of West Bengal, but certainly, Bihar has its own version of celebrating Durga Puja.The Ritualistic version though begins much earlier, nearly 6 days before, the actual Pandal hopping period lasts for only three days, namely, Saptami, Ashtami and Navami, making the entire festival last for 9 days. Dashmi, the tenth marks the conclusion.The construction of Puja Pandals take nearly three months, and preparations begin much earlier, from the month of July or August itself. The artisans try their best to give an experience of World Tour by constructing the Puja Pandals in the image of world-famous monuments. The idol preparation is done with utmost sanctity.The establishment of the Holy Pitcher, called the Kalash Sthapana is done {{on the first day of}} the Bright half of the Ashwina Month. A <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> is established into which seeds of Barley are sown and in the centre of this bed, a Pitcher, full of water, jewels, and leaves, topped by a Coconut and draped by red cloth is established. The Pitcher itself is believed to be the representation of the universe, while the <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> symbolises the agricultural fields. During the course of 9 days, the barley seeds spring out, which is believed to be an indicative of good harvest and prosperity. The Major Part of the entire Worship is the performance of the recitation of the Book, 'Shri Durga Saptashati' which is roughly translated as, 'The Glory of Devi in Seven Hundred Verses'.The Clay image of Goddess Durga is Unveiled on the Day of Saptami. The Unveiling is done just as soon as a White Gourd is sacrificed in honour of Chandika. Nights are marked by Huge crowds thronging, seemingly aimlessly, in every direction of the road. While there are a thousand showcases of Puja Pandals, the most famous ones in the city of Patna are, Dak Bungalow Chowraha, Beena Cinema Hall, Patna Kali Bari, Bengali Akahara, Adrakh Ghat, Khajanchi Road, macchuatoli, dariyaganj, raja bazaar, Jag dev Path, Rukanpura and so many more.Durga Puja is celebrated with much more Pomp in districts of Munger, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Purnia and the rest, aligned to West Bengal border, with much Bengali influence in the way of worship and most remarkably, distinct forms of idol making.While the Puja goes own in the Puja Pandals, there are many ancient temples in the city of Patna and other places in bihar which continue to perform durga Puja in their own way.A few to mention are, Bari Patan Devi, Cchoti Patan Devi, Shitala Mandir, Darbhanga House Kali mandir, Siddheshwari Kali Mandir, Mundeshwari Mandir.Unlike West Bengal, there is No Navapatrika Sthapana in Bihar. However, Bodhan and Billva Nimantran is performed in the eastern districts.While Ashtami is a Day of Great religious service, the juncture of Ashtami and Navami is considered most sacred, and is called Mahanisha Puja, which lasts for about Five Hours, unlike the Sandhi Puja, which is carried out for only 48 minutes.Navami is marked by Chandika Navami Homam or Fire sacrifice in honor of Durga. The day also hosts Animal sacrifices, though now not much prevalent, is still performed in very old temples of Shakti. Goats, Sheeps and Buffaloes are sacrificed. The meat hence obtained is distributed among the people free for consumption. However, such practices are now being condemned and animals have been replaced by vegetables.Pandal hopping reaches at its peak on this day.On the day of Dashmi, the Goddess is asked to recede back to her celestial abode. The Kalash is dismantled and the water from the Pitcher is sprinkled everywhere and around. The sproutings of Barley are uprooted from the <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> and is kept over the ears symbolising blessings related to prosperity and good health. The vine of the Aparajita plant is tied over the wrist for blessings related to success and victory. Rituals like Sindur Khela are not at all performed in Bihar as falling down of Sindur and playing with it is not considered auspicious in this state. Instead, the women folk put a Sindur tilaka from the tip of the nose up till the midway of the head for long life and well being of their husbands. Boys on the other hand are engaged in playing with colours.Flat wheat bread stuffed with lentils, curry of yam, fried crispy amorphophalous leaves, fish, kheer, are especially made on this day. It is believed that who so ever sees the Neelakantha Bird on the day of Dashmi would be very lucky and victorious throughout the year.Just as the sun begins to set, the Idols are carried over to the banks of river Ganga, and are immersed there in, with only memories to ponder upon but with a firm belief of the return of Universal mother the next year.|$|E
40|$|Two anomalous, gray, silty <b>clay</b> <b>beds</b> {{are present}} in ODP cores {{collected}} from Saanich Inlet, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The beds, which date to about 10, 500 14 C yr BP (11, 000 calendar years BP), contain Tertiary pollen derived from sedimentary rocks found only in the Fraser Lowland, on the mainland of British Columbia and Washington {{just east of the}} Strait of Georgia. Abundant illite-muscovite in the sediments supports a Fraser Lowland provenance. The <b>clay</b> <b>beds</b> are probably distal deposits of huge floods that swept through the Fraser Lowland {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene. Muddy overflow plumes from these floods crossed the Strait of Georgia and entered Saanich Inlet, where the sediment settled from suspension and blanketed diatom-rich mud on the fiord floor. The likely source of the floods is Late Pleistocene, ice-dammed lakes in the Fraser and Thompson valleys, which are known to have drained at about the time the floods occurred...|$|R
50|$|Gypsum {{is formed}} as an {{evaporative}} mineral, frequently found in alkaline lake muds, <b>clay</b> <b>beds,</b> evaporated seas, salt flats, salt springs, and caves. Gypsum, also, is frequently found {{in conjunction with}} other minerals such as, copper ores, sulfur and sulfides, silver, iron ores, coal, calcite, dolomite, limestone, and opal.

50|$|The {{base of the}} Upper Floridan aquifer {{is marked}} by two {{composite}} units (see below) and one confining unit in the middle part of the Floridan aquifer system: the Lisbon-Avon Park Composite Unit or the Middle Avon Park Composite Unit, and the Bucatunna Clay Confining Unit. In updip areas, {{the base of the}} Upper Floridan is either coincident with the top of the confining units above the Claiborne, Lisbon, or Gordon aquifers, or it lies above any <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> that marks the boundary between mostly carbonate and mostly clastic units or previously mapped numbered MCUs of Miller (1986). If one or more evaporite units are present, such as middle confining unit MCUIII near Valdosta in south-central Georgia (Miller, 1986) or MCUII in southwestern Florida (Miller, 1986), the base of the Upper Floridan aquifer is coincident with the top of the evaporite unit. In regions where no distinct lower permeability unit is known to be present, the base of the Upper Floridan is extrapolated along a horizon that allows for a stratigraphic grouping of permeable rock into the upper or lower parts of the aquifer system. In southeastern Alabama, northern Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, the stratigraphic units are grouped into the Lisbon-Avon Park Composite Unit. In peninsular Florida, this horizon is coincident with one or more evaporite-bearing or non-evaporite-bearing units of the Middle Avon Park Composite Unit. In the panhandle of Florida and southwest Alabama, the base is coincident with the top of the Bucatunna Clay Confining Unit.|$|E
50|$|In 1823 Newport (then New Port with New Village, and the 'West Side' of the settlement), {{was partly}} {{in the parish}} of Eastrington, partly part of an extra-parochial area, and within the Wapentake and Liberty of Howdenshire, and the Wapentake of Harthill. In the early 1770s the area that became Newport was the uncultivated and barren Walling Fen. A <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> 30 ft deep, and {{adjacent}} to the present village, was found and dug to provide material {{for the production of}} bricks, tiles and earthenware. A quantity of 1,700,000 tiles and 2,000,000 bricks were being made annually by 1823. The village that had grown over 50 years attained a population of 339 and a Wesleyan chapel, established 1814, with Sunday School to educate 200 poor children for Newport and surrounding villages. Occupations in 1823 for Newport, New Village and West Side, included nine farmers, two blacksmiths, seven brick and tile manufacturers, an earthenware manufacturer, two butchers, two carpenters, two coal merchants, three corn millers, five drapers, one of whom was a druggist, three grocers, two saddlers, two shoemakers,five tailors, eight master mariners, a bricklayer, a hair dresser, a sacking weaver & basket maker, two shopkeepers, a baker, a gardener, a schoolmaster, and the landlords of The Turk's Head, The King's Arms Inn, and The Crown & Anchor public houses. A packet boat conveyed goods and passengers by water to Hull and back once a week. A carrier conveyed goods and passengers by land to Hull, and to Howden, once a week. A mail coach ran to Hull and Doncaster daily.|$|E
30|$|The {{same type}} of aquifer system {{persists}} {{in the western part}} of Sone River, in Bhojpur District. A <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> (~ 25 -m thick) separating the Holocene and Pleistocene aquifer is delineated (Saha et al. 2010). The <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> vertically separates the aquifer system; the shallow aquifer occurring above the <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> is assigned to the Holocene age and the aquifer occurring below this <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> is marked as a Pleistocene aquifer. The same study shows this <b>clay</b> <b>bed</b> to be laterally extensive in the east–west direction across Sone River.|$|E
40|$|Post-depositional normal faults {{within the}} turbidite {{sequence}} of the Late Miocene Mount Messenger Formation of the Taranaki basin, New Zealand are characterised by granulation and cataclasis of sands and by the smearing of <b>clay</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>Clay</b> smears maintain continuity for high ratios of fault throw to <b>clay</b> source <b>bed</b> thickness (c. 8), but are highly variable in thickness, and gaps occur at any point between the <b>clay</b> source <b>bed</b> cutoffs at higher ratios. Although cataclastic fault rock permeabilities may be significantly lower (c. 2 orders of magnitude) than host rock sandstone permeabilities, the occurrence of continuous clay smears, combined with low clay permeabilities (10 's to 100 's nD) means that the primary control on fault rock permeability is clay smear continuity. A new permeability predictor, the Probabilistic Shale Smear Factor (PSSF), is developed which incorporates the main characteristics of clay smearing from the Taranaki Basin. The PSSF method calculates fault permeabilities from a simple model of multiple clay smears within fault zones, predicting a more heterogeneous and realistic fault rock structure than other approaches (e. g. Shale Gouge Ratio, SGR). Nevertheless, its averaging effects at higher ratios of fault throw to bed thickness provide a rationale {{for the application of}} other fault rock mixing models, e. g. SGR, at appropriate scales...|$|R
