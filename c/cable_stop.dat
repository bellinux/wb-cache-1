25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a <b>cable</b> <b>stop</b> {{on the frame}} or fork to terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E
2500|$|This type of brake has {{symmetrical}} {{arms and}} therefore centre more effectively. [...] The cable housing attaches to a fixed <b>cable</b> <b>stop</b> {{attached to the}} frame, and the inner cable bolts to a sliding piece (called a [...] "braking delta", [...] "braking triangle", or [...] "yoke") or a small pulley, over which runs a straddle cable connecting the two brake arms. Tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms, preventing the brake from taking a [...] "set" [...] to {{one side or the}} other.|$|E
2500|$|V-brakes {{function}} {{well with}} the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes {{because they do not}} require a separate <b>cable</b> <b>stop</b> on the frame or fork. Because of the higher mechanical advantage of V-brakes, they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes. [...] Mechanical (i.e. cable-actuated) disc brakes use the same amount of cable travel as V-brakes, except for those that are described as being [...] "road" [...] specific. As a general rule, mechanical disc brakes for so-called [...] "flat bar" [...] bicycles (chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles) are compatible with V-brake levers, whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for [...] "drop-bar" [...] bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs (cantilever, caliper, and U-brake).|$|E

50|$|They do allow {{use of a}} {{slightly}} shorter cable, tend to keep the cable more clean (as it is more protected from grit thrown up from the road), and the loop of housing at the rear derailleur {{does not need to}} bend quite as tightly, since the <b>cable</b> <b>stop</b> is on the top side of the chainstay, rather than beneath it. Despite the advantages this routing is almost exclusively found on older bikes.|$|E

50|$|The {{single cable}} from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to {{opposite}} sides of the stem or fork steer tube and into <b>cable</b> <b>stops.</b> The inner <b>cables</b> connect to metal tabs on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. Squeezing the brake lever pulls the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached {{to the bottom of the}} thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through <b>cable</b> <b>stops</b> mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.|$|R

5000|$|... top pull : This type is more {{commonly}} seen on mountain bikes without rear-suspension. The derailleur is actuated by a cable pulling upwards, {{which is usually}} routed along the frame's top tube, using <b>cable</b> <b>stops</b> and a short length of housing to change the cable's direction. This arrangement keeps the cable away from {{the underside of the}} bottom bracket/down tube which get pelted with dirt when off-road.|$|R

25|$|Lieutenant Commander Cookson {{accepted}} the order. Steaming up river {{with his gun}} boats, the RN/RIM units passed through the Ottoman lines under heavy fire. However, just short of Kut, they found the river blocked {{by a combination of}} sunken river boats and steel <b>cables.</b> <b>Stopped</b> by the obstruction, the Anglo-Indian riverboats attempted to cut their way through.

2500|$|... "Mini V-brakes" [...] (or [...] "mini V's") are V-brakes with shorter arms, {{typically}} between 8 and 9 centimeters. This {{reduces the}} required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra <b>cable</b> <b>stops.</b> On the downside, their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally {{make for a}} less forgiving setup: they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes, may pose problems for mounting fenders, can be clogged more easily by mud, and {{they can make it}} harder to change wheels.|$|R

5000|$|Th {{position}} at the State Department also did not last long. Cox surmised that Finletter [...] "was a little too ambitious."

5000|$|Robinson {{returned}} to Toronto {{to attempt a}} world record cable jump from the CN Tower for a feature-length television documentary film called The World's Most Spectacular Stuntman. The first test of the cable using a bag of water equal to Robinson's weight smashed into the ground when the cable snapped. High winds and bad weather delayed the jump until August 12, 1980. Although visibly nervous, he leapt from the tower's edge, plummeting more than 1,200 feet (366 m) tied to only a 1/8" [...] (3 mm) steel <b>cable,</b> <b>stopping</b> only a short distance above the ground.
