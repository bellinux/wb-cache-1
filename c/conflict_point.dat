However, if one were to compare a site with another in terms of safety, the use of accident frequency will be of a limited value since no account is taken of exposure to risk.

40|$|Regardless {{of signing}} and signalization, {{at-grade}} intersections {{have the potential}} for vehicle-vehicle collisions as a result of vehicular conflicts. Intersection conflict points represent the locations where vehicle paths meet as they move from one intersection leg to another. Intersection <b>conflict</b> <b>point</b> analysis is a well understood means of comparing the relative safety of alternative intersection designs (1). The basic premise suggests that the intersection safety performance will decline when the design results in more conflict points. This approach is useful, but is ultimately limited because it assumes that the crash risk is equal at each <b>conflict</b> <b>point,</b> when in fact, the crash risk associated with each <b>conflict</b> <b>point</b> varies depending on the complexity and volumes of the movements involved. The greatest crash risk movements (i. e., those accounting for the largest proportion of crashes) at a typical four-legged, two-way stop controlled (TWSC) rural expressway intersection are usually the minor road left-turn and crossing maneuvers (2). Therefore, elimination or minimization of these left-turning and crossing conflicts could be an effective means of improving safety at rural expressway intersections.

40|$|The {{safety at}} {{alternative}} intersections is largely unknown. Alternative intersections typically relocate the left-turn {{movement from the}} primary intersection {{with the objective of}} achieving operational and safety benefits. Although there have been a handful of studies which provide information on the safety impact of a few select alternative intersections, these studies are limited in number and tend to be regionally specific. The work herein seeks to evaluate the feasibility of predicting safety at alternative intersections by building an intersection from a microscopic perspective. Four models were developed: a binary logit model was developed to predict the likelihood of a merge crash in a month at a merge <b>conflict</b> <b>point,</b> the likelihood of a diverge crash in a month at a diverge <b>conflict</b> <b>point,</b> and the likelihood of a crossing crash in a month at a crossing <b>conflict</b> <b>point.</b> A multivariate model was developed to better understand the interplay between merge, diverge and crossing conflict points at the intersection level. The models indicate that variables representing weather, exposure, geometry, and complexity are present in all of the microscopic models. Finally, the results of the aggregated model indicate that there is a relationship between the likelihoods of a merge, diverge and crossing crash. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, many of {{the foreign}} traffic-safety {{analyses}} point out {{the low level of}} traffic safety in multi-lane roundabouts. This problem is resolved in several ways in different countries; however, the solution, whereby the number of <b>conflict</b> <b>points</b> is diminished (e. g. turbo roundabout) has proven to be the most successful. However, the turbo roundabout also has its deficiencies: it has <b>conflict</b> crossing <b>points</b> and larger reconstruction of the existing two-lane roundabout is needed when the turbo roundabout is to be implemented instead of the existing one. In the paper a new type of roundabout has been introduced; the roundabout with “depressed” lanes for right turning (“the flower-roundabout”). Financially speaking, the main advantage of the new type of roundabout is that it can be implemented within the dimensions of the already existing “normal” two-lane roundabout.

40|$|Visibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues in almost all geometrical norms for road and intersection design. This paper deals with the question of visibility on roundabouts but from a different point of view in respect of the norms that have currently been adopted regarding capacity and safety issues. Attention is focussed on the simple consideration that many trajectories, in well designed roundabouts, are curvilinear and therefore two possible measures of distances between vehicles can be calculated along their trajectories and directly (such as the Euclidean distance) between the vehicles themselves. The first measure is associated with the distance in terms of the <b>conflict</b> <b>point</b> and the second one represents the sight distance between the vehicles. These two distances are generally different on a roundabout. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate both analytically (through a mathematical representation) and experimentally (by using trajectories processed from video images shot on a working roundabout) that in many cases the visual distance is less than the distance to the <b>conflict</b> <b>point.</b> This difference changes in time (and space) according to the speeds of vehicles. Comparisons between the two approaches, applied to a real case, are also provided. Three cases are taken into consideration (1 - two vehicles both circulating both in the circulating roadway, 2 -one is circulating in the circulating roadway and the other is entering, 3 -both vehicles are entering) highlighting the effect that visibility can produce...|$|E

40|$|Generally road intersections are {{the most}} {{dangerous}} places into the road space. This is mainly caused from the many <b>conflicting</b> <b>points</b> existing in that road area. Generally roundabout reduces considerably the number of <b>conflicting</b> <b>points</b> {{with respect to a}} stop or yield intersection, from 32 to 8 <b>conflicting</b> <b>points.</b> For this reason, in recent years, many countries have adopted roundabouts as a design solution for both urban and rural road intersections. This happens even if the available space is not enough: for this reason, {{there are a lot of}} non-standard roundabouts, for example with one of legs without deflection. The absence of deflection can modify the roundabouts performance. Roundabout works well if specific traffic and geometric conditions exist. The parameter used to estimate if a roundabout can work well or not is its capacity (where capacity is defined as the maximum entering flow). One of more popular method to investigate roundabout performances is based on the relationship between entering flow (Qe) and circulating flow (Qc). These models have been built by using statistical regressions and only for well designed roundabouts. The paper reports a different approach to the phenomenon: an approach based on geostatistical theories, which consider the relationship between Qe and Qc as a regionalized phenomenon. According to this collected data are not random values but are supposed to be related to each other with a defined law. The paper analyzed both roundabouts with and without deflection...|$|R

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] {{address the problem of}} how a set of agents can decide to share a resource, represented as a unit-sized pie. The pie can be generated by the entire set but also by some of its subsets. We investigate a finite horizon non-cooperative bargaining game, in which the players take it in turns to make proposals on how the resource should for this purpose be allocated, and the other players vote on whether or not to accept the allocation. Voting is modelled as a Bayesian weighted voting game with uncertainty about the players’ weights. The agenda, (i. e., the order in which the players are called to make offers), is defined exogenously. We focus on impatient players with heterogeneous discount factors. In the case of a conflict, (i. e., no agreement by the deadline), no player receives anything. We provide a Bayesian subgame perfect equilibrium for the bargaining game and conduct an ex-ante analysis of the resulting outcome. We show that the equilibrium is unique, computable in polynomial time, results in an instant Pareto optimal outcome, and, under certain conditions provides a foundation for the core and also the nucleolus of the Bayesian voting game. In addition, our analysis leads to insights on how an individual’s bargained share is in- fluenced by his position on the agenda. Finally, we show that, if the <b>conflict</b> <b>point</b> of the bargaining game changes, then the problem of determining the non-cooperative equilibrium becomes NP-hard even under the perfect information assumption.
