40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the classical task of transporting resources from source to home {{by a group}} of autonomous robots. The robots use ant-like trail following to navigate between home and source. This paper studies the effect on global performance <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view of each robot’s trail-following sensor. It is shown that, under certain conditions, a narrow <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view can improve system performance. We argue that the benefit is obtained by selectively degrading the individuals’ trail-following ability so that more work space is exploited in parallel, thus decreasing mutual spatial interference. This “worse-is-better ” idea may be applicable to other large-scale multi-robot systems. I...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This {{research}} {{is about the}} <b>changing</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity of elderly care physicians. The theory of planned behavior is used to study {{the changes in the}} <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity. Successfulness of change is operationalized as the level of modernity in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity. The relationships between readiness to change, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control and successfulness of change are investigated. Also, the role of organizational culture, commitment to the association for elderly care physicians Verenso and commitment to postgraduate medical education are researched. In order to accomplish the objective of this study, the research questions to be answered are: How do characteristics of elderly care physicians influence the level of modernity in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity, and what are the roles of organizational culture, commitment to postgraduate medical education and commitment to Verenso in the <b>changing</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity? Methods A questionnaire has been distributed among elderly care physicians and elderly care residents in the Netherlands in order to obtain the necessary data. Regression analyses have been done to analyze the data. Results The linear regression analysis shows that readiness to change, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control have a positive significant relationship with the level of modernity. When the variables of the theory of planned behavior are taken together, subjective norm is the only variable which, according to the multiple regression analysis, has a significant positive relationship with level of modernity. This means that subjective norm is of relative higher importance in explaining the successfulness of change than are readiness to change and perceived behavioral control. To increase the level of modernity in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity all three variables should be taken into account whereby special attention should be given to subjective norm. Further more, a strong clan culture enhances the relationship between readiness to change and the level of modernity. Moreover, a mediating effect of subjective norm on the relationship between the independent variable commitment to Verenso and the dependent variable level of modernity has been found. Discussion The main strength {{of this study is that}} it is among the first to provide a thorough overview of the influences on changes in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity of elderly care physicians. The theory driven assessment adds support for Ajzen’s (1991) theory of planned behavior, and can be useful for postgraduate medical education and Verenso, since they are currently busy with <b>changing</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> activity of elderly care physicians. ...|$|R
