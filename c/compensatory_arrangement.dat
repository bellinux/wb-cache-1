Rival water users negotiate their competing claims by activating rules, and confronting {{them to come}} to local arrangements. The type of local arrangement capable of overcoming rivalry depends on the power that rules confer on the respective users. The property rights or public policies activated confer a role of owner or final beneficiary on the users. If two owners confront one another, then a transactional arrangement is needed: the users reach agreement and share the costs of the arrangement. Alternatively, if a final beneficiary confronts an owner, then a <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangement</b> is necessary. In this situation, the state must compensate the loss of property financially. The qualitative comparison of four cases of water rivalries partially refutes these initial assumptions and reveals that non-owners can succeed against owners when they successfully activate public policies...|$|E
40|$|The BP {{oil spill}} {{litigation}} and subsequent settlements {{provide an opportunity}} to explore a novel societal economic deterrence rationale for classwide supra-compensatory damages. Judge Jack Weinstein was a pioneer in the field of punitive damages class certification. In In re Simon II, he certified a nationwide punitive-damages-only class in a multijurisdiction, multidefendant tobacco lawsuit. Using Judge Weinstein’s innovations in In re Simon II as an analytical lens, the Article evaluates the future prospects for classwide punitive damages claims. Specifically, the Article considers how private litigants might adopt a societal damages approach in negotiating and achieving class action settlements. Class action settlements readily accommodate the “public law” dimension of societal damages, as demonstrated by the classwide punitive damages settlement with BP’s co-defendant Halliburton. Indeed, on closer inspection, even the BP compensatory damages class settlement has a surrounding aura of societal damages. For even that ostensibly purely <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangement</b> included an unusual (and mostly overlooked) feature: a provision for supra-compensatory multipliers applicable to certain claimants. This Article advances the new idea that these supra-compensatory multipliers are a form of classwide societal damages embedded within the settlement, and, in turn, a potential blueprint for nascent punitive damages classes of the future...|$|E
40|$|Service {{providers}} (aka executives) to {{partnerships and}} to corporations confront {{a number of}} choices as to how their <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangement</b> may be structured and the tax consequences thereof. In the simplest case, an individual may render services to an enterprise in return for cash payments over the period of service. In this non-equity setting, the issue is straightforward and non-controversial. The service provider is treated as receiving ordinary income for services rendered. The return {{on his or her}} expenditure of human capital is taxed at progressive rates. Once the relationship between the service provider and the enterprise becomes more complicated through the service provider 2 ̆ 7 s receipt of an equity interest in the enterprise, the tax treatment of the return becomes more complex. If the service provider receives an equity interest in return for services, the issue of whether the receipt of, and return on, the equity interest is attributable to human capital or invested capital is confronted. A tension arises between conceptualizing the receipt of and return on an equity interest and the economic enhancement which it generates as a return on human capital, generating ordinary income, or as a return on invested capital, which in certain settings may be taxed preferentially as capital gain. In the corporate context, stock in the corporation may be issued in return for the rendition of future services. It may be transferred outright, i. e., free and clear, or be restricted, i. e., conditioned upon the rendition of services for a fixed period of time. Various tax issues are confronted—when is the income taken into account, what amount is taken into account, what is the character of the income from such receipt, and whether and to what extent its compensatory origin must be segregated from any subsequent appreciation in the equity interest. Subchapter K raises similar issues in the services-for-equity context regarding partnerships, but the tax consequences arise under a single tax, rather than double tax, regime for the enterprise. However, in the partnership context, three types of equity interests may be utilized for compensatory purposes, i. e., a capital interest with an attendant right to profits, a restricted capital with profits interest, and a pure profits interest. Critics have recently advocated a change in the tax treatment of the return from a compensatory profits interest in a partnership. They conclude that the current tax treatment of the receipt of and return on such an interest is seriously flawed, violating fundamental principles of tax policy. Unfortunately, such advocacy is limited to a narrow analysis of the results generated by a compensatory receipt of a profits interest and lacks a thorough comparison with, and analysis of, the treatment of the traditional compensatory equity transfers in the two dominant business contexts employed in the United States economy, i. e., partnerships and corporations. This Article provides a broader discussion of compensatory equity transfers (capital interests as well as profits interests) in the partnership context and discusses the similarities and dissimilarities between these compensatory arrangements and those arising in the corporate setting. By doing so, this Article illustrates the erroneous assumption that profits interests derive unique and unfair tax treatment. The recent assault on the status quo treatment of a profits interest in a partnership has gathered momentum, in large part due to the inflammatory rhetoric which attends the academic commentary and the focus by the media on the economic success of private equity ventures. Bills have been introduced in Congress to mandate that such receipts generate ordinary income, rather than preferential capital gain, to the recipient. To date, none has been enacted. However, with the economic freefall and the Congressional need to generate additional tax revenues, the issue of the proper taxation of a compensatory transfer of a profits interest in a partnership will likely be revisited in the next legislative session. By focusing on but one of the five traditional types of available equity transfers (a profits interest), most of the academic commentary has confused, rather than clarified, the need for reform. The treatment of the return on human capital and on invested capital has never been as clear or as singular as commentators suggest. The Code, for sound policy reasons, refrains from disentangling the return on human capital from the return on invested capital when the service provider 2 ̆ 2 re-invests 2 ̆ 2 his or her return on human capital in the enterprise by foregoing annual compensation. With regard to profits interests, the role of § 702 (b), which requires that all partners in a partnership, regardless of how they acquired ownership of their interest, characterize the nature of their share of the income at the partnership, not the partner, level, is overlooked. Additionally, compensatory profits interests possess implicit, if not explicit, restrictions on transfer and thus require treatment akin to that accorded restricted capital interests in a partnership and restricted corporate stock. Finally, some of the treatment accorded profits interests is attributable to the fundamental differences between the tax treatment of partnerships (single level of tax) and corporations (double level of tax), which some critics either minimize or ignore. Accordingly, this Article critiques proposals for change with regard to the suggested modification of the tax treatment of profits interests, in large measure by illustrating the misperception of the current operation of Subchapter K of the Code and enterprise equity compensation as a whole. The entire field of compensatory transfers of equity interests and the allocation of the return therefrom to human capital and/or invested capital is surveyed from a tax policy standpoint. In this broader context, the status quo (subject to an elective defect) from a normative standpoint is equal, or superior, to any of the proposals recently advanced. Finally, with the misdirected emphasis on the tax treatment of profits interests, the real opportunity for reform of the area is overlooked. The ability to recognize income in the year of receipt of a restricted compensatory equity interest under § 83 (b) permits recipients to minimize the impact of the progressive rates. This treatment is far more inconsistent with the taxation of human capital than is the current tax treatment of compensatory profits interests. As a modest proposal for reform, this Article advances the repeal of § 83 (b) which, if enacted, would constitute significantly broader reform than recent proposals and would result in an overall improvement of the current tax law from a policy standpoint...|$|E

5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangements</b> for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|R
30|$|Kroll et al. ([2007]) {{suggest that}} the initial top {{management}} team (TMT) members have accompanied the firms {{for many years and}} possess tacit knowledge and common visions. The establishment of such common visions requires long time of fostering and continuous interaction. TMTs with common goals usually are more flexible, respond more quickly to changes, and handle problems better. They also believes that the initial TMTs are the primal providers of key human resources for IPO firms, and such human resources exist in the tacit knowledge and personal investment of TMT members in the growth processes of firms. The acquisition of tacit knowledge is also relatively difficult because it is established on the mutually trusting interpersonal relationship, while common visions are formed gradually in long-term work. The ownership status of TMT is observable by outside investors because firms are obliged to disclose the ownership status and <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangements</b> of their TMTs. Beatty and Zajac ([1994]) point out that ownership arrangement enables the management team to diversify the risk of firm failure. Investors may regard such risk diversification as signals of management devotion and corporate quality and performance.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangements</b> for health related expenses. It is important that these are executed correctly, to prevent {{that people who are}} entitled to compensation do not receive the compensation and that people claim the compensation who are not entitled to receive a compensation. In 2008, the compensation arrangement for the obligatory deductible has been introduced. This compensation is paid automatically. People who do not receive the compensation but regard themselves as rightful claimants can ask for the compensation. An evaluation of the compensation arrangement of the Dutch Healthcare Authority shows that many requests for compensation of the obligatory deductible are not justified (85 %). This high number of not-justifiable requests leads to unnecessary cost of work. Current research shows that people who regard themselves as rightful claimants and ask for the compensation do not exactly know {{the ins and outs of}} the compensation arrangement. They also hardly look for information about this arrangement. To reduce the percentage of not-justifiable requests and the extra cost of work this causes, it is important to provide people with more information about the compensation arrangement for the obligatory deductible. This is expected to reduce also the number of people who are entitled to compensation but do not receive it...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{dictates}} that convenience goods should be distributed as intensively as possible. Still, exclusivity arrangements are rapidly gaining way in grocery retailing. We discuss the possible performance outcomes of exclusivity deals, and propose a unified framework (i) {{to quantify the}} gains and losses of such arrangements in consumer-packaged-goods markets, and (ii) to decompose the total monetary gains and losses {{into a variety of}} sources. Our framework considers both the manufacturer and the retailer granted the exclusivity right, and accounts for the fact that both dyad parties may be active in multiple, inter-related, categories. We illustrate the proposed approach in the context of Unilever s decision to limit the distribution of five of its (sub-) brands to a single retailer in the Dutch market, and derive the sales and profit implications for the parties involved. In all instances,we find that intensive distribution generates higher sales for themanufacturer than the exclusive arrangement, while such an arrangement is typically appealing for the retailer granted exclusivity. To come to a win-win situation, a variety of <b>compensatory</b> <b>arrangements</b> are considered. While manufacturers should not try to have leading incumbent products de-listed, we show how extra feature support for the exclusive brand may make an otherwise harmful arrangement beneficial for the manufacturer. In addition, we show how, in a number of instances, the total dyad profitability increases under exclusive arrangements, which offers rooms for margin re-negotiations. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|PES is a market-based scheme whose {{concept is}} {{based on the premise that}} those who provide {{environmental}} services (managers or sellers) by conserving natural ecosystems are compensated or incentivized by those who benefit from the services (the buyers). The term PES is used broadly aiming at ES enhancement through <b>compensatory</b> or rewards <b>arrangement</b> (van Noordwijk and Leimona (2010). However, Wunder (2005) and Engel et al. (2008) define PES as mechanisms which fits five sets of conditions; a voluntary transaction where, a well-defined environmental service (or land use likely to secure that service), is being “bought” by at least one buyer, from an environmental service provider, if, and only if, the environmental service provider secures environmental service provision (conditionality). The voluntary agreement between sellers and buyers of PES schemes is important, and incentives to farmers motivate them to sustainably adopt alternative PES farm practices (Ruto and Garrod 2009). Nevertheless, compensation or reward for environmental services (CRES) envisages efficient, equitable use and conservation of natural resources through contingent contracts between sellers and buyers of ecosystem services (Swallow et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether socio-economic variables were more related to reading achievement among grade four boys in urban Newfoundland than were certain educational inputs which have in the past been given emphasis in efforts to raise educational productivity in the province. Several minor hypotheses were set up to elucidate the relationships between reading achievement, as measured by vocabulary and paragraph comprehension scores, and the following variables: intelligence, father's occupation, mother's education, reading material at home, size of family, pupil absenteeism, teacher's qualifications and size of the school. [...] Three hundred and fifty pupils were selected randomly from the fourth grade male population in schools within the city limits and operating under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic School Board for St. John's. Data collection took place in May and June, 1968, using three standardized tests and two questionnaires. A complete set of data was obtained for 305 pupils, their parents, their twenty-five teachers and twelve schools. [...] Pearson product-moment correlation, partial product-moment correlation and multiple correlation were used to test the hypotheses. A descriptive analysis of the data, classifying pupils by each of the variables in the study and using means and medians, was also presented. Most of the calculations were carried out by means of the computer at Memorial University. [...] The major finding of this study revealed that when variables were combined in multiple correlation the socio-economic variables explained a much larger proportion of the variance in reading achievement than did the combined group of educational input variables. Furthermore, of the sociological variables considered, two - father's occupation and mother's education - predicted achievement in reading almost as well as the whole group combined. One other sociological factor, size of family, contributed slightly to the multiple correlation coefficient when reading comprehension was used as the dependent variable. The two educational variables used in this study accounted for only a negligible amount of the variance in pupils' reading achievement. However, of the whole group of factors considered, intelligence proved to be the best predictor of reading achievement. [...] The findings of this study suggest the need for educators to recognize that certain factors remote from the school exert a great influence on the reading achievement of pupils and to take these factors into account when devising educational policies and programs. <b>Compensatory</b> educational <b>arrangements</b> as well as diagnostic and remedial procedures to effect cure should be considered. Concomitantly, consideration should be given by those interested in education in the province to raising the socio-economic and cultural levels of the homes through a long-range program of involvement in adult education...|$|R
