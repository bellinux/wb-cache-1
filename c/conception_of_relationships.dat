40|$|This article {{provides}} a suggestive, theoretical perspective regarding the developmental nature of personal relationships across the human lifespan. As {{an alternative to}} linear thinking, this interpersonal communication perspective builds upon an organismic <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> that accommodates the complexities of relational changes over time, and advances a tetradic model of relational adjustment and adaptation. Building on the organismic perspective about relational change, this model identifies intensification, obsolescence, retrieval, and modification (or reversal) of interpersonal transactions as variable features of a given relationship. This theory provides a much-needed, simultaneous communicative approach {{to the study of}} any interpersonal relationship as it is influenced by and embedded in larger, complex kin, social, and socio-cultural networks across the lifespan. Dyadic, triadic, and socio-cultural relationships illustrate the changes that motivate this alternative perspective. Aspects of theoretic development create a system for projecting the usefulness of this alternative perspective. By exploring the dynamic and evolving communicative processes that emerge within varied relationships, researchers can further unfold the relational complexities of the aging process. Comprised of communicative interactions with romantic partners, family members, friends, co-workers and others, interpersonal relationships play an essential role in our personal and social lives. From these relationships and the influence of varied experiences individuals can discover themselves and patterns of personal development throughout their lifespan. An inherent part of these on-going relationships are many suppositions about relational change, redefinition, and in many cases complete change or transformation, whic...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} dissertation explores how {{the symbolic}} space of public space, and therefore memory and meaning {{attached to a}} place, could inspire {{the process of the}} design for a landscape intervention. The research argues that community identity of a neighbourhood can be enhanced through the landscape and, more specifically, through the memory that a landscape holds. Furthermore, it suggests that relationships can be fostered within a community through the use of urban public space. Public space is a platform for the initiation of events which in turn provides the opportunity for interaction and therefore the <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationships.</b> The area of study is Marabastad in South Africa, which underwent a number of forced evictions during the Apartheid regime. This community was uprooted and forced to live in racially demarcated areas. The development plans for Marabastad suggest that previous residents have the opportunity to return to their land. Adding to this, a new residential component is proposed for the area. This suggests that a new community would be present. It would consist of people who do not know one another as well as a combination of people who do and do not have knowledge of the area’s past. In order to initiate the interactions between these community members the author proposed a landscape intervention in the form of urban public space for Marabastad. The physical landscape intervention was conceived through recognising the memory that the site holds. The memory of certain events was revealed {{while at the same time}} the opportunity for new memories and associations to the landscape was created. In this way the traumatic past that Marabastad has experienced is overlaid with new and inspiring memories. Dissertation (ML(Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Architectureunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} orthographic {{analyses of}} selected works of Musorgsky. The thesis argues that more traditional methods, such as voice-leading analysis or set-theory analysis, are, {{because of their}} particular historical and stylistic origins, limited in their application to Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music and, on this basis, it sets out to demonstrate {{the value of an}} orthographic approach. The thesis takes existing orthographic analyses of the music of later transitional, or post-tonal, figures such as Skriabin and Bartók, and extends the application of this approach to an earlier transitional notation and attempts by composers to give cogent articulation to an increasing number of non-traditional pitch structures. The thesis falls into six chapters. The first chapter reviews common perceptions of Musorgsky, especially the notion that his music is somehow technically deficient or limited by a self-didactic eccentricity. It concludes by surveying analytical approaches to Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music, and orthographic analyses of Bartók and Skriabin. The second chapter expounds the methodological principles of orthographic analysis. It examines common-practice conventions of orthography and then takes typical orthographic "problems" found in post-common-practice styles in order to show how novel structures are illuminated by the notational friction described above. The chapter concludes with a case study of Brahms 2 ̆ 7 s Intermezzo op. 118, no 6, which demonstrates how conventions of common-practice notation are sustained in a piece from the central tradition. Chapters Three and Five are dedicated to the analysis of Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s music. Each takes a work, or selections from a work, leading to a discussion of several related orthographic and tonal issues. The music examined includes selected passages from Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition, and the entire song cycle Sunless. Several issues arise from these analyses, notably Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s use of octave symmetry and polymodalism, and his radical <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> between individual chords and prevailing keys. The sixth chapter synthesises these findings and presents a revised view of Musorgsky 2 ̆ 7 s tonal thinking and practice, based on his orthography. At the centre of these findings lie key observations concerning the fusion in his music of "functional" and "non-functional" elements. This concluding chapter also speculates on the further potential role of orthographic analytical methods for musics of a traditional nature, especially those of Eastern European traditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} Church's {{understanding}} of the dual nature -in one person- of Christ, human and divine, {{to the issue of}} the strained between the Church and the State, within the Creation and the History. This question is approached and analysed through two theological, ecclesiological and canonical categories, alterity (otherness) and communion, which are based on the antinomical conciliar formula of a (comm) union "without confusion and without division". With the help of the systematic and canonical theology of the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451), it has investigated the Christological question, according to the author, of the relationships between the Church and the State on a global level, {{in the name of the}} a double and symmetrical divergence: occurs: on the one hand, the autonomisation of otherness leading to the minorisation of communion, in other words, division and separation between Church and State arising from turning otherness into absolute autonomy (without any communion and relationship); and on the other hand, the alienation of communion causing confusion, and leading to the absorption of otherness, in other words, absorption of the weak locally established Church by the powerful State leading to "confusion" (in the Chalcedonian sense) - without any alterity. In the first case, priority is given to being "without confusion" at the detriment of being "without division" (communion), whereas in the second, we observe the predominance of "without division" and the total abolition of "without confusion" (otherness-autonomy). The author enshrines in Church, Body of Christ, its very nature a combination of alterity (otherness) and communion. He argues that these characteristics are undermined by the twin distortions of State infliction and untamed separation, which are marred the relations between these two entities, the Church and the State. For fifteen centuries now, this <b>conception</b> <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> between the Church and the State has placed a burden at an ecumenical level. More precisely, the ecclesiological vision of the Council of Chalcedon was the simultaneous coexistence of otherness and communion between State and Church as a clearly paradoxical or antinomial feature of the christological mode of coexistence of the two natures of Christ: the human nature and the divine one. It naturally emerges that the coexistence of Church and State in a given state territory is realised through the acceptance of their ontological and institutional otherness and the preservation of communi(cati) on and relationship among them. Special reference is made to the case of the Political Dimension of the Church Eschatology...|$|E

40|$|Mary Ainsworth’s {{pioneering}} work has changed <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> infant-mother <b>relationships,</b> and by extension, <b>conceptions</b> <b>of</b> human <b>relationships</b> more generally. As John Bowlby’s major collaborator {{in the development}} of attachment theory, she is commonly credited with providing supporting empirical evidence for the theory while Bowlby is regarded as creating its basic framework. This view is too simple. Ainsworth's innovative ap-proach to studying the development <b>of</b> <b>relationships</b> not only made it possible to put some of Bowlby's ideas to empirical test, but her insights expanded the theory itself in fundamental ways. Among her major contributions are the concept of the attachment figure as a secure base from which an infant can explore the world, the identi-fication of patterns of infant-mother attachment as indicators <b>of</b> <b>relationship</b> quality, and the concept of parental sensitive responsiveness to infant signals as precursor to secure attachment. Without this work, attachment the-ory and research would not have attained the importance they currently hold in developmental and social psy-chology. That Ainsworth and Bowlby became collaborators was due to a series of fortunate coincidences, al-though their thinking about personality development had developed along congenial lines before they met. Their first encounter took place when both were in mid-life—after both of their professional careers had been interrupted by military service during the Second World War, but their most creative and original contributions still lay ahead.
