40|$|Abstract For many <b>companies,</b> <b>legacy</b> {{applications}} developed using a modeldriven approach {{based on}} (proprietary) domain-specific modeling languages (DSML’s) form an important asset, as they implement key business functionality. Unfortunately, if the underlying infrastructure comprising code generators, libraries, and model repositories fails {{to meet new}} demands of, e. g., modern web applications, the original benefits of the model-driven DSML approach can turn into a significant drawback. To remedy this, we explore how models specified with a proprietary DSML in use at a large financial services company can be migrated to models conform the MDA, in order {{to benefit from the}} range of MDA standards. We describe the legacy model-driven engineering infrastructure, propose a migration approach, discuss how we implemented each migration step using metamodeling and transformation activities, and offer an analysis of the lessons learned. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{redesign}} elements {{of one of our}} <b>company’s</b> <b>legacy</b> products, a standard five speed commuter bicycle, in an effort to cut costs and expand the product’s profit margin through cost reduction. Through mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, component engineering, marketing, and engineering change researcher efforts, areas for cost improvements will be identified and developed through redesign. The tasks associated with these functional areas are clearly outlined in Appendix A and the resources responsible for these tasks are clearly outlined in Appendix B with resource loading addressed in Appendix J. Ultimately, mechanical components will be redesigned, manufacturing processes optimized, and labor and overhead will be analyzed in order to address current design and production problems and identify areas of high cost that can be improved. In turn, these improvements will be realized through product implementation...|$|R
