40|$|The DNA {{microarray}} is {{a powerful}} tool to study expression levels of thousands of genes simul-taneously. Often, cDNA libraries representing expressed genes of an organism are available, along with expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs are widely used as the probes for microarrays. Design-ing custom microarrays, rich in genes relevant to the experimental objectives, requires selection of probes based on their sequence. We have designed a probe selection method, called GeneSieve, to select EST probes for custom microarrays. To assign annotations to the ESTs, we cluster them into contigs using phrap. The larger contig sequences are then used for similarity search against known proteins in model organism such as Arabidopsis thaliana. We have designed three different methods to assign annotations to the contigs: bidirectional hits (BH), bidirectional best hits (BBH), and unidirectional best hits (UBH). We apply these methods to pine and potato EST sets. Results show that the UBH method assigns unambiguous annotations to a large fraction of contigs in an organism. Hence, we use UBH to assign annotations to ESTs in GeneSieve. To select a single EST from a contig, GeneSieve assigns a quality score to each EST based on its protein homology (PH), <b>cross</b> <b>hybridization</b> (CH), and relative length (RL). We use this quality score to rank ESTs according to seven different measures: length, 3 ′ proximity, 5 ′ proximity, protein homology, <b>cross</b> <b>hybridization...</b>|$|E

We utilized a modified Southern <b>Cross</b> <b>hybridization</b> to display the hybridization pattern of all size-separated restriction fragments from wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans to all the corresponding fragments in a particular mutant strain and in a distinct C. elegans variety. In this analysis, almost all homologous restriction fragments are the same size in both strains and result in an intense diagonal of hybridization, whereas homologous fragments that differ in size between the two strains generate an off-diagonal spot. To attenuate the contribution of repeated sequences in the genome to spurious off-diagonal spots, restriction fragments from each genome were partially resected with a 3 ' or 5 ' exonuclease and not denatured, so that only the DNA sequences at the ends of these fragments could hybridize. Off-diagonal hybridization spots were detected at the expected locations when genomic DNA from wild-type was compared to an unc- 54 mutant strain containing a 1. 5 kb deletion or to a C. elegans variety that contains dispersed transposon insertions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{molecular}} recognition {{based on the}} complementary base pairing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the fundamental principle {{in the fields of}} genetics, DNA nanotechnology and DNA computing. We present an exhaustive DNA sequence design algorithm that allows to generate sets containing a maximum number of sequences with defined properties. EGNAS (Exhaustive Generation of Nucleic Acid Sequences) offers the possibility of controlling both interstrand and intrastrand properties. The guanine-cytosine content can be adjusted. Sequences can be forced to start and end with guanine or cytosine. This option reduces the risk of “fraying” of DNA strands. It is possible to limit <b>cross</b> <b>hybridizations</b> of a defined length, and to adjust the uniqueness of sequences. Self-complementarity and hairpin structures of certain length can be avoided. Sequences and subsequences can optionally be forbidden. Furthermore, sequences can be designed to have minimum interactions with predefined strands and neighboring sequences. Results The algorithm is realized in a C++ program. TAG sequences can be generated and combined with primers for single-base extension reactions, which were described for multiplexed genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thereby, possible foldback through intrastrand interaction of TAG-primer pairs can be limited. The design of sequences for specific attachment of molecular constructs to DNA origami is presented. Conclusions We developed a new software tool called EGNAS for the design of unique nucleic acid sequences.

Based on sequence conservation among grass species, we selected Affymetrix GeneChip® wheat genome array {{as a tool to}} analyze changes in gene expression profiles of three Festuca species in response to varying levels of glyphosate. Differences in transcript expression upon glyphosate application at 5 % and 20 % of the recommended rate were recorded. Differences highlighted metabolic categories, including photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and stress responses. Expression levels of a larger number of transcripts altered with 20 % glyphosate. RT-PCR analysis was conducted for experimental validation. This is the first report to analyze the potential of <b>cross</b> species <b>hybridization</b> in Festuca species and the data help extend our knowledge on the cellular processes affected by glyphosate. Autophagy related gene, Atg 8 has been used for monitoring autophagy in various organisms. In this study, Atg 8 gene was identified in Brachypodium distachyon (named as BdAtg 8) under osmotic stress. Expression profile of BdAtg 8 was examined in a variety of tissues of different ages and osmotic stress conditions. Expression level of BdAtg 8 elevated with osmotic stress, especially in the roots. BdAtg 8 complemented atg 8 Δ[delta]::kan MX yeast mutants grown under starvation conditions. Monodansylcadaverine was used to observe autophagosomes, and autophagy was shown to be constitutively active in Brachypodium. Autophagy was more active in plants exposed to osmotic stress. BdATG 8 protein was expressed in yeast and analyzed with western blotting. In conclusion, under osmotic stress conditions, BdAtg 8 gene is required for induction of autophagy in Brachypodium...|$|R
