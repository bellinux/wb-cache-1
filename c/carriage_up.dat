5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
25|$|For safety, train {{formations}} {{consist of}} one locomotive pushing a single <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> {{the mountain and}} leading it down again while the locomotive brakes allow a controlled descent. (On opening, the usual practice {{was to have a}} locomotive pushing two coaches; this was changed in 1923.) The carriage is not coupled to the locomotive, as gravity keeps the two in contact, although an electric cable is run between the locomotive and the carriage, which enables a buzzer to be used to signal between the driver and the guard. The cable is designed to pull free if the locomotive and carriage separate. Not being coupled prevents a carriage being dragged down the mountain if a locomotive derailed, as happened in the opening day accident.|$|E
25|$|Camacho's {{body was}} flown to New York City on November 29 and {{presented}} at Elcock Funeral Home in Queens. On Friday, {{his body was}} taken to Saint Cecilia's Church on Manhattan for a religious service. Camacho was buried on December 1 in Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Before the burial, a parade was held in Camacho's honor in East Harlem. Two white horses pulled a hearse <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> First Avenue surrounded by fans, friends and family of the late boxer. Camacho's casket was draped in a Puerto Rican flag. After a visitation and mass at St. Cecilia's Church on East 106th Street on November 30 and December 1, Camacho was buried {{on the afternoon of}} December 1, 2012, in Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx.|$|E

500|$|Pedro II was {{acclaimed}} {{as the new}} Brazilian Emperor on 9 April. Bewildered by his parents' abandonment {{and frightened}} by the large crowds and thundering artillery salutes, he wept inconsolably as he was taken, with Mariana de Verna at his side, by <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to the City Palace. The frightened young Emperor was displayed along with his sisters {{at one of the}} windows of the palace. He stood atop a chair so that he could be seen by the assembled thousands and observe their acclamations. The Brazilians were touched by this [...] "figure of a small orphan who would rule them one day." [...] The entire ordeal, followed by the roar of saluting cannon, was so traumatic to the little emperor that it may account for his noted aversion to ceremonies as an adult.|$|E
2500|$|The town's other station, Epsom Town, {{was closed}} in 1929; {{although}} most of the listed buildings remain. The station is of historic interest being the arrival point for Queen Victoria and her entourage prior to taking a <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to Epsom Downs.|$|E

60|$|Finding {{that the}} cost of <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> the country was very high, and as he would yearly require many waggon-loads of young trees and fencing Mr Humphreys {{determined}} to do his own teaming; he therefore bought two of the large country-waggons and set a Kaffir to work to break in some young steers to the yoke.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} at Folking, before Hester had started, that Caldigate himself should drive the waggonette into Cambridge {{to take her}} back on the Wednesday, but that he would bring a servant with him who should drive the <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to the Grange, so that he, personally, should not have to appear {{at the door of the}} house. He would remain at Mr. Seely's, and then the waggonette should pick him up. This had been explained to Mrs. Bolton. 'John will remain in town, because he has so much to do with Mr. Seely,' Hester had said; 'and Richard will call here at about twelve.' All her plans had thus been made known, and Mrs. Bolton was aware at what hour the bolts must be drawn and the things removed.|$|E

6000|$|They all drove {{together}} in the Willises' <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> the sloping road from Callao to Lima, and Mary heard astonishment, such as she had once felt, breaking out in screams from the children {{at the sight of}} omnibuses filled with gaily-dressed negroes, and brown horsewomen in Panama hats and lace-edged trousers careering down the road. But then, her father had come and fetched her from on board, and that dear mamma was waiting in the carriage! They entered the old walled town when twilight had already closed in, and Mrs. Willis was anxious to take her tired little ones home at once. They were set down at their own door; but Mr. Ward, with protecting anxious kindness, insisted on seeing Miss Ponsonby safely home before he would join them. As they drove through the dark streets, Mary heard a little restless movement, betraying some embarrassment; and at last, with an evident desire of reassuring her, he said, 'Senora Rosita is thought very pleasing and engaging;' and then, as if willing to change the subject, he hastily added, 'I suppose you did not speak the Pizarro?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Was Pendennis {{becoming}} worldly, or only {{seeing the}} worldly, or both? {{and is a}} man very wrong for being after all only a man? Which is the most reasonable, and does his duty best: he who stands aloof from the struggle of life, calmly contemplating, or he who descends to the ground, and takes his part in the contest? [...] "That philosopher," [...] Pen said, [...] "had held a great place amongst {{the leaders of the}} world, and enjoyed to the full what it had to give of rank and riches, renown and pleasure, who came, weary-hearted, out of it, and said that all was vanity and vexation of spirit. Many a teacher of those whom we reverence, and who steps out of his <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to his carved cathedral place, shakes his lawn ruffles over the velvet cushions, and cries out, that the whole struggle is an accursed one, and the works of the world are evil. Many a conscience-stricken mystic flies from it altogether, and shuts himself out from it within convent walls (real or spiritual), whence he can only look up to the sky, and contemplate the heaven out of which there is no rest, and no good.|$|E
60|$|The scenery {{was very}} much varied, too; and the changes were on so grand a scale that they made the views which were {{presented}} on every side appear extremely imposing. Sometimes the road lay across a wide plain, many miles in extent, but extremely fertile and luxuriant, and bounded in the distance by blue and beautiful mountains. After travelling upon one of these plains for many hours, the road would gradually approach the mountains, and then at length would enter among them, and begin to wind, by zigzags, up a broad slope, or into a dark ravine. At such places Vittorio would stop, usually at a post house {{at the foot of}} the ascent, and take an additional horse, or pair of horses, and sometimes a yoke of oxen, to help his team draw the <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> the hill. Many of these ascents were four or live miles long, and as the road turned upon itself in continual zigzags, there was presented to Mr. George and Rollo, and also to Mrs. Gray's party within the carriage, as they ascended, a perpetual succession of widely-extended views over the vast plain below, with the road which they had traversed stretching across it in a straight line for ten or fifteen miles, like a white ribbon.|$|E

6000|$|A severe shock awaited him. He {{found his}} patient cured by the draught! It was {{contrary}} to all rule and precedent; it savored of quackery--the red lavender {{had no business}} {{to do what the}} red lavender had done--but there she was, nevertheless, up and dressed, and contemplating a journey to London on the next day but one. [...] "An act of duty, doctor, is involved in this--whatever the sacrifice, I must go!" [...] No other explanation could be obtained. The patient was plainly determined--nothing remained for the physician but to retreat with unimpaired dignity and a paid fee. He did it. [...] "Our art," [...] he explained to Lady Lundie in confidence, [...] "is nothing, after all, but a choice between alternatives. For instance. I see you--not cured, as you think--but sustained by abnormal excitement. I have to ask which is the least of the two evils--to risk letting you travel, or to irritate you by keeping you at home. With your constitution, we must risk the journey. Be careful to keep the window of the <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> on the side on which the wind blows. Let the extremities be moderately warm, and the mind easy--and pray don't omit to provide yourself with a second bottle of the Mixture before you start." [...] He made his bow, as before--he slipped two guineas into his pocket, as before--and he went his way, as before, with an approving conscience, in the character of a physician who had done his duty. (What an enviable profession is Medicine! And why don't we all belong to it?) ...|$|E
6000|$|Henry Grantly and {{the lawyer}} found {{very little to}} say to each other on their long way out to Hogglestock. They were thinking, probably, much of the coming interview, and hardly knew how to express their {{thoughts}} to each other. [...] "I will not take the <b>carriage</b> <b>up</b> to the house," [...] said the major, as they were entering the parish of Hogglestock; [...] "particularly as the man must feed the horses." [...] So they got out at a farmhouse about half a mile from the church, where the offence of the carriage and livery-servant would be well out of Mr. Crawley's sight, and from thence walked towards the parsonage. The church, and the school close to it, lay on their way, and as they passed by the school door they heard voices within. [...] "I'll bet twopence he's there," [...] said Toogood. [...] "They tell me he's always either in one shop or the other. I'll slip in and bring him out." [...] Mr. Toogood had assumed a comfortable air, as though the day's work was to be good pastime, and even made occasional attempts at drollery. He had had his jokes about Dan Stringer, and had attempted to describe the absurdities of Mr. Crawley's visit to Bedford Row. All this would have angered the major, had he not seen that it was assumed to cover something below of which Mr. Toogood was a little ashamed, but of which, as the major thought, Mr. Toogood had no cause to be ashamed. When, therefore, Toogood proposed to go into the school and bring Mr. Crawley out, as though the telling of their story would be the easiest thing in the world, the major did not stop him. Indeed he had no plan of his own ready. His mind was too intent on the tragedy which had occurred, and which was now to be brought to a close, to enable him to form any plan as to the best way of getting up the last scene. So Mr. Toogood, with quick and easy steps, entered the school, leaving the major still standing in the road. Mr. Crawley was in the school;--as was also Jane Crawley. [...] "So here you are," [...] said Toogood. [...] "That's fortunate. I hope I find you pretty well?" ...|$|E

50|$|At one time, {{thirteen}} trains a day plied between Stamford through South Luffenham {{and on to}} Seaton {{railway station}} on a double line, although one track was taken up in 1914.

The line from Seaton was closed and lifted in 1966.|$|E
