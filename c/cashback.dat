25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer <b>cashback</b> on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.|$|E

2500|$|The UK Government {{published}} its Microgeneration Strategy in March 2006, {{although it}} {{was seen as a}} disappointment by many commentators. In contrast, the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 has been viewed as a positive step. To replace earlier schemes, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in April 2006, which provided grants to individuals, communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies. These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) for clean energy <b>cashback</b> via Feed-In Tariffs [...] for generating electricity from April 2010 and the Renewable Heat Incentive [...] for generating renewable heat from 28 November 2011.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cashback</b> offers {{combine a}} {{contracted}} monthly payment along with <b>cashback</b> amounts and dates {{at some point}} in the future.

50|$|<b>Cashback</b> deals allow {{retailers}} to attract customers to high-value contracts. The contract rate is paid {{directly to the}} network and is usually a standard tariff with many other customers paying the same rate. The <b>cashback</b> is received not from the network itself, but from the retailer, who uses the <b>cashback</b> as a sales device.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} time that it takes to receive the <b>cashback</b> {{benefits}} is dependent on the site.

50|$|These {{are usually}} the {{simplest}} reward websites from the user's perspective, since the reward website will usually display a task {{and the amount of}} <b>cashback</b> that will be rewarded for completing the task. <b>Cashback</b> websites are often rewarded for online shopping and there is usually a threshold on when a customer can withdraw their earnings, driving loyalty to the <b>cashback</b> website.|$|E

50|$|In addition, <b>cashback</b> offers {{may help}} to combat fraud on high value contracts. Where up-front {{inducements}} are used to incentivise sales, such as instant <b>cashback</b> or free merchandise, criminals may use fraud {{to gain access to}} the incentives. When the customer defaults on the contract, the network will recall the commission paid to the retailer and the retailer is out-of-pocket. <b>Cashback</b> deals paid over time allow the retailer to provide an incentive on condition that the consumer sticks to the terms of the contract, thereby securing the retailers' commission.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{although}} {{fees for}} debit card ATM usage are very rare {{in countries such}} as the UK, where <b>cashback</b> originated, {{this is not the case}} in some other countries.

The fees in some other countries are even higher. In Germany, for instance, usual fees are €4~5.

50|$|Some {{mortgage}} lenders, {{particularly in}} the United Kingdom, give a one-off lump sum payment to new borrowers {{at the beginning of}} a mortgage.
