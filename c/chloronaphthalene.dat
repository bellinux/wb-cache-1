50|$|Polymer Solar Cells {{fabricated}} from <b>chloronaphthalene</b> (CN) as a co-solvent enjoy {{a higher}} efficiency than those fabricated from the more conventional pure chlorobenzene solution. This is because the donor-acceptor morphology changes, which reduces the phase separation between donor polymer and fullerene. As a result, this translates into high hole mobilities. Without co-solvents, large domains of fullerene form, decreasing photovoltaic performance of the cell due to polymer aggregation in solution. This morphology originates from the liquid-liquid phase separation during drying; solve evaporation causes the mixture {{to enter into the}} spinodal region, in which there are significant thermal fluctuations. Large domains prevent electrons from being collected efficiently (decreasing PCE).|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} State Factory of Nitric Compounds was held in Mościce on 18 January 1930 with the participation of Ignacy Mościckiego, the President of Poland, representatives of the PR government with Kazimierz Bartel, the Prime Minister of Poland, and Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, the Minister of Industry and Commerce. In the initial period of its operation, PFZA produced ca. 60 tons of ammonia per day. Nitrogen necessary for synthesis was obtained {{as a result of}} air condensation with Linde method and hydrogen out of water gas. The part of produced ammonia was subject to processing into 50% nitric acid. Ammonia nitrate obtained by neutralising the nitric acid with gaseous ammonia was processed into fertiliser named nitrofos with ca. 15.5%nitrogen content. The global production of the State Factory of Nitric Compounds in Mościce in 1930 was 57 thousand tons of mass, out of which ca. 80% were nitric fertilisers. In addition to the aforementioned products, in 1930 ammonium nitrate was also produced for weapon industry and among chloric products were produced: chlorobenzene, <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> calcium hypochlorite as well as melted sodium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the end of}} {{occupation}} in June 1945 the government passed a law on the reconstruction and development of PFZA in {{the scope of the}} national program of fertiliser production for agriculture. The machines and devices removed from Mościce, with involvement of the crew, were successfully found - e.g. in Brzeg Dolny in Silesia. In 1945 the production of methanol on the small scale was started. In November 1946 the half-technological formalin installation was commissioned for public use and the law on the reconstruction of the chlorination plant was passed. Years 1947-1949 are the period of Three-Year Plan. The recovery of the stolen equipment allowed for commissioning of the installation for iron-chromic catalyst for carbon oxide conversion as soon as in May 1947 and in July - the installation for synthetic ammonia, next, the installation for technological nitric acid production and nitro-chalk (20.5% N). The installation of lime saltpetre was reconstructed in 1948 and launched a year later. In summer 1948 upon 8 months of reconstruction, the chlorine plant was commissioned. Chlorine obtained from salt electrolysis was the base material for production of chlorinated lime, hydrochloric acid, chlorobenzenes and <b>chloronaphthalene</b> waxes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chloronaphthalenes</b> (CNs) and phenanthrenes or/and anthracenes (CP/CAs) were {{detected}} in the emissions of polyvinylchloride (PVC) combustion at 900 degrees C. The presence of metallic iron, copper, or aluminum increased the formation of highly chlorinated CNs (tri- to octachloro-homologues) in the PVC combustion process. Total levels of CNs and CP/CAs were 40 - 48 and 76 - 116 mg/kg PVC, respectively, in the emissions from combustion of PVC with metals. Monochloronaphthalenes, dichloronaphtahlenes, monochlorophenanthrenes, and monochloroanthracenes were the predominant homologues. The other CN homologues were minor combustion byproducts.

40|$|Objectives: Polychlorinated naphthalenes are widespread, {{persistent}} environmental pollutants. Commercial {{products are}} generally mixtures of several congeners and range from thin liquids to hard waxes of high melting point. The higher chlorinated naphthalene products {{are used as}} impregnants for condensers and capacitors and dipping encapsulating compounds in electronics. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the disposition of penta- and tetrachloronaphthalene in rats following a single intraperitoneal administration. Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed on male Outbred Wist rats with body weight of 200 – 250 g. Both compounds labeled with tritium, were given intraperitoneally in a single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Blood and selected tissues distribution of 3 H-radioactivity as well as urine and feces excretion from 0 to 336 h were traced following the administration. Results: After 120 h about 70 % of the given dose was excreted in feces. Feces proved to be the main route of tritium excretion; only about 6 % were excreted in urine within 120 h. In all the examined tissues, the highest 3 H concentrations were found in the fat tissue, liver, kidneys and adrenals. Conclusions: Following calculations of the balance of total tritium excreted and stored, it was found out that both <b>chloronaphthalenes</b> belong to compounds of slow turnover rate in the rat body, and especially in the case of repeated exposure they might accumulate in the body.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the toxic pollutants formed during the thermal decomposition of polychlorinated (PCBs) and mixed halogenated (i. e., simultaneously chlorinated and brominated) biphenyls (PXBs; X = Cl/Br), under gas phase conditions similar to those occurring in fires, and in other combustion processes. (For convenience, in this thesis, the term polychlorinated biphenyls also comprises monochlorinated biphenyls.) In particular, we have investigated the oxidation of 4 -chlorobiphenyl (4 -CB), 4, 4 ’-dichlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-DCB) and 4 -bromo, 4 ’-chlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-BCB), at temperatures lower than those leading to complete conversion of PCBs and PXBs to HBr, HCl, H 2 O and CO 2. The presence of chlorine and bromine in the molecules indicates the propensity for releasing highly toxic chlorinated and mixed halogenated volatiles (VOCs) in combustion processes. In addition, previous studies reported polychlorinated biphenyls, which were widely used as transformer oil in capacitors, to form polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The work covered by this thesis was designed to examine the type and abundance of pollutants formed in incomplete oxidation of PCBs and PXBs and to gain an understanding into the effect of structural differences among the reactants on the reaction mechanisms responsible for the formation of pollutants. In addition, we examined the effect of three materials of construction of the reactors: alumina (99. 5 %), quartz (99. 95 %) and quartz with boron-oxide coating on the reactor walls. Initially, we studied the same reactant (4 -CB) in the three reactors, to understand the effect of impurities (trace amount of transition metals) and surface generated singlet oxygen on the reaction mechanisms responsible for the pollutant formation. We established a laboratory-scale apparatus that consisted of a laminar flow reactor equipped with a sampling system for intercepting the volatile and condensable products. A XAD- 2 cartridge served to trap the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PCDD/Fs. The analysis of VOCs involved high resolution gas chromatography – quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS) while HRGC – ion trap MS (GC-ITMS) quantitated the PCDD/Fs produced. The development of reaction mechanisms involved the application of Gaussian 09 suite of programs. We optimised structures and calculated the zero point vibrational energies (ZPVE) at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d), B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) and M 062 X/ 6 - 311 +G(d,p) levels of theory. Stationary points located were either minima or transition states (TSs) determined by vibrational frequency analysis wherein a transition structure contained just one imaginary frequency along the specified reaction coordinates. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis afforded linking the reactants and products with their TSs. The thermal decomposition of 4 -CB in the alumina reactor produces a number of volatile pollutants, including chlorophenols and chlorobenzenes, which are important precursors for the formation of PCDD/Fs. Other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected included (chloro) benzaldehydes, (chloro) naphthalenes, one isomer of ethylbenzaldehyde, 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene and dibenzofuran. The results of the thermal decomposition of 4 -CB also indicate the formation of mono to octa-CDD/Fs at high temperatures, with 3 -monochlorodibenzofuran (3 -MCDF) being the most abundant CDD/Fs formed. Gas products were identified and quantitated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with hydrogen chloride quantitated by ion chromatography (IC). The results from IC analysis afforded accurate quantitation of the formation of HCl in pyrolysis experiments. The oxidation of 4 -CB in quartz reactor and quartz tube with boron-oxide coating on the reactor surfaces revealed the formation of similar VOCs and gas products, but in a different temperature window. The first product observed in the alumina reactor, benzaldehyde, initially appeared at around 300 °C, and at 450 °C and 500 °C in quartz and boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor, respectively. The onset temperatures of other VOCs products, such as PCBzs and PCPs formed in three reactors, rank as follow: boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor > quartz reactor > alumina reactor. In addition, we observed the formation of all homologue groups of PCDD/Fs but only in the alumina reactor. In quartz and boron-oxide-coated reactors, we only observed mono and diCDD/Fs. In all three reactors, 3 -MCDF constituted the most abundant congener. The current measurements report the distinct mechanisms operating on reactor surfaces and in gas phase; the former appearing {{as a consequence of the}} transition metal impurities in the reactor walls and surface-generated singlet oxygen, which were neglected in previous studies. Our findings are of great practical significance as all studies on the thermal decomposition of PCB performed in the 20 th century involved glass ampoule reactors. This means that, the results of the previous investigation, especially the product speciation, must be treated with caution, due to confounding effects of the homogenous and heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. On the basis of the results of the thermal decomposition of 4 -CB, we investigated the decomposition of 4, 4 ’-DCB in the boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor, in order to study the pollutants formed and to elucidate their reaction mechanisms. Benzene, chlorobenzene, phenol and 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) were found as the PCDD/F precursors, with chlorobenzene as the dominant species. We identified 2 -chloronaphthalene as the main VOC product with smaller amount of naphthalene, and even smaller abundance of 1 -chloronaphthalene. This indicates that, 2 -chloronaphthalene forms directly from 4, 4 ’-DCB, with possible 1, 2 -Cl shift in 2 -chloronaphthalene producing 1 -chloronaphthalene. Similar mechanism operates for the appearance of 4 -chlorobenzaldehyde (forming benzaldehyde, and then 3 -chlorobenzaldehyde), 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene (dechlorinating to 1 -ethynylbenzene) and 1 -chloro- 4 -(1 -propynyl) -benzene (producing 1 -chloro- 6 -(1 -propynyl) -benzene, via dechlorination of 1 -propynylbenzene, H abstraction and then chlorination at a different carbon atom). We found a small amount of 1 -propynylbenzene in the experiments conducted at 625 and 650 ºC, and with this species acting as a source for other isomers of chloropropynylbenzenes. We also detected benzofuran from 625 – 700 °C. The formation of PCDD/Fs included only MCDF, MCDD, DCDF and a minute amount of DCDD. Note that, 3 -MCDF was observed first at 550 °C above a background level of 0. 2 ng/(g 4, 4 ’-DCB). This temperature is about 250 °C higher than that of the first observation of PCDD/Fs in the alumina reactor. We also studied the thermal decomposition of PXB with 4 -bromo- 4 ’-chlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-BCB) as a probe molecule to gain insights into the effect of combined sources of chlorine and bromine on formation of mixed halogenated pollutants. The oxidation of 4, 4 ’-BCB in the B 2 O 3 -coated reactor revealed the formation of species similar to those appearing in fires of brominated flame retardants (BFR) and municipal waste combustion; i. e., in systems characterising both bromine and chlorine sources. The gas products detected included HCl, CO, CO 2, C 2 H 2 and HBr. To improve elemental balances of chlorine and bromine, we employed ion chromatography (IC) for quantitation of HCl and HBr. With increasing temperature, the concentration of HCl and HBr increased dramatically, in similar concentrations. We detected benzene, monobromobenzene, monochlorobenzene, one congener of mixed halogenated benzenes, one congener of mixed halogenated phenols, bromonaphthalenes, <b>chloronaphthalenes,</b> 6 -bromobenzofuran, chlorobenzofurans, dibenzofuran, mixed halogenated ethynylbenzenes and chlorobenzaldehydes. Similar chlorinated species also formed in the oxidation of 4 -CB and 4, 4 ’-DCB. In addition, we observed the formation of one congener of PXDD/Fs by deploying a GC-QTOFMS (high resolution gas chromatography – quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to elucidate the reaction products. The accurate calculations of molecular mass and isotopic distribution revealed the formation of monobromochlorodibenzofuran. We also observed significant amount of 3 -MCDF and one congener of DCDF (3, 7 -DCDF formed from the impurity 4, 4 ’-DCB) in our experiments. We did not detect any PBDD/Fs. The quantum chemical calculations yielded the reaction pathways and provided reaction mechanisms for the pollutants observed in the experiments. These mechanisms comprise direct formation of VOCs and dioxins from 4, 4 ’-BCB by its partial oxidation (for example, by adding an oxygen bridge between the two aryl rings to form dioxins) and synthesis of two- and three-ring species from primary decomposition fragments, such as chlorophenoxys and chlorobenzenes...|$|R

Prior to method development a target subset of pesticides was chosen to reflect the typical range of chemicals commonly used in previous treatments.

Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4, 4 ′-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, <b>chloronaphthalene</b> and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos.|$|E
30|$|After the {{laboratory}} validation experiments, Tenax sampling tubes {{were used in}} the field to assess the quality of air surrounding a range of objects that had previously been treated with pesticides. The first sampling site was an avian taxidermy exhibition at Swiss Cottage, Osborne House, Isle of Wight.

Tenax sampling tubes were deployed inside the case for 98 d, giving an approximate sample volume of 70  dm 3. Using the flow chart (Figure  1) it was shown that the collected air would need to be analysed by GC-FID or TD-GC-MS; here TD-GC-MS was chosen. The resultant chromatograms displayed confirmatory peaks for naphthalene and camphor together with an additional, unexpected pesticide, <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> at vapour phase concentrations of 2.7, 2.6 or 2.8  μg m- 3, respectively. The measured concentrations were significantly lower than the European Union Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) of 50  mg m- 3 for naphthalene, and 13  mg m- 3 for camphor (no WEL exists for <b>chloronaphthalene).</b> While this site was sampled for 98 d, the measured concentrations were 15 times higher than the proposed procedural detection limits and the sampling time could have been reduced to 6 d.|$|E

We simulate P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) oligomers in different environments, namely, in vacuo, in the bulk phase, and in liquid toluene and <b>chloronaphthalene</b> solution. The choice of these solvents is motivated {{by the fact that}} they induce different kinds of molecular preaggregates during the casting procedures, resulting in variable device performances. Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental data; the polymer bulk structure, in which the chains are quite planar, is correcly reproduced, yet the isolated chains are flexible enough to fold in vacuo. We also calculate the solubility of P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) in toluene and <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> predicting a much better solubility of the polymer in the latter, also in accordance to experimental observations. Different morphologies and dynamics of the oligomers in the two solvents have been observed.

40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel non-invasive sampling and analysis method {{that can be used to}} assess the presence of volatile pesticides on objects held in heritage collections. Vapour phase sampling was conducted using sampling tubes loaded with Tenax-TA™ and trapped analytes were determined using thermal desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The results of this study are presented in a simple ‘decision tree’ diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Results: Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4, 4 ′-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} air sampling as an inferential analysis method to identify the presence of selected pesticides on museum objects. Air sampling around treated objects will permit the determination of camphor, naphthalene, thymol, <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> dichlorvos, aldrin, HCH, dieldrin or endrin, whilst swabbing is required to detect 4, 4 ′-DDT. A ‘decision tree’ is presented to aid collection custodians {{and to provide a}} choice of sampling methods dependent upon suspected treatments. On-site case studies have confirmed that deployment of Tenax air sampling tubes for pesticide detection was minimally invasive, non-contact, and did not require the presence of trained personnel to be present during collection of the vapour phase sample. Despite not commonly being used in passive mode, the results obtained here confirmed that passive sampling using Tenax sampling tubes is suitable. Significantly, the data presented here supports the use of air sampling to determine the presence of pesticides on objects which have been treated in the past and provides the first case study evidence of the developed methods.|$|E

Substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated compounds have severely detrimental effects on health for both humans and animals. These toxic organic substances are mainly introduced into soils and groundwater by pesticide use and industrials by products. There is a dire need to develop soil remediation techniques that are efficient, cost effect and relatively uncomplicated. The need is especially great for developing countries that have an obsolete pesticide stockpiles problem. Mechanochemical remediation is an ideal candidate to fill that need. Mechanochemical activation by ball milling was originally developed for mineral processing. It {{has proved to be}} an extremely versatile technique and was found to be able to degrade toxic organic compounds. In this study reactive ball milling was used to investigate the destruction rates of naphthalene, <b>chloronaphthalene</b> and diesel in different kinds of soil. Naphthalene, <b>chloronaphthalene</b> and diesel were used as organic pollutant analogues. A GC-MS was used to analyse and quantify the destruction rates. It has been suggested that Total Organic Content (TOC) analysers {{can also be used to}} analyse the destruction rates, but a TOC analyser was not available. Quartz had the highest overall destruction rate followed by scoria, limestone, subsoil, greywacke, china clay and terracotta clay. In past studies, it was found that water would hinder destruction efficiencies but no reason as to why or how water did this. This study also looked at why water was reducing destructive capacities of the soils. Water was reacting with the radicals generated by the milling therefore decreasing the total radical available that would react with the target pollutants. The study also looked the effects of organic matter has on the destruction rates of naphthalene. Cellulose powder was added to the sample soils and it was determined that it also decreased the destructive capacities of the soil. The cellulose was sequestering the naphthalene initially, but with continued milling the cellulose and naphthalene were degraded. The effects of ball milling on soil health were also studied. Soil structure and aggregation were altered, but tillage of the milled soil and mixing it with unmilled soil would create healthy aggregation and the sample soils tested were all able to sustain plant life. The study also looked how soil bacteria would react to ball milling. It was determined that the bacteria did not survive the milling process, but milled soils were successfully inoculated by bacteria...|$|E

This is demonstrated by the synthesis of the alternating copolymer (P 1) consisting of 3, 3 ?-difluoro- 2, 2 ?-bithiophene and pyridopyridinedithiophene and the random terpolymer (P 2) containing pyridopyridinedithiophene 3, 3 ?-difluoro- 2, 2 ?-bithiophene and thiophene. OPV devices fabricated by P 1 and P 2 in combination with PC 61 BM and PC 71 BM in an inverted device configuration exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1. 5 % and 4. 0 %, respectively. We identified that the main reason for the enhanced performance of the OPV devices based on the P 2 random copolymer was the improved morphology (miscibility) between P 2 and PCBM as compared to P 1. More specifically, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that the P 1 based films showed rougher surface with clear crystallization/precipitation of the polymer chains even after the addition of <b>chloronaphthalene</b> (CN) to the chloroform processing solvent which significantly limited the short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and overall performance of the prepared photovoltaic devices.

These compounds are highly stable to oxidation, reduction and thermal degradation. Current remediation technologies are expensive and can cause the formation of even more toxic byproducts. It is clear that an environmentally friendly and inexpensive remediation technology is required. Our goal was the synthesis of dehalogenation catalysts incorporating aromatic side arms for the pre-concentration of the substrates to the catalysts. We envisioned that aromatic side arms would allow the aggregation of catalyst and substrate to form a pre-complex that would enhance rates of dehalogenation. Rapid and stereochemically predictable synthesis of N and C functionalized nickel cyclam complexes were a priority for this project. Synthesis of N-functionalized cyclam molecules and subsequent metal incorporation proceeds smoothly to form trans(III) nickel cyclam complexes. However longer reaction times, initiation periods and short catalyst lifetimes made these complexes unsuitable for long-term study. Cyclization of dipeptides and tetrapeptides using a metal template in basic conditions {{led to the formation}} of cyclopeptide nickel complexes with stereochemistry retained from the peptide precursors. Free cyclopeptides could be isolated from the nickel complexes by treatment with HCl. Cyclopeptides are reduced to the cyclam molecules via a LAH reduction in low to moderate yields. Nickel incorporation into the cyclam molecules produced C-functionalized nickel catalysts with stereochemical integrity maintained throughout the synthesis. Intermolecular CH-π interactions can be seen in the solid state for the nickel cyclam complexes with aromatic side arms. Reduction data show that the C-functionalized catalysts do not show improved rates of reduction for several aromatic substrates but small rate enhancements are observed for the reduction of <b>chloronaphthalene</b> over the unfunctionalized catalyst...|$|E

Substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organic compounds in contaminated soil and groundwater can have severe and long-lasting effects on health in animals and humans. There is an urgent need {{for the development of}} safe technologies for their effective removal. Originally developed for mineral processing, mechanical treatment by ball milling is an extremely versatile technique for the degradation of toxic compounds. Reactive milling can rapidly destroy organic compounds without producing hazardous wastes. Complete breakdown of the organic molecules is achieved after relatively short milling times. Successful tests were conducted on polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), DDT, DDD, DDE, Dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene with a conversion yield in the of greater than 99 % (Hall et al., 1996; Monagheddu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Tanaka and Zhang, 2003; Pizzigallo et al., 2004; Nomura et al., 2005; Bellingham, 2006). In this study reactive ball milling was used to investigate the destruction of two classes of persistent {{organic pollutants}} environmental contaminants. The compounds studied are either known environmental pollutants or simple analogues. These were chosen as being representative of pollutants to investigate the pathway using ball milling destruction and in most cases were relatively small molecules so that the intermediates could be more easily identified. The first class of compounds was polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some smaller members of this class such as naphthalene, anthracene were investigated. The second class of compounds were some analogues of environmentally hazardous hydroxylated and halogenated compounds such as <b>chloronaphthalene,</b> bromonaphthalene, 1 - naphthol, 2 -naphthol and pentachlorophenol under reactive milling using GCMS analysis of the degradation pathway. Destruction efficiencies greater than 99 % have been achieved for a number of organic compounds. Several different intermediates have been identified during the milling degradation. There was also some evidence from this study that halogens could be transferred between compounds during milling. The final products of the milling destruction of these compounds are an amorphous carbon residue and inorganic chloride or bromides. It was proposed that large amounts of halogens could be found however the results showed that small amounts detected. At early stages of milling a number of intermediate breakdown products were detected which were destroyed on extended milling. The core objective of this research was to clarify the reaction mechanisms pathways used of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic organ halogen compounds.

40|$|Polyolefins are {{the most}} {{important}} commodity polymers today. Their end use properties polymers depend primarily on their molecular weight (MWD) and chemical composition (CCD) distributions. Several characterization techniques are used to analyze the microstructures of the polyolefins. High-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is the most widely used technique for MWD determination. Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) and crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) are routinely used for CCD measurement. There have been significant improvements {{over the last few years}} on CCD characterization techniques for polyolefins with the introduction of crystallization elution fractionation (CEF) and high-temperature thermal gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC). The main objective of this thesis was to conduct systematic studies on HT-TGIC and CEF to provide a better understanding on the separation mechanism of these new techniques and to find out operational conditions that enhance the resolution of the measured CCDs. The effects of cooling rate, adsorption/desorption temperature range, heating rate and sample size on HT-TGIC fractionation were investigated using polyethylene and ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymers made with metallocene catalyst. It was found out that HT-TGIC was relatively insensitive to the cooling rate within the range investigated in this study. However, the obtained profiles depended strongly on the heating rate applied during the desorption cycle. Chromatograms measured under faster heating rates were broader and had lower resolutions, supposedly due to co-desorption effects. Analysis of polyolefin blends by HT-TGIC showed that sample volume was a very important parameter affecting peak separation of the blend components; reducing the volume of the injected sample can be used to minimize the degree of co-adsorption and co-desorption effects. The effect of solvent type on HT-TGIC analysis was investigated using o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB), and <b>chloronaphthalene</b> (CN). Polyolefin blends were analyzed using these solvents and the best resolution was obtained iv when ODCB was used as the mobile phase. The profiles obtained using TCB and CN were similar and both were strongly affected by the co-adsorption and co-desorption phenomena. HT-TGIC profiles of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymers were also compared with the equivalent CEF profiles. Interestingly, it was found out that the differences between the profiles measured by these techniques decreased as the comonomer content increased, with CEF systematically measuring sharper profiles for samples with low 1 -olefin comonomer content. A new method was also developed to quantify the degree of co-crystallization of polyolefin blends analyzed by CEF and was used to quantify operating conditions that influenced co-crystallization. The results showed that co-crystallization can be minimized using slower cooling rates, but heating rates play a less important role. A detailed study on the effect of CEF operating conditions on CCD resolution was also conducted using industrial LLDPE resins that have broad MWDs and CCDs. Cooling rate and solvent flow rate during the cooling cycle significantly affect the degree of co-crystallization of CEF profiles. However, varying the heating rate does not have a marked impact on these separations. The CEF profiles of these resins were compared with the equivalent HT-TGIC profiles, showing that CEF provided better peak separation than HT-TGIC. Finally, a new mathematical model was developed to simultaneously deconvolute the MWD and CCD of polyolefins made with multiple site-type catalysts such as Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The model was applied to several industrial linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins to estimate the minimum number of active site types, the number average molecular weight, the average comonomer mole fraction, and the mass fraction of soluble and non-soluble polymer made on each site type...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{formation}} of toxic pollutants formed during the thermal decomposition of chlorinated thiophenol and its related compounds (thiophenes and thioxane) {{have been investigated}} using combined combustion experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Computational calculations elucidated the kinetic and mechanistic aspects for the {{formation of}} two main pollutants, polychlorinated dibenzothiophene and polychlorinated thianthrene. In order to gain better understanding of thermal decomposition of chlorinated thiophenols, thermochemical parameters of a complete series of congeners of chlorothiophenols were derived. Standard enthalpies of formation of chlorothiophenols and thiophenoxy radicals were calculated using isodesmic work reactions. Thermodynamic scales of enthalpy and Gibbs energy enabled the highlighting of most stable isomers in each homologue group. Standard entropies and heat capacities were calculated with the treatment of the internal rotation of the S-H group as a hindered rotor. Values of solvation energies designate that the interaction of chlorinated congeners of thiophenols with water molecules decreases with the degree of chlorination; however, no apparent dependency can be deduced with regard to the pattern of chlorination. A thermodynamic cycle was constructed to estimate pKa values based on gas phase deprotonation free energies and calculated solvation energies for chlorothiophenol molecules and chlorinated thiophenolate anions. Calculated pKa values are in good agreement with the limited available experimental measurements. Density functional theory calculations were performed on 2 -chlorothiophenol and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorothiophenol to investigate the reaction pathways {{for the formation of}} polychlorinated dibenzothiophene and polychlorinated thianthrene and report relevant thermochemical and kinetic parameters. The results were compared with the analogous oxygenated system and it has been found that the presence of oxygen lowers the enthalpic profile of the systems, resulting in polychlorinated dibenzothiophene and polychlorinated thianthrene formation more favourable compared to their oxygenated counterparts (Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofuran respectively). This is rationalized in terms of different influences of S-H and O-H moieties in chlorothiophenol and chlorinated phenol precursors. Furthermore, polychlorinated dibenzothiophene formation is found to be more likely than polychlorinated thianthrene formation based on thermochemical and kinetic parameters. In addition, degree and pattern of chlorination on chlorothiophenol precursor have subtle effects on polychlorinated dibenzothiophene and polychlorinated thianthrene formation mechanism. Experimental studies were also conducted under gas phase conditions over a temperature range of 300 - 800 °C. The thermal oxidation of 4 -chlorothiophenol offered twelve toxic volatile organic compounds and seven congeners of polychlorinated dibenzothiophene and its oxygenated analogue polychlorinated dibenzofuran between 500 - 700 °C. Based on the results, the pathways for the formation of two important sulfur containing volatile organic compounds, chlorobenzothiophene and <b>chloronaphthalene</b> thiol were explained using quantum chemical calculations. It has also been concluded that chlorocyclopentadiene radical acts as key precursor for the formation of several dominant volatile organic compounds. For more comprehensive insights into the oxidative and pyrolytic thermal decomposition of cyclic organosulfur compounds, high level computational chemistry methods were used to deduce pathways for tetrahydrothiophene, 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene, 2, 5 -dimethyltetrahydrothiophene and 1, 4 -thioxane. Thiophene family has been found to decompose preferentially via C-S bond cleavage compared to C-C β bond scission on account of lower barrier heights. However, direct oxidation of thiophenes by ground state oxygen is exhibited to be only important in case of high temperature combustion processes. Similarly, 1, 4 -thioxane decomposition is favoured by β-CH₂-O scission...|$|E

In Chapter 3, we present {{the study of the}} self-assembly of oligo(p-phenyteneethynylene) -based coil-rod-coil and rod-coil-rod triblock copolymers in the solvent mixture of toluene and hexane by using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results reveal that the aggregation in the solvent mixture is strongly influenced by the triblock copolymer structure. For the coil-rod-coil (PS-OPE-PS) triblock copolymer, small well-defined aggregates are formed in the solvent mixture with different toluene/hexane ratios. The coiled PS blocks entangle with the OPE block to restrict possible pi-pi stacking and make the OPE chain backbone more planar. The red-shift in the UV-vis and fluorescence spectra indicates the formation of 3 -type aggregates. The rod-coil-rod (OPE-PS-OPE) triblock copolymer chains form large "disk-like" micelles with an ordered OPE core and a collapsed PS shell. The blue-shift in the UV-vis and fluorescence spectra shows the formation of H-type aggregates; namely, the OPE block in the core are parallel to each other so that there is stronger interchain pi-pi interaction. In Chapter 4, we present the study of the aggregation of C 60 -PEO-C 60 chains in the chloronaphthalene/benzene solvent mixture with different ratios by using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. <b>Chloronaphthalene</b> is a good solvent for C 60 but a poor solvent for the PEO chain. On the other hand, benzene is a good solvent for the PEO chain but a poor solvent for Co. Individual polymer chains or small micelles coexist with large aggregates in solvent mixture. Our results show that the structures of the aggregates strongly depend on the composition of the solvent mixtures, which reflects in different ratios of /, where and are z-average root-mean-square radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius, respectively. In Chapter 5, we present a study of reversible formation and decomposition of star polymer clusters. First, we synthesized 4 -aim bromide-end star polystyrene chains by using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and then modified the end group from bromide to thiol since it can be slowly oxidized in air to induce the clustering among 4 -arm star polystyrene chains. The clustering is reversible under a reduction condition. Such formation and fragmentation (decomposition) of the polymer clusters in toluene was followed by LLS. To induce the reduction, DTT was added. Our results reveal that in the clustering, the fast mode is attributed to the cooperative diffusion of individual 4 -arm star polystyrene chains (unimers), while the slow mode is related to the diffusion of large clusters. In the fragmentation, the slow mode becomes fast and its intensity contribution decreases as the reduction time increases, reflecting the decreases of the size and the number of large polymer clusters. Our results suggest that the clusters fragmentation induced by thiol-functionalized 4 -PS chains in toluene dilute solution follows the universal RLCA regime, but in a reversed fashion. In this thesis, we did the following studies: (1) The association of two rod-coil triblock copolymers: polystyrene-oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) -polystyrene (PS-OPE-PS) and oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) -polystyrene-oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) (OPE-PS-OPE) in a toluene/hexane mixture as well as of C 60 -Poly(ethylene oxide) -C 60 in a chloronaphthalene/benzene mixture.

Calcium is an important second messenger in signaling pathways that respond to environmental stresses, pathogen attack as well as hormonal stimuli (For review, see DeFalco et al., 2010; Reddy and Reddy, 2004; Sanders et al., 2002). The transient increase of cytosolic free calcium concentration {{has been shown in}} a variety of external signals (Reddy, 2001), which in turn triggers many signal transduction pathways leading to a variety of cellular responses (Bush, 1995). Any calcium mediated signal transduction process involves generation of signal-specific calcium signature in the cytosol (Scrase-Field and Knight, 2003). These changes in cytosolic calcium level or ‘calcium signatures’ are sensed by the specific group of proteins called the ‘calcium sensors’. Different calcium sensors recognize specific calcium signatures and transduce them into downstream effects, including altered protein phosphorylation and gene expression patterns. In plants the protein kinases are a large and differentiated group of calcium sensors. After analyzing 1264 protein kinase sequences, a superfamily of protein kinase called CDPK/SnRK family of protein kinase were defined (Hrabak et al., 2003). CDPK/SnRK family of protein kinases encompasses five subfamilies viz., calcium-dependant protein kinases, (CPKs), calcium/calmodulin dependant protein kinases (CCaMKs), calmodulin-dependant protein kinases (CaMKs), CPKrelated kinases (CRKs), and SnF 1 related kinase 3 (SnRK 3) and are regulated by calcium directly or indirectly. Among these, in plants, calcium-dependant protein kinases (CPKs) are predominant calcium sensors, which are shown to be involved in myriads of physiological responses. They are Ser/Thr family of protein kinases typically made up of five domains with an Nterminal variable domain followed by catalytic protein kinase domain, an autoinhibitory/ junction domain, a regulatory calmodulin-like domain (CaMLD) and a Cterminal domain of variable length. The CPKs are unique due to the presence of CaMLD which couples the calcium sensor directly to its responder (kinase domain). Although CPKs are highly conserved, there are several features that distinguish different members of the plant CDPK family. In an attempt to investigate the role of a CPK isoform, in the present work we bring out the results and inferences on isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA encoding a calcium-dependant protein kinase isoform ScCPK 1 from Swainsonacanescens, a pharmaceutically important Australian herb known to produce an anticancer drug, swainsonine. Initially, we have cloned an 800 bp partial CPK cDNA from S. canescens by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed based on conserved regions of the other known CPKs. A 2. 1 kb full length CPK was obtained using 5 ` and 3 ` RACE which was designated as ScCPK 1. An open reading frame (ORF) of 1659 bp was detected that encodes a protein of 552 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 61. 8 kDa. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of ScCPK 1 with sequences of other CPKs revealed the highest identity (> 90 %) to Glycine max and Vigna radiate CPKs. As described for other CPKs, ScCPK 1 has a long variable domain (88 aa), an auto-inhibitory domain (31 aa) and a C-terminal calmodulin domain (145 aa) containing four EF-hand calcium binding motifs, which is found in many CPKs. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that ScCPK 1 was closely related to StCPK 4, CmCPK 1 and CmCPK 2. The entire coding region of ScCPK 1 was cloned into pRSETA expression vector and expressed as fusion protein in E. coli. The recombinant ScCPK 1 protein was purified to homogeneity by NiNTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant purified ScCPK 1 was catalytically active in a calcium-dependent manner. The recombinant ScCPK 1 phosphorylated itself and histone IIIS as substrate only in the presence of Ca 2 +. Phosphoaminoacid analyses showed that ScCPK 1 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of histone IIIS and its autophosphorylation also occurs on serine and threonine residues. ScCPK 1 has a pH and temperature optima of 7. 5 and 37 °C, respectively. It showed high affinity to histone III-S with a Km of 4. 8 µM and had a Vmax of 4. 700 pmoles of γ 32 P incorporation/min/mg at saturating substrate concentrations. The ScCPK 1 is ~ 100 fold active and showed 10 fold higher affinities to histone III-S than CaCPK 1 and CaCPK 2, CPKs which were characterized from Cicer arietinum previously in our laboratory (Prakash and Jayabaskaran, 2006). From literature it is known that many CPKs are activated or inhibited by metal ions. (PutnamEvans etal., 1990; Anil and Rao, 2001). The influence of Na+ and Mg 2 +on the in vitro substrate phosphorylation activity of the recombinant ScCPK 1 was tested in this work. Addition of NaCl strongly inhibited ScCPK 1 activity. The inhibition of substrate phosphorylation activity by salt implies ionic interactions between the positively charged substrate and the enzyme’s active site. The optimum concentration of Mg 2 + for ScCPK 1 substrate phosphorylation activity was found to be 810 mM, similar to CaCPK 1 and CaCPK 2 (Prakash and Jayabaskaran, 2006). However, the activity was inhibited above 10 mM Mg 2 +suggesting the disruption of ionic interactions between the enzyme and the substrate. The kinase and autophosphorylation activities of the recombinant ScCPK 1 were calmodulin independent and sensitive to CaM antagonists’ calmidazolium and W 7 (N(6 aminohexyl) 5 <b>chloronaphthalene</b> sulphonate). This indicates that the activation was supported by calmodulin-like domain, which is typical of CPK family. Farmer and Choi (1999), showed that DcCPK 1 activity was inhibited by polyamines vizspermine and spermidine, and polylysine. We found that substrate phosphorylation activity of ScCPK 1 was inhibited by polyLLysine with an IC 50 of 8 M but not the polyamines, spermine and spermidine. An interesting aspect that makes CPKs attractive for research is their functional similarity to mammalian PKCs. There are no structural PKC analogues found in plant genomic data. Similar to PKCs, CPKs are regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + signals. There is also experimental evidence that some of the CPKs are additionally activated by phospholipids (Farmer and Choi, 1999; Szczegielniak etal., 2000). We investigated the effects of lipid molecules on the activity of ScCPK 1. Phosphorylation of histone IIIS by ScCPK 1 was stimulated by phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol in the presence of Ca 2 +, where as lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid did not increase the enzyme activity. Our data that shows interaction of ScCPK 1 with phospholipids supports the idea that this protein kinase could be associated with the membrane. The work from Farmer and Choi (1999), with DcCPK 1 suggested that some of the PKClike activities observed in plants may be attributed to CPKs. They also demonstrated that DcCPK 1 phosphorylated PKC pseudosubstrate peptide and also was sensitive to staurosporine inhibition. However, the protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine inhibited the substrate phosphorylation activity of ScCPK 1 completely with an IC 50 value of 700 nM invitro. But PKC inhibitor PMA was less effective, inhibiting the substrate phosphorylation activity of ScCPK 1 to a maximum of 50 %, but at a very high concentration (200 nM). Our data suggests that ScCPK 1 may not have any features attributable to PKC. We investigated subcellular localization of the ScCPK 1. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the subcellular localization of the ScCPK 1, we generated GFP fusion protein of ScCPK 1 and transiently expressed it in Agrobacterium-mediated transformed tobacco BY 2 cells. Analysis of the GFP expression patterns in transformed tobacco BY 2 cells revealed ScCPK 1 localization in the plasma membrane of the transformed tobacco BY 2 cells despite lacking consensus myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs (as per in silico analyses). Taking together, our data have demonstrated that ScCPK 1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and its sub-cellular localization studies revealed that it is localized to plasma membrane. We propose that ScCPK 1 is a key component of one or more signaling pathways and plays vital roles in plant development, responses to environmental stimuli and/ or in secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene expression. The involvement of the ScCPK 1 as a component of signaling pathways warrants further studies...|$|E
