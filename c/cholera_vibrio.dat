50|$|The second cholera {{pandemic}} (1829-1849), {{also known}} as the Asiatic Cholera Pandemic, was a cholera pandemic that reached from India across western Asia to Europe, Great Britain and the Americas, as well as east to China and Japan. Cholera caused more deaths, more quickly, than any other epidemic disease in the 19th century. It is exclusively a human disease, and it can spread through many means of travel, such as by persons via caravan, ship, and aeroplanes. Cholera is known most popularly to spread through warm fecal-contaminated river waters and contaminated foods. The causative microorganisms (<b>Cholera</b> <b>vibrio)</b> flourish by reaching humans. It is treatable with oral re-hydration therapy and preventable with adequate sanitation and water treatment.|$|E
50|$|Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov already {{announced}} the “principle of immunization” during his voluntary exile in Italy, {{where he went}} to undertake some studies, the results {{of which he had}} promptly communicated to Pasteur. The phagocytosis theory is based on the notion that phagocytes are cells that have the power to englobe foreign bodies - and above all bacteria - introduced inside an organism. German biologists opposed to his doctrine the humoral theory: they claimed to have found in Roux's serum some substances able to reveal the presence of microbes, and to ensure their destruction if properly stimulated. The German scientist Eduard Buchner referred to these substances as “alexine” and two other biologists, Von Behring and Kitasato, demonstrated their lytic power towards bacteria. In 1894 one of these scientist published the result of an experiment that appeared to completely refute Metchnikoff’s ideas: using the <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrio,</b> discovered ten years before by Robert Koch, as an antigen, Richard F. J. Pfeiffer introduced it in the abdomen of a guinea pig already vaccinated against this disease, and was able to observe the destruction of the vibrio in the local blood plasma, without the participation of the phagocytes. Not even this study was able to shake Metchnikoff’s belief and faith in his theory, and his ideas, as well as Pfeiffer’s and Buchner’s, would all contribute to the elaboration of the current theory of the immune system.|$|E

40|$|In 1924 Sanarelli (1) {{reported}} that rabbits infected with <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> react to B. coli or B. proteus {{in a way}} entirely {{different from that of}} normal rabbits. In a study on the virulence of <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> Sanarelli observed that in every large group of rabbits a few would die from the injection of minute doses, much smaller than the dose lethal for most rabbits. The symptoms resembled anaphylactic shock. In order to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon, SanareUi studied the fate of <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> injected into the circulation. He found that the <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> disappeared from the blood stream within 2 days after their injection. But he also observed that in the rabbits which succumbed following the injection of sublethal doses, B. coll or proteus bacilli would invade the blood stream. Sanarelli now injected rabbits intravenously with minute doses of <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> and on the following day gave an intravenous injection of either <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> or of colon or proteus bacilli.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of cholera with bacteriophage has, in the past, been unsuccessful, {{owing to the}} fact that the phages prepared by the usual method (multiplication on <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> in broth) proved incapable of parasitizing <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> in vivo. In this paper, the author presents the results of therapeutic and prophylactic trials of a phage preparation prepared by a different method—namely, cultivation on <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrios</b> through alternate passages in the small intestine of guinea-pigs and in bile. This preparation was used effectively for the {{treatment of}} cholera patients and for the control of epidemic outbreaks in Afghanistan in 1958 and 1960. A single dose of the phage, administered with saline intravenously or intramuscularly, followed by an oral dose daily for three days, gave satisfactory results in the majority of cases, even if the patients were seriously ill and did not receive additional symptomatic treatment. As to the prophylactic value of the phage, when the preparation was administered simultaneously with a single dose of cholera vaccine to the entire population of an epidemic focus, no further cases of the disease occurred in that focus...|$|R
40|$|Blass and Macheboeuf {{reported}} that they had isolated α-aminoadipic acid from <b>cholera</b> <b>Vibrio</b> (1). On repeating the experiment later, they tested the purity of the isolated product by means of paper chromatograms developed with phenol and retracted their earlier claim (2). However, Borsook et al. found that α-aminoadipic acid and glutamic acid gave the same spot on two-dimensional paper chromatograms developed with phenol and δ-collidine (3). The retraction of Blass and Macheboeuf was therefore based on a method which does not differentiate between the two dicarboxylic amino acids. By using the starch chromatographic method of Stein and Moore (4), Borsook et al. were able to separate α-aminoadipic acid from other amino acids, including glutamic acid (3).

In these respects it resembles the thermostable direct hemolysin/cytotoxin/cardiotoxin/lethal toxin of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and certain other bacterial hemolysins, although there are other significant differences. Because identical diseases are produced by both hemolytic and nonhemolytic cholera vibrios, the El Tor hemolysin may be presumed to be pathogenetically irrelevant.

The course of the epidemic fell into three periods: in period I (1961 to 1969), 24 countries (predominantly in Asia) reported about 419, 968 cholera cases; in period II (1970 to 1977), 73 countries from Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas reported 706, 261 cases; and in period III (1978 to 1989), 83 countries reported 586, 828 cases. The global epidemic was at its most severe in 1967 - 74. Subsequently morbidity declined and up to 1989 had remained high and stable, with 44, 000 - 52, 000 cases per annum. In the USSR 10, 723 cholera cases and carriers were reported between 1965 and 1989 from 11 republics (but not Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, or Armenia). In 1965 and 1970 - 74 large-scale outbreaks of imported cholera were characteristic of the epidemic in the USSR. Thereafter morbidity declined, and sporadic cases were reported along with environmental, predominantly nontoxigenic strains of <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrio.</b> Most of the outbreaks in the 1970 s were waterborne, and virulent strains containing the vct-gene were isolated from samples of water.

40|$|Cholera-like non-agglutinating vibrios are {{invariably}} {{found in}} the intestinal contents of healthy persons, and frequently in the water of wells and rivers, during epidemics of cholera. Although many of these saprophytic vibrios are indistinguishable in morphology and cultural properties from the <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrio,</b> the negative reaction with an anticholera serum has readily differentiated them from the Asiatic vibrio. The biological polymorphism of the <b>cholera</b> <b>vibrio</b> has been suggested {{by the development of}} agglutination, by special methods of culture, in cholera-like vibrios. Confirmatory Pfeiffer reactions have not been obtained, as a rule, in these instances, probably because of the low virulence of the vibrio culture, although positive bacteriolysis in vitro (Bordet's test) was observed in some, and in others positive complement fixation and cross agglutination indicated the cholera nature of the vibrios in question. Although it cannot as yet be definitely proven, we are justified in suspecting that cholera-like vibrios which eventually develop agglutination properties are of a true cholera nature. It is probable that the production of agglutination antibodies in the serum brings about the development by the bacterial cell of defensive anti-agglutinins, resulting in the disappearance of agglutinating power. In the case of the water vibrios, changed physical conditions could bring about a similar alteration in biological properties. It may be said that the absence of agglutination in a vibrio isolated from a suspected source does not define conclusively its noncholera nature. In all probability among a number of cholera-like vibrios isolated from suspected sources a certain percentage will eventually be found to develop agglutination either during laboratory cultivation or by means of animal passage, and until subjected to a procedure that will induce the return of agglutination no vibrio can be regarded with assurance as of a truly saprophytic variety...|$|E
