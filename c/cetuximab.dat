25|$|The {{best quality}} data are {{available}} for <b>cetuximab</b> since the 2006 publication of a randomized clinical trial comparing radiation treatment plus <b>cetuximab</b> versus radiation treatment alone. This study found that concurrent <b>cetuximab</b> and radiotherapy improves survival and locoregional disease control compared to radiotherapy alone, without {{a substantial increase in}} side effects, as would be expected with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which is the current gold standard treatment for advanced head and neck cancer. Whilst this study is of pivotal significance, interpretation is difficult since cetuximab-radiotherapy was not directly compared to chemoradiotherapy.

25|$|It {{is thought}} that HPV+OPC {{patients}} benefit better from radiotherapy and concurrent <b>cetuximab</b> treatment than HPV-OPC patients receiving the same treatment, and that radiation and cisplatin induce an immune response against an antigenic tumour which enhances their effect on the cancer cells. Although the incidence of HPV positivity is low (10–20%), an advantage for HPV+OPC was seen in trials of both <b>cetuximab</b> and panitumumab, a similar anti-EGFR agent, but not a consistent interaction with treatment, although HPV+OPC appears not to benefit {{to the same extent}} as HPV-OPC to second line anti-EGFR therapy, possibly due to lower EGFR expression in HPV+OPC.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in throat {{cancer is}} not {{generally}} used {{to cure the}} cancer as such. Instead, {{it is used to}} provide an inhospitable environment for metastases so that they will not establish {{in other parts of the}} body. Typical chemotherapy agents are a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. <b>Cetuximab</b> is also used in the treatment of throat cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} of a tumor to radiation therapy is {{also related to}} its size. Due to complex radiobiology, very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: Cisplatin, Nimorazole, and <b>Cetuximab.</b>|$|E
25|$|UC San Diego {{is one of}} {{the most}} active health science {{research}} institutes in the country. Of the $1.07 billion it received in research funding in 2017, $615.7 million was dedicated to health sciences research at UC San Diego Health medical centers and the School of Medicine. Several pioneering medical innovations have been made by UCSD researchers, such as the development of the chemotherapy drug <b>Cetuximab,</b> the use of gene therapy in the treatment of congenital defects, the discovery of insulin resistance as a cause of diabetes, the understanding of genetic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, the link between vitamin D deficiency and certain cancers, the first human trials of robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery, the development of the first oral drug for treating interstitial cystitis called Elmiron, the demonstration of HIV latency, the link between the p53 gene and rheumatoid arthritis, the identification of the genetic basis for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, the discovery of an early warning sign for autism, the connection between inflammation and cancer, the use of green fluorescent protein as a surgical and research aid, the nation's first sleeve gastrectomy, and the discovery of a potential treatment for chronic lymphomatic leukemia called Cirmtuzumab.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} {{radiotherapy}} data, {{most of the}} available knowledge on the efficacy of chemotherapy derives from the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer rather than specific studies of HPV+OPC. Since 1976, many clinical studies have compared CRT to RT alone in the primary management of locally advanced head and neck cancers and have demonstrated an advantage to CRT in both survival and locoregional control. Cisplatin is considered the standard agent, and a survival advantage was seen for those patients who received radiation with concurrent cisplatin. Despite this no trials directly comparing cisplatin with other agents in this context have been conducted. The other agent that is widely used is <b>Cetuximab,</b> a monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A 10% survival advantage at three years was noted when <b>cetuximab</b> was given concurrently with radiation (bioradiation). <b>Cetuximab</b> trials were completed prior to knowledge of HPV status. The main toxicity is an acneiform rash, {{but it has not}} been compared directly to cisplatin in HPV+OPC, although RTOG 1016 is addressing this question. [...] Concurrent chemotherapy is also superior to chemotherapy alone (induction chemotherapy) followed by radiation. <b>Cetuximab</b> shows no advantage when added to cisplatin in combination with radiation. Although chemoradiation became a treatment standard based on clinical trials and in particular, meta-analyses, a subsequent population based study of patients with OPC, indicated no advantage to the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in either HPV+OPC or HPV-OPC, and significant concerns about added toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Targeted therapy, {{according}} to the National Cancer Institute, is [...] "a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells." [...] Some targeted therapy used in squamous cell cancers {{of the head and}} neck include <b>cetuximab,</b> bevacizumab and erlotinib.|$|E
2500|$|In cancer treatment, {{pharmacogenomics}} {{tests are}} used to identify which patients {{are most likely to}} respond to certain cancer drugs. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include KRAS test with <b>cetuximab</b> and EGFR test with gefitinib. Beside efficacy, germline pharmacogenetics can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics [...] showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU.|$|E

50|$|This {{multiphase}} trial {{aimed to}} further evaluate {{the safety of}} tolerability of Abituzumab in combination therapy with <b>cetuximab</b> and irinotecan in the Phase I portion of the trial. Cetixumab, a monoclonal antibody, that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, {{can be used in}} combination as standard of care for treating colorectal cancer. The Phase II portion of the trial sought to compare the efficacy of Abituzumab, <b>cetuximab,</b> and irinotecan compared to <b>cetuximab</b> and irinotecan in patients with KRAS (exon 2) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients included in the study failed treatment with oxaliplatin, and initial safety studies included comparing Abituzumab, <b>cetuximab,</b> and irinotecan with standard of care. The Phase I study showed that doses up to 1000 mg of Abituzumab, <b>cetuximab,</b> and irinotecan were well tolerated. The results of Phase II showed that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was not met, but overall survival improved in patients receiving Abituzumab compared to standard of care. The researchers postulate that this could be due to increased expression of αvβ6 integrin in tumors.|$|E

50|$|ErbB-1 is overexpressed in many cancers. Drugs such as panitumumab, <b>cetuximab,</b> gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib {{are used}} to inhibit it.

50|$|Severe {{disease with}} {{persistent}} and substantial protein loss despite <b>cetuximab</b> may require total {{removal of the}} stomach.

50|$|One of {{the more}} serious side effects of <b>cetuximab</b> therapy is the {{incidence}} of acne-like rash. This rash rarely leads to dose reductions or termination of therapy. It is generally reversible.|$|E
50|$|Clinical Results:Cynomolgus monkeys {{were used}} in {{preclinical}} studies. Dose range finding studies showed an increase in cynomolgus monkey kidney weight and decrease in body weight in respect to the control group, but both effects were reversible. The clearance of Sym004 is dependent on antibody mediated receptor internalization. Due to the efficiency of Sym004 induction of receptor internalization, repeat dose studies showed little accumulation of Sym004 and the clearance rate was higher than <b>Cetuximab.</b> Because EGFR is expressed in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, the only toxic side effects observed were rash and diarrhea, and presented much earlier than <b>Cetuximab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{diagnostic}} immunohistochemistry assay (EGFR pharmDx) {{can be used}} {{to detect}} EGFR expression in the tumor material. Approximately 75% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have an EGFR-expressing tumor and are therefore considered eligible for treatment with <b>cetuximab</b> or panitumumab, according to FDA guidelines. Unfortunately, there is evidence that immunohistochemical EGFR receptor testing does not predict response to either <b>cetuximab</b> or panitumumab, so that this has been called a [...] "misleading biomarker" [...] that has nevertheless caused insurers and even health systems to deny payment for EGFR antibody treatment for patients who lack a positive tumor EGFR histochemical test.|$|E
50|$|Alpha-gal {{is present}} in the {{anti-cancer}} drug <b>cetuximab,</b> as well as the IV fluid replacements Gelofusine and Haemaccel. Blood thinners derived from porcine intestine and replacement heart valves derived from porcine tissue may also contain alpha-gal.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{geographic}} regions have a {{high rate}} of anaphylactic reactions to <b>cetuximab</b> upon the first exposure to the medication. This is unusual because exposure to the allergen must occur before the development of an allergy. Fewer than 1% of people in the northeast United States reacted, while greater than 20% in the southeast did. The alpha-gal allergy is believed to result from tick bites. Lone star ticks are native to the regions of the US where reactions occurred and were found to be the vector. <b>Cetuximab</b> is produced in the mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0 and thus contains the alpha-gal oligosaccharide, as do all mammals other than primates.|$|E
50|$|In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated {{the labels}} of two anti-EGFR {{monoclonal}} antibody drugs (panitumumab (Vectibix) and <b>cetuximab</b> (Erbitux)) indicated {{for treatment of}} metastatic colorectal cancer to include information about KRAS mutations.|$|E
