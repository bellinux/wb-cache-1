40|$|Clay {{modeling}} {{is increasingly}} {{used as a}} teaching method other than dissection. The haptic experience during clay modeling is supposed to correspond to the learning effect of manipulations during exercises in the dissection room involving tissues and organs. We questioned this assumption in two pretest-post-test experiments. In these experiments, the learning effects of clay modeling were compared to either live observations (Experiment I) or video observations (Experiment II) of the clay-modeling exercise. The effects of learning were measured with multiple choice questions, extended matching questions, and recognition of structures on illustrations of <b>cross-sections.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate was used to elaborate the results. Experiment I showed a significantly higher post-test score for the observers, whereas Experiment II showed a significantly higher post-test score for the clay modelers.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} Higher-harmonic Aeroacoustic Rotor Test (HART) II blades are determined using a finite element (FE) based <b>cross-section</b> <b>analysis</b> {{combined with the}} X-ray computed tomography technique. Three-dimensional, high-resolution digital images are constructed for this purpose. The detailed cross-section geometries are identified from a section segmentation process so that each pixel of the image is characterized by different attenuation coefficients according to the distribution of materials. The segmented section profiles are used to produce graphic data interfaces to create FE section model. A <b>cross-section</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed to compute the structural properties of the blade. The predicted mass and inertia results exactly reflect the manufactured configuration of the blade yielding semi-empirical data set of the blade. The stiffness properties measured using a cantilevered condition are correlated with the present predictions and the earlier estimated values. Good correlation is obtained between the predicted results and the measured data while a substantial deviation is observed with the earlier estimations. The possible source of discrepancy is identified from the analysis. The sensitivity of manufacturing defects and modeling deficiencies on the structural properties is examined.
