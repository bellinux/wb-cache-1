500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled The Wrongs of Woman. In her [...] "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of [...] "woman" [...] and not the story of an [...] "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has phrased it, [...] "the wrongs done to women and the wrongs done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). The wrongs done to women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the wrongs done by women include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), The Wrongs of Woman offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses <b>class</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|E

Rather than using fixed static thresholds as boundaries to distinguish between different classes, this approach introduces two methods of classification where the <b>boundaries</b> between different <b>classes</b> can be dynamically determined during the evolutionary process. The two methods are centred dynamic <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> determination and slotted dynamic <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> determination. The two methods are tested on four object classification problems of increasing difficulty and are compared with the commonly used static <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> method.

6000|$|That unorganized, unpaid {{public service}} of public-spirited aristocratic and wealthy {{financial}} and business people, the [...] "governing class," [...] which dominated the British Empire throughout the nineteenth century, has, through {{the absence of}} definite <b>class</b> <b>boundaries</b> in England and the readiness of each class to take its tone from the class above, that [...] "Snobbishness" [...] which is so often heedlessly dismissed as altogether evil, given a unique quality to British thought upon public questions and to British conceptions of Socialism. It has made the British mind as a whole [...] "administrative." [...] As compared with the American mind, for example, the British is State-conscious, the American State-blind. The American is no doubt intensely patriotic, but {{the nation and the}} State to which his patriotism points is something overhead and comprehensive like the sky, like a flag hoisted; something, indeed, that not only does not but must not interfere with his ordinary business occupations. To have public spirit, {{to be aware of the}} State as a whole and to have an administrative feeling towards it, is necessarily to be accessible to constructive ideas--that is to say, to Socialistic ideas. In the history of thought in Victorian Great Britain, one sees a constant conflict of this administrative disposition with the individualistic commercialism of the aggressively trading and manufacturing class, the class that in America reigns unchallenged to this day. In the latter country Individualism reigns unchallenged, it is assumed; in the former it has fought an uphill fight against the traditions of Church and State and has never absolutely prevailed. The political economists and Herbert Spencer were its prophets, and they never at any time held the public mind in any invincible grip. Since the eighties that grip has weakened more and more. Socialistic thought and legislation, therefore, was going on in Great Britain through all the Victorian period. Nevertheless, it was the Fabian Society that, in the eighties and through the intellectual impetus of at most four or five personalities, really brought this obstinately administrative spirit in British affairs into relation with Socialism as such.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According {{to support}} vector {{machines}} (SVMs), for those geometric approach based classification methods, examples {{close to the}} <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> usually are more informative than others. Taking face detection as an example, this paper addresses the problem of enhancing given training set and presents a nonlinear method to tackle the problem effectively. Based on SVM and improved reduced set algorithm (IRS), the method generates new examples lying close to the face/non-face <b>class</b> <b>boundary</b> to enlarge the original dataset and hence improve its sample distribution. The new IRS algorithm has greatly improved the approximation performance of the original reduced set (RS) method by embedding a new distance metric called image Euclidean distance (IMED) into the kernel function. To verify the generalization capability of the proposed method, the enhanced dataset is used to train an AdaBoost-based face detector and test it on the MIT+CMU frontal face test set.
