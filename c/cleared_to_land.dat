25|$|The Merauke Five {{are five}} Australian {{citizens}} who were detained by Indonesian {{authorities in the}} West Papuan town of Merauke for entering Indonesian territory without visas. The passengers were assured by the operator of the aircraft that visas were arranged and would be obtained upon arrival. Even without visas or security clearance, they were <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> by air traffic controllers, who were aware of their situation and assured them that a fine would be sufficient to clear the matter up. However, they were put in detention, then sentenced to jail.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} occurred on 12 April 1988. It involved a BAC One-Eleven 500 (registration: G-AYWB). The aircraft, {{which had been}} <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on Gatwick's runway 08L (the airport's standby runway), inadvertently landed on the parallel taxiway. An air traffic controller in Gatwick's control tower, who spotted the BIA One-Eleven coming in {{to land on the}} taxiway parallel to the emergency runway, ordered a British Airways Boeing 737 that had just entered the same taxiway to vacate it immediately. This resulted in the 737 taxiing right into the grass and the One-Eleven stopping 100-200m {{to the west of the}} 737's position.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Cheju at 21:07 for Seoul. The flight was <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on runway 14R with a crosswind component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the captain misused the reverse thrusters {{in a way the}} No. 1 engine failed to provide reverse thrust. Coupled with the fact the captain was confused with crosswind conditions and the first officer was preoccupied and not paying attention to the landing, the 747 failed to stop {{before the end of the}} runway. The aircraft swerved to the right and slid into a ditch at 50 knots with the fuselage splitting up.|$|E

25|$|Korean Air flight 8702, {{operated}} by a Boeing 747-400, departed Tokyo, Narita International Airport at 16:50 for a flight to Seoul, scheduled to arrive there at 19:20. Bad weather, including heavy rainfall, at Seoul forced the flight crew to divert to Cheju. The aircraft took off from Cheju at 21:07 for Seoul. The flight was <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on runway 14R with a crosswind component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the aircraft rolled off the runway. The aircraft slid into a ditch. The undercarriage was destroyed by the impact and the fuselage split.

25|$|The SkyWest {{aircraft}} was arriving at SFO after {{a flight from}} Modesto, California, and was cleared for a visual approach to runway 28R by NorCal approach control. After being switched over to the tower controller, SkyWest was <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on runway 28R. At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the runway threshold the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} cleared for takeoff.

On landing the pilots were unable to stop the aircraft and it ran {{off the end of}} the runway and down a slope, crashing into ten houses. The accident killed 18 people in all: eight passengers and eight crew members on board the aircraft, and two occupants of the houses. There were 298 passengers and crew who survived; however 37 passengers and crew and another 20 people on the ground were injured in the accident.

25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he did so much closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach {{as if he had been}} properly <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E

At Kisangani, 29 passengers boarded the aircraft for the flight to Kinshasa; 594kg of luggage was loaded for this sector. Besides the Captain and the Co-Pilot, the crew consisted of a Flight Attendant and a Ground Engineer. Pilot in Command (PIC) was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the Co-Pilot was the Pilot Not flying (PNF) for this sector. The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 11:18 and climbed to Flight Level 300. At 12:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 12:49, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting wind 210 degrees with 8 knots, visibility 8km, and thunderstorm over the station. The aircraft later <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> in the airport.|$|E
