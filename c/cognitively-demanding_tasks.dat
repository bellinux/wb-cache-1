5000|$|Slow-wave {{sleep is}} {{considered}} important for memory consolidation. This is {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "sleep-dependent memory processing." [...] Impaired memory consolidation has been seen in individuals with primary insomnia who thus do not perform {{as well as those who}} are healthy in memory tasks following a period of sleep. Furthermore, slow-wave sleep improves declarative memory (which includes semantic and episodic memory). A central model has been hypothesized that the long-term memory storage is facilitated by an interaction between the hippocampal and neocortical networks. In several studies, after the subjects have had training to learn a declarative memory task, the density of human sleep spindles present was significantly higher than the signals observed during the control tasks that involved similar visual stimulation and <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>tasks</b> but did not require learning. This associated with the spontaneously occurring wave oscillations that account for the intracellular recordings from thalamic and cortical neurons.|$|E
40|$|Insights into neurobiological {{mechanisms}} of depression {{are increasingly being}} sought via brain imaging studies. Our aim was to quantitatively summarize overlap and divergence in regions of altered brain activation associated with depression under emotionally-valenced compared to cognitively-demanding task conditions, with reference to intrinsic functional connectivity. We hypothesized differences reflective of task demands. A coordinate-based meta-analysis technique, Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE), was used to analyze relevant imaging literature. These studies compared brain activity in depressed adults relative to healthy controls during three conditions: (i) emotionally-valenced (cognitively easy) tasks (n= 29); (ii) <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>tasks</b> (n= 15); and (iii) resting conditions (n= 21). The meta-analyses identified 5, 8 and 7 significant clusters of altered brain activity under emotion, cognition and resting conditions respectively in depressed individuals compared to healthy controls. Regions of overlap and divergence between pairs of the three separate meta-analyses were quantified. There were no significant regions of overlap between emotion and cognition meta-analyses, but several divergent clusters were found. Cognitively-demanding conditions were associated with greater activation of right medial frontal and insula regions while bilateral amygdala was more significantly altered during emotion (cognitively-undemanding) conditions; consistent with task demands. Overlap was present in left amygdala and right subcallosal cingulate between emotion and resting meta-analyses, with no significant divergence. Our meta-analyses highlight alteration of common brain regions, during cognitively-undemanding emotional tasks and resting conditions but divergence of regions between emotional and <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>tasks.</b> Regions altered reflect current biological and system-level models of depression and highlight the relationship with task condition and difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Older adults show {{increased}} postural sway and {{a greater}} risk of falls when completing activities with high cognitive demands. While dual-task approaches have clarified an association between cognitive processes and postural control, it is unclear how manual ability, which is also required for the successful completion of <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>tasks</b> (e. g. putting a key into a lock), affects this relationship. Methods: Kinematic technology was used to explore the relationship between postural sway and manual control in healthy younger and older adults. Participants remained standing to complete a visual-motor tracking task on a tablet computer. Root Mean Square tracking error measured manual performance, and a balance board measured deviations in Centre of Pressure as a marker of postural sway. Results: Older adults displayed poorer manual accuracy and increased postural sway across all testing conditions. Conclusions: Cognitive capacity can interact with multiple task demands, and in turn affect postural sway in older adults. Improving our understanding of factors that influence postural control will assist falls-prevention efforts and inform clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|In this research, I {{investigated}} ways to reliably {{measure the}} effects of time pressure on mental workload using physiological measurement techniques and subjective workload assessments, {{as well as the}} resultant effects on performance in a <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>task.</b> This task involved subjects solving mental arithmetic problems of varying difficulties to induce different workloads. Time pressure has not been systematically researched to the extent of mental workload, but has been observed to affect performance in two contrasting ways: 1) limiting performance {{in a manner similar to}} cognitive overload; and by 2) focusing cognitive activities to improve performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel concept of {{congestion}} pricing based on voluntary peer-to-peer exchange of money between motorists {{in exchange for}} one ceding priority to another in a traffic stream. While in the classical congestion charging paradigm payments are compulsory and flow only towards the system operator, in the proposed marketplace participation is voluntary and motorists directly compensate each other. A particular motorist may find that he/she is a ‘payer’ at certain points in a given journey and a ‘payee’ at others. Humans would {{not be expected to}} successfully seek, negotiate and execute a continuous series of peer-to-peer trades involving micro-payments while also handling the <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>task</b> of driving; real-world implementation will therefore require vehicles operating under fully-automated control in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions during the time periods that they seek and engage in trades. The automated vehicle control algorithms must be sufficiently intelligent and adaptable to enable alternative maneuvers on short timescales, given the inherent uncertainty of whether or not a potential trade will in fact be executed. The peer-to-peer trading would be executed algorithmically, subject to strategic-level guidance given by a vehicle’s occupant(s) regarding the occupant’s relative valuation of money and priority in the traffic stream. In this paper we detail the prospective marketplace and present a simple simulation model to expose its properties. We show that the proposed peer-to-peer marketplace could lead to both desirable and undesirable outcomes; which of these would be predominant is a matter requiring empirical study. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to refine and develop these concepts into practice...|$|R
40|$|Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) is a debilitating disorder of unknown pathogenesis, characterised by fatigue {{which is not}} relieved by rest, accompanied by assorted symptoms including cognitive difficulties, pain, and unrefreshing sleep. One hallmark of the symptom complex in CFS is a transient exacerbation of the fatigue state after relatively minor physical activity or cognitive activity  often termed a post-exertional exacerbation. By applying challenge paradigms, the studies presented in this thesis aimed to analyse the biological underpinnings of the disorder during periods of worsened fatigue and symptoms following the imposition of environmental challenges  a physical exercise protocol and a simulated-driving protocol (representing a <b>cognitively-demanding</b> <b>task).</b> These paradigms allowed analysis of a working conceptual model that CFS {{is a result of}} central sensitisation, representing augmented responsiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) to signals either from the periphery or from within the brain - resulting in altered sensory processing within the brain and ultimately the excessive conscious sensation of fatigue. Across the two challenge studies, patients with CFS reported high levels of fatigue in their baseline state (consistent with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder). This was measured using a new fatigue scale specifically designed for these studies to allow real-time measurement of the phenomenon. In comparison to matched healthy participants, at baseline, the patients had impairments in cognitive function, longer night-time sleep, less day-time physical activity and movement, and less heart rate variability - an index of vagal activity, around the time of night-time sleep, but no alterations in gene expression for biomarkers previously linked with the sensation of fatigue, or in indices of interoception. These findings are generally consistent with previous evidence for autonomic nervous system and cognitive disturbances in patients with CFS. However, while both the physical and cognitive challenges induced an exacerbation of fatigue lasting hours-to-days in patients with CFS (with little or no change in healthy participants), there were no corresponding changes in gene expression, cognitive performance, indices of interoception, indices of vagal activity, or sleep and activity patterns. As such, the inability to detect meaningful changes in biological parameters indirectly reflecting central sensitisation post-challenge did not allow for confirmation or denial of the hypothesis that the post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue and related symptoms is due to central sensitisation. Further studies are warranted using these challenge protocols in conjunction with more direct measures of central sensitisation such as functional neuro-imaging...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{standard}} Markov decision process (MDP), rewards {{are assumed to}} be precisely known and of quantitative nature. This can be a too strong hypothesis in some situations. When rewards can really be modeled numerically, specifying the reward function is often difficult as it is a <b>cognitively-demanding</b> and/or time-consuming <b>task.</b> Besides, rewards can sometimes be of qualitative nature as when they represent qualitative risk levels for instance. In those cases, it is problematic to use directly standard MDPs and we propose instead to resort to MDPs with ordinal rewards. Only a total order over rewards is assumed to be known. In this setting, we explain how an alternative way to define expressive and interpretable preferences using reference points can be exploited...|$|R
40|$|When {{interacting}} with an object within the environment, one must combine visual {{information with the}} felt limb position (i. e. proprioception) in order compute an appropriate coordinated muscle plan for accurate motor control. Amongst the vast reciprocally connected parieto-frontal connections responsible for guiding a limb throughout space, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) remains a front-runner as a crucial node within this network. Our brain is primed to reach directly towards a viewed object, a situation that has been termed ""standard"". Such direct eye-hand coordination is common across species and is crucial for basic survival. Humans, however, have developed the capacity for tool-use and thus have learned to interact indirectly with an object. In such ""non-standard"" situations, the directions of gaze and arm movement are spatially decoupled and rely on both {{the implementation of a}} cognitive rule and online feedback of the decoupled limb. The studies included within this dissertation were designed to further characterize the role of the PPC in different types of visually-guided reaching which require one to think and to act simultaneously (i. e. cognitive-motor integration). To address the relative contribution of different cortical networks responsible for cognitive-motor integration, we tested three patients with optic ataxia (OA; two unilateral - first study, and one bilateral -second study) as well as healthy participants during a <b>cognitively-demanding</b> dual <b>task</b> (third study) on a series of visually-guided reaching tasks each requiring a relative weighting between explicit cognitive control and implicit online control of the spatially decoupled limb. We found that the eye and hand movement performance during decoupled reaching was the most compromised in OA during situations relying on sensorimotor recalibration, and the most compromised in healthy participants during a dual task relying on strategic control. Taken together, these data presented in this dissertation provide further evidence for the existence of alternate task-dependent neural pathways for cognitive-motor integration. ...|$|R
40|$|Educators in the English-medium {{community}} colleges in Hong Kong are being challenged to prepare students with diverse language backgrounds to learn through English as a second language. While some researchers advocate the adoption of an ‘English-only policy’ to maximise students’ exposure to their target language, others argue that bilingual learners’ accessibility to both their first language [L 1] and second language [L 2] as semiotic resources for learning may facilitate their mediation of <b>cognitively-demanding</b> academic <b>tasks,</b> and subsequently their academic discourse development. Adopting a social practice view of learning, this study explores how learners use their bilingual resources to mediate their academic discourse development in a marketing course at the sub-degree level in Hong Kong. A case {{study was conducted to}} trace how students use Chinese as their L 1 and English as their L 2 {{to make sense of the}} social practice of marketing in an integrated language and content learning environment. The focus of the study was students’ language use at different stages of a marketing project which required them to work collaboratively to research and analyse the marketing environment of a product, to write up a marketing plan of the product, and to deliver an oral presentation. The main data sources were the spoken and written discourse data collected from a 14 -week semester from a project group’s out-of-classroom discussions, written report and oral presentation, which were analysed using Mohan’s (2007) model of social practice analysis – one that considers texts as the instantiation of both the language system and the system of meanings. Interview data on the functions of students’ language choices in the project were also used to triangulate the discourse data. The analysis of the student discourses shows the prominent role of learners’ L 1 in mediating their meaning-making, and subsequently their L 2 academic discourse development, in the theory-practice dialectic of learning in the marketing project. The findings indicate that the student-participants used both their L 1 and L 2 to help them perform the project tasks within the larger context of the marketing course. At the project preparation stage, the student-participants were able to use appropriate lexical-grammatical features of their L 1 and/or L 2 to (i) reconstruct their findings about the marketing practices of the selected company, (ii) reflect on such practices using their disciplinary knowledge, and (iii) scaffold their peers’ second language academic discourse development. Through their constant reflection on their academic practices in both L 1 and L 2, the student-participants were ultimately able to deploy effective L 2 linguistic resources which correspond to the semantic structures of marketing to represent their disciplinary knowledge in both L 2 oral and written academic discourses. This study has made contributions to the field of bilingualism and academic discourse socialisation. It helps to generate a deeper understanding of learners’ language use patterns in a marketing project – how bilingual learners use their linguistic resources to make sense of the disciplinary ways of knowing and thinking. The results illustrate the interdependent relationship of content, language and higher level thinking skills in marketing. With a better understanding of the language and cognitive demands of the marketing project, this study helps to draw implications for the pedagogical practices of disciplinary subjects at the sub-degree level and calls for the collaboration of both content and language teachers to derive more effective strategies for fostering students’ academic discourse development by drawing on the linguistic resources of bilingual learners. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Educatio...|$|R
