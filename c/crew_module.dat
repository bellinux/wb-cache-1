Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS {{that would also}} send Orion on a circumlunar trajectory, which is planned for 2019. The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch in 2022; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit. EM-3 is planned to deliver a crew of 4 to Lunar orbit along with the first module of Deep Space Gateway.|$|E
25|$|Orion's design {{consists}} of three main parts: a <b>Crew</b> <b>Module</b> (CM) similar to the Apollo Command Module, but capable of sustaining four to six crew members; a cylindrical Service Module (SM) containing the primary propulsion systems and consumable supplies; and the Launch Abort System (LAS), which provides capability for the astronauts and <b>Crew</b> <b>Module</b> {{to escape from the}} launch vehicle should problems arise during launch ascent. The Orion <b>Crew</b> <b>Module</b> is designed to be reusable for up to ten flights, allowing NASA to construct a fleet of Orion crew modules.|$|E

50|$|The {{radiation}} from ICAN-II's ACMF engine would be intercepted by a 4-meter radius silicon carbide shell. Additionally, 1.2 meters of lithium hydride will shield the fuel rings from high-energy neutrons that are {{ejected from the}} nuclear explosions, and 2.2 meters of shielding will protect the <b>crew</b> <b>modules.</b> The spacecraft would have a total mass of 625 metric tons, with 82 additional metric tons available for payload. This is more than sufficient to carry a Mars Lander and exploration vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Three {{missions}} {{have been}} identified by NASA for a Space Shuttle-supplementing Alternate Transportation System (ATS) encompassing combinations of booster vehicles, <b>crew</b> <b>modules,</b> and service modules: (1) to achieve manned access to orbit for Space Station crew rotation every 90 days, (2) the lofting of a logistics module resupplying the Space Station every 180 days, and (3) the simultaneous launch of both crews and logistics to the Space Station. A reentry glider is considered, {{in conjunction with the}} Space Shuttle's unmanned cargo version and the Apollo manned capsule, as an important ATS element.

25|$|The {{version of}} Kliper {{presented}} during the bid in January 2006 differs {{again from the}} original design. It showed a lifting body with larger wings, that, according to Energia officials, could be folded around the core <b>crew</b> <b>module</b> and unfold after atmospheric re-entry {{in order to provide}} cross-range and better landing accuracy for the spacecraft. The light Kliper version proposed was stripped down to 7 tons and uses the 'split-up'-option with Parom as a spacetug.|$|E

25|$|NASA {{managers}} held a post {{news conference}} to brief about the outcomes of the FRR on October 30, 2009. The briefing was broadcast on NASA TV and was attended by William Gerstenmaier, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Operations, Michael Moses, Launch Integration Manager, Space Shuttle Program and Michael Leinbach, space shuttle launch director. Mr. Gerstenmaier and Mr. Moses mentioned about two issues related to ongoing shuttle processing that had been discussed during the FRR: (1) Effects of vibrations and acoustics associated with the Main Engine ignition—a potential issue with a stinger (bolt) structure on the aft of the shuttle, which may be susceptible to the stresses of Main Engine ignition (2) Shuttle's toilet– a new Aluminum bracket used to help anchor the toilet to the <b>crew</b> <b>module</b> structure had been installed. For future flights, NASA plans to use a redesigned Titanium bracket.|$|E

Italy has designed and built several satellites, as well as pressurized (<b>crewed)</b> <b>modules</b> for the International Space Station. Early Italian satellites were launched using vehicles provided by NASA, first from Wallops Flight Facility in 1964 and then from a spaceport in Kenya (San Marco Platform) between 1967 and 1988; Italy has led {{the development of the}} Vega rocket programme within the European Space Agency since 1998.The United Kingdom abandoned its independent space launch programme in 1972 in favour of co-operating with the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) on launch technologies until 1974. Australia abandoned its launcher programme shortly after the successful launch of WRESAT, and became the only non-European member of ELDO.|$|R

2500|$|... 9:00:18 (EI+969): Videos and {{eyewitness}} {{reports by}} observers {{on the ground}} in and near Dallas indicated that the Orbiter had disintegrated overhead, continued to break up into smaller pieces, and left multiple ion trails, as it continued eastward. In Mission Control, while the loss of signal was a cause for concern, {{there was no sign of}} any serious problem. Before the orbiter broke up at 9:00:18, the Columbia cabin pressure was nominal and the crew was capable of conscious actions. Although the <b>crew</b> <b>module</b> remained mostly intact through the breakup, it was damaged enough that it lost pressure at a rate fast enough to incapacitate the crew within seconds, and was completely depressurized no later than 9:00:53.|$|E

50|$|The LCS is reconfigured {{for various}} roles by {{changing}} mission packages, {{each of which}} includes mission module equipment (weapon systems, sensors, etc.), carried craft and mission <b>crews.</b> <b>Modules</b> include Anti-submarine warfare (ASW), mine hunter (MCM), surface warfare (SUW), and special warfare missions. The MCM and SUW modules are planned to reach initial operating capability in Fiscal year 2014, and the ASW module in FY2016. Module changes were envisioned to allow a single LCS to change roles {{in a matter of}} hours at any commercial port allowing it to rapidly optimize effectiveness against a threat. A report from the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) on a January 2012 sustainment wargame reportedly stated that, possibly for logistics reasons, the mission module changes may take as long as weeks, and that in the future the navy plans to use LCS ships with a single module, with module changes being a rare occurrence. In 2014, Independence switched from mine to surface warfare modes in 96 hours on short notice.|$|R
2500|$|The Kliper {{program was}} {{proposed}} as the Russian-European counterpart to the American Orion Spacecraft {{and was therefore}} designed (similar to the Orion) {{to be part of}} a modular system that enabled it to be both a LEO-shuttle type vehicle as well as part of a spacecraft able to go beyond Earth orbit to the Moon and even Mars (there were outline suggestions of lunar applications in September 2005). [...] The modular design would have included the Kliper <b>crew</b> <b>module</b> and - depending on the mission - a mission module or propulsion module.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials {{continues to increase}} in the aerospace community due to {{the potential benefits of}} reduced weight, increased strength, and manufacturability. Ongoing work at NASA involves the use of the large-scale composite structures for spacecraft (payload shrouds, cryotanks, <b>crew</b> <b>modules,</b> etc). NASA is also working to enable both the use and sustainment of composites in commercial aircraft structures. One key to the sustainment of these large composite structures is the rapid, in-situ characterization {{of a wide range of}} potential defects that may occur during the vehicle's life. Additionally, in many applications it is necessary to monitor changes in these materials over their lifetime. Quantitative characterization through Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) of defects such as reduced bond strength, microcracking, and delamination damage due to impact, are of particular interest. This paper will present an overview of NASA's applications of NDE technologies being developed for the characterization and sustainment of advanced aerospace composites.
