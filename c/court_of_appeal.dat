In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> than the House of Lords. <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes.

On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> reversed Judge Quesada's order.

These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
