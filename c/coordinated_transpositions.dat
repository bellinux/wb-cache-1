As the [...] "Balletown" [...] mode could effectively solve the problem with urban and rural population <b>coordinated</b> <b>transpositions,</b> effectively expand domestic demand, provide large number of job opportunities, create {{a new way of}} living, and have an obvious social and economic benefits, it got great attention and good graces from the governments of various regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{reflection}} σi {{through the}} hyperplane perpendicular to αi {{is the same}} as permutation of the adjacent i-th and (i + 1)-th <b>coordinates.</b> Such <b>transpositions</b> generate the full permutation group.For adjacent simple roots, σi(αi+1) = αi+1 + αi = σi+1(αi) = αi + αi+1, that is, reflection is equivalent to adding a multiple of 1; butreflection of a simple root perpendicular to a nonadjacent simple root leaves it unchanged, differing by a multiple of 0.|$|R
40|$|This article compares cabinet {{institutions}} for <b>coordinating</b> the <b>transposition</b> of EU legislation in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. It examines how national executives {{have adapted to}} European integration and what factors have shaped institutional variation across countries and over time. During pre-accession, the Hungarian, Polish and (to a lesser extent) Czech cabinets established strong core executives for tracking EU-related legislative commitments, monitoring progress and reviewing the quality of transposition. After accession, the cores in all three cabinets loosened the grip on transposition, although to different degrees. The analysis shows that, if sectoral factors are kept constant, variation in the patterns of national adaptation can be explained with reference to external incentives and constitutional rules. High benefits of transposition before accession encouraged centralization, particularly in prime-ministerial cabinets. Fewer incentives under full membership contributed to a halt or reversal in core executive ascendancy...|$|R
40|$|Most {{member states}} of the European Union (EU) have some {{difficulty}} in transposing EU directives. Despite the obligation to comply with EU law, member states are often slow to adopt national policies implementing directives. In this paper I analyse this problem {{by focusing on the}} coordination of transposition in the domestic policy arena. Coordination is approached as a game in which one or more higher-level players decide on policy when lower-level players are unable to make a decision. Based on the model developed in the paper, lower-level players sometimes appear to have discretion in shaping the policy transposing a directive. Furthermore, if a single player <b>coordinates</b> the <b>transposition</b> process, the implementing policy differs from the policy specified by the directive. However, a decisionmaking process with more than one higher-level player can result in deadlock, leading to a literal transposition of a directive. Moreover, deadlock between the deciding players may delay the transposition process. Both mechanisms are illustrated by two cases of decision-making on EU directives in The Netherlands: the cocoa and chocolate products directive and the laying hens directive. The analysis shows that the framework developed in this paper contributes to the understanding of transposition...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial transposons {{typically}} {{exist in}} a mutually beneficial relationship with the host cell. Limited transposition can benefit the host while also ensuring {{the survival of the}} element. An important component of this relationship is that transposition must be tightly regulated. In this thesis I explore ways that the host and transposon each control transposition in E. coli and provide evidence that a transposon can also control host gene expression in S. enterica Typhimurium. Post-transcriptional regulation with small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) has emerged as a key way that bacteria respond to stress and regulate many cellular processes. The RNA-binding protein Hfq is the nexus of sRNA regulatory networks and acts by promoting base-pairing interactions between sRNAs and their target mRNAs. Previous work found that Hfq is a potent negative regulator of IS 10 transposition in E. coli and suggested that Hfq inhibited transposase translation using an IS 10 -encoded sRNA (RNA-OUT) as well as an undefined mechanism that was independent of RNA-OUT. I show that Hfq promotes base-pairing between RNA-OUT and IS 10 transposase mRNA (RNA-IN) by melting the secondary structure of both RNAs to expose residues involved in intermolecular base-pairing. I also investigated how Hfq can repress translation of RNA-IN in the absence of RNA-OUT and demonstrate that Hfq-binding to an mRNA can directly repress translation {{in the absence of any}} sRNA. The data suggested Hfq may regulate other transposons and I show that the unrelated IS 200 element is also subject to Hfq regulation. In contrast to the IS 10 system, Hfq represses IS 200 transposase (tnpA) translation completely independent of the IS 200 -encoded sRNA (art 200). Translation initiation on tnpA is inhibited 3 ̆e 350 -fold by the cooperation of Hfq, art 200, and an RNA structural element in the tnpA 5 ’UTR illustrating how host- and transposon-encoded factors can <b>coordinate</b> to repress <b>transposition.</b> Lastly, I demonstrate that tnpA is processed to produce an sRNA that alters transcript abundance 3 ̆e 2 -fold for 73 S. enterica Typhimurium genes, which provides a new twist on our understanding of host-transposon interactions. Taken together, this work suggests that RNA transactions play an important role in governing host-transposon relationships in bacteria...|$|R
