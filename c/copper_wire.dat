5|$|With nearly 3,000telephone poles {{damaged or}} snapped and 32,000service outages, Southern Bell and AT quickly {{began work on}} {{restoring}} telephone service, sending workers from their centers in Atlanta and Jacksonville, respectively. The companies shipped about 225tons of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> and 20rail cars full of poles and switchboards. The Southern Bell office in Delray Beach was nearly destroyed, causing workers to move the service center to a nearby building. By the morning of September18, water service was restored in the central sections of West Palm Beach and was expected to expand {{to other areas of}} the city quickly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
40|$|Oil-impregnated {{paper is}} widely used in power {{transmission}} equipment as a reliable insulation. However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of copper sulfur corrosion and copper sulphide deposition on <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory. The corrosive characteristics of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were analyzed. Dielectric properties of insulation paper and insulating oil were also analyzed {{at different stages of}} the thermal aging tests using a broadband dielectric spectrometer. Experiments and analysis results show that copper sulfide deposition on surfaces of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper changes the surface structures of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper. Copper sulfur corrosion changes the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation, and the copper sulfide deposition greatly reduces the electrical breakdown strength of oil-paper insulation. Metal passivator is capable of preventing <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> from sulfur corrosion. The experimental results are helpful for investigations for fault diagnosis of internal insulation in power transformers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} research, after thin {{straight}} <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> of 0. 1 mm φ were {{exposure to the}} impulse cur-rent, their temperature rose and they were melted according to the specific pre-arcing Joule integral in an adiabatic state. However, in this research we confirmed the straight <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were broken in solid state before melted. And the test data suggest that ohmic heating {{is the main reason}} for breaking these thin <b>copper</b> <b>wires,</b> less than 0. 6 mm φ in the experiments. Then the impulse current was impressed through curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> from 0. 3 mm φ to 0. 6 mm φ. And the current-carrying capability of curved wires was experimentally compared with that of straight ones. ...|$|R
50|$|Corning {{announced}} a multi-mode version of ClearCurve cabling on 13 January 2009.

Although it was mentioned only in passing, Intel's new Light Peak interconnection system uses ClearCurve cabling as its basis. Light Peak uses a two-fiber cable running at 10 Gbit/s in both directions. Unlike most optical connection systems, Light Peak is being designed to allow daisy-chaining and supply power through a set of coaxial <b>copper</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E
25|$|Geometry is {{important}} because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick <b>copper</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{characteristic}} of cathodic copper is its {{concentration of impurities}} because this determines the mechanical properties, i. e. ductility, of the derived <b>copper</b> <b>wires.</b> However, the results of standard mechanical tests to evaluate ductility {{show that there is}} no clear correlation between the content of impurities in the cathodes and the ductility of the <b>copper</b> <b>wires.</b> In this study, from traction tests on <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and observation of their fracture surfaces by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, it has been concluded that the principal impurity affecting the ductility of the <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> is oxygen, which is mainly incorporated during the melting of the cathodes and casting of the rods. In addition, to discriminate the effect of oxygen concentration in copper ductility, the used probes or wires must have the same previous deformation and must not have been annealed. When <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> are annealed, cuprous oxide particles are also more dispersed in the matrix, and not only segregated and concentrated as occurs in the non-annealed condition, thus diminishing the mechanical fragility effect of the oxide. ©ASM International.

25|$|Copper used in {{building}} wire has a conductivity rating of 100% IACS or better. Copper building wire requires less insulation {{and can be}} installed in smaller conduits than when lower-conductivity conductors are used. Also, comparatively, more <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> can fit in a given conduit than conductors with lower conductivities.
