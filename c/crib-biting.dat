And this might have been expected, as horses breed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising. Authors who have had wide experience give in detail many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French veterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be formed), <b>crib-biting,</b> jibbing and ill-temper, are all plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying [...] "there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;" [...] and M. Bernard adds that the doctrine [...] "that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day." [...] (12/21. These various statements are taken from the following works and papers:--Youatt on 'The Horse' pages 35, 220. Lawrence 'The Horse' page 30. Karkeek in an excellent paper in 'Gard.

The <b>crib-biting</b> horses had significantly higher mean plasma ghrelin concentrations than the control horses. The circadian rhythm of cortisol was evident, indicating that the sampling protocol did not inhibit the circadian regulation in these horses. <b>Crib-biting</b> had no statistically significant effect on cortisol, ACTH or β-endorphin concentrations.

40|$|The horse (Equus caballus) {{provides}} a useful model where the study of repetitious behaviour is concerned as they perform three distinct stereotypies including one oral (<b>crib-biting)</b> and two locomotor equivalents (weaving and box-walking). Whilst several preliminary investigations have been performed into the neuro-aetiology of <b>crib-biting,</b> no studies to date have sought to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying locomotor stereotypy in this species. As such, the primary aim {{of this investigation was}} to probe the neural basis of locomotor stereotypy (weaving) and extend current knowledge with regards to the <b>crib-biting</b> response. In this regard, behavioural probes have proved useful in identifying altered striatal functioning in a number of species without the use of invasive methods. Consequently spontaneous blink rate (SBR), behavioural initiation and an extinction-devaluation paradigm were conducted on a sample of <b>crib-biting</b> (n= 8), weaving (n= 8) and control (n= 8) horses to investigate striatal output patterns. <b>Crib-biting</b> horses demonstrated significantly lower SBR when compared to the control (p< 0. 05) and the weaving (p< 0. 01) animals. Behaviour initiation was significantly increased for the <b>crib-biting</b> (p< 0. 01) and the weaving (p< 0. 05) horses when compared to control equivalents. During the extinction paradigm, the control horses required significantly more trials to reach learning criterion when compared to both <b>crib-biting</b> (p< 0. 001) and weaving (p< 0. 001) animals. The <b>crib-biting</b> horses performed significantly more operant responses during extinction 1 and extinction 2 compared to weaving (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01 respectively) and control horses (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 001 respectively). The <b>crib-biting</b> sample conducted significantly more operant responses during extinction 1 when compared to extinction 2 (p< 0. 005), though no difference was observed for the control or weaving group. Finally, <b>crib-biting</b> horses required significantly more trials to reach total extinction criterion when compared to their control (p< 0. 001) and weaving (p< 0. 01) equivalents. This data suggests that there is an initial acceleration of ventral-dorsal activity within the striatum of <b>crib-biting</b> horses. However, the significant reduction of operant responses during extinction 2 compared to extinction 1 is indicative of a return to action outcome monitoring {{in the final stages of}} the extinction experiment. It is possible that this reduction of operant responses in extinction 2 is resultant of dopamine receptor saturation following devaluation. As the number of operant responses during extinction 2 is significantly higher for the <b>crib-biting</b> horses, the <b>crib-biting</b> horse is therefore responding habitually during extinction 2 in response to the conditioned stimulus as motivation in terms of reward acquisition has ceased. On the other hand the weaving horses did not transit towards stimulus-response learning at any stage of the extinction paradigm. Rather the weaving horse data suggests enhanced motivation as a result of increased phasic dopamine release highlighted by significantly reduced trials to attain learning criterion compared to control animals...|$|E
40|$|<b>Crib-biting</b> is {{a common}} oral stereotypy. Because of {{perceived}} deleterious effects on the health and appearance of subjects the prevention of <b>crib-biting</b> is regularly attempted. The resourcefulness of horses in satisfying their motivation to perform this behaviour often frustrates owners ’ efforts at prevention. This paper reviews the efficacy and observable consequences of attempting to prevent <b>crib-biting</b> {{by a variety of}} methods. These include attempts to prevent the grasping of objects, to interfere with air-engulfing and to introduce punishment for grasping and neck-flexion. Other approaches include the use of surgery, acupuncture, pharmaceuticals, operant feeding and environmental enrichment. A remedy that is effective for every crib-biter remains elusive. We conclude that, rather than concentrating on remedial prevention, further research should be directed at establishing why horses crib-bite and how the emergence of <b>crib-biting</b> can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} of eleven pairs of <b>crib-biting</b> and non-crib-biting horses (controls) to an arousal-inducing stimulus were studied. Video-observation {{of the horses}} revealed that <b>crib-biting</b> horses spent between 10. 4 and 64. 7 % of their stabling time performing the stereotypy. During the first 2 days of an experimental period, the horses were conditioned to receive food from a special bucket. On the third day the food bucket was presented, but the horses {{were not allowed to}} feed. Arousal behaviour and <b>crib-biting</b> intensity as well as plasma cortisol concentration, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded at rest, and during and after presentation of the food stimulus. The stimulus induced a significant increase of HR and arousal behaviour in crib-biters and in controls, whereas the <b>crib-biting</b> frequency decreased. Power spectral analysis of the HRV revealed significant differences between crib-biters and controls at rest: crib-biters had a lower vagal tone (high frequency component, HF) and a higher sympathetic tone (low frequency component, LF) than controls. The lower basal parasympathetic activity might be an indication why <b>crib-biting</b> horses, in contrast to the controls, showed neither a significant decrease of the HF component during presentation of the food stimulus nor an increase of the HF component after presentation. Thus, there might be differences in the tuning of the autonomous nervous system and of the stress reactivity in <b>crib-biting</b> and in control horses. The results suggest that the <b>crib-biting</b> horses are more stress sensitive and physiologically and psychologically less flexible than the control horse...|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that environmentally-induced (spontaneous) stereotypies arise from dysregulation of the basal ganglia. Basal ganglia dysfunction can also expresses itself as aberrations in learning task performance. As a result, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a strong link between inappropriate repeat responding within an extinction learning paradigm and stereotypy performance. In contrast to this, research into the oral equine stereotypy <b>crib-biting</b> {{has suggested that the}} aetiology of this behaviour sterns from visceral discomfort {{as a result of the}} acidic consequences of eating cereal-based concentrate where, <b>crib-biting</b> is potentially a means of producing additional alkaline saliva to counteract the effect. If <b>crib-biting</b> is an artifact of nutritional and not basal ganglia dysfunction, <b>crib-biting</b> horses should not display the additional aforementioned signs of basal ganglia dysfunction. The aim of this study, therefore, was to test this hypothesis by recording the behavioural response of <b>crib-biting</b> and control animals within an extinction-learning paradigm. Ten control and 10 stereotypy (<b>crib-biting)</b> horses of similar breed (Thoroughbred and Thoroughbred cross) and sex (control: 5 male [gelding], 5 female; stereotypy: 6 male, 4 female) were shaped to press a 15 cm x 15 cm square button mounted vertically at 1. 5 in from the floor in response to a conditioned stimulus (CS) (electronic buzzer [30 Db] and a yellow light bulb [50 W]. All subjects were then placed under extinction conditions whereby button presses following CS delivery would yield no food reward. The following four recordings made: (1) the number of trials to total extinction (zero responses within or outside of the 15 s window of opportunity), (2) the number of trials to extinction within the 15 s window of opportunity, (3) the number of button presses to total extinction and (4) the number of trials taken to re-establish criterion. <b>Crib-biting</b> horse required significantly more unreinforced trials (P < 0. 01) and overall button presses (P < 0. 01) to reach extinction criterion compared to control animals. Thus, <b>crib-biting</b> horses demonstrated characteristics of increased perseveration suggesting alterations in basal ganglia physiology. These results tend to dissuade from the hypothesis that <b>crib-biting</b> is a method of producing additional saliva to ameliorate visceral discomfort, but studies combined might suggest that visceral discomfort has an important role to play in the alteration of basal ganglia activity that then manifests itself behaviourally as oral stereotypy.

Animal Welfare, 10, (2), 173 - 189 The common practice of preventing equine stereotypic behaviour in the UK {{may be of}} concern, from a welfare perspective, if these behaviours constitute a coping response to a suboptimal environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the putative function of these behaviours by measuring behavioural and physiological parameters i) before and after stereotypy prevention; ii) before and after stereotypy performance; and iii) in response to opiate antagonist (naloxone) administration. The crib-strap significantly (P = 0. 05) elevated mean plasma cortisol levels in <b>crib-biting</b> horses; a similar, although not significant trend (P = 0. 07) was also observed for the weaving group during the anti-weave bar treatment. Both crib-strap and anti-weave bar significantly (P < 0. 05) elevated plasma cortisol levels in the control horses. Although the latter result prevented a definite conclusion being drawn about the function of equine stereotypies, the results did indicate that the use of the crib-strap and anti-weave bar is stressful to the horse. Plasma cortisol level was significantly (P = 0. 04) higher immediately prior to the onset of stereotypy followed by a significant reduction post-stereotypy. This suggested that both <b>crib-biting</b> and weaving have a coping function to reduce stress levels in the animal. Naloxone significantly reduced <b>crib-biting</b> by 84 per cent (P = 0. 05) but it did not reduce weaving behaviour, indicating that <b>crib-biting</b> is a reward behaviour. However, resting behaviour was also significantly (P = 0. 02) increased in <b>crib-biting</b> horses, suggesting that the stereotypy reduction was due to a sedative effect of the opiate antagonist. The latter was not measured, however, in control or weaving animals, and thus may be interpreted differently. The welfare implications of these results are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Such restrictions can lead to digestive disturbances and promote the development of ste- reo typic behaviours. The objectives of this experiment were to determine if ad libitum or restricted forage {{with or without the}} molassesbased lick,Horslyx,would alter the behaviour in a group of normal and confirmed stereotypic horses. Two Randomised Block Design trials were conducted simultaneously. Group A consisted of 3 crib- biters and 1 normal horse,while group B contained 4 non-stereotypic (normal) horses. Horses were individually housed in 10 � 12 foot boxes and bedded on dust-extracted shavings with water available ad libitum. Diets were ad libitum hay, ad libitum hayþ Horslyx, restricted hay,and restricted hayþ Horslyx. For two days of each collection period every horse was individually observed,and andthe program completed for ½ h 3 x/day¼ 6 observation sessions for each horse. Switching behaviour and data for hay and lick intakes were averaged across the 5 days of collection and subjected to Friedman's non-parametric ANOVA with horse,diet and behaviour as fixed factors. Ad libitum or restricted forage or thepresence of a Horslyx had no significant impact o nhorse be- haviour. <b>Crib-biting</b> horses tended to consume lesshay 8. 81 (73. 60) kg/d and more Horslyx 1. 10 (70. 38) kg/d compared with normal horses who consumed more hay at 11. 72 (74. 59) kg/d and less Horslyx at 1. 01 (70. 45) kg/d respectively,but there was {{no significant differences between the}} groups. <b>Crib-biting</b> horses switched behaviour(eating,licking,cribbing,drinking,and looking over the door resting) an average of 40 times more during the 30 min observation sessions than normal horses. Crib- biting horses also licked th eHorslyx 1. 5 times more than normal horses. These results confirmed that stereotypic animals are addicted to the reward of the dopamine release, achieved by the action of crib biting,and are thus not influenced by ad libitum forage or access to a stable lick. The 4 fold increase in switching behaviour and additional licking by the <b>crib-biting</b> horses suggests an increased transmission of the neurotransmitter dopamine and in this regard licking may promote coping in certain environmental circumstances. The results of this study suggest that providing a lick in the stable for <b>crib-biting</b> horses gives them another activity to the normal forage consumption and resting actions and may provide another me- chanism for dopamine release and thus enhance their ‘coping’ strategy when confined in stables...|$|E
40|$|Stereotypies are {{repetitive}} {{and relatively}} invariant patterns of behavior, which are {{observed in a}} wide range of species in captivity. Stereotypic behavior occurs when environmental demands produce a physiological response that, if sustained for an extended period, exceeds the natural physiological regulatory capacity of the organism, particularly in situations that include unpredictability and uncontrollability. One hypothesis is that stereotypic behavior functions to cope with stressful environments, but the existing evidence is contradictory. To address the coping hypothesis of stereotypies, we triggered physiological reactions in 22 horses affected by stereotypic behavior (crib-biters) and 21 non-crib-biters (controls), using an ACTH challenge test. Following administration of an ACTH injection, we measured saliva cortisol every 30 min and heart rate (HR) continuously for a period of 3 h. We did not find any differences in HR or HR variability between the two groups, but crib-biters (Group CB) had significantly higher cortisol responses than controls (Group C; mean±SD: CB, 5. 84 ± 2. 62 ng/ml, C, 4. 76 ± 3. 04 ng/ml). Moreover, crib-biters that did not perform the stereotypic behavior during the 3 -hour test period (Group B) had significantly higher cortisol levels than controls, which was not the case of crib-biters showing stereotypic behavior (Group A) (B, 6. 44 ± 2. 38 ng/ml A, 5. 58 ± 2. 69 ng/ml). Our results suggest that <b>crib-biting</b> is a coping strategy that helps stereotypic individuals to reduce cortisol levels caused by stressful situations. We conclude that preventing stereotypic horses from <b>crib-biting</b> could be an inappropriate strategy to control this abnormal behavior, as it prevents individuals from coping with situations that they perceive as stressful...|$|E

40|$|Stereotypic {{behaviors}} are commonly observed in domestic equids {{as they are}} in a range of captive nondomesticated species. Estimates suggest that 19. 5 %- 32. 5 % of horses perform a stereotypy. The presence of these behaviors is thought to indicate suboptimal welfare status and can result in secondary physical pathologies, such as colic, ligament strain, and incisor wear. Relatively little is understood about the etiologies of oral and locomotor stereotypies. Seemingly disparate causal factors have been proposed, including gastric pathology, neural adaptation, and genetic predisposition. In this review, we propose a model of causality that presents separate pathways to the development and continuation of oral behaviors such as <b>crib-biting,</b> compared with locomotor alternatives (i. e., weaving). The word stereotypy has alarmingly negative connotation among horse keepers. Stereotypic {{behaviors are}} often viewed as vices, and therefore, a number of horse owners and establishments attempt to physically prevent the behavior with harsh mechanical devices.

40|$|There {{are strong}} {{suggestions}} that equine stereotypies are being connected to poor welfare and a sub-optimal management and/or stabling environment. Until today {{different forms of}} equine stereotypic behaviors have been described. <b>Crib-biting,</b> weaving, and box-walking are considered the most prevalent. Several {{studies have been conducted}} to establish links between the underlying causes and potential function of such behaviors. Both experimental and epidemiological studies have indicated management factors specifically feeding practices, housing conditions, and weaning method as crucial in the development of stereotypies in stabled horses. Some neurologic studies on equine stereotypy demonstrated some forms of CNS dysfunction as the causal factor for the performance of stereotypic behaviors. Different researchers hypothesized that the functional significance of stereotypies is that they reduce stress in captive environments and should thus be considered as a coping mechanism. In contrast, the owner‟s perspective is often that a stereotypic horse has a “stable-vice” that needs to be stopped and different kinds of methods have been developed to control or regulate stereotypic behaviors. However, if the stress-reducing hypothesis is correct, controlling stereotypic behaviors particularly by physical and surgical approaches without addressing the underlying causes is of great concern to the horse‟s welfare. Although there is ongoing uncertainty about the exact function, the growing knowledge about causation should be applied: under all circumstances prevention is better than cure...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the neural and behavioural features of environmentally and drug-induced stereotypy. For example, exposure to dopamine agonists, such as amphetamine, induces stereotypy and causes alterations in midbrain neurophysiology similar to those observed following chronic stress. An additional behavioural feature of these neural 29 changes in the drug-induced phenotype is an enhanced rate of switching from response-outcome (R-O) to stimulus-response (S-R) learning. The aim of the current experiment was to examine O and S-R learning in horses displaying environmentally-induced oral stereotypies. This was achieved by employing variations of a place-response paradigm. In Experiment 1, we found that <b>crib-biting</b> horses displayed ‘response’ learning after 20 -learning trials, whereas non-crib-biting controls tended to display ‘place’ learning throughout the experiment. In Experiment 2, we used {{a modified version of}} the place-response paradigm, where the subjects were introduced to the maze from different start points and forced always to turn the same way. We found that the crib biters acquired the task at a faster rate suggesting again that this group were displaying ‘response’ learning. Finally, in Experiment 3, we carried out an arena test to ensure that crib biters were capable of ‘place’ learning. These results are the first to show that horses displaying an oral stereotypy, a behavioural phenotype previously associated with stress-induced perturbations of the basal ganglia, preferentially use ‘response’ learning.

Case horses were recruited from 2 veterinary school clinics. Control horses were population based and matched by time of year. A number of risk factors were considered in the following areas: general carer and premises information; exercise information; husbandry information (housing- and pasture-related); feeding information; breeding information; behavioural information; travel information; preventive medicine information and previous medical information. All variables with a P value of < 0. 2 in the univariable analysis were considered for possible inclusion in a multivariable model.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of stereotypies in horses (Equus caballus) {{commonly referred to}} as ‘stable vices’ has been addressed by a range of different methods. None, however, has provided a ‘cure’ for these unwanted behaviours. This deficiency highlights the need to identify the underlying mechanisms and to treat the behaviours prophylactically; i. e. to address the causative agents using a preventative approach. There appears to be a higher incidence of stereotypical behaviours in the Thoroughbred (TB) than in other breeds of horse generally. One of the proffered explanations for this has been the very different management practices involved in producing and maintaining TB racehorses in a competitive market. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if there is a correlation between the feeding of creep feed/hard feed after weaning and the development of oral stereotypies in TB foals. The methodology included a self-administered questionnaire distributed to twenty-five Irish stud farms in counties Kildare and Meath. Following a response rate of 88 %, twenty-two responses were available, representing a cohort of six hundred and seventy three foals. With the exception of sixteen foals, all the remaining foals had access to some form of concentrated proprietary horse feed both before and after weaning. All of the foals were at least four months of age prior to weaning. All of the foals had access to grass paddocks post-weaning and they were brought in once daily for feeding and checking for a short period before returning to the field. Only three foals (0. 004 % of the test population) developed oral stereotypies and all three foals were on different farms.

40|$|Mammalian {{metabolism}} {{is known}} to be influenced by a number of physiological and environmental factors and the metabolic phenotype of an individual includes contributions from diet and the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal wellbeing is paramount for mammalian health and it is increasingly evident that intestinal bacteria have the ability to influence the development of an array of diseases. The horse is a hindgut fermenter- a sophisticated fermentation vat, housing a plethora of gut microbes that liberate energy from high cellulose diets. Investigating the horse will further enhance our knowledge of the symbiotic relationship between the mammalian host and its consortium of gut microbes. Plasma, urine and faecal biological matrices were explored using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify the dominant metabolites present in a healthy racehorse population. Multivariate statistics allowed differences in metabolic profiles to be analysed between horses and within individual horses. 106 metabolites were catalogued, providing a reference tool for ‘normal’ horse NMR data. Urine samples provided the highest percentage of gut microbial derived metabolites. 32 racehorses were subsequently longitudinally sampled to investigate sources of metabolic variation such as yard origin, exercise intensity and behavioural phenotype. Gut microbial co-metabolites; such as hippurate, quinate and p-cresol glucuronide were found to be significantly associated with a number of sources of variation. Equine oral stereotypical behaviour (EOS), abrupt dietary change and high-starch diets are risk factors for colic. Gut microbes can indirectly influence behaviour and it has been postulated that stereotypical abnormalities, such as autism and EOS could be related to changes in gut microbial composition and metabolism. Urinary quinate- a dietary and gut microbial co-metabolite was found to be significantly increased in horses that displayed <b>crib-biting</b> behaviour compared to matched controls. Metabolic profiles from biofluids of horses on a diet trial exploring 3 diets; a traditional high-starch racing diet; a high-fat alternative and a grass only diet highlighted significant differences in gut microbial metabolism. A grass only diet had the highest level of gut microbial co-metabolites such as hippurate in comparison to the other diets and the high-fat alternative was most similar to this ‘natural’ grass metabolome. Conversely, a high-starch diet was associated with higher faecal lactic acid levels, suggesting a shift in pH and therefore microbial environment. Open Acces...|$|E

The hypothesis of this study was that there is no association between the severity of gastric ulceration and the owners perception of clinical signs of gastric ulceration. To achieve statistical significance, the study included 100 horses. A gastroscopic examination was performed on all the horses and documented on video. Owners were then asked to fill in a questionnaire documenting the clinical signs exhibited by their horses in the 3 months prior to the examination. The ulcers where graded into four categories 1) presence or absence of gastric ulcers; 2) presence or absence of clinical significant gastric ulcers (i. e. needing treatment or not); 3) presence or absence of glandular ulcers; and 4) presence or absence of non-glandular ulcers. The four categories where compared to the clinical signs using a Pearson Chi-Square or Mann- Whitney U-test. Significance was set at p< 0. 05. A statistical association was found between clinical significant ulcers and losing weight (p= 0, 01) and between ulcer or no ulcer and losing weight (p= 0, 051). The results suggest that an owners perception of their horse losing weight could be {{associated with}} the presence of gastric ulcers and an increased severity of gastric ulcers, and can be used as an indication to perform gastroscopy on these individuals. There was no association between gastric ulcer severity and the owners perception of colic, <b>crib-biting,</b> flank- biting, fussy eating, changes in behaviour, chronic diarrhoea, bruxism, poor body condition, poor coat condition and poor performance, and requests from owners to have gastroscopy performed on their horses based upon these clinical signs should be approached with caution...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Crib-biting</b> and {{windsucking}} (CBWS) behaviour in horses {{has been}} associated with increased risk of colic in general, recurrence of colic and specific forms of colic. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of colic within a population of horses that display CBWS behaviour and to identify risk factors for colic. Methods: Owners/carers of horses in the general UK equine population that display CBWS behaviour were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based survey about the management and health of these horses. Data were obtained for a number of variables considered to be possible risk factors for colic. The prevalence of colic was calculated and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associations between horse- and management-level variables for two outcomes of interest: a history of colic ever and a history of colic in the previous 12 months. Results: Data were obtained for 367 horses. One or more episodes of colic had been observed in 130 horses (35. 4 %). A total of 672 colic episodes were reported and 13 colic episodes required surgical intervention in 12 horses. Where the horse/pony had been in that persons care over the previous 12 months (n= 331), colic had been observed in 67 horses (20. 2 %) during that time. A total of 126 colic episodes were reported in the preceding 12 months of which veterinary attendance was required in 69 (54. 8 %) episodes. Increased duration of ownership, increased duration of stabling in the Autumn months (September-November), crib-biting/windsucking behaviour associated with eating forage and horses that were fed haylage were associated with increased risk of colic (ever). Increasing severity (frequency) of CBWS behaviour and increased duration of stabling in the Autumn were associated with increased risk of colic in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: The prevalence of colic in a population of horses that display CBWS appeared to be relatively high. The results of this study can be used to identify horses that display CBWS who are at increased risk of colic and identifies areas for further research to determine if there are ways in which this risk might be reduced...|$|E
