5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in <b>cholestasis</b> (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
25|$|Estradiol has complex {{effects on}} the liver. It affects the {{production}} of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting. In high amounts, estradiol can lead to <b>cholestasis,</b> for instance <b>cholestasis</b> of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Pyritinol: A 1973 {{study found}} that large doses (several hundred times the {{recommended}} daily intake) of Pyritinol, a synthetic Vitamin B6 analog, can help to reduce hangover symptoms.

25|$|Plaa's primary area of {{research}} was hepatotoxicity, in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were {{in the areas of}} <b>cholestasis</b> and toxic potentiation, in particular potentiation by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of hepatotoxicity. A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human hepatotoxicity (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities in drugs) from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of <b>cholestasis.</b> According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in criminalistics.|$|E
25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} {{are unlikely to}} have chronic liver disease, however, if they suffer from congenital liver disorders, this fact increases the chance of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Specifically, children with biliary atresia, infantile <b>cholestasis,</b> glycogen-storage diseases, and other cirrhotic diseases of the liver are predisposed to developing HCC in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) can {{be caused}} by many {{cytotoxic}} drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, viral hepatitis, immunosuppression and nutritional deficiency. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, hepatic sinusoidal syndrome (obstruction of the veins in the liver), <b>cholestasis</b> (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and liver fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of ABC {{transporters}} {{have been}} characterized from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ABC genes {{are essential for}} many processes in the cell, and mutations in human genes cause or contribute to several human genetic diseases. Forty eight ABC genes {{have been reported in}} humans. Among these, many have been characterized and shown to be causally related to diseases present in humans such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, drug-resistant tumors, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Byler’s disease, progressive familiar intrahepatic <b>cholestasis,</b> X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia. ABC transporters are also involved in multiple drug resistance, and this is how some of them were first identified. When the ABC transport proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells, they can export anticancer drugs and render tumors resistant.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic <b>cholestasis,</b> Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
