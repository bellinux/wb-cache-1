5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian <b>Car</b> <b>Company,</b> had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian <b>Car</b> <b>Company</b> moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E

Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run.

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace <b>Car</b> <b>Company</b> organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike.
