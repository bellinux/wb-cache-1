40|$|Perceiving a body is {{a phenomenal}} <b>experience</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from <b>experiencing</b> a body as one's own body. Visual {{presentation}} of bodies or body parts recruits several occipitotemporal regions in the brain. Are these activations sufficient in order to change the phenomenal status of a body in one's own body? In this paper, I will review consolidated experimental evidence showing that the feeling of owning a body {{is not limited to}} the vision of a body, rather it is the result of a complex interaction between interoception, exteroception, and pre-existing body templates. To illustrate this complex interplay, I will take advantage of the so-called bodily illusions, referring to controlled illusory generation of unusual bodily feeling. These feelings include having a supernumerary limb, or lacking an arm, or feeling like you do not really have a body, or feeling that you do not really control a certain part of your body, or that your body is not really yours. In the last 15 years more than 150 empirical studies on body illusions have been published (Source: Pubmed, June 2014). These studies, using different technologies, are largely responsible for contributed our current understanding of bodily self-consciousness. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
30|$|In {{reference}} to the first two research questions, we {{found that people who}} combined teaching with another job experienced threatening situations less frequently and perceived these situations to be less stressful. Moreover, very few differences were found with regard to job similarity. In particular, individuals who combined teaching with a secondary job in a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> field <b>experienced</b> role-related challenges to be less frequent and less stressful than colleagues who held secondary jobs that were close to the taught field. These findings do not support the “role conflict” hypothesis of Zickar and colleagues (2004)—according to which if the primary and secondary jobs are very dissimilar, an employee is more likely to face role conflicts. On the contrary, we posit that being engaged in two dissimilar jobs might help individuals “take a step back” from problems encountered at school, as well as reduce their identity investments as teachers. The flip side of the coin is the negative effect such conditions may have on teachers’ sense of competence. Indeed, people who combine teaching with another job in a very different field reported the lowest levels of perceived competence as a teachers. In other words, although being involved in dissimilar jobs may support teachers emotionally, such dissimilarity might reduce individuals’ opportunities to reinforce the specific competences required for their two separate job fields. In consequence, teaching-specific knowledge and skill development may be reduced in favour of more heterogeneous competence profiles.|$|R
40|$|Em sua obra magna, O Mundo como Vontade e como Representação, Arthur Schopenhauer elabora sua Teoria da Representação como subdividida em duas considerações contrapostas: a representação que segue o fio condutor do princípio de razão, e aquela que independe deste princípio. Na perspectiva dessa divisão, o filósofo apresenta seu conceito de conhecimento, que da mesma maneira será subdivido em duas experiências completamente diferentes. É na explanação dos elementos constitutivos dessas duas concepções contrapostas de conhecimento que Schopenhauer se propôs a apresentar o significado do Mundo como Representação. Dessa maneira, nosso trabalho tem como objetivo {{principal}} apresentar a tensão inerente a essas duas concepções de conhecimento, e explorar por essa via os limites do conhecimento em geral. Como intenção metodológica, optamos por dividir a presente dissertação em três partes. A primeira corresponde ao momento da fundamentação do conceito de representação na perspectiva de uma epistemologia, onde tivemos o objetivo de apresentar o extenso arcabouço conceitual da teoria da representação de Schopenhauer. Na segunda parte adentramos na primeira concepção de conhecimento para o filósofo, onde exploramos os atributos característicos e os limites dessa concepção. Na terceira parte nos detivemos na segunda concepção de conhecimento, onde Schopenhauer tem como objetivo ultrapassar os limiares da primeira e apresentar uma forma de conhecimento inteiramente intuitiva e livre das amarras de uma racionalidade meramente instrumental. In {{his major}} work, The World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer elaborates his Representation Theory subdivided into two counterposed considerations: the representation {{that follows the}} guide line {{of the principle of}} sufficient reason, and that which independs of this principle. In the perspective of this division, the philosopher presents his concept of knowledge, that in the same manner will be subdivided into two <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>experiences.</b> It is in the explanation of the constitutive elements of these two counterposed conceptions of knowledge that Schopenhauer proposed himself to present significance of the World as Representation.

As a methodological intention, we choose to divide the present dissertation in three parts. The first correspond to the fundamentation moment of the representation concept in an epistemological perspective, where we had the objective of show the extensive conceptual structure of Schopenhauer s theory of representation. In the second part we entered in the philosopher s first conception of knowledge, where we explored this conception s characteristic atributes and limits.

The economic structure is measured with GDP and employment absorption shares composition by the economic sectors (agriculture, industry, and service). The direct impact of agricultural technology on the economic structure is evaluated with the supply side approach. The analysis is conducted with an econometric model using time series data of 1971 - 1991 period. The study shows that the pattern of Indonesian economic structural change is abnormal in the sense <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the <b>experience</b> of most developed countries. The economic structural change have been highly unbalanced, excessively burdened the agricultural sector with labor absorption. The study also shows that agricultural technology (measured with labor productivity) and real price are positively related with agricultural GDP share, but negatively related with the agricultural employment share. This explains why the directions of GDP shares is a contradictory with employment share. Accordingly the attempt to improve the pattern of economic structural change should be conducted with a multi sectoral policy package: increasing agricultural productivity and real price while increasing labor use intensity in the industrial sector...|$|R

40|$|HISTORY OF MUNCIE AND CURRENT SITE ISSUES This project {{looks at}} the {{problems}} with Muncie’s downtown and proposes a design that will revitalize it through urban parks. Muncie’s downtown began to see businesses leave during the 1970 s and 80 s, when Muncie had two major events that affected its downtown. First, Walnut Street was converted to a pedestrian mall, eliminating any automobile traffic along it and essentially killing the retail of the downtown. The second major event was {{the installation of the}} Muncie Mall on the north end of Muncie, which began to take businesses away from the downtown and out to the mall. In the 90 s to 2000 s, Muncie’s downtown began to slowly recovering from the devastation of the loss of businesses. However, as businesses began to move out in the 1990 s, their vacant buildings were replaced with parking lots. This has lead to an overabundance of parking lots in the downtown. Though Walnut has maintained its downtown style, the neighboring streets east and west of it, Mulberry and High, currently face mostly parking lots. Even though these streets are one block away, they have a <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> <b>experience</b> than Walnut. Most of these streets have poor sidewalk conditions and little destinations along them to get people to walk down them. As a result of this parking situation, most of the developmental land is tied up in privately owned parking lots, which means development only occurs when existing buildings become vacant. The other key issue is a lack of public spaces throughout the downtown. There are no places to gather or draw people to the downtown. Even if people were walking around downtown, there is little shade or seating provided anywhere outside of the buildings. DESIGN PHILOSPHY In order to solve these problems, a design philosophy was developed. After reviewing literature on the subject, an urban park was conceived as the solution towards the downtown’s problems. The idea behind this philosophy is that the park, people, and businesses are all connected in a cycle where they all benefit from the each other and if one is removed, it breaks the cycle. The cycle starts with the park providing activities and attractions for people. This will bring more people downtown to live and play. With more people living and visiting near the park, there will be a higher demand for goods and services to accommodate the increase of people. The businesses will realize the potential demand and move their retail near the park. The businesses, located next to the park, will help maintain it to keep people visiting it. DESIGN CONCEPT The main concept that followed this philosophy was incorporating multiple pocket parks connected along a pedestrian circulation system that looped throughout the downtown. These pocket parks form one larger linear park that becomes a landmark for the downtown. Although these parks are relatively close to each other, they are designed to each have a different style and character to them. Each park will provide different amenities to attract a diverse amount of users and give different opportunities for people downtown. These parks, connected to form one linear park, will attract people with its variety of amenities to the downtown and help revitalize the businesses. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. L.
