5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to memorise specific tasks. Elephants <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel has a {{friendly}} and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It {{is not a}} naturally aggressive dog, is eager to please and thus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has {{a high level of}} stamina and requires vigorous exercise.|$|E

5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{classification}} of vocalization type could potentially become {{a useful tool}} for acoustic the monitoring of captive colonies of highly vocal primates. However, for classification to be useful in practice, a reliable algorithm that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> successfully <b>trained</b> on small datasets is necessary. In this work, we consider seven different classification algorithms with the goal of finding a robust classifier that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> successfully <b>trained</b> on small datasets. We found good classification performance (accuracy > 0. 83 and F 1 -score > 0. 84) using the Optimum Path Forest classifier. Dataset and algorithms are made publicly available.

5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are {{trained by the}} United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{types are}} identical, {{regardless}} of civilization (though certain civilizations may have improved variations of these units). So, for example, a Korean Choson broad swordsman {{is identical to}} a Persian or Phoenician one, as are bowmen, axemen, short swordsmen, cavalry, and so forth. Some armors and clothes are historically inaccurate, with the long swordsman bearing more resemblance to a Roman praetorian. Some units were also available in the game to civilizations that never, historically, had them; hoplites <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> by every civilization except Persia, and some middle-Asian civilizations can train Legions and Centurions, while Japanese Yamato can build triremes.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published {{sources say that}} guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
5|$|The baggage camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|Mercenaries may aid {{the player}} in their campaigns in the New World. Mercenaries are not trained like {{standard}} units; instead {{they can be}} shipped from the Home City or hired from saloons for much coin, so that only economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively. Incidentally, along with hero/explorer units, Mercenaries were vulnerable to assassin units such as spies, agents and ninjas. In most cases, a selection of Native American tribes populate game maps, and support their own brand of military units that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> once an alliance has been formed. Some Native American military units use mêlée weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows or atl-atls, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock.|$|E

50|$|The Lupo Italiano is well {{adapted for}} work in a {{mountain}} environment, as an avalanche dog and as a rescue dog. It is resistant to adverse atmospheric conditions and bad weather. It is not affected by snow-glare. With its keen sense of smell, it is ideally suited to search for missing people or wounded animals. It therefore proves to be an ideal aid for park rangers, or game wardens. It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> as a police dog and possesses great physical strength and incredible agility. It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> as a flock guard to protect livestock.|$|R
50|$|Highly {{aggressive}} towards large predators, {{they are}} calm and well-tempered with people, although they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> good watchdogs and if encouraged will {{be protective against}} human intruders.

5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E
