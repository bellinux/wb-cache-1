His recent work explores scaling laws in systems that may seem very different, but are, in many ways, more similar than we have realized. Runtime: 97 : 16 minutesWhy do all companies and people die whereas cities keep growing and life continues to accelerate? Why do we stop growing, live on the order of 100 years and sleep 8 hours a day? And how are these related to innovation, wealth creation, social networks, urbanisation and global sustainability? Cities are the prime source of crime, pollution, disease, global warming, and energy and resource consumption but are also the hubs of innovation, wealth <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Despite being our greatest challenge, there is no integrated, quantitative, predictive science-based framework for understanding their dynamics, growth and organization.

40|$|This EuNaMus report studies how nations develop {{policy in}} order to deploy {{national}} museums in the redefinition of the national vision. Considering museums as utopian institutions, it focusses on the negotiations between politicians and museum professionals in Europe from 1990 - 2010. In-depth case studies are presented from France, Norway, Estonia, Hungary and Greece, {{in order to}} examine the broad range of change occurring throughout Europe. The report also examines the EU as a new actor in these museum negotiations. The findings indicate that museums have responded to differing circumstances using five broad policy making techniques to engage in national redefinition: re-formulation, re-narration, re-mediation, re-organisation and re-professionalization. The report suggests that national and transnational narratives coexist uneasily in national museums {{due in large part to}} three competing utopian visions articulated by Europe’s various policymakers: EUtopia, Multicultural Utopia, and National Historical Utopia. How museums can balance these visions is a key issue for these institutions in the years to come.

40|$|Studying the Dante Alighieri’s {{poetry is}} more {{important}} than studying only the medieval era and its literary representations; it is also to glimpse survival perspective, which is brought to us by ways that are not always very calm, being guided through rhizomes that organize and disorganize themselves around the author. Thus, thinking of this rhizome, on evolution of the book and of the world, the aim of this text is to view Dante as an idea originator. Giorgio Agamben is chosen as an interlocutor of the Florentine work, because he is a philosopher who shows his reflection in his most texts regarding medieval poetry work and it gives him the true light of contemporaneity that it seems to deserve.

This collection of papers brings together reflections on the nature and roles of history museums on a general level with reports from case studies in Brussels, Berlin, Warsaw and Paris. The cases dwell on the challenges and negotiations of collections, communities and citizenship that arise when polities create new museums. How to balance political and intellectual concerns?

This Open Access publication presents key findings of research undertaken by the Eunamus consortium in its attempts to understand the ‘museology of Europe’. This notion is used here to describe activities which are peculiar to museums and which result from {{the manner in which}} museums assemble and deploy objects. This idea {{can also be used to}} understand the museological aspects of the city, in which architecture, buildings, monuments, parks, piazzas and boulevards become curated objects. The museological aspect explored here also acts as a counterpoint to the narrative tradition in museums, explored elsewhere in the work of Eunamus. This research investigated the ways in which the city, online museum-like spaces, and national, regional and local museums produce opportunities for connecting identities. A study of national art museums and capital cities, for example, sought to understand how acts of nation making also produced a sense of Europe and of a shared European identity. This aim addressed a central purpose of Eunamus research: to understand how the portrayal of history in national museums could contribute to greater European social cohesion...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} visitor {{perspectives on}} {{what it means to}} be a national museum and relations between national museums and identities. Overall, visitors expect national museums to help them build national consciousness and collective identity, when it comes to nationals; and help them understand difference and similarity when it comes to non-nationals/visitors to the nation. The survey suggests that national museums, in order to “deserve” the name, need to present the complete story of the nation. In terms of identity, national identity is prioritized by most visitors as their primary identity. There are three categories of self-proclaimed “national identity”: a single national identity; a hybrid national identity (two or more heritage roots); and a trans-national identity, which places an emphasis on European, cosmopolitan ideals, universal humanity or the importance of the individual in determining identity. Often national identity is complemented with other identities: class, gender, education, origins of some sort. The findings suggest that national museums seem to be well located to express those ideas as well, since they provide historical models with which people can understand and identify themselves.

40|$|This is {{the summary}} policy {{report of the}} Eunamus project. Drawing {{together}} findings {{from all of the}} other project reports and conferences, it reflects upon the way histories are constructed and deployed in Europe’s national museums. It sets out to address two questions: In what ways do national museums, and the histories they display, contribute to social division and cohesion? How might national museums be a force for greater social cohesion in Europe in the future? The report discusses how national museums perform, interpret and narrate meaningful pasts and how these acts of communication are perceived by visitors and citizens. The report concludes with eight policy implications: National museums need to be autonomous creative institutions National museums need to understand and be open about their performances National museums need to overcome national constraints National museums need to develop and share tools for establishing bridge-building narratives National museums need to review their impact on perceptions of citizenship National museums need to reach new audiences Regional and local museums hold great potential for international bridge building National museums can act as forums for contested issues The three-year research programme, EuNaMus – European National Museums: Identity Politics, the Uses of the Past and the European Citizen, is coordinated at Tema Q at Linköping University (www. eunamus. eu).

40|$|ORDER AT THE CENTER: ARCHITECTURE AS AN ARBITRATOR OF CLASS AMONG THE ANCIENT MAYA Investigations into <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> uses of <b>power</b> {{have become}} a focus in anthropology, {{archaeology}} included (Earle 1997, Moore 1996, Montmolin 1988). With this knowledge, human networks are illuminated and {{a better understanding of}} organization and evolution of human society is realized. In archaeology, the temporal element and lack of observable behavior create a situation where we must fall back on the patterns of material remains to answer the questions of behavior. Among the Ancient Maya processes in the <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of <b>power</b> have been investigated using artifacts, settlement patterns, architecture, and agricultural symbolism. (Inomata 2006, Ashmore 2002, Ashmore 2 ̆ 6 Knapp 1999, McAnany 1995, Adams 2 ̆ 6 Jones 1981) In order to more fully explore this question, this thesis focuses on elements of architectural symbolism that I believe have been overlooked so far. Open courtyard space is a common theme in Mesoamerican domestic architecture, indeed in most architecture in tropical zones. This space was used as workspace, ritual focus, and place of gathering. I believe there is a process by which this common feature is appropriated for higher level purposes and this project explores possible avenues of the <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of <b>power</b> by elite lords, legitimizing their position in a hierarchy of unequal resource access through the use of common architectural forms. The thesis builds on an approach first used by Patricia McAnany in her 1995 publication; Living with the Ancestors: Kings and Kingship in Ancient Maya Society. One of the approaches McAnany employed was an appropriation of agricultural symbols by elites in their statements of lineage. Here I employ the McAnany model of <b>power</b> <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> apply it to architectural symbolism using ethnohistorical, linguistic, and archaeological evidence as lines of evidence to suggest the fact that this central focal space that began its existence as a household courtyard conceals another metaphor of space, the plaza as a representation of work area, linking <b>power</b> <b>and</b> ritual critical to rulership with the tasks required to maintain a household.. The ubiquitous nature of this courtyard feature served to create a powerful key symbol that was an advantage used by the elites in achieving their own goals. I believe this work will broaden the way in which power creation can be studied, models of micro-landscape are as critical to the creation of power as macro-landscapes. The addition of another tool into the interpretive framework will provide a fuller understanding of the evolution of hierarchal formation, advancing the aim of the discipline; the explanation of cultural change over time, or more simply, how we became who we are...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{knowledge}} about soils and their fertility {{from the perspective}} of different players, including both scientists and farmers. Different understandings of soils and their management are seen to be bound up with the contexts within which knowledges about soils are created—the networks of players engaged in building knowledge, the settings within which ideas about soils are tested and examined, and the wider assumptions and beliefs that different people carry with them. The contrasting, and sometimes overlapping, understanding of soils by farmers, scientists and development practitioners in Ethiopia is focused on. Drawing on a range of documentary material and detailed fieldwork carried out in Wolayta, southern Ethiopia, over a number of years, the paper argues that a focus on the contexts for the generation of different knowledges helps avoid the unhelpful distinctions often made between indigenous and scientific knowledges, and moves analytical attention towards an assessment of who is involved in knowledge <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> the <b>power</b> relations implied. The paper concludes with a discussion of how multiple knowledges about soils and their fertility might interact in the context of meeting agricultural development challenges and the potential for a productive engagement between different actors and networks. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{collection}} of conference papers examines the different narratives that museums have; {{since the beginning}} of the nineteenth century and up until the present day; developed as monuments to and of national histories. The aim has been to identify how narratives and their impact might have changed over time and more particularly how this can contribute to our understanding of how they might be changing today. The expression "great historical narratives" was chosen to avoid being tied down to the more ideologically specific defined notions "grand" and "master" narratives. Indeed; the perspective of these conferences was to consider the principles that have allowed the national museum to coherently present great histories in a literal sense – vast and spanning major chronological and geographical subjects. The collection places emphasis on the idea that narratives of the past are accounts based on the diversity of materials or factual sources used to illustrate them; constrained by conventions that bestow particular values or meaning upon them.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the findings from}} interviews and focus groups carried out at six European national museums with visitors and minority groups. It looks at the connections {{that can be made}} between national, European and minority identities and how these frame very different experiences of the national museum. Whilst visitors were, on the whole, convinced that national museums represented a shared, collective identity, the inclusion of minority groups in the research revealed a discernible dissonance between the majority of visitor’s views and the views of minority groups. Despite collectively forming a substantial section of the European population, minority experiences were largely absent from national museums, a situation that is rarely recognised by museum visitors. Personal and national identity was especially complex and important to minorities because they were constantly negotiating their relationship with the dominant culture, but the silence in national museums and lack of recognition of their contribution to national society only confirmed their status as “Other” when they wanted to belong. In response, this study calls on national museums to be more conscious of unheard voices and experiences, and be more actively aware that national and European identity is continually evolving, fluid and dynamic. The challenge for national museums is to embrace these elements and to become places of dialogue not didacticism, of exploration not certainty, and of inclusion not silence. National museums are valued as important and authoritative institutions by their visitors but they need to harness this authority more responsibly and proactively if they are to enhance national and European understanding.

Chapter 30:1-4, the [...] "sayings of Agur", introduces <b>creation,</b> divine <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> human ignorance.|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} a supply chain depend on each other and often work {{together}} for mutual benefits. Their working relationships are often asymmetrical both in <b>power</b> <b>and</b> trust. As the chain members constantly negotiate to create <b>and</b> distribute value, <b>power</b> <b>and</b> trust determine the outcomes of negotiation. However, {{little attention has been}} given to study factors of <b>power</b> <b>and</b> trust in relation to value <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> value appropriation. The aim of this paper is thus to examine the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> trust oriented interrelationships among chain members focusing on value <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> value appropriation. It contends that stronger members should consider more cooperative approaches based on trust for improving interaction mechanisms to achieve value <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> appropriation...|$|R

These tensions initially stem {{from the fact that}} the practices of western NGOs and development agencies have been criticised for their imperialist and colonial tendencies (Shiva 1989, Escobar 1995, Stirrat and Henkel 1997, Kothari 2005) while, at the same time western feminism has been critiqued assuming universalism of the experiences and needs of white western women (Lorde 1984, Hooks 1981, 1986, Carby 1992, Lazreg 2000). While feminism embraces a number of theories that disclose power relations, structures of oppression and "othering", it on the other hand [has] been attacked for perpetuating unequal power relations. Western feminists have been challenged to recognise that categories of gender, race, class and sexuality intersect in the <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of <b>power</b> relations. Furthermore, they were challenged to confront their own privileges...|$|R

Intergenerational poverty, the entrenchment of a class of very poor people, is a major sub set of that problem and is tied very closely {{to the issue of}} race. The author claims that missing in the fight by the poor and their allies against {{stratified}} poverty is the <b>creation</b> <b>and</b> utilization of <b>power.</b> This paper examines the disparate ways in which commentators have defined power. It suggests that those seeking to obtain power must understand the concept’s varying meanings and direct their activities to meet their own understanding of the concept. Community Economic Development (CED) may be nothing more than a re-affirmation of existing power relationships or it may be the cause and the result of a change in those relationships. This paper attempts to make sense of this apparent paradox...|$|R
