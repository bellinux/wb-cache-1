5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in the slums, experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and <b>Child</b> <b>Poverty</b> Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} families will fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party.

30|$|Overall, {{it seems}} likely that {{universal}} programs would reach a much larger portion of the disadvantaged population. Despite a long history, public programs in the United States still fail to enroll most <b>children</b> in <b>poverty</b> at age four. The United States is even farther away from the goal of serving all <b>children</b> in <b>poverty</b> at age three. Recent efforts to expand the federal Head Start program have focused on children under three, neglecting the program’s failure to enroll most of the population for which it was originally designed. This failure raises questions about how many eligible families do not want to enroll in the program, the difficulty Head Start may have identifying the rest of the eligible population, and the lack of political will to serve all <b>children</b> in <b>poverty.</b>|$|R
