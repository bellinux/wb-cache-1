50|$|The Radiometric {{calibration}} of {{the instrument}} is traceable to Synchrotron source standards, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Its stability will be monitored by onboard <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> sources (light-emitting diodes), which allow distinguishing between potential degradations of the detectors and filters. Additionally, a redundancy strategy contributes to the accuracy and {{the stability of the}} measurements. LYRA will benefit from wide bandgap detectors based on diamond: {{it will be the first}} space assessment of a pioneering UV detectors program. Diamond sensors make the instruments radiation-hard and solar-blind: their high bandgap energy makes them quasi-insensitive to visible light (see also references in Marchywka Effect). The SWAP extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging telescope will operate next to LYRA on Proba-2. Together, they will establish a high performance solar monitor for operational space weather nowcasting and research. LYRA demonstrates technologies important for future missions such as the ESA Solar Orbiter mission.|$|E

A laser beam is split by a polarizing beam splitter {{to generate a}} <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> beam. The calibration beam firstly passes through a PEM and then is reflected by the rear surface of the PEM. The reflected light beam is analysed by the polarizing beam splitter and detected by a photodetector. The second harmonic component of the detected signal is extracted and used to calibrate the retardation amplitude at 2. 568000 radians. Because the second Bessel function J(2) (5. 136) of the detected signal is zero, the calibration process is immune to the light intensity fluctuation which {{may be caused by}} laser source or ambient light. A PEM has been successfully calibrated with an uncertainty of 0. 006280 radians (0. 0001 of the wavelength,lambda) by the proposed method. The <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> passes through the PEM twice, so the calibration accuracy is two times higher than the typical second Bessel function zero method.

The methods applied were current state-of-the-art GPC with RI, MALLS, and viscosimetry detectors. Different dissolution protocols were compared as well. Following from the obtained results, more standardized protocols were proposed for approaches with different equipment (RI or MALLS/RI) and solvent systems (direct dissolution or derivatization).

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) technology have made UAVs an attractive possibility as an airborne calibration platform for astronomical facilities. This {{is especially true for}} arrays of telescopes spread over a large area such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this paper, the feasibility of using UAVs to calibrate CTA is investigated. Assuming a UAV at 1 km altitude above CTA, operating on astronomically clear nights with stratified, low atmospheric dust content, appropriate thermal protection for the <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> source and an onboard photodiode to monitor its absolute light intensity, inter-calibration of CTA’s telescopes of the same size class is found to be achievable with a 6 − 8 % uncertainty. For cross-calibration of different telescope size classes, a systematic uncertainty of 8 − 10 % is found to be achievable. Importantly, equipping the UAV with a multi-wavelength <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> source affords us the ability to monitor the wavelength-dependent degradation of CTA telescopes’ optical system, allowing us to not only maintain this 6 − 10 % uncertainty after {{the first few years of}} telescope deployment, but also to accurately account for the effect of multi-wavelength degradation on the cross-calibration of CTA by other techniques, namely with images of air showers and local muons. A UAV-based system thus provides CTA with several independent and complementary methods of cross-calibrating the optical throughput of individual telescopes. Furthermore, housing environmental sensors on the UAV system allows us to not only minimise the systematic uncertainty associated with the atmospheric transmission of the calibration signal, it also allows us to map the dust content above CTA as well as monitor the temperature, humidity and pressure profiles of the first kilometre of atmosphere above CTA with each UAV flight...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{essential}} prerequisites for detection of Earth-like extra-solar planets or direct measurements of the cosmological expansion is the accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers. It has already been realized that {{the large number of}} exactly known optical frequencies provided by laser frequency combs ('astrocombs') can significantly surpass conventionally used hollow-cathode lamps as <b>calibration</b> <b>light</b> sources. A remaining challenge, however, is generation of frequency combs with lines resolvable by astronomical spectrometers. Here we demonstrate an astrocomb generated via soliton formation in an on-chip microphotonic resonator ('microresonator') with a resolvable line spacing of 23. 7 GHz. This comb is providing wavelength calibration on the 10 cm/s radial velocity level on the GIANO-B high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer. As such, microresonator frequency combs have the potential of providing broadband wavelength calibration for the next-generation of astronomical instruments in planet-hunting and cosmological research...|$|E

We have proposed and experimentally tested a fast and fully automated approach for determining the number of atomic planes in graphene samples.

It is based on an original image processing algorithm, which utilizes micro-Raman <b>calibration,</b> <b>light</b> background subtraction, lighting non-uniformity correction, and the color and grayscale image processing for each pixel. The outcome of the developed procedure is a pseudo-color map, which marks the single-layer and few-layer graphene regions on the substrate of any size that can be captured by an optical microscope.

This enables the interaction between deformable mirror and wavefront sensor to be calibrated at any time, greatly enhancing the possibilities and time available for engineering on the installed system.
