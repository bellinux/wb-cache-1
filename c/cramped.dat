30|$|Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more}} likely to have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the event than those without <b>cramping.</b> Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in {{supplements}} and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|The key {{findings}} of this study are that (1) <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> were common in this 161 -km ultramarathon; (2) the most commonly involved muscles were the calf, quadriceps, and hamstrings; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{were more likely to have}} a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the race than those without cramping; and (4) hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration did not differ between those with <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the <b>cramped</b> housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, <b>cramped</b> and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon were distinguished from those without <b>cramping</b> by more commonly having a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and having higher post-race blood CK and BUN concentrations. A prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> {{has previously been}} found to be a characteristic of those developing <b>cramping</b> during endurance events [5, 6], so this finding is not surprising. However, as far as we are aware, higher blood CK and BUN concentrations among those with <b>cramping</b> are new findings. While numerous factors account for variability in post-race blood CK concentrations, our interpretation of the finding that those with <b>cramping</b> had a higher blood CK relates to an association of muscle injury with relative exercise demand. In other words, we presume that the higher CK concentrations indicate that the group with <b>cramping</b> was placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training than those without <b>cramping.</b> This provides additional support to the prior observation that those developing muscle <b>cramping</b> are racing at a relatively higher intensity than those without <b>cramping</b> [5, 6, 14] and that <b>cramping</b> in this environment may be due to muscle overload and fatigue rather than a fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance.|$|R
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{also asked}} {{whether or not}} the runner had experienced muscle <b>cramping</b> during prior ultramarathons and if they had had muscle <b>cramping</b> during this event, with answer options of yes, no, and “almost, but was able to control any full-blown cramping” (subsequently referred to as “near cramping”). The answer option of near <b>cramping</b> was included because we are aware that runners sometimes sense impending muscle <b>cramping</b> that can be aborted with various interventions, such as altering gait pattern. Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> were asked which muscle groups were involved and in which of the four course segments they experienced the <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|From this work, we {{conclude}} that muscle <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> are common in a 161 -km ultramarathon, largely involve the most active muscles, and tend to occur after the early segment of the race. Compared with those not having <b>cramping,</b> those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more likely to}} have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon, and evidence suggests that they are placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training. Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b> Of the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> the present findings support a muscle fatigue basis for muscle <b>cramping</b> during ultra-endurance exercise over the theory based on hyperexcitability of motor neuron axon terminals due to an electrolyte or fluid imbalance.|$|R
5|$|A British Transport Police {{police station}} was based at Waterloo by the Victory Arch, with a custody suite of three cells.

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more <b>cramped</b> and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

30|$|Prior {{studies of}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{associated}} with endurance activities up to ~ 18  h {{have shown a}} higher likelihood of <b>cramping</b> among those with a prior history of <b>cramping</b> [5, 6] and those racing at a relatively higher intensity [5, 6, 14]. Muscle <b>cramping</b> has not been related to serum sodium concentration [5, 15 – 17]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to learn about muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon lasting up to 30  h, including the prevalence, muscle groups involved, distance at which <b>cramping</b> tends to occur, characteristics of those who have muscle <b>cramping,</b> and whether muscle <b>cramping</b> is related to weight change, sodium supplementation, post-race serum sodium, or extent of muscle injury as defined by serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. It was anticipated that this new information would offer additional insight into the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment. Based on prior findings from endurance events [2 – 6, 8, 15 – 18], we hypothesized that muscle <b>cramping</b> would be common and more likely among those with a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> and is unrelated to hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, or post-race serum sodium concentration.|$|R
30|$|The present {{findings}} offer {{some insight into}} the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping.</b> Key findings in this regard were that (1) the <b>cramping</b> involved muscle groups under high demand during the activity; (2) <b>cramping</b> appeared most prevalent, though not statistically different, after the early portion of the race; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> had higher blood CK concentrations than those without cramping; and (4) <b>cramping</b> was not related to serum sodium concentration or hydration status. Considering the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> these findings seem most consistent with muscle fatigue as an underlying mechanism for muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment rather than an electrolyte or fluid balance issue.|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} {{eighteen}} subjects, out of 250 individuals {{taken from a}} general practice register, returned completed questionnaires giving details about rest <b>cramps,</b> and a further 15 were contacted by telephone. The overall prevalence of rest <b>cramps</b> in the survey population was 37 %. The symptom was more prevalent in older subjects. Rest <b>cramps</b> were most commonly experienced in {{the muscles of the}} leg, in 83 % of the 86 <b>cramp</b> sufferers. Symptoms were usually present at night (73 %). On average <b>cramp</b> episodes lasted for 9 min (95 %CI 6. 7 - 11. 2). Most <b>cramps</b> sufferers experienced symptoms infrequently, but 40 % had <b>cramp</b> episodes more than three times per week and 6 % complained of at least one episode per day or night. Twenty-one per cent of <b>cramp</b> sufferers described their symptoms as very distressing. A minority, 32 % of the 86 <b>cramp</b> sufferers, had reported the symptoms to a general practitioner although the 86 subjects self-rated their health more negatively than the individuals without muscle <b>cramps.</b> There was a significant, positive association between rest <b>cramps</b> and symptoms of angina or intermittent claudication although these two factors only accounted for 12 % of the variance, suggesting that peripheral vascular disease may play a relevant but limited role in the aetiology of rest <b>cramps...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese.

5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. <b>Cramped</b> conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E

40|$|The {{records of}} 2527 healthy {{children}} seen in an ambulatory care clinic were evaluated for nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> {{in the preceding}} 12 months, frequency and duration of the <b>cramps,</b> whether the <b>cramps</b> affected one leg or both legs at a time, whether there was associated muscle <b>cramps</b> in feet, whether the <b>cramps</b> occurred when the child was awake or asleep, and whether there was residual tenderness in the affected muscles. Nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> were present in 185 children for an overall incidence of 7. 3 %. Leg <b>cramps</b> were noted only in children aged > or = 8 years. The incidence increased at 12 years and peaked at 16 to 18 years of age. A majority (81. 6 %) of the affected children had nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> 1 to 4 times per year. The mean duration of episodes was 1. 7 minutes. Leg <b>cramps</b> were unilateral in 98. 9 % of cases and the ipsilateral foot also was involved in 18. 9 % of cases. One hundred thirty-five (73 %) children had leg <b>cramps</b> while asleep, and the remaining 23 (12. 4 %) children had leg <b>cramps</b> in either state. Fifty-seven (30. 8 %) children had residual tenderness in the affected muscles. The mean duration of residual tenderness was 33. 2 minutes (range: 2 minutes- 1 day). We conclude that nocturnal leg <b>cramps</b> are common in children aged > 12 years. A majority of the affected children have leg <b>cramps</b> 1 to 4 times per year. The <b>cramps</b> are usually unilateral and occur when the children are asleep. Normal duration of the leg <b>cramp</b> is < 2 minutes.

40|$|Background: Night-time calf <b>cramping</b> affects {{approximately}} 1 in 3 adults. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the experience of night-time calf cramp; if and where people seek treatment advice; and perceived treatment effectiveness. Methods: 80 adults who experienced night-time calf <b>cramp</b> at least once per week were recruited from the Hunter region, NSW, Australia through newspaper, radio and television advertisements. All participants completed a pilot-tested survey about muscle <b>cramp.</b> Quantitative data were analysed with independent-sample t-tests, Chi square tests and Fisher’s tests. Qualitative data were transcribed and sorted into categories to identify themes. Results: Median recalled age of first night-time calf <b>cramp</b> was 50 years. Most participants recalled being awoken from sleep by <b>cramping,</b> and experiencing <b>cramping</b> of either calf muscle, calf-muscle soreness in the days following <b>cramp</b> and <b>cramping</b> during day-time. Despite current therapies, mean usual pain intensity was 66 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Participants described their <b>cramps</b> as being ‘unbearable’, ‘unmanageable’ and ‘cruel’. One participant stated that ‘sometimes I just wish I could cut my legs open’ and another reported ‘getting about 2 h sleep a night due to cramps’. Most participants had sought advice about their night-time calf <b>cramps</b> from a health professional. Participants identified 49 different interventions used to prevent night-time calf <b>cramp.</b> Of all treatment ratings, 68 % described the intervention used to prevent <b>cramp</b> as being ‘useless’ or of ‘a little help’. Of 14 participants who provided additional information regarding their use of quinine, eight had a current prescription of quinine for muscle <b>cramp</b> at the time of the survey. None had been asked by their prescribing doctor to stop using quinine. Conclusion: Night time calf <b>cramps</b> typically woke sufferers from sleep, affected either leg and caused ongoing pain. Most participants experienced little or no relief with current therapies used to prevent muscle <b>cramp.</b> Most people who were taking quinine for muscle <b>cramp</b> were unaware that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration withdrew support of quinine for muscle <b>cramp</b> in 2004 due to the risk of thrombocytopaenia. Case-control studies are required to identify therapeutic targets so that clinical trials can evaluate safe interventions to prevent recurrent <b>cramp...</b>|$|R

30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon {{did not have}} a statistically different post-race serum sodium compared with those without <b>cramping,</b> but the statistical effect was close to significant (p[*]=[*] 0.055). To further investigate whether a low serum sodium (below the reference range for normal of 135 – 145  mmol/L) might be linked to a higher incidence of <b>cramping,</b> we performed additional analyses. The serum sodium concentration among those with <b>cramping,</b> near <b>cramping,</b> and no <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race was compared and found to not be different. We also compared the proportion of runners with serum sodium concentrations below normal among those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race and found no difference between groups. These analyses were performed under the presumption that the serum sodium concentration at the finish would relate best to any symptoms during the final segment of the race. Given the findings from these analyses, we conclude that <b>cramping</b> is not related to serum sodium concentration in this environment, a conclusion that supports prior studies of runners and triathletes [5, 15 – 17].|$|R
