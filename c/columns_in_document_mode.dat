40|$|The {{important}} pre-requisites <b>in</b> <b>document</b> {{layout analysis}} are identifying number of text lines, number of columns and segmentation of textual and non-textual regions. The literature reveals two major procedures viz. global and local approaches used for extraction of text lines. The examples of global approaches are projection profile and Hough transform, which have serious problem with multicolumn layouts. The local approach is connected component linking which consume lot of computational time, or requires complete page layout analysis as input {{prior to the}} reliable identification of text lines. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient method for segmentation and identification of number of text lines based on image dilation and region labeling for a machine printed binary document image containing text or/and non-text, single or multi-column layouts. The proposed method segments the individual text lines present <b>in</b> the <b>document,</b> reports the number of <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> the <b>documents,</b> detects and segments the number of nontextual regions present <b>in</b> the given <b>document</b> image. The flexibility of this method further permit’s to work on text line features, which are invariably used in the later phase of image analysis for higher level interpretation and matching. The experimental results are encouraging and indicate that better accuracy could be achieved by using this method. 1...|$|R

In Database mode, the programmer can quickly implement a printing solution, for example a billing application, for a delimited database file. In Line mode, an existing print application can be enhanced with form overlays, font selection, color and other features offered by modern laser printers. In XML mode, an XML file can be turned into a readable <b>document.</b> <b>In</b> all <b>modes,</b> VIPP offers conditional logic manipulation of the data.|$|R

To produce new knowledge, predicate logic is used and applied to the ontological model of the representation of monographs, in order to establish dynamic and reliable inferences or to make changes in situations where required...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} services of cloud computing is Cloud storage service. Huge amount of sensitive data is stored in the cloud for easy remote access and to reduce the cost of storage. The confidential data is encrypt before uploading to the cloud server in order to maintain privacy and security. All conventional searchable symmetric encryption(SSE) schemes enable the users to search on the entire index file. In this paper, we propose the Domain and Range Specific Index Generation(DRSIG) scheme that minimizes the Index Generation time. This scheme adopts collection sort technique to split the index file into D Domains and R Ranges. The Domain is based on the length of the keyword; the Range splits within the domain based on the first letter of the keyword. A mathematical model is used to encrypt the indexed keyword that eliminates the information leakage. The time complexity of the index generation is O(NT × 3) where NT - Number of rows <b>in</b> index <b>document</b> and 3 is Number of <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> index <b>document.</b> Experiments have been conducted on real world dataset to validate proposed DRSIG scheme. It is observed that DRSIG scheme is efficient and provide more secure data than Ranked Searchable Symmetric Encryption(RSSE) Scheme...|$|R

Many recognition systems have been developed for languages based on various scripts and digits all over the world, taking input in either of the online and offline modes, with considerable efficiencies. These systems have proved to be highly applicable in the fields of Banking, Education, IT systems and Postal Sector for digitization of processes and automated information retrieval.
