5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Saran {{acted in}} the Hindi film Mission Istaanbul with Zayed Khan, Vivek Oberoi and Shabbir Ahluwalia in 2008. She played the {{character}} of Anjali Sagar which was inspired by {{the character of}} Romila Dutta played by Preity Zinta in the film Lakshya, a journalist who desires to have a child with her husband, which leads to their separation, since he is reluctant. Bollywood Hungama <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> that her character was wasted, as again she gets very little screen time. However, she did pick up the Stardust Exciting New Face Award.|$|E

5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and the fastest-selling U.S. album of 1995. It has since been ranked among {{the best and most}} {{important}} recordings produced during the rock and roll era. Media outlets have since ranked the recording among the best posthumous releases. When Dreaming of You peaked at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> the general population of the U.S. would not have known about Tejano or Latin music {{had it not been for}} Dreaming of You. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 35×platinum (Latin field), for shipping 3.5 million units in the U.S. The album was eventually certified gold by Music Canada and by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). As of January 2015, the album has sold five million copies worldwide, and remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>critic</b> <b>said</b> [...] "the {{production}} {{was one of}} exceptional excellence. For clever acting, extensive staging, daring effects and quality of photography, the film stands as a masterpiece." ...|$|R

5|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{continued}} to be dogged by controversy about not holding {{a referendum on the}} EU Treaty of Lisbon. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband stood in for Brown at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty, which was attended by all other European heads of government. At the time, Brown was appearing before the Liaison Committee; he went to Portugal to sign the treaty that afternoon. Brown was criticised by opponents {{on both sides of the}} House and in the press. His <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> that neither Brown nor Labour had a mandate to ratify the treaty without public consent. Conservative leader David Cameron pointed to Labour's 2005 manifesto, which had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
25|$|After an {{independent}} {{investigation by the}} governor’s office, he was later ordered to pay back more than $25,000 of $44,000 to the state. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> {{he should have been}} fired, as he conducted the personal travel with intent.|$|E

5000|$|The {{production}} {{had mixed}} reviews from <b>critics.</b> Mel Gusso <b>said</b> for The New York Times, [...] "It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing." [...] Another <b>critic</b> <b>said</b> {{the play was}} [...] "a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain" [...] and that it contained [...] "a cornucopia of cliches".|$|R
25|$|While never a {{religious}} man, he donated 10 acres of his lakefront property in Chicago, worth $50,000, {{to a small}} new Baptist college, the first University of Chicago. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> {{that he wanted to}} enhance the value of his adjoining lots.|$|E
25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as an endorsement of Islam.|$|E
25|$|Considering Padilla {{was held}} for years in {{military}} custody with no formal charges, many observers were shocked by the charges finally brought by the Bush presidential administration. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> such a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the cause that would eventually be tried.|$|E

In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament.

25|$|Early stories {{following}} the shootings charged that school {{administrators and teachers}} at Columbine had long condoned a climate of bullying by the so-called jocks or athletes, allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and resentment to fester. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> this could have contributed to triggering the perpetrators' extreme violence. Reportedly, homophobic remarks were directed at Klebold and Harris.|$|E
25|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> {{that voters}} who favor a {{developed}} {{version of the}} current status of Puerto Rico (a commonwealth {{which is part of the}} United States with internal self-government) had no alternatives on the ballot. As a result, leaders of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) instructed such voters to leave the second portion of the ballot blank, or to invalidate the ballot.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted {{unanimously}} {{for independence from}} the United States. In 1917, the US Congress passed an act by which it granted citizenship to Puerto Rican residents, although this was overwhelmingly opposed by the island's political leaders. <b>Critics</b> <b>said</b> the US was simply interested in increasing {{the size of its}} conscription pool for soldiers for World War I.|$|E
25|$|Allen led {{his city}} {{during a time}} of {{transition}} and racial moderation. The city population grew, particularly the mostly white outlying residential areas. And new industry came to Shreveport, but <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> it was never sufficient to provide jobs for all who sought work. In time, blacks became the majority of Shreveport's population and a political force of immense proportions within the municipality. Caddo Parish, as a whole, however, remained majority white.|$|E
25|$|Austin {{was headed}} for {{re-election}} to the State House in 1980 but chose instead {{to run for the}} State Senate against an 18-year incumbent Edward Zemprelli, who was also the State Senate Majority Leader. Austin charged that Zemprelli had been in office too long and had not done enough for the district. His <b>critics</b> <b>said</b> Austin had only served one-term in the State House and should wait before trying to go too far too fast politically.|$|E
