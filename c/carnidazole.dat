40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{treating}} 152 women with <b>carnidazole,</b> a new trichomonacidal drug. They {{were divided into two}} groups. The first comprised 91 patients who were treated with 2 g, while the second group comprised 61 patients who were treated with 1 - 5 g <b>carnidazole</b> in a single oral dose. Defaulter rates were 6 - 6 % for the first group and 13 - 1 % for the second. Of the remaining 85 patients in the first group, 76 (89 - 5 %) were negative at the first follow-up one to three weeks after treatment, three (3 - 5 %) were considered to be treatment failures, and six (7 - 0 %) were considered to be reinfected. Of 53 women treated with 1 - 5 g, 39 (73 - 6 %) were negative at first follow-up, eight (15 - 1 %) were considered to be treatment failures, and six (11 - 3 %) were considered to be reinfected. The difference between the number of patients cured in both groups is statistically significant.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of <b>carnidazole</b> form II, O-methyl [2 -(2 -methyl- 5 -nitro- 1 H-imidazole- 1 -yl) ethyl]thiocarbamate, {{has been determined}} using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction in combination with simulated annealing and whole profile pattern matching, and refined by the Rietveld method. For structure solution, 12 degrees of freedom were defined: one motion group and six torsions. Form II crystallizes in space group P 2 (1) /n, Z= 4, with unit cell parameters after Rietveld refinement: a= 13. 915 (4), b= 8. 095 (2), c= 10. 649 (3) A, beta= 110. 83 (1) degrees, and V= 1121. 1 (5) A 3. The two polymorphic forms, {{as well as the}} hydrate, crystallize in the monoclinic space group P 2 (1) /n having four molecules in the cell. In form II, the molecules are held together by forming two infinite zig-zag chains via hydrogen bonds of the type N [...] H [...] . N, the same pattern as in form I. A conformational study of <b>carnidazole,</b> at semiempirical PM 3 level, was performed using stochastic approaches based on modification of the flexible torsion angles. The values of the torsion angles for the molecules of the two polymorphic forms and the hydrate of <b>carnidazole</b> are compared to those obtained from the conformational search. Form I and form II are enantiotropic polymorphic pairs this agrees {{with the fact that the}} two forms are conformational polymorphs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of hydrated and anhydrous <b>carnidazole</b> {{have been}} subjected to X-irradiation at 77 K and studied by EPR. The determination of the EPR tensors shows that NO 2, sulfur-centered radicals as well as a radical pair can be generated from this molecule; it appears that the species trapped at 77 K are not the same in the hydrated and in the anhydrous crystal.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{reports the}} results of {{treating}} 152 women with <b>carnidazole,</b> a new tricho-monacidal drug. They {{were divided into two}} groups. The first comprised 91 patients who were treated with 2 g, while the second group comprised 61 patients who were treated with 1 P 5 g carni-dazole in a single oral dose. Defaulter rates were 6 - 6 % for the first group and 13 - 1 % for the second. Of the remaining 85 patients in the first group, 76 (89. 5 %) were negative at the first follow-up one to three weeks after treatment, three (3. 5 %) were considered to be treatment failures, and six (7 0 Y.) were considered to be reinfected. Of 53 women treated with 1 - 5 g, 39 (73. 6 %) were negative at first follow-up, eight (15. 1 %) were considered to be treatment failures, and six (11. 3 %) were considered to be reinfected.

40|$|The indexed powder {{diffraction}} pattern and related crystallographic data for polymorphic form 2 of <b>carnidazole</b> (C 8 H 12 N 4 O 3 S) are reported, {{as a first step}} in the structure determination by powder diffraction methods. The unit cell dimensions were determined from high resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data (lambda= 0. 079 998 0 nm) and evaluated by indexing programs. The monoclinic cell found for this polymorph is a= 1. 3908 (2) nm, b= 08094 (2) nm, c= 1. 0645 (2) nm, beta= 110. 82 (2) degrees, V= 1. 12015 (27) nm(3), Z= 4, Dx= 1. 445 Mg/m(3).

40|$|Tube-dilution MICs {{of seven}} 2 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole {{compounds}} varying at the 1 -substitution were determined against Bacteroides fragilis. Activities on a molar basis were ranked: tinidazole greater than panidazole {{greater than or}}nidazole greater than metronidazole {{greater than or equal}} to secnidazole greater than <b>carnidazole</b> greater than dimetridazole. Geometric mean MICs varied from 0. 5 to 6. 6 microM, and MICs against individual strains varied up to 50 -fold between compounds. In general, the MIC of each drug correlated with that of each of the other drugs, but with tinidazole the correlation coefficients tended to be small and were not significant versus metronidazole and secnidazole. MICs against 14 other bacteria of the B. fragilis group, including B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus, were within the range determined for B. fragilis...|$|E
40|$|Trichomonas gallinae, {{the cause}} of avian trichomonosis, is most {{commonly}} found in the order Columbiformes. Racing pigeons are often treated preventively with nitro-imidazoles which {{could result in the}} emergence of resistant isolates, and these isolates can be a treath to wildlife when exchanges occur. The sequence type of 16 T. gallinae isolates obtained from racing pigeons and 15 isolates from wild pigeons was determined based on the ITS 1 / 5. 8 S rRNA/ITS 2 region sequence. In addition, the resistance profiles of these isolates against five different nitro-imidazoles (metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, tinidazole and <b>carnidazole)</b> were determined. Two different Trichomonas sequence types were isolated. Sequence type A isolates were recovered from racing and wild pigeons, in contrast to sequence type B which was only isolated from wild pigeons. Isolates with sequence type B were all susceptible to the tested nitro-imidazoles, except for tinidazole-resistance in 3 isolates. Resistance to the nitro-imidazoles was observed more frequently in isolates obtained from racing pigeons than from wild pigeons, with most isolates belonging to sequence type A. A higher percentage of the sequence type A isolated from racing pigeons, in comparison with those isolated from the wild pigeons, were resistant to the nitro-imidazoles and displayed higher mean lethal concentration (MLC) values. Two isolates belonging to sequence type A, 1 recovered from a racing pigeon and 1 from a wild pigeon, displayed a similar resistance pattern, suggesting a potential exchange of resistant isolates between racing pigeons and wild pigeons...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for <b>carnidazole,</b> ornidazole, ternidazole, tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this substance group and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CC) and detection capabilities (CC) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 μg L- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 μg L- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 μg kg- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 μg kg- 1 respectively in honey. For chloramphenicol the values are 0. 07 and 0. 11 μg L- 1 in milk and 0. 08 and 0. 13 μg kg- 1 in honey. Validation criteria of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes in both matrices...|$|E
