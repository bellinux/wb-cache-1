2500|$|The M3 {{operating}} sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked {{to the rear}} using the cocking handle located {{on the right side}} of the ejector housing. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the recoil springs, stripping a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer,</b> igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the recoil springs and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the [...]45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and recoil springs with a lighter-than-normal compression rate.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1880s the Benet (inside) <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> was retired {{and the modern}} Boxer type (externally visible) primer was adopted for all future {{military}} production of revolver ammunition.|$|E
50|$|A hammer {{block is}} similar to a firing pin block. It is a latch, block or other {{obstruction}} built into the action and normally positioned to prevent the hammer contacting the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> or firing pin when at rest. Similar to the firing pin block, the obstruction to the hammer's travel is removed as a consequence of pulling the trigger. This allows the hammer to contact the primer or firing pin only when the trigger is pulled.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, pistol dueling became popular as a sport in France. The duelists were armed with {{conventional}} pistols, but the cartridges had wax bullets and were without any powder charge; the bullet was propelled {{only by the}} explosion of the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{the firing}} pin has its own safety, which makes sure that the pin will not move forward. That is, until the trigger is pulled, at which time the safety is removed and the pin is pushed forward to meet the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer.</b> This third safety is also the gun's drop safety. Even when dropped from a {{reasonable}} height, with a round in the chamber, the gun will not fire.|$|R

50|$|Some {{very early}} {{blowback}} pistols used ammunition with no rim or extractor groove on the cartridge cases (e.g., 5mm Bergmann), and such pistols therefore lacked extractors. The spent case {{was forced out}} of the chamber by recoil, and was subsequently ejected. As this system did not provide for easy clearance of misfires, it was not very successful, especially for self-defense handguns needing to be cleared quickly and reloaded {{in the event of a}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> malfunction. Nonetheless, there are examples of contemporary modern semi-automatic pistols that do not have extractors even to this day, such as the Beretta Bobcat, Beretta Model 21A, and clones of the Beretta designs such as the Taurus PT22 that are successful. These modern pistols typically have flip-up barrels, to permit easy loading without necessarily cycling a slide against a strong recoil spring, making these pistols suitable for use by the elderly and others with less hand strength. The trade made is that in the event of a <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> malfunction, the gun is rendered useless until the action can be cycled by someone with full hand strength. Still, for someone without the hand strength to handle a semi-automatic firearm with a slide against a strong recoil spring, the trade is often made.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transfer}} bar {{is also used}} in revolvers and some exposed hammer rifles, but works the opposite way from a hammer block. The {{transfer bar}} has the spur {{that would otherwise be}} on the hammer, or encloses a firing pin similar to autoloading designs. The hammer itself cannot contact a loaded cartridge, but must instead strike the transfer bar, which then contacts the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> with the spur or pin. The transfer bar is normally positioned out of line with the hammer's travel, but is moved into place by the normal action of the trigger, providing similar [...] "drop safety" [...] to a firing pin block.|$|E
5000|$|The MG4 is an air-cooled, belt-fed gas-operated weapon with a {{positively}} locked rotary bolt and {{is somewhat}} similar in concept to the Belgian Minimi light machine gun. Firing in fully automatic. Safety mechanisms on the MG4 includes a manual safety incorporated into fire mode selector toggle; setting the fire selector lever on the [...] "safe" [...] position blocks the trigger mechanically and locks the bolt in the cocked position. When the bolt is not pulled back completely, accidental firing is prevented by an integral, automatic mechanism that prevents the bolt from traveling forward. In addition, {{the firing pin}} cannot reach the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> until the cartridge has been fully chambered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{feature of}} centerfire ammunition is the primer {{which is a}} metal cup containing a primary explosive inserted into a recess {{in the center of}} the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing pin crushes this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. [...] Berdan and Boxer <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> are both considered [...] "centerfire" [...] and are not interchangeable at the primer level; however, the same weapon can fire either Berdan- or Boxer-primed cartridges if the overall dimensions are the same.|$|R

5000|$|A {{centerfire}} cartridge is a <b>cartridge</b> with a <b>primer</b> {{located in}} the center of the cartridge case head. Unlike rimfire <b>cartridges,</b> the <b>primer</b> is a separate and replaceable component. Centerfire cartridges have supplanted the rimfire variety in all but the smallest cartridge sizes. With the exception of a few [...]17 caliber and [...]22 caliber pistol and rifle cartridges, small-bore shotgun cartridges (intended for pest-control), and a handful of antique, mostly obsolete cartridges, almost all pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition used today is centerfire.|$|R
50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt sleeve assembly and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|E
5000|$|The M3 {{operating}} sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked {{to the rear}} using the cocking handle located {{on the right side}} of the ejector housing.

50|$|The rifle's {{operation}} during firing and reloading {{is identical}} {{to that of the}} AKM. After ignition of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]30-'06 Garand rifle (essentially an {{enlarged}} T3E2) was quickly built and, under the confusing designation T1E1, was tested {{along with the}} T3E2 and the Pedersen T1E3 during the remainder of 1931. The Semiautomatic Rifle Board now exhibited a notably critical attitude toward the T1E3. The Board found fault with the requirement for lubricated cartridge cases (seemingly regardless of the technical merits of Mr. Pedersen’s case treatment concept), poor trigger pull, and the upward break of the breech mechanism. A more substantive complaint {{had to do with}} the complete exposure of the breech mechanism when held open—the Board correctly cited the vulnerability of the rifle to mud and dust while in this condition. The Board also reported slamfires (the Garand T3E2 was reported to dimple <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> with its firing pin, but did not slamfire).|$|R
5000|$|This pistol was {{actually}} fired by action of a hammer striking and driving a firing pin into a center-fire <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer.</b> The hammer {{was covered by}} {{the rear of the}} slide. The [...] "hammerless" [...] designation was merely an advertising designation pointing out the pistol's particular suitability for concealed carry. Special features include a serrated slide to prevent slippage during manual cycling of the slide, and two safety mechanisms (a grip safety and a manual safety). The grip safety is a spring-loaded piece making up the back strap of the pistol. The grip safety, though not solely restricted to them, was a typical feature of Colt automatic pistols. A magazine safety was added on later models; this feature prevents the pistol from being fired with a round in the chamber and the magazine removed.|$|R
5000|$|Before this, a [...] "cartridge" [...] {{was simply}} a premeasured {{quantity}} of gunpowder together with a ball in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder), which also acted as wadding for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called [...] "primers") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer,</b> which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is {{at the base of}} the cartridge, either within the rim (a [...] "rimfire" [...] cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a [...] "centerfire" [...] cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.|$|E
50|$|To fire, the {{operator}} inserts a loaded magazine, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the trigger. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger {{to be released}} and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into {{the underside of the}} bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel, which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. The AK-47 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. The Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case.|$|E
5000|$|A {{safety notch}} {{is one of}} the oldest forms of drop safety, used on older single-action revolvers {{manufactured}} before the invention of the hammer block, some lever-action rifles, 1911-pattern guns, and hammer-fired semi-automatics that were designed before the invention of the firing pin block. The safety notch is a relief cut made in the tumbler at the base of the hammer, that allows the sear to catch and hold the hammer a short distance from the pin or <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer,</b> in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] position. The safety notch works first by allowing the handler to retract the hammer a short distance from the firing pin or primer, such that dropping the firearm on its hammer will not result in an energy transfer to the pin or spur, which could then discharge a chambered cartridge. A second purpose is to allow the sear to [...] "catch" [...] a hammer that is falling when the trigger has not been pulled, such as in cases where a drop jarred the sear loose or when the hammer was not fully cocked before being released. However, a safety notch used to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm is an active feature that must be engaged, and does not positively prevent accidental discharges in all cases. A certain amount of manual dexterity and familiarity with a firearm is also required to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm; unfamiliarity with how to engage the [...] "half-cock" [...] position can result in accidental discharges. Moreover, safety notch and [...] "half-cock" [...] style safeties are prone to breakage which can result in unintentional discharges leading to severe personal injuries or death.|$|E
50|$|Primer pocket {{cleaning}} {{tools are}} used to remove residual combustion debris remaining in the primer pocket; both brush designs and single blade designs are commonly used. Dirty primer pockets can prevent setting primers at, or below, the <b>cartridge</b> head. <b>Primer</b> pocket reamers or swagers {{are used to}} remove military crimps in primer pockets.|$|R
5000|$|However, some single-action revolvers have relief cuts {{in between}} {{cylinder}} bores {{that allow the}} hammer to be rested directly upon the cylinder with no chance of interacting with loaded <b>cartridges</b> or <b>primers.</b> These are also known colloquially as [...] "safety notches." [...] They are usually found on black-powder revolvers, {{but there are also}} cartridge-firing revolvers with safety notches.|$|R
50|$|The chamber {{block is}} locked to the handle block, which {{contains}} the locking surface, firing button (pushed by the trigger when the chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. The <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> are ignited electrically, {{so there are}} four circular contact plates on the locking surface (contacting the case bottom) and four contact pins {{in the center of}} each plate (contacting the primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. The electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. The weapon is only capable of firing one round at a time. There are different models of PB-4; in some, the firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others by a piezoelectric igniter similar to those used by kitchen gas lighters.|$|R
25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer</b> unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the <b>primer</b> of a <b>cartridge.</b> If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the {{gun in the holster}} to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|R
5000|$|Indoor ranges {{usually have}} a back wall with a sloped earthen berm or bank, with {{reinforced}} baffles additionally situated along the roof and side walls. Ranges with proper ventilation pull smoke and lead particles away from the shooting line and discharge them from the building to reduce potential lead poisoning, as when ranges lack proper ventilation, employees and users are exposed to lead dust from bullets or <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers,</b> which can be inhaled or can settle on skin or clothing. Additionally, the discharging of firearms in indoor ranges can produce noise levels of over 140 dB sound pressure level. To combat this, it is commonly recommended that those inside the range [...] "double up" [...] ear protection by using both earplugs and over-the-head earmuffs, and to protect range bystanders from sound exposure, many modern ranges have an air-locked corridor for sound-proofing, with two doors {{at opposite ends of}} the egress corridor. Most indoor ranges restrict the use of certain powerful calibers, rifles, or fully automatic weapons, and in many shooting ranges, [...]50 caliber or higher bullets are not allowed.|$|R

5000|$|While early (1949-50) Soviet models had {{spring-loaded}} firing pins, {{which held}} the pin away from <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> until {{struck by the}} action's hammer, most variants of the SKS have a free floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, {{care must be taken}} during cleaning (especially after long storage packed in Cosmoline) to ensure that the firing pin can freely move and does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental [...] "slamfires" [...] (the rifle firing on its own, without pulling the trigger and often without being fully locked). This behavior is less likely with the hard primer military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle, users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of Cosmoline embedded in it that retard firing pin movement. As it is triangular in cross section with only one way to properly insert it (notches up), slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted in one of the other two orientations.|$|R
50|$|Factory {{ammunition}} {{was produced}} by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and primer has anvil), others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole <b>cartridge</b> and <b>primer</b> has no anvil). Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan <b>primer.</b> Berden primed <b>cartridges</b> also have a double flash hole, making their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin.|$|R
50|$|Cylinders {{that use}} these {{cartridges}} are {{what most people}} envision as modern cylinders. These cartridges are all metallic and are struck at the rear by the hammer. The rimfire <b>cartridges</b> contain a <b>primer</b> around {{the inside of the}} rim. The centerfire <b>cartridges</b> have a <b>primer</b> cap pressed into the base. They are similar to the pin-fire cylinders as the chambers are bored completely through, but they have no additional holes or channels connected to the chambers. In 1857, Smith & Wesson held the patent for this bored through cylinder. Removal of cartridges from the early models was done one at a time with a push rod as in the pin-fire cylinders. Later models that had swing-out cylinders incorporated push rods with extractors that pushed all of the cartridges out in a single operation.|$|R
5000|$|Berdan primers {{are named}} after their American inventor, Hiram Berdan of New York who invented his first {{variation}} of the Berdan primer and patented it on March 20, 1866, in [...] A small copper cylinder formed the shell of the <b>cartridge,</b> and the <b>primer</b> cap was pressed into a recess in {{the outside of the}} closed end of the cartridge opposite the bullet. In the end of the <b>cartridge</b> beneath the <b>primer</b> cap was a small vent-hole, as well as a small teat-like projection or point (later to be known as an anvil) fashioned from the case, such that the firing pin could crush the primer against the anvil and ignite the propellant. This system worked well, allowing the option of installing a cap just before use of the propellant-loaded cartridge as well as permitting reloading the cartridge for reuse.|$|R
5000|$|Types of jams include {{failures}} to feed, extract, or eject a cartridge; failure to fully cycle after firing; and {{failure of a}} recoil- or gas-operated firearm to lock back when empty (largely a procedural hazard, as a [...] "slide lock" [...] is a visual cue that the firearm's ammunition supply is empty). When a jam occurs, the handler should exercise extreme caution as a <b>cartridge</b> whose <b>primer</b> has been struck and which has been deformed in a jam can discharge unexpectedly (in a [...] "hang-fire".) One method of quickly clearing a jammed semi-automatic weapon is tap rack bang.|$|R

50|$|Electrically primed {{small arms}} <b>cartridges</b> retain the <b>primer</b> which {{functions}} {{in the same way}} as a conventional primer. Rather than being struck by a firing pin or equivalent mechanical means, a small electric current serves to detonate the primer which provides the thermal impulse necessary to ignite the propellant which then deflagrates, producing pressure.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} ammunition, smoke or chemical, and high-explosive are known. Likewise, {{there are two}} weights of shells-7.2 pounds and 14.3 pounds. The {{complete}} 7.2-pound round consists of a percussion fuze, the shell body, the fin assembly, the <b>primer</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and the propelling charge. The propelling charge {{is made up of}} increments, each increment consisting of a lacquered silk envelope containing a ballistite-type propellant. The <b>primer</b> <b>cartridge,</b> enclosed at one end by a lacquered brass head, resembles a 12-gauge shotgun shell. The body of the high-explosive shell is painted black, inside and out, and contains an explosive charge of about 1 pound of TNT. A white band is painted {{around the base of the}} body of the shell, a yellow band at the junction of the shell and the fin assembly, and a red band around the nose, on the fuze adapter. The 7.2-pound shell is 11.6 inches long unfuzed.|$|R
5000|$|Powder-actuated tool {{cartridges}} are specially-designed blank firearm cartridges. In many cases, {{the charges}} are ordinary firearm cartridges with modified casings, and the bullet removed. The [...]22 Short, developed by Smith & Wesson is common. These charges may be hand-fed, or manufactured and distributed on a plastic strip. The charges are activated when a firing pin strikes the primer, which is an explosive charge {{in the base of}} <b>cartridge.</b> The <b>primer</b> ignites the charge, which burns rapidly. The gases released by the burning of the propellant build pressure within the cartridge, which acts either on the head of the nail, or on the piston, accelerating the nail towards the muzzle.|$|R
