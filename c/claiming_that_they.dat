5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Harvey {{called for}} Mark and Steve Waugh {{to be dropped}} from the Australian team, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were a waste of space. He stated: Money {{is the only thing}} that keeps them playing...If they earned the same money as I did when I was playing they'd have retired at 34 as I did, and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E
5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not a priori. He rejected the argument on the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E
50|$|Like {{any other}} ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Bali <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> entered the Nigeria region from the east. The Bali, for example <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> entered the Nigerian region from the Republic of Congo and through gradual process; they came and settled in their present {{geographical}} location. The Kpasham and Bomni denied any knowledge of distance movement. <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> came from Bachama land, probably from Lamurde to the area they are now occupying. The evidence points to Republic of Congo as their original homeland.|$|R

5|$|St Vincent's gaze {{passed over}} {{every aspect of}} the Navy from the Sea Fencibles to the Navy Hospitals. The earl {{attempted}} to disband the Sea Fencibles <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The Blink Hacker Group, associating {{themselves}} with the Anonymous group, claimed to have hacked the Thailand prison websites and servers. The compromised data has been shared online, with the group <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> give the data back to Thailand Justice and the citizens of Thailand as well. The hack was done in response to news from Thailand about the mistreatment of prisoners in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E

5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering {{the powers of the}} head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of the area of operations around Stolac, the situation was significantly calmer than around Nevesinje, although a group of 200 Ustaše at Berkovići were falsely <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being surrounded by rebels at night. Despite this claim, they had suffered no casualties. Regardless, Prpić sent them ammunition and a platoon of the 18th Battalion. At 19:00 on 26 June, Francetić arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to be briefed on the situation. He resolved that he would travel to Berkovići the following day and take personal command of the Ustaše unit there.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{used the}} coup to enact {{retribution}} against Minh's leading generals. Khánh had Kim, Don, Dinh and Xuan arrested, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were part of}} a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although he did as well. Lan was also arrested as a suspected French agent. The junta members were caught totally unaware. Minh, Don and Kim woke up to find hostile forces surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers.|$|E

5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E
5|$|The Cistercian monasteries in {{the north}} of England {{resisted}} the tax, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were immune to taxation. John put pressure on them, as he was {{in the north}} when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, by then Chancellor. Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £1,000, but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer. In October, the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through Walter's intercession, the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax.|$|E
5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Redbox <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{could no}} longer obtain titles through VPD and Ingram. <b>They</b> also <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not obtain these titles through Walmart and Best Buy stores because the stores would either impose a limit on how many DVDs can be {{purchased}} at a time, or not sell to Redbox personnel entirely.|$|R

5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing {{the game in the}} same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E
5|$|Verran {{called an}} {{election}} in February 1912, and the ULP were defeated by the Liberal Union, although Denny was again returned first in the seat of Adelaide with 15.8 per cent of votes cast. He {{became a member of}} the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a referendum to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election, Denny attacked them, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E

5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> violated his constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
