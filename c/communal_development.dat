An article in local newspaper Pichilemu stated that the new coat of arms was to be chosen by a jury composed of the mayor of Pichilemu, the director of Municipal Works, two members of the CODECO, a representative of the culture department of the regional secretariat of the Education Ministry, an artist, and a teacher.

The research aim was to investigate models of interaction dynamics between an anthropological system and its environment. Equifinality dynamic model defined by three compartments and propensity for establishment of a steady state regardless of the initial conditions was applied. The intention was to apply this concept in anthropological research using the OPSIM procedure. DYNOPS model defined by four age-group compartments and the environment was also used. The model was applied on the census of the Bogomolje village {{on the island of}} Hvar (R. Croatia). Through numerous simulations, {{it was found that the}} influence of the environment increases with the decrease of time spent in the young age compartment. A drawback of DYNOPS model is that it places the environment in an unchangeable category, while in reality it necessarily changes through numerous interactions with various agents. Finally, cybernetics should not only be used to explicate, but also predict and correct undesired <b>communal</b> <b>developments...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{large scale}} post-war {{migration}} impacted beyond {{the change of}} the demographic structure of Australia. The dynamics of migration impact is also felt beyond the immediate intent of particular ethnic <b>communal</b> <b>developments</b> {{in a place of}} settlement. Migration affected civil society in Australia too. Civil society is not a given good (Keane 1998, p. 49) as it is also grounded in exogenous factors that are in this case identified as immigration effects. Cosmopolitan features of Australian cities have their foundations in fragmented ethnic voluntary collective actions. These social effects of post-war migration are contextualised through analysis of the diverse impacts and consequences of migrant collective acts undertaken to satisfy their own perceived needs through appropriation of communal places in Sydney. This article explores that part of the ‘ethnic third sector’ that relates to the activities of ethnic community organisations who established a place (building) where the religious, educational, recreational or welfare needs of immigrant communities in Australia were met. Utilising the concepts of bonding and bridging social capital to explore the social relations that developed in these migrant places and spaces, this article thus attempts to explore an important chapter in story of how post-war migrants have contributed to civil society in Australia...|$|R

50|$|The New England land system, {{while the}} primary {{influence}} on the great land ordinances of the 1780s, {{was not the only}} land system influence. The Southern land system, marked by individualism and personal initiative, also helped shape the ordinance. While the New England land system was premised on community-based development, the Southern land system was premised on individual frontiersman appropriating undeveloped land to call their own. The Southern pioneer claimed property and the local surveyor would demarcate it for him. The system did not protect people from competing claims or set up an orderly chain of title. The process was called ‘indiscriminate location”. This system encouraged individuals to amass large plantations instead of settling into dense <b>communal</b> <b>development.</b> This system was supported by the use of slave labor. Perhaps the committee’s resistance against indiscriminate location and support for limited and disciplined land settlement was an implicit attempt to create a structural barrier to developing a plantation economy that was dependent on slave labor. The committee could have been attempting to effectively eradicate slavery in the West after Jefferson failed to outlaw it in the Land Ordinance of 1784.|$|E

50|$|During 1989-2001, CAMPFIRE {{generated}} over US$20 {{million of}} transfers to the participating communities, 89% of {{which came from}} sport hunting. The scale of benefits varied greatly across districts, wards and households. Twelve of the 37 districts with authority to market wildlife produced 97% of all CAMPFIRE revenues, reflecting the variability in wildlife resources and local institutional arrangements. The programme has been widely emulated in southern and eastern Africa. It has been estimated by the World Wildlife Fund that households participating in CAMPFIRE increased their incomes by 15-25%. Between 1989 and 2006 the project generated US$30 million, of which approximately 52 percent was distributed to local communities to promote rural development projects. No location has benefited more substantially than the Masoka ward, which has used its revenue to improve the livelihoods of its rural residents by building a four-block primary school, a two-ward clinic, a grinding mill, and two hand-pumped boreholes, to name but a few. In addition, environmental benefits have been witnessed since CAMPFIRE's inception; elephant numbers have increased, buffalo numbers are either stable or witnessing a slight decrease, and habitat loss has diminished, and in certain regions, even reversed. CAMPFIRE leadership also chose to invest <b>communal</b> <b>development</b> funds from tourism revenue to build a beer hall for local residents.|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} an {{integrated}} Christian community is vital to its continuance, perspective, and strength. This integration of course includes a number of variables, including age, gender, race, and under the lenses of this paper, spiritual maturity. Without preference to time or culture, a healthy view of the Christian life is one that views {{it in terms of}} a path that leads towards the One who created all life. Living with the goal of godliness at the end of one’s path encourages a steady transformation into the image of Christ. This however, is not enough. To keep from becoming irrelevant and ultimately extinct in the community, each Christian must hold with equal regard those at different stages of the journey, and remain committed to them by giving other believers chances to grow. This is exactly how Syriac Christians viewed <b>communal</b> spiritual <b>development.</b> Because Syriac Ascetics saw spiritual formation as a community on a journey, they were successful in avoiding isolation and irrelevance - remaining instead a spiritually effective presence in the church and the lost world around them.|$|R
