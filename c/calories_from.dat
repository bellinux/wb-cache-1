5|$|The Whopper is the {{signature}} sandwich and an associated product line sold by international fast food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. The sandwich contains 660 calories, including 360 <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat, 40 grams of fat, including 12 grams {{of saturated fat}} and 1.5 grams of transfat.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E

30|$|Values of diet {{compounds}} do {{not have}} a specific definition. Typically, low-fat diets contain 10 % <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> fat, high-fat diets have 30 – 50 % energy from fat source and very high-fat diets have more than 50 % energy. To induce obesity, both high-fat and very high-fat diets are used and body weight depends on the amount of fat (Ghibaudi et al. 2002).|$|R
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E

30|$|Kako (2009) {{defined the}} SSR on a calorie basis as {{the ratio of}} <b>calorie</b> supply <b>from</b> {{domestically}} produced food to the total <b>calorie</b> supply <b>from</b> all food in a country. The author found Japan’s food self-sufficiency (calorie basis) decreased sharply from 79 % in 1960 to 40 % in 2005. The finding was attributed to a sharp appreciation of the Yen (increase purchasing power of food imports) and drastic changes in the diet of Japanese consumers.|$|R
25|$|Traditional Inuit diets derive {{approximately}} 50% {{of their}} <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat, 30–35% from protein and 15–20% of their <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> carbohydrates, {{largely in the}} form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet. However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to cerebrovascular strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard American diet has reduced the incidence of mortality in Inuit population. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes.|$|E
25|$|Another view is {{that until}} the Upper Paleolithic, humans were frugivores (fruit eaters) who {{supplemented}} their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and mussels, and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as antelopes. This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically, sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally {{very similar to that}} of humans. Chimpanzees are primarily frugivores, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant-based, with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals. In some ecosystems, however, chimpanzees are predatory, forming parties to hunt monkeys. Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> sources such as animal foods, allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead.|$|E
500|$|To address {{concerns}} over the increase in childhood obesity in Western nations and accusations of unhealthy offerings for children by {{groups such as the}} Center for Science in the Public Interest, the company created a nutritional program called [...] "BK Positive Steps" [...] that is aimed at children and their families. The program began with the introduction of products such as broiled Chicken Tenders, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and apple [...] "fries", which are French cut apples served in a fry box that are featured in a new low-fat Kid's Club Meal. According to a statement by Burger King, the new Kid's Club meals contain no more than 560 calories per meal, less than 30 percent of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat, less than 10 percent of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fat, no added trans fats, and no more than 10 percent of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> added sugars. Additional changes to its menu were announced in May 2009, including the reduction of sodium levels in its Chicken Tenders product by approximately 33 percent; a switch to non-fat milk products in the U.S.; and adding calcium-fortified apple juice to its beverage line-up. The broiled Chicken Tenders product is only sold in the UK/Ireland market. The product line has been expanded to include a boiled mini chicken sandwich for the kid's meals in this region.|$|E

500|$|Controlled {{trials have}} now shown {{unequivocally}} that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases body weight and body fat, and that replacement of sugar by artificial sweeteners reduces weight. Studies on {{the link between}} sugars and diabetes are inconclusive, with some suggesting that eating excessive amounts of sugar does not {{increase the risk of}} diabetes, although the extra <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to obesity, which may itself increase the risk of developing this metabolic disorder. [...] Other studies show correlation between refined sugar (also called [...] "free sugar") consumption and the onset of diabetes, and negative correlation with the consumption of fiber. These included a 2010 meta-analysis of eleven studies involving 310,819 participants and 15,043 cases of type2 diabetes.|$|E
500|$|The {{modified}} Kid's Meal {{line will}} include new products, such as broiled Chicken Tenders, apple [...] "fries" [...] (French cut, raw apples {{served in a}} fry box), and Kraft macaroni and cheese.

500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{negatively}} correlated with body mass, whereas both osteoporosis and weight loss occur at higher incidence during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than the age-matched non-dementia individuals. Given {{that there is no}} evidence that overweight associated with AD-type cognitive dysfunction, we hypothesized that moderate weight gain might have a protective effect on the bone loss in AD without exacerbating cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, feeding a high-fat-diet (HFD, 45 % <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> fat) to female APP/PS 1 transgenic mice, an AD animal model, induced weight gain. The bone mineral density, microarchitecture, and biomechanical properties of the femurs were then evaluated. The results showed that the middle-aged female APP/PS 1 transgenic mice were susceptible to osteoporosis of the femoral bones and that weight gain significantly enhanced bone mass and mechanical properties. Notably, HFD was not detrimental to brain insulin signaling and AβPP processing, as well as to exploration ability and working, learning and memory performance of the transgenic mice measured by T maze and water maze, compared with the mice fed a normal fat diet (10 % <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> fat). In addition, the circulating levels of leptin but not estradiol were remarkably elevated in HFD-treated mice. These results suggest that a body weight gain induced by the HFD feeding regimen significantly improved bone mass in female APP/PS 1 mice with no detriments to exploration ability and spatial memory, most likely via the action of elevated circulating leptin...|$|R

40|$|This study {{uses the}} panel data of a {{randomized}} experiment from the Mexican PROGRESA program {{to evaluate the}} impact of drought on total calorie availability and the mitigating effects of PROGRESA on food consumption in periods of drought. Drought reduced total expenditures and total food expenditures but increased the total availability of calories. This paradox {{can be explained by}} the impact of drought on the composition of calories; that is, it reduced the consumption of expensive calories in such foods as vegetables, fruits, and animal products but increased <b>calories</b> consumed <b>from</b> cheaper sources, such as grains. This study finds that PROGRESA can completely mitigate the negative effects of drought on <b>calorie</b> availability <b>from</b> vegetables, fruits, and other sources. However, PROGRESA cannot mitigate the impact of drought on <b>calories</b> available <b>from</b> grains. The analysis also shows that, during drought, households who increase their consumption of grains get them mainly from purchased sources rather than from home production. In these circumstances, decreased total expenditures and increased purchases of grains suggest that grains are inferior goods in rural Mexico. The Engel curve analysis further proves that grains are inferior goods. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch."
