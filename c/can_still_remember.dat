25|$|The play The Sound of the People Victorious (Ludu Aungthan) that U Nu wrote {{while he}} was Prime Minister is about the havoc that Communist {{ideologies}} can wreak in a family. Strangely enough the first production of the play {{seems to have been}} in Pasadena, California. It later became a popular comic book in Burma, was translated into English, and made into a feature film {{at the height of the}} Cold War in the 1950s. The older generation in Burma <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> having studied the play in their schooldays.|$|E
25|$|At Briarcliff, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) takes Lana's secret {{notes about}} the asylum. Lana retorts that she <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> what has {{happened}} to her, prompting Sister Jude to ask Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) to give Lana electroshock treatment. Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed by the violence of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her a slut and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face a double standard with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E

[...] The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Rosa Parks. The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. [...] "I was {{a big fan of}} Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s. [...] There was always a really great charm about the music.

However, Barbara Streisand who directs and stars in her own movies, has influenced Velasquez the most. Velasquez said the first time she saw Streisand perform was on TV in one of her musical specials, she told The Philippine Star, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> that time.

One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled, [...] "My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!" [...] In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: [...] "The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida.

If {{it had not}} been for my Staffordshire cousins I do not think I should have known any girls at all until I was twenty. Of Staffordshire I will tell a little later. But I <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> <b>still</b> how through all those ripening years, the thought of women's beauty, their magic presence in the world beside me and the unknown, untried reactions of their intercourse, grew upon me and grew, as a strange presence grows in a room when one is occupied by other things. I busied myself and pretended to be wholly occupied, and there the woman stood, full half of life neglected, and it seemed to my averted mind sometimes that she was there clad and dignified and divine, and sometimes Aphrodite shining and commanding, and sometimes that Venus who stoops and allures.|$|R

But, unfortunately, I cannot read it through very carefully, because, you see, it is not written yet. The image and the idea of it clung to me through a great part of my boyhood; I may have dreamt it before I could talk; or told it to myself before I could read; or read it before I could remember. On the whole, however, I am certain that I did not read it, for children have very clear memories about things like that; and of the books which I was really fond I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember,</b> not only the shape and bulk and binding, but even the position of the printed words on many of the pages.

60|$|Was it with sensations {{resembling}} these (applied, however, {{rather to}} the mind than to the eye) that the reader perused those pages devoted to Hermanric and Antonina? Does the happiness there described now appear to him to beam through the stormy progress of the narrative as the spot of blue beams through the gathering clouds? Did that small prospect of brightness present itself, at the time, like a garden of repose amid the waste of fierce emotions which encompassed it? Did it encourage him, when contrasted with what had gone before, to enter {{on the field of}} gloomier interest which was to follow? If, indeed, it has thus affected him, if he <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> the scene at the farm-house beyond the suburbs with emotions such as these, he will not now be unwilling to turn again for a moment from the gathering clouds to the spot of blue,--he will not deny us an instant's digression from Ulpius and the city of famine to Antonina and the lonely plains.|$|E

Philip and I came down together by the same train from Harbury, I shared the Burnmore dog-cart and luggage cart, and he dropped me at the rectory. I was a long-limbed youngster of seventeen, as tall as I am now, and fair, so fair that I was still boyish-faced while most of my contemporaries and Philip (who favored his father) were at least smudgy with moustaches. With the head-master's valediction and the grave elder-brotherliness of old Henson, and the shrill cheers of a little crowd of juniors still echoing in my head, I very naturally came home in a mood of exalted gravity, and I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> pacing up and down the oblong lawn behind the rockery and the fig-tree wall with my father, talking of my outlook with all the tremendous savoir faire that was natural to my age, and noting with a secret gratification that our shoulders were now on a level. No doubt we were discussing Oxford and all that I was to do at Oxford; I don't remember a word of our speech though I recall the exact tint of its color and the distinctive feeling of our measured equal paces in the sunshine....|$|E
