40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the efficient design of explosion protection systems against <b>confined</b> <b>explosions.</b> The issue addressed concerns the quantitative estimation of the protective effect of explosion relief vents {{in the case of}} <b>confined</b> <b>explosions</b> inside tunnels. A series of virtual experiments performed by computer simulation, revealed how the number of vents, their diameter, as well as the angle between the vents and the tunnel, influences the blast wave attenuation. The computational study was performed considering a complicated large-scale tunnel configuration with branches on its half portion. The purpose was the calculation of the attenuation effect due to the presence of vents by comparing the total explosion-specific impulse developing at antidiametric positions inside the tunnel. Simulations were carried out via a three-dimensional numerical model built in the computational fluid dynamics code CFX 5. 7. 1, which has been validated in previous papers against experimental overpressure histories data demonstrating reasonable performance. Computer results showed that the use of branch vents provides an effective method for shock wave attenuation following an explosion, whereas their statistical elaboration revealed that the attenuation is mainly affected by the number of vents and their diameter. In contrast, the angle between the side vents and the main tunnel appeared to slightly affect the pressure wave weakening. Eventually, the quantitative influence of the above parameters was effectively illustrated in functional diagrams, so that the total attenuation effect may be promptly estimated, if the design variables are known. In addition, two statistical models with reasonable fitting to the calculated data are proposed, which express the attenuation effect as a dependent variable of the design variables including their interactions.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] EC funded Naturalhy project is assessing the potential for using the existing gas infrastructure for conveying hydrogen as a mixture with natural gas (methane). The hydrogen could then be removed at a point of use or the natural gas/hydrogen mixture could be burned in gas-fired appliances thereby providing reduced carbon emissions compared to natural gas. As part of the project, the impact on the safety of the gas system resulting from the addition of hydrogen is being assessed. A release of a natural gas/hydrogen mixture within a vented enclosure (such as an industrial housing of plant and equipment) could result in a flammable mixture being formed and ignited. Due to the different properties of hydrogen, the resulting explosion may be more severe for natural gas/hydrogen mixtures compared to natural gas. Therefore, a series of large scale explosion experiments involving methane/hydrogen mixtures has been conducted in a 69. 3 m 3 enclosure in order to assess the effect of different hydrogen concentrations on the resulting explosion overpressures. The results showed that adding up to 20 % by volume of hydrogen to the methane resulted in a small increase in explosion flame speeds and overpressures. However, a significant increase was observed when 50 % hydrogen was added. For the vented <b>confined</b> <b>explosions</b> studied, it was also observed that the addition of obstacles within the enclosure, representing congestion caused by equipment and pipework, etc., increased flame speeds and overpressures above the levels measured in an empty enclosure.

The supernovae evolve along two evolutionary paths according to whether they explode in H 2 regions or neutral halos. Those in H 2 regions first expand adiabatically and then radiate strongly upon collision with baryons ejected from the halo during its photoevaporation by the progenitor. Explosions in neutral halos promptly emit most of their kinetic energy as x-rays, but retain enough momentum to seriously disrupt the halo. We find that the least energetic of the supernovae are capable of destroying halos ≲ 10 ^ 7, while a single PISN can destroy even more massive halos.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of the magnetic field configuration and its transformation in six solar eruptive events that show good agreement with the Hirayama-Shibata model for eruptive flares. The observations arc X-ray images from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and magnetograms from Kitt Peak National Solar Observatory, interpreted together with the 1 - 8 Angstrom X-ray flux observed by GOES. The observations show: 1. Each event is a magnetic explosion that occurs in an initially closed magnetic bipole in which the core field is sheared and twisted {{in the shape of}} a sigmoid, having an oppositely curved elbow on each end. The arms of the opposite elbows are sheared past each other so that they overlap and are crossed low above the neutral line in the middle of the bipole. 2. Although four of the explosions arc ejective (blow open the bipole) and two are confined (arc arrested within the closed bipole), all six begin the same way. In the SXT iniages, the explosion begins with brightening and expansion of the two elbows together with the appearance of short bright sheared loops low over the neutral line under the crossed arms and, rising up from the crossed arms, long strands connecting the far ends of the elbows. 3. All six events arc single-bipole events in that during the onset and early development of the explosion they show no evidence for reconnection between the exploding bipole and any surrounding magnetic fields. We conclude that in each of our events the magnetic explosion was unleashed by runaway tether-cutting via implosive/explosive rcconnection in the middle of the sigmoid, as in the Hirayama-Shibata model. The similarity of the onsets of the two <b>confined</b> <b>explosions</b> to the onsets of the four ejective explosions and their agreement with the model indicate that runaway reconnection inside a sheared core field can begin whether or not the overlying fields (the envelope field and contiguous fields that press down on the envelope) allow the explosion to be ejective.

Gas samples collected from sampling holes near the shot hole were analyzed for Kr/sup 85 /, which had been included with the nitromethane as a tracer. It appeared that the Kr/sup 85 / concentration in the samples out to 50 ft was more or less independent of space and time between + 2 and + 50 hr. Relativsly little Kr/sup 85 / was detected at 125 ft and none beyond. About (20 plus or minus 10) % of the Kr/sup 85 / escaped into ths adit. The results of the Pinot experiment cannot be extrapolated quantitatively to the case of a nuclear explosion in oil shale. Even if the structure at the Pinot site is typical of oil shale, the generation of a smaller quantity of noncondensible gases per unit energy in a nuclear explosion (as compared with a chemical explosion), the shonter time scale of the ensrgy release and the higher temperatares and pressures encountered will all have a definite influence on the effective containment distance. One can conclude, however, that, if the medium at the site of a potential nuclear experiment is similar to that at Pinot, the radioactive gases will not travel preferentially in directions parallel to the bedding planes, but rather will tend to expand mors or less spherically from the shot point. In other words, an explosion in oil shale designed not to vent in a direction perpendicular to the bedning planes will be just as tight parallel to the bedding planes. (auth...|$|R

The failure of seals at Sago prompted sweeping regulatory changes that were initiated {{with the passage of}} the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER act), which required MSHA to increase the seal design standard by the end of 2007. Based on sound scientific and engineering justification, NIOSH researchers developed explosion pressure design criteria for new seal designs and for monitoring the atmosphere behind seals to protect miners from blast effects and toxic gases produced by contained explosions. This information was published in July 2007. In 2008, MSHA issued the final rule for mine seals based, in part, on the information contained in this NIOSH report. The final rule states that seals must withstand 345 kPa (50 psig) if the sealed area atmosphere is monitored and maintained inert, 828 kPa (120 psig) if the sealed area atmosphere is not monitored, and greater than 828 kPa (120 psig) if the sealed area atmosphere is not monitored and certain conditions exist that might lead to higher explosion pressures. From 2001 to 2007, the NIOSH Office of Mine Safety and Health Research conducted studies to develop alternative ways to determine the adequacy of coal mine seals. The researchers compared full-scale explosion testing within the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine to full-scale hydrostatic testing within a chamber using water to load seals to pressure. Researchers found that gradually applying water pressure to twice the expected explosion pressure was equivalent to the effects created by the rapid increase in pressure loading that results from <b>confined</b> <b>explosions.</b> These hydrostatic tests provided stress-strain measurements, determined the ultimate strength of seals, and demonstrated that hydrostatic testing of mine seals was a timely and cost-effective alternative to full-scale explosion testing. Results of these studies should be used with the testing of mine ventilation seals. NIOSH Recommendations: 1. Use hydrostatic testing of mine seals in place of or in conjunction with full-scale explosion testing as a means to validate engineering calculations and models. 2. Use empirical resistance data from the hydrostatic testing to improve or validate design codes. These new data should be considered when using or evaluating design codes. 3. Test seals under static load at least twice the explosion design pressure when performing hydrostatic tests. 4. Conduct additional studies to further refine and quantify the response. 5. Utilize only design codes validated by testing for mine seal design. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "October 2010. "On back: Logo for the Research to Practice at NIOSH initiative (r 2 p).

40|$|The authors compare {{two-dimensional}} model {{results with}} measurements for the thermal, chemical and mechanical {{behavior in a}} thermal <b>explosion</b> experiment. <b>Confined</b> high explosives are heated {{at a rate of}} 1 C per hour until an explosion is observed. The heating, ignition, and deflagration phases are modeled using an Arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian code (ALE 3 D) that can handle a wide range of time scales that vary from a structural to a dynamic hydro time scale. During the pre-ignition phase, quasi-static mechanics and diffusive thermal transfer from a heat source to the HE are coupled with the finite chemical reactions that include both endothermic and exothermic processes. Once the HE ignites, a hydro dynamic calculation is performed as a burn front propagates through the HE. Two octahydrotetranitrotetrazine (HMX) -based explosives, LX- 04 and LX- 10, are considered, whose chemical-thermal-mechanical models are constructed based on measurements of thermal and mechanical properties along with small scale thermal explosion measurements. The present HMX modeling work shows very first violence calculations with thermal predictions associated with a <b>confined</b> thermal <b>explosion</b> test. The simulated dynamic response of HE confinement during the explosive phase is compared to measurements in larger scale thermal explosion tests. The explosion temperatures for both HE's are predicted to within 1 C. Calculated and measured wall strains provide an indication of vessel pressurization during the heating phase and violence during the explosive phase...|$|R
