2500|$|Neither Rapaport, Pinker, nor Senghas were {{initially}} {{aware of the}} earlier coinages. [...] Pinker learned of Rapaport's earlier example only in 1994, and Rapaport was not informed of Borgmann's sentence until 2006. [...] Even Borgmann's example {{may not be the}} oldest: <b>computational</b> <b>linguist</b> Robert C. Berwick, who used a five-"buffalo" [...] version in a 1987 book, claims he had heard the sentence as a child ("before 1972, to be sure") and had assumed it was part of common parlance.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} unsuccessful attempts in the 60 years since its discovery to crack the letters found {{at the rear of}} the book, including efforts by military and naval intelligence, mathematicians, and amateur code crackers.

[...] (the former nurse lived in Moseley Street which is the main road through Glenelg). A 2014 analysis by <b>computational</b> <b>linguist</b> John Rehling strongly supports the theory that the letters consist of the initials of some English text, but finds no match for these in a large survey of literature, and concludes that the letters were likely written as a form of shorthand, not as a code, and that the original text can likely never be determined.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>computational</b> <b>linguists</b> were {{disenchanted with}} the print {{dictionaries}} {{as a resource}} for computational linguistics because they lacked sufficient syntactic and semantic information for computer programs.

40|$|How do {{speakers}} {{refer to}} entities? This {{question has been}} addressed by both psycholinguists and <b>computational</b> <b>linguists.</b> A referring expression is typically defined as one which is produced {{in order to identify}} an object or set of objects for a listener or reader, in a relevant domain of discourse. In spite of several decades of research on the topic, our understanding of it is still incomplete, in part {{due to a lack of}} communication between psycholinguists and <b>computational</b> <b>linguists,</b> a remarkable state of affairs given the substantial overlap in the topics that these practitioners have investigated.

40|$|There is {{currently}} considerable interest among <b>computational</b> <b>linguists</b> in grammatical formalisms with highly restricted generative power. This paper concerns {{the relationship between}} the class of string languages generated by several such formalisms viz. Combinatory Categorial Grammars, Head Grammars, Linear Indexed Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars. Each of these formalisms is known to generate a larger class of languages than Context-Free Grammars. The four formalisms under consideration were developed independently and appear superficially to be quite different from one another. The result presented in this paper is that all four of the formalisms under consideration generate exactly the same class of string languages. 1 Introduction There {{is currently}} considerable interest among <b>computational</b> <b>linguists</b> in grammatical formalisms with highly restricted generative power. This is based on the argument that a grammar formalism should not merely be viewed as a notation, but as part o [...] ...|$|R
