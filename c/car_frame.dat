25|$|Kart racing or karting is {{a variant}} of an open-wheel motor sport with simple, small four-wheeled {{vehicles}} called karts, go-karts, or gearbox karts depending on the design. Karts vary widely in speed and some can reach speeds exceeding 160mph, while go-karts intended {{for the general public}} in amusement parks may be limited to speeds of no more than 15mph. In the summer of 1956, hot rod veteran Art Ingels built the first go-kart out of old <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> tubing, welding beads, and a lawnmower motor, not realizing that he had invented a new sport and form of auto racing.|$|E
2500|$|The Composite derived {{its name}} from its build as a [...] "protected wooden car." [...] The <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> was made of steel, while the car body itself was made from wood encased in a layer of copper sheathing. The copper skin was {{intended}} to protect {{the car in the}} event of a fire in the subway. Therefore the result was a body composed of several materials (as in a Composite material) and became known simply as a [...] "Composite." ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "torque" [...] that is {{referred}} to in the name is not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car, but that applied by the wheels. The design problem that the torque tube solves is how to get the traction forces generated by the wheels to the <b>car</b> <b>frame.</b> The [...] "torque tube" [...] transmits this force by directly coupling the axle differential to the transmission and therefore propels the car forward by pushing on the engine/transmission and then through the engine mounts to the <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> [...]|$|E

50|$|The <b>car's</b> <b>frame</b> {{is mainly}} carbon-fiber {{reinforced}} plastic, which {{allows it to}} be lightweight yet strong. The engine is 500 cc and sits under the rear two of four seats, driving the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Industry: Norbert Enning, Ulrich Klages, Heinrich Timm, Gundolf Kreis, Alois Feldschmid, Christian Dornberg and Karl Reiter, Audi (Germany) for revolutionising {{automotive}} manufacturing {{by making}} <b>car</b> <b>frames</b> lighter and safer {{through the use}} of aluminium.|$|R
5|$|The biggest {{structural}} change was {{a support system}} attached to the <b>car's</b> <b>frame.</b> The support system runs {{the length of the}} running boards and allows the increased weight of cheerleaders or Reck Club members standing on the runningboards.|$|R
50|$|A major {{market for}} {{galvannealed}} steel is the automobile industry. In the 1990s galvannealled coatings where used by Honda, Toyota and Ford, with hot dip galvanized, electrogalvanized and other coatings (e.g. Zn-Ni) {{being used by}} other manufacturers, with variations depending on the part within the <b>car</b> <b>frame,</b> as well as due to local price differences.|$|E
50|$|A port {{based on}} the Eubanks/Raffertyversion was gong {{to be made for}} the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) {{developed}} by PopCap and published by the now-defunct video game company Gametek in the 1980s, however, it was scrapped later in development. In the picture of the box art, it features the <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> when it was added to the CBS Daytime version as the short-lived syndicated version got the axe in 1987.|$|E
50|$|The Coupe Express {{was created}} by using the Studebaker Dictator {{passenger}} <b>car</b> <b>frame,</b> running gear, and front sheet metal. A new body stamping was made to form the cab back. An all-steel pickup box was built for the pickup models. The model was sold as a cab and chassis, with rear fenders attached, so a service box could be fabricated by the end user (such as a plumber, or depot hack).|$|E
40|$|This work {{focussed}} on how {{tubular steel}} structures {{similar to that}} in frontal <b>car</b> <b>frames</b> deform under crash conditions. The novelty comes from finding three crash modes: axial crush, transitional and global bending. Each mode was categorised by reaction force and energy absorption, this allowing for better structural design practices...|$|R

50|$|A routine {{inspection}} during the train's stop in New York City, inspectors later said, found the angle cock in the correct, open position. But an after-accident {{investigation by the}} ICC revealed that {{the handle of the}} angle cock {{at the rear of the}} third coach was not in the correct position, as a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of the angle cock valve to come into contact with the <b>car</b> <b>frame,</b> causing the valve to close. This meant that the engine could only activate the braking power of the first three coaches.|$|E
50|$|The Ann Arbor Railroad of Michigan {{developed}} {{a system of}} making cars secure that was adopted by many other lines. Screw jacks {{were placed on the}} corners of the railcar and the car was raised slightly to take its weight off of its wheels. Chains and turnbuckles were placed around the <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> and hooked onto the rails and tightened. Clamps were placed behind the wheels on the rails. Deckhands engaged in continual inspection and tightening of the gear during the crossing. This system effectively held the cars in place when the ship encountered rough weather.|$|E
50|$|Lincoln {{began to}} {{manufacture}} what became their first principal product - coal mine <b>car</b> <b>frames</b> including the axles using anti-friction bearings {{supplied by the}} Hyatt Roller Bearing Company. The company quickly became a standard in the industry. It was the roller bearing designed by Hyatt coupled with Lincoln's design for the car itself that made the product successful.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{automotive}} restoration process, repair of the <b>car's</b> <b>frame</b> is important since in serves {{as the foundation for}} the entire <b>car.</b> The <b>frame</b> should be inspected for straightness, twisting, alignment, rust damage, stress fractures, collision damage and condition of the mounting points for the body, suspension, and other components. Any problems must be repaired, which can be a costly process. For many popular <b>cars,</b> replacement <b>frames</b> can be purchased from parts suppliers specializing in that make of vehicle. This is often a better option than investing money into a severely damaged frame. Depending on the frame construction, mud and water can make their way inside the frame and cause rusting from the inside out, so it can be seriously weakened with little or no external sign. This, and the fact that many replacement chassis/frames are galvanised, provides sound additional reasons to consider a replacement frame.|$|R
5000|$|By 1921, The Kahler Co. was {{exclusively}} manufacturing wooden [...] "open body" [...] (without doors) automobile {{frames and}} components for the Ford Motor Company, {{and had an}} annual production capacity of 93,000 <b>car</b> <b>frames,</b> many shipped directly from the New Albany factory to the Louisville, Kentucky Ford Assembly Plant (then located at Third Street and Eastern Parkway) for use in Model T production.|$|R
50|$|A five-point harness {{is a form}} of {{seat belt}} that {{contains}} five straps that are mounted to the <b>car</b> <b>frame.</b> It has been engineered for an increase of safety in the occurrence of an automobile accident. As a result, this form of seat belt has been mandated in the race car competition of NASCAR. This was an invention made mandatory to have due to the high velocities involved in the sport. Along with the design of the seat belt, helmet straps have been designed to increase the safety of the driver. This invention has also been used to secure infants and young children in child safety seats.|$|E
5000|$|There, {{they find}} a <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> with [...] "Zborowski" [...] written on it as well. Jem finally realizes that Chitty has been taking them around the world so they can collect her old {{bodywork}} and put her back together. A local mechanic takes all the parts {{and is able to}} put Chitty back the way she was before the Tootings found her. They drive Chitty into the sky to search for their parents. They soon find their parents and decide to head home to finish Chitty's repairs. Along the way, they learn a little more about Chitty, as well as the family that owned her before them: The Pott Family.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "'caruggy'" [...] or tarapopp is a {{specialized}} off-road vehicle. Caruggy is a portmanteau {{of the words}} car and buggy. Some {{people think that the}} caruggy nomenclature is derived from using a <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> {{as the basis for the}} vehicle, whereas a [...] "buggy" [...] would have started from the chassis of a Volkswagen Bug. Actually the [...] "caruggy" [...] is the [...] "unlimited class", full tube chassis brainchild of Tim Lawrence (TLR Performance Fabrication) of El Cajon, Ca. With the help of Travis Rojas (the co driver). It is a morph between a [...] "Trophy car" [...] and a [...] "Race Buggy". It is simply put, a giant front engined race buggy, like a car. Race buggies were historically rear engine.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, the {{traction}} motor is three-point suspended between the bogie frame and the driven axle; this {{is referred to}} as a [...] "nose-suspended {{traction motor}}". The problem with such an arrangement is that a portion of the motor's weight is unsprung, increasing unwanted forces on the track. In the case of the famous Pennsylvania Railroad GG1, two bogie-mounted motors drove each axle through a quill drive. The [...] "Bi-Polar" [...] electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. In the case of French TGV power cars, a motor mounted to the power <b>car’s</b> <b>frame</b> drives each axle; a [...] "tripod" [...] drive allows a small amount of flexibility in the drive train allowing the trucks bogies to pivot. By mounting the relatively heavy traction motor directly to the power <b>car's</b> <b>frame</b> rather than to the bogie, better dynamics are obtained allowing better high-speed operation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As a {{new type}} of automobile, solar cars lack the data of {{relevant}} assemblies. The frame requirements of solar cars are also different from the traditional ones. In this paper, a specific analysis of the vibration characteristics of the solar <b>car's</b> <b>frame</b> has been made, and an improvement is carried out to ensure the comfort and handling stability. It provides a theoretical basis {{for the study of the}} solar car...|$|R
50|$|The term {{coach trimmer}} {{derives from the}} days when <b>car</b> <b>frames</b> were {{produced}} by manufacturers and delivered to coach builders to add a car body and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, soft tops, and roof linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were often an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.|$|R
5000|$|Harm {{lives in}} a small Washington, D.C. loft {{apartment}} north of Union Station that he renovated himself. During the first few seasons of JAG, he smoked Cuban cigars occasionally but then later quit as {{he did not like}} being addicted to them. He owned a classic red 1968 Corvette, but it was stolen; he would later recover the <b>car</b> <b>frame.</b> He later [...] "rebuilt" [...] it (the steering wheel he bought was from his original car) with help from his friend Commander Sturgis Turner, whom he met during their academy days, Harm once thought the car had been stolen, but Sturgis had taken it from his garage to get a new top placed onto it. Later, it suffered damage from a collision with an old woman attempting insurance fraud.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, the Hotchkiss drive has the {{traction}} forces {{transmitted to}} the <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> by using other suspension components such as leaf springs or trailing arms. A ball and socket type of joint called a [...] "torque ball" [...] is used {{at one end of}} the torque tube to allow relative motion between the axle and transmission due to suspension travel. Later AMC/Rambler models (1962 through 1966) used a flange and cushion mount in place of the ball and socket. Since the torque tube does not constrain the axle in the lateral (side-to-side) direction a panhard rod is often used for this purpose. The combination of the panhard rod and the torque tube allows the easy implementation of soft coil springs in the rear to give good ride quality [...]|$|E
50|$|The IMCA-style modifieds {{are easy}} to {{identify}} as a whole, but distinguishing between the sanctioning bodies is all but impossible. The bodies are very flat on the sides, and lack the downforce generating tunnels the DIRTcar modifieds sport. The driver sits on the left side. One of the most notable differences between the IMCA-style modifieds and other modified series cars, {{is the use of}} stock production <b>car</b> <b>frame</b> sections as part of the racing chassis. These cars also race on smaller tires than the other types of modifieds, with most sanctioning bodies specifying the same tire. The IMCA Sportmods appear very similar to their brethren, but have distinctly different engines. The Afco KidModz appear the same as the others, but sport full tube chassis, and by rules, have to have Ford 2300 cc inline 4-cylinder engines.|$|E

50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} <b>car's</b> <b>frame.</b> From 1932 the brake vacuum servo motor was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professional}} car {{industry was}} negatively and profoundly impacted by three {{factors in the}} late 1970s. At the time, many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles, called [...] "combinations." [...] Combinations disappeared from general service in the late 1970s. The downsizing of America's biggest luxury cars, beginning with the 1977 model year, forced major changes upon professional car builders, who were dependent upon <b>car</b> <b>frames</b> purchased from General Motors and Ford Motor Company to begin their conversion processes.|$|R
