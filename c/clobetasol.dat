5000|$|Betamethasone dipropionate was {{patented}} by Merck in 1987 as an augmented cream/lotion, Diprolene in the U.S., and Disprosone in Europe. These patents expired in 2003 and 2007 respectively leading to generic production of betamethasone dipropionate.

5000|$|Treatments include class I topical steroids (<b>clobetasol,</b> halobetasol, etc.) {{which in}} some studies {{have proven to be}} equally {{effective}} as systemic, or pill, therapy and somewhat safer. [...] However, in difficult-to-manage or widespread cases, systemic prednisone and powerful steroid-free immunosuppressant medications, such as methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, may be appropriate. Antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin may also control the disease, particularly in patients who cannot use corticosteroids.

50|$|The most {{accepted}} way {{to treat}} PG is {{with the use of}} corticosteroids, i.e. prednisone; and/or topical steroids, i.e. <b>clobetasol</b> and betamethasone. Suppressing the immune system with corticosteroids helps by decreasing the number of antibodies attacking the skin. Treating PG can be difficult and can take several months. Some cases of PG persist for many years. In the post partum period, if necessary, the full range of immunosuppressive treatment may be administered for cases unresponsive to corticosteroid treatments, such as tetracyclines, nicotinamide, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, goserelin, azathioprine, dapsone, rituximumab, or plasmaphoresis, or intravenous immunoglobulin may sometimes be considered when the symptoms are severe.|$|E

50|$|In {{cases of}} severe hair loss, limited {{success has been}} {{achieved}} by using the corticosteroids <b>clobetasol</b> or fluocinonide, corticosteroid injections, or cream. The cream is not as effective and it takes longer {{in order to see}} results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications that have been used are minoxidil, Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream), irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar), and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin, sometimes in different combinations. Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs, which are the treatment target, and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously. Oral corticosteroids decrease the hair loss, but only for the period during which they are taken, and these drugs can cause serious side effects.|$|E
50|$|Lichen sclerosus {{is another}} {{common cause of}} vulvitis in children, and it often affects an {{hourglass}} or figure eight-shaped area of skin around the anus and vulva. Symptoms of a mild case include skin fissures, loss of skin pigment (hypopigmentation), skin atrophy, a parchment-like texture to the skin, dysuria, itching, discomfort, and excoriation. In more severe cases, the vulva may become discolored, developing dark purple bruising (ecchymosis), bleeding, scarring, attenuation of the labia minora, and fissures and bleeding affecting the posterior fourchette. Its cause is unknown, but likely genetic or autoimmune, and it is unconnected to malignancy in children. If the skin changes are not obvious on visual inspection, a biopsy of the skin may be performed to acquire an exact diagnosis. Treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosis may consist of topical hydrocortisone in mild cases, or stronger topical steroids (e.g. <b>clobetasol</b> propionate). Preliminary studies show that 75% of cases do not resolve with puberty.|$|E

5000|$|... 11Î±-Hydroxyprogesterone (11Î±-OHP), or 11Î±-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione is an {{endogenous}} steroid and metabolite of progesterone. It is a weak antiandrogen, and is {{devoid of}} androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic activity. It was investigated as a topical antiandrogen {{for the treatment}} of androgen-dependent skin conditions in the early 1950s, and was found to produce some benefit. In 1995, 11Î±-OHP, along with its epimer 11Î²-hydroxyprogesterone, was identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11Î²-HSD). It is notably not metabolized by 11Î²-HSD2. 11Î±-OHP is a more potent inhibitor of 11Î²-HSD than enoxolone (glycyrrhetinic acid) or carbenoxolone in vitro (IC50 = 0.9 nM; IC50 = 5 nM in transfected cells). The compound {{has been found to be}} highly active in conferring mineralocorticoid sodium-retaining activity of corticosterone in vivo in rat bioassays and in increasing blood pressure, effects that it mediates by preventing the 11Î²-HSD-mediated inactivation of endogenous corticosteroids. Because of its inhibition of 11Î²-HSD and consequent potentiation of corticosteroids, 11Î±-OHP has recently been patented {{for the treatment of}} skin diseases, particularly psoriasis in combination with <b>clobetasol</b> propionate and minoxidil.|$|E

The mean recovery of studied <b>clobetasol</b> propionate ranges from 98. 7 to 101. 0 %.

40|$|Background: No {{controlled}} data {{is available}} till date comparing topical tazarotene and <b>clobetasol</b> in Indian psoriatic patients. Objective: The {{aim was to}} compare the clinical efficacy of 12 weeks of once-daily tazarotene 0. 1 &#x 0025; cream with that of once-daily <b>clobetasol</b> propionate 0. 05 &#x 0025; cream {{in the treatment of}} patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: About 36 patients with bilaterally symmetrical lesions were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled study. A left-right randomized study was conducted. Results: <b>Clobetasol</b> cream was better than tazarotene cream in reducing the erythema throughout the treatment period with statistically significant differences favoring <b>clobetasol</b> at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (P &# 60; 0. 05). Tazarotene was better in reducing the induration at weeks 2 (P &# 60; 0. 05), 4, 10 and 12. <b>Clobetasol</b> cream was better in reducing the scaling throughout the treatment period with statistically significant differences favoring <b>clobetasol</b> over the entire treatment period. Treatment success rate was 100 &#x 0025; with <b>clobetasol</b> and 88 &#x 0025; with tazarotene at the end of week 12 with <b>clobetasol</b> achieving 100 &#x 0025; success rate at the end of week 6. Treatment with tazarotene resulted in uniform reduction of plaque elevation and was not associated with the development of hot spots. Conclusion: Topical tazarotene 0. 1 &#x 0025; cream is less effective than topical <b>clobetasol</b> propionate 0. 05 &#x 0025; cream in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. It has more effect on induration than on erythema and scaling of psoriatic lesions...|$|E

METHODS:Fifty-four patients (34 males and 20 females) {{with a history of}} vesiculo-ulcero-erosive oral lesions were selected: 24 with oral erosive lichen planus and 30 with aphthae. The subjects enrolled were randomly divided into three groups, each of 18 patients (10 with aphthae and 8 with lichen planus) : the first was treated with topical <b>clobetasol</b> propionate ointment (0. 05 %) directly on the lesion(s) three times a day; the second with <b>clobetasol</b> propionate in an adhesive denture paste in equal amounts (1 : 1) two times a day; the third with <b>clobetasol</b> propionate in an oral analgesic base (Orabase-B) in equal amounts (1 : 1) two times a day. Each subject scored his or her symptoms daily from most severe (7) to none (0) by verbal assessments using a categorical scale. RESULTS:In all cases, the administration of the corticosteroid was effective in producing remission of symptoms in each group of patients. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) between groups were determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Dunn test was used in order to detect which group differs from the others; <b>clobetasol</b> and adhesive denture paste correlated with an early remission of pain in lichen and apthous lesions. CONCLUSION:The results suggest that topical application of <b>clobetasol</b> in an adhesive denture paste is an effective drug for symptomatic oral vesiculo-erosive and/or ulcerative lesions...|$|E
