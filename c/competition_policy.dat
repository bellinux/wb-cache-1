25|$|In its {{late 1990s}} incarnation, One Nation called for zero net immigration, {{an end to}} {{multiculturalism}} and a revival of Australia's Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition which it says has been diminished, the abolition of native title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an end to special Aboriginal funding programs, opposition to Aboriginal reconciliation which the party says will create two nations, and {{a review of the}} 1967 constitutional referendum which gave the Commonwealth power to legislate for Aborigines. The party's economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation's influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, <b>competition</b> <b>policy,</b> and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people's bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia's United Nations membership, a repudiation of Australia's UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.|$|E

We present an analysis of interrelationship between technology and competition within evolutionary approach in three dimensions: (1) International Division of Labor, (2) Global Market System, (3) Dependency. Government intervention in the technology and competition processes is vital for developing countries. Moreover, national policies are not adequate, common acts applied by inter and supra national institutions are necessary. Through this aspect, documenting the common science and technology policies applied and results achieved in European Union and Turkey, we compare Turkey with new member states of EU.

40|$|As {{international}} economic integration has progressed, policy makers {{have started to}} ponder the possible conflicts arising from nationally pursued <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> in more unified goods markets. An idea underlying much of this discussion {{is the notion that}} international trade liberalisation, by limiting countries' abilities to promote their self-interest with beggar-thy-neighbour trade policies, will induce countries to instead use <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> to pursue the same goals. We argue that one should not expect to find any particular relationship between trade policy and merger policy.

40|$|Choice and <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> {{in public}} {{services}} are popular reform strategies in many European countries. Using {{the case of}} health care in the UK, this article analyses the effects of choice and <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> by using subjective well-being (SWB) as an indicator of welfare and equity. Existing literature on welfare effects is focused on measuring efficiency and quality and it is here that SWB offers an alternative perspective. In this article, I use SWB to assess the welfare effects of the choice of hospital policy in the English NHS. Choice preferences are then analysed with a particular focus on the views of different social groups and the results are related to the overall welfare effects of choice with the purpose of capturing equity effects. Results indicate overall positive welfare effects of choice and competition with marked differences between social groups. While it is groups with lower income and lower education that state a higher demand choice, the positive welfare effects I identify are felt most strongly by high income and high education groups. The results highlight the previously debated equity problem arising from choice and <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> in health care...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2009, the Republic of Cyprus blocked 6 {{chapters}} of Turkish accession negotiations, including those on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Energy and Education and Culture, arguing that Turkey needs to first normalise relations with Cyprus.

Hence, {{there is no}} chapter Turkey can open other than the difficult and economically detrimental chapters <b>Competition</b> <b>Policy,</b> Social Policy and Employment, and Public Procurement that most candidate countries open {{at the end of}} accession as all other chapters are blocked. In February 2013, Turkish Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry for EU Affairs, Burak Erdenir, claimed that the EU had yet to communicate to Turkey the benchmark criteria for opening chapters 23 and 24, Judiciary & Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom & Security, which was to be done after screening of the chapters was completed in 2006, thus making it impossible to comply with them. [...] He also suggested this was a deliberate attempt to slow their accession process.|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{the central role}} economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood among the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon: [...] "While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."

40|$|This paper studies, in {{the context}} of a New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM) model, the effects of "public {{competition}} policies" aimed at improving the efficiency of public spending. Such measures are modeled as an increase in the price elasticity of public consumption. The paper finds that public <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> significantly affect macroeconomic interdependence across countries. Following a domestic fiscal expansion, an higher public price elasticity increases the substitutability between goods purchased by the domestic and the foreign governments. The same exchange rate variation can therefore sustain larger shifts in relative demand for goods. The expenditure-switching effect is magnified, implying a larger change in relative output. In welfare terms, countries with a larger government sector have an incentive to promote public <b>competition</b> <b>policies.</b> Government expenditures;Economic models;fiscal shock, <b>competition</b> <b>policies,</b> public spending, government spending, elasticity of substitution, fiscal expansion, open economy, aggregate demand, fiscal policy, fiscal shocks, domestic consumption, domestic economy, political economy, government expenditure, fiscal expansions, domestic firms, size of public spending, budget constraint, competitive pressure, fiscal affairs, unit of labor, level of public spending, fiscal affairs department, nominal interest rate, imperfect competition, aggregate consumption, world economy, market integration...|$|R

40|$|The report {{focuses on}} the complementarities between trade, {{investment}} and <b>competition</b> <b>policies</b> and analyses how policy coherence can be promoted in these three important areas that shape incentives for firms and individuals to be more productive and for markets to be more competitive. It also deals with the potential inconsistencies or tensions that may arise between trade, investment and competition reforms and how to ease them. It shows that specific policy goals can be achieved while maintaining an open and procompetitive environment. Overall, the analysis highlights the role of governments in providing the right incentives to facilitate the adjustment to the internationalisation of production and the important synergies between policies that can be exploited to promote growth. It {{is not only the}} case in contestable markets but also in the context of market failures where pro-competitive policies can address specific distortions and mitigate the adverse effects of reforms.
