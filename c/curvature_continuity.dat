40|$|The {{tool path}} {{composed}} of consecutive short linear segments (G 01 blocks) {{is still the}} widespread tool path representation form in five-axis machining. The inherent shortcoming of linear tool path is first-order discontinuity at the corner, which is the bottleneck to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy machining. In this article, a dual-Bézier path smoothing algorithm for five-axis linear tool path in workpiece coordinate system is proposed. There are three steps involved in our method. First, the corner error distribution model is introduced to assign the given tolerance to the smoothing approximation error constraint and the chord error constraint to ensure the interpolation trajectory error within the given tolerance. Second, segment junctions of the linear tool path in workpiece coordinate system are smoothed by double G 2 continuous cubic Bézier curves. One cubic Bézier curve is used to round {{the corner of the}} tool tip point path, and the other Bézier curve is used to round the corner of the tool axis point path. This algorithm takes the conditions of approximation error constraint, the parameterized synchronization constraint, and continuous curvature constraint into consideration. Hence, the tangency and <b>curvature</b> <b>continuities</b> are both guaranteed in the new path. Third, an adaptive feedrate scheduling method is introduced to interpolate the new path. Simulation and experiment are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in five-axis tool path smoothing, speed smoothing, and trajectory accuracy controlling...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} law of creep {{of concrete}} at constant humidity and temperature is proposed. The well-known double power law gives too high a final slope of creep curves compared to available test data. This is remedied by a new formula which exhibits a continuous tran-sition from a power curve to a straight line in the logarithm of creep duration. The straight line has the same slope for all ages at loading, and the higher the age at loading, the longer is the duration at which the transition occurs. The exponent of the initial power curve is higher than that used in the double power law and is much too high {{in comparison with the}} existing test results for very short load dura-tions in the dynamic range. This penalty, however, is outweighed by better extrapolation to very long load durations. The new formula significantly restricts the occurrence of divergence of creep curves at various ages at loading but does not eliminate it completely unless closeness of data fit is sacrificed. The new formula also greatly re-duces the occurrence of negative values at the end of calculated stress relaxation curves. Extensive statistical analysis of most test data available in the lit-erature reveals a relatively modest improvement in the overall coeffi-cient of variation for the deviations of the formula from test data and a significant improvement for the deviations of the final slope from its measured value. The same improvements were achieved in an ear-lier study in which the transition from the power law to the logarith-mic law was abrupt, with a discontinuity in <b>curvature.</b> The <b>continuity</b> of <b>curvature</b> in the present formulation is desirable for applications in data extrapolation...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a B-spline path synthesis approach for nonholonomic car-like vehicles. Recent findings in robotic research suggest that C 2 continuity is a realistic representation of robotic paths. A novel solution that guarantees C 2 parametric continuity for a cubic path, whilst satisfying kinodynamic constraints {{imposed on the}} vehicle, is proposed here.

This paper addresses two key issues in robot motion planning; path <b>continuity</b> and maximum <b>curvature</b> constraint for nonholonomic robots. The {{advantage of this}} new method {{is that it allows}} robots to account for their constraints in an efficient manner that facilitates real-time planning. B-spline curves are leveraged for their robustness and practical synthesis to model the vehicle&# 039;s path. Comparative navigational-based analyses are presented to selected appropriate curve and nominate its parameters. Path continuity is achieved by utilizing a single path, to represent the trajectory, with no limitations on path, or orientation. The path parameters are formulated with respect to the robot&# 039;s constraints. Maximum curvature is satisfied locally, in every segment using a smoothing algorithm, if needed. It is demonstrated that any local modifications of single sections have minimal effect on the entire path. Rigorous simulations are presented, to highlight the benefits of the proposed method, in comparison to existing approaches with regards to <b>continuity,</b> <b>curvature</b> control, path length and resulting acceleration.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} several {{applications of}} computational topology to the visualization of scalar fields. Scalar field data come from different measurements and simulations. The intrinsic properties {{of this kind}} of data, which make the visualization of it to a complicated task, are the large size and presence of noise. Computational topology is a powerful tool for automatic feature extraction, which allows the user to interpret the information contained in the dataset in a more efficient way. Utilizing it one can make the main purpose of scientific visualization, namely extracting knowledge from data, a more convenient task. Volume rendering is a class of methods designed for realistic visual representation of 3 D scalar fields. It is used {{in a wide range of}} applications with different data size, noise rate and requirements on interactivity and flexibility. At the moment there is no known technique which can meet the needs of every application domain, therefore development of methods solving specific problems is required. One of such algorithms, designed for rendering of noisy data with high frequencies is presented in the first part of this thesis. The method works with multidimensional transfer functions and is especially suited for functions exhibiting sharp features. Compared with known methods the presented algorithm achieves better visual quality with a faster performance in presence of mentioned features. An improvement on the method utilizing a topological theory, Morse theory, and a topological construct, Morse-Smale complex, is also presented in this part of the thesis. The improvement allows for performance speedup at a little precomputation and memory cost. The usage of topological methods for feature extraction on a real world dataset often results in a very large feature space which easily leads to information overflow. Topology simplification is designed to reduce the number of features and allow a domain expert to concentrate on the most important ones. In the terms of Morse theory features are represented by critical points. An importance measure which is usually used for removing critical points is called homological persistence. Critical points are cancelled pairwise according to their homological persistence value. In the presence of outlier-like noise homological persistence has a clear drawback: the outliers get a high importance value assigned and therefore are not being removed. In the second part of this thesis a new importance measure is presented which is especially suited for data with outliers. This importance measure is called scale space persistence. The algorithm for the computation of this measure is based on the scale space theory known from the area of computer vision. The development of a critical point in scale space gives information about its spacial extent, therefore outliers can be distinguished from other critical points. The usage of the presented importance measure is demonstrated on a real world application, crater identification on a surface of Mars. The third part of this work presents a system for general interactive topology analysis and exploration. The development of such a system is motivated by the fact that topological methods are often considered to be complicated and hard to understand, because application of topology for visualization requires deep understanding of the mathematical background behind it. A domain expert exploring the data using topology for feature extraction needs an intuitive way to manipulate the exploration process. The presented system is based on an intuitive notion of a scene graph, where the user can choose and place the component blocks to achieve an individual result. This way the domain expert can extract more knowledge from given data independent on the application domain. The tool gives the possibility for calculation and simplification of the underlying topological structure, Morse-Smale complex, and also the visualization of parts of it. The system also includes a simple generic query language to acquire different structures of the topological structure at different levels of hierarchy. The fourth part of this dissertation is concentrated on an application of computational geometry for quality assessment of a triangulated surface. Quality assessment of a triangulation is called surface interrogation and is aimed for revealing intrinsic irregularities of a surface. <b>Curvature</b> and <b>continuity</b> are the properties required to design a visually pleasing geometric object. For example, a surface of a manufactured body usually should be convex without bumps of wiggles. Conventional rendering methods hide the regions of interest because of smoothing or interpolation. Two new methods which are presented here: curvature estimation using local fitting with B´ezier patches and computation of reflection lines for visual representation of continuity, are specially designed for assessment problems. The examples and comparisons presented in this part of the thesis prove the benefits of the introduced algorithms. The methods are also well suited for concurrent visualization of the results from simulation and surface interrogation to reveal the possible intrinsic relationship between them...|$|R
