5000|$|The Martin I (649-653) frescoes are few but {{reasonably}} preserved. These in Hellenistic {{style as}} it had fully eclipsed the traditional Roman style {{by the time he}} entered office, which was after the Byzantines had taken over. [...] Roman style was much less detailed: no contour lines or shading and very subdued backgrounds. The earliest Martin I decorations are the Church Fathers AD 649 who are expressing movement by having a leg lifted in the walking motion while their robes are draped and highlighted to exaggerate this effect. [...] The Church Fathers are exemplifying more fluidity with their tunics swirling than compared to later frescoes but their faces are much stiffer, also compared to later frescoes. [...] The precise date is referenced by a Greek inscription below as pertaining to the Lateran Council of 649 that condemned Monothelitism. [...] Martin I was ultimately exiled for his condemnation of Monothelitism but John VII commissioned his image to be painted in the Presbytery (see map) with other images of popes in Santa Maria Antiqua. [...] Martin I is depicted in Hellenistic fashion by white brush strokes shading his brown facial hair that is painted on a heavily contoured, emaciated jaw and he carries a jewelled book. [...] He wears an ecclesiastical hairstyle that is balding, short and has a <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> of hair around the forehead. [...] Martin I's eyes are not staring straight ahead with jet-black pupils as was typical of contemporaries, instead they are gazing downward and individualized. [...] Most notably is that Martin I and John VII's images are clothed in the same colour paenula of light yellow with green underlay showing through, suggesting a sort of solidarity among the popes against the Byzantines, using art to convey political messages that the Byzantine decision to exile Martin I was wrong.|$|E

The case of car hijacking has become so rampant that it has become a threat to the world leaders. Some of them cannot drive their expensive cars without escort plus the sounding of siren to scare the evil perpetrators. The necessity of car security cannot be overemphasized by car owners due to high cost of purchasing car nowadays. Car security system using GSM and Electronic circuit had been designed, which can operate in two ways: receiving signal / command from the car owner through the mobile phone or by taken decision by itself using electronic circuit. The signal received through the mobile phone that serves as input to the circuit and immediately sends signal through transistor TR 1 and TR 2 to the 555 timer IC 1 to other transistors in the circuit and output of one transistor serves as input signal to another. The output signal from the PIC 16 F 84 A or CD 4017 demobilized the <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> system and brain box of the car. The demobilized <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> system and brain box can be reset by calling or sending another signal through the mobile phone to reset the brain box...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Large-scale {{distributed}} systems often require scalable and fault-tolerant mechanisms to coordinate exclusive access to shared {{resources such as}} files, replicas or the primary role. The best known algorithms to implement distributed mutual exclusion with leases, such as Multipaxos, are complex, difficult to implement, and rely on stable storage to persist lease information. In this paper we present FLEASE, an algorithm for faulttolerant lease coordination in {{distributed systems}} that is simpler than Multipaxos and does not rely on stable storage. The evaluation shows that FLEASE {{can be used to}} implement scalable, decentralized lease coordination that outperforms a <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> service implementation by an order of magnitude.

The part is made of galvanized steel sheet metal, sheet metal thickness 3 mm. The part has a spatial shape with holes. Expected manufacture series is 25 000 per year. Bassed on literary studies and manufacture requirements on the clasp, the method of cutting combinated with stamping in combined tool was found the most optimal. The final shape of clasp will be done in three steps. The nobel steel 12 050, which performs required mechanical properties, was chosen as the main material for clasp manufacture. The manufacture will be made by eccentric press LEXN 100 C. The expected price of the clasp is 9, 7 CZK per piece with counting the procurement price of metallurgical semi-finished product and the tool...|$|E

Election is the problem of choosing a unique processor as the leader of a network. Such an election is very important in token regeneration in token ring, token bus, and FDDI networks, for concurrency control, to replace a malfunctioning or crashed <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> coordinator in a distributed data system, and to replace a primary site in a replicated file system. A network of processors is said to be of the order k if each of the processors is connected to exactly k processors. There are several known election algorithm for bounded degree asynchronous networks of the order two. In general, the algorithms for all these networks require a message complexity of 0 (n log n) messages. There are also election algorithms for asynchronous mesh networks, which are of the order four, that require 0 (n) messages. A natural question arises, therefore, if there exits any election algorithm with message complexity 0 (n) for a network of the order three. In this thesis, we develop a network and an algorithm that answer the question in the affirmative...|$|E
40|$|The Permit based Locking {{design pattern}} {{provides}} fast acquisition and release of locks without network communication even in distributed systems build around a <b>central</b> <b>lock</b> server. Instead of plain locks, the server manages "permits to lock", and passes them to those clients which probably need the lock next. If a client hosts a permit, the associated lock can be acquired immediately without server interaction. If a permit asked for {{is not present}} at the server but at some other client, it can be revoked. Lock-Permit, Distributed Locking A network management system provides access to a pile of telecommunication hardware. The switches, routers and transmission units are supervised and controlled by human operators as well as automated network administration tools. Since the hardware components are highly distributed, a central server carries {{a model of the}} complex network. The set of hardware components is, depending on the workload, temporally organized into subsections, each with an operator assigned to it. Therefore, there is almost no potential for collisions when accessing the components. But since they are still possible, it is necessary to serialize the access to the hardware in order to prevent interference between different operators or tools. This is done by means of locking capabilities, also provided by the central model server. Although seldom a real benefit, the pessimistic lock acquisition and release causes most of the network traffic, wasting a lot of communication bandwidth for "administrational " sugar, just in case … Contex...|$|E
