40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. This study {{estimated the}} mechanical {{response of the}} cochlea to pulsatile electrical stimulation of the scala tympani of the cat. The auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by an acoustic probe was forward-masked by a train of charge-balanced biphasic current pulses. Masking {{as a function of}} probe frequency reflected the excitation pattern of the response to the masker and resembled the spectrum of the electrical stimulus. Both pulse rate and pulse width influenced the degree of masking. The vibration of a region of the basilar membrane was estimated by recording the local <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> evoked by biphasic pulses. The amplitude of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> was proportional to the amplitude of the spectral component of the electrical stimulus to which the local <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> was tuned.

40|$|Background and Aim: Physiologic {{measures}} of cochlear and auditory nerve function {{may be of}} assis¬tance in distinguishing between hearing disorders due primarily to auditory nerve impairment from those due primarily to cochlear hair cells dysfunction. The goal of {{present study was to}} measure of co-chlear responses (otoacoustic emissions and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics)</b> and auditory brainstem response in some adults with auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony and subjects with normal hearing. Materials and Methods: Patients were 16 adults (32 ears) in age range of 14 - 30 years with auditory neu¬ropathy/ dys-synchrony and 16 individuals in age range of 16 - 30 years from both sexes. The results of transient otoacoustic emissions, <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> and auditory brainstem response measures were compared in both groups and the effects of age, sex, ear and degree of hearing loss were studied. Results: The pure-tone average was 48. 1 dB HL in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony group and the fre¬quency of low tone loss and flat audiograms were higher among other audiogram's shapes. Transient oto¬acoustic emissions were shown in all auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony people except two cases and its average was near in both studied groups. The latency and amplitude of the biggest reversed co-chlear microphonics response were higher in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony patients than control peo¬ple significantly. The correlation between <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> amplitude and degree of hearing loss was not significant, and age had significant effect in some <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> measures. Audi-tory brainstem response had no response in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony patients even with low stim¬uli rates. Conclusion: In adults with speech understanding worsen than predicted from the degree of hearing loss that suspect to auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony, the frequency of low tone loss and flat audiograms are higher. Usually auditory brainstem response is absent in this patients and use of both otoacoustic emis¬sions and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> responses to measure cochlear hair cells function are suggested in them...|$|R

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of the mustached bat's cochlea was studied by measuring <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> and compound action potentials. In adults, a cochlear resonance is involved in enhanced tuning to the second harmonic constant frequency component (CF 2) of their echolocation calls at ~ 61 kHz This resonance is present immediately after birth in bats that do not yet echolocate. Its frequency is lower (46 kHz) and the corresponding threshold minimum of <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials is broader than in adults. Long-lasting ringing of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potential after tone stimulus offset that characterizes the adult auditory response close to CF 2 is absent in newborns. In {{the course of the}} first 5 postnatal weeks, there is a concomitant upward shift of CF 2 and the frequency of cochlear threshold minima. Up {{to the end of the}} third postnatal week, sensitivity of auditory threshold minima and the Q value of the cochlear resonance increase at a fast rate. Between 2 and 4 wk of age, two <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> threshold minima are found consistently in the CF 2 range that differ in their level-dependent dynamic growth behavior and are 1. 5 ¿ 5. 7 kHz apart from each other. In older animals, there is a single minimum that approaches adult tuning in its sharpness. The data provide evidence to show that during maturation of the cochlea, the frequency and the sensitivity of the threshold minimum associated with CF 2 increases and that these increases are associated with the fusion of two resonances that are partly dissociated in developing animals...|$|R

Elevation of pure tone thresholds in the presence of preserved inner ear function as suggested by <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> (CM), absent or markedly abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and elevation of speech perception out of proportion to the pure tone loss were found in the patients. From 28 members of a Gypsy family, we examined two siblings aged 31 and 30 years and their nephew aged 20 years, all suffering from HMSN that was associated with auditory neuropathy. All three affected members with difficulty of understanding speech had following investigations: pure tone and speech audiograms, BAEP, <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics,</b> and nerve conduction studies (NCV).

40|$|The cochlea {{converts}} sound vibration into electrical impulses and amplifies the low-level sound signal. Urethane, {{a widely}} used anesthetic in animal research, {{has been shown}} to reduce the neural responses to auditory stimuli. However, the effects of urethane on cochlea, especially on the function of outer hair cells, remain largely unknown. In the present study, we compared the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> responses between awake and urethane-anesthetized rats. The results revealed that the amplitude of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> was decreased by urethane, resulting in an increase in the threshold at all of the sound frequencies examined. To deduce the possible mechanism underlying the urethane-induced decrease in cochlear sensitivity, we examined the electrical response properties of isolated outer hair cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that urethane hyperpolarizes the outer hair cell membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner and elicits larger outward current. This urethane-induced outward current was blocked by strychnine, an antagonist of the α 9 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Meanwhile, the function of the outer hair cell motor protein, prestin, was not affected. These results suggest that urethane anesthesia is expected to decrease the responses of outer hair cells, whereas the frequency selectivity of cochlea remains unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{receptor}} potentials {{were recorded}} from {{inner and outer}} hair cells in response to low-frequency tones, from the basal, high-frequency region of the guinea-pig cochlea. The receptor potentials recorded from inner hair cells are asymmetrical about the resting membrane potential with the depolarizing phase, which corresponds to rarefaction in sound pressure, exceeding the phase of hyperpolarization {{by a factor of}} about 3. It was found that the relationship between the peak-to-peak voltage responses and sound pressure level could be described by rectangular hyperbolae. When the frequency of the sound stimulus was progressively increased from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the 'periodic' (a. c.) component of the receptor potential was attenuated with respect to the 'continuous' (d. c.) component. The characteristics of the inner hair cells could be described by two stages of low-pass filtering, with one of the filters having the same corner frequency as the electrical time constants which varied in different cells between 178 and 840 Hz. Receptor potentials recorded intracellularly from two morphologically identified outer hair cells were symmetrical about the resting membrane potential (about - 65 - 70 mV) and had a maximal amplitude of only 5 mV at frequencies and intensities which yield 20 - 30 mV voltage responses from inner hair cells. No d. c. component receptor potentials were recorded in response to high-frequency tones. Phase and amplitude measurements were made from receptor potentials from inner hair cells, and from 'cochlear microphonic potentials' which were recorded from the organ of Corti and scala tympani. The phase of depolarization in both potentials was associated with displacement of the basilar membrane towards the scala vestibuli. The phase of the intracellular receptor potentials leads the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> by about 90 degrees and the sound pressure by about 180 degrees at frequencies below 100 Hz. Above this frequency the phase lead progressively declines and at higher frequencies becomes a phase lag. These phase relationships indicate that inner hair cells respond to the velocity of the basilar membrane at frequencies below 200 - 600 Hz, and to its displacement above this, and that the voltage responses of the inner hair cells are limited by their membrane time constants. It is suggested that outer hair cells respond to basilar membrane displacement throughout their frequency range. It is shown that, with respect to frequency, the different growth rates of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials and inner hair cell receptor potentials, and the dominance of <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials in the organ of Corti, result in an effective electrical interaction between inner hair cells and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials...|$|R
