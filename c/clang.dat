5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible <b>clang)</b> and failed to explode.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would <b>clang</b> it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

25|$|In this fashion, Rush's system {{implemented}} {{a store and}} forward public message system similar to Usenet, but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such echomail forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public echos soon followed, including GAYNET and <b>CLANG.</b> These spawned hundreds of new echos, {{and led to the}} creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987. Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull <b>clang.</b> In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding. The contact pistol {{appeared to be}} malfunctioning, though the conclusion was anything but clear until running depth and magnetic exploder problems were solved. The experience of Dan Daspit (in Tinosa) was {{exactly the sort of}} live-fire trial BuOrd had been prevented from doing in peacetime. It was now clear to all at Pearl Harbor the contact pistol was also defective. Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle.|$|E
25|$|The Mark 14 {{was central}} to the torpedo scandal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force during World War II. Inadequate {{production}} planning led to severe shortages of the weapon. The frugal, Depression-era, peacetime testing of both the torpedo and its exploder was woefully inadequate and had not uncovered many serious design problems. Torpedoes were so expensive that the Navy was unwilling to perform tests that would destroy a torpedo. Furthermore, the design defects tended to mask each other. Much of the blame commonly attached to the Mark14 correctly belongs to the Mark6 exploder. These defects, {{in the course of}} fully twenty months of war, were exposed, as torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible <b>clang)</b> and failed to explode.|$|E

500|$|... decltype is {{included}} in the C++ Language Standard since C++11. It is provided by a number of compilers as an extension. Microsoft's Visual C++ 2010 and later compilers provide a decltype type specifier that closely mimics the semantics as described in the standards committee proposal. It can be used with both managed and native code. The documentation states that it is [...] "useful primarily to developers who write template libraries." [...] decltype was added to the mainline of the GCC C++ compiler in version 4.3, released on March 5, 2008. decltype is also present in Codegear's C++ Builder 2009, the Intel C++ Compiler, and <b>Clang.</b>|$|E

[...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad.
