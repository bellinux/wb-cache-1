40|$|Banks often measure <b>credit</b> and <b>interest</b> rate risk {{separately}} {{and then add}} the two risk measures to determine their overall economic capital. This approach misses complex interactions between the two risks. We develop a framework where <b>credit</b> and <b>interest</b> rate risks are analysed jointly. We focus on a traditional banking book where all positions are held to maturity and subject to book value accounting. Our simulations show that interactions between risks matter, and that their implications depend {{on the structure of}} the balance sheet and on the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. The analysis suggests that a joint analysis of risks can deliver substantially different results relative to a piece-wise approach: risk integration is challenging but feasible and worthwhile.

40|$|Turkish {{credit card}} market {{experienced}} a strong growth {{with the establishment}} of stability in the economy and the decline in the inflation rate after 2001 crisis. Turkey became the 3 rd biggest market in Europe with 32 million credit cards in 2006. However, the quick response of the <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates to the increase in the cost of funds during the 2001 crisis was not observed in the case of decreasing cost of funds afterwards. <b>Credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates stayed persistently high compared to the declining market interest rates and the interest rates in other credit markets such as home, auto or consumer credits. This study is an attempt to analyze the failure of competition in the Turkish credit card market. Moreover, a quarterly data set of the <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates of the all 22 issuers in the Turkish market is employed to provide empirical evidence for the failure of price competition in the market. The data set spans from the second quarter of 2001 to the last quarter of 2006. One-step and two-step difference and system GMM regressions are run on the panel data set.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to evaluate the full extent of price stickiness in <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates by modifying the existing asymmetric models {{so that they can be}} adopted for testing both the amount and adjustment asymmetries as well as the lagged dynamic inertia. Consistent with similar studies, banks behave asymmetrically in response to changes in the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s (RBA) target interest rate. Rate rises are passed onto the consumer faster than rate cuts and the <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rate showed a very significant degree of downward rigidity. Based on the magnitude of the pass-through parameters obtained from short-run dynamic models, rate rises had a full one-to-one and instantaneous impact on <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates.

50|$|Typically an {{economic}} expansion {{is marked by}} an upturn in production and utilization of resources. Economic recovery and prosperity are two successive phases of expansion.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the full extent}} of downward stickiness in <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rates by testing for the amount and adjustment asymmetries. We found that lenders behave asymmetrically in response to changes in the Reserve Bank of Australiaâ€™s (RBA) cash rate. The RBAâ€™s rate rises are passed on to borrowers much faster than rate cuts and the aggregate <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rate showed a very resilient degree of downward rigidity. Overall, based on the estimated short-run dynamic model, banks immediately pass on 112 % of any RBAâ€™s rate rises, but only 53. 7 % of any rate cut. In other words, the short-run effects of rate cuts were not only {{less than half of the}} rate rises but also were delayed on average by two months. As far as changes in the <b>credit</b> card <b>interest</b> rate are concerned, an expansionary monetary policy is thus less effective than a contractionary policy...|$|R

Because his second year [...] "hypothetical account" [...] starts the year with a $1200 balance, the <b>interest</b> <b>credit</b> at 6% would be $72.
