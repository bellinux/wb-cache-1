The lyricism doesn’t particularly strike me as innovative or overly thought provoking, but sometimes a voice can carry far enough on it’s own. Toss in a bit more in the category of pop hooks and we might have ourselves a winner, but for now this is a solid start and will surely find fans among those entrenched in Francesca Battistelli or fans of American Idol." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4½ stars out of 5, stating [...] "This {{is one of}} Cline's strongest and most {{innovative}} efforts". All About Jazz stated [...] "Jazz fans without an ear open to rock rhythms, energy music, or punk sensibility will almost certainly fail to appreciate what the Nels Cline Singers have done on Instrumentals. But Cline doesn't really care about that. His music is a defining statement of identity, a cry from the heart without pretense or ambiguity. For the open-minded, this record will stack up {{as one of the}} very best of the year. It's deep, exciting, and viscerally satisfying". Pitchfork Media's Sam Ubl stated [...] "While Instrumentals suffers a bit in comparison to Cline's previous studio work with the huge Destroy All Nels Cline ensemble, it's mostly because the three-piece lineup curtails some of the wild tonal exploration done on that record. Don't fret, though, these folks still have an awful lot going for them". JazzTimes' Ron Wynn noted [...] "There's <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to admire about what Nels Cline is doing on much of Instrumentals, but there's just too much chaos during those segments that don't work".|$|E

5000|$|Stereo Worxxx {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Ian Martin commented that {{while most of}} the track were catchy, he felt [...] "The wild party of 2011’s World of Fantasy still seems to be raging on into 2012, with Nakata continuing to integrate tribal and Japanese festival rhythms into his music...", citing [...] "Tapping Beats" [...] and [...] "All the Way" [...] as examples. He concluded [...] "There’s <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to take away from Stereo Worxxx, but it’s definitely a transitional album with no clear sense of direction or identity. It has material to tantalize fans of both its predecessor and Nakata’s work with Perfume, but probably not enough to satisfy either. Importantly though, it makes clear that these two poles are not irreconcilable, which could augur very well for the future." [...] Patrick St. Michel from Make Believe Melodies also felt that the music from Stereo Worxxx was comparable to World of Fantasy, and felt that songs like [...] "In the Rain" [...] and [...] "Tapping Beats" [...] ruined the albums sonic flow. However, he concluded it as a [...] "good, uncomplicated album".|$|E
5000|$|A lot {{of people}} believe that Arab Sunnis {{migrated}} to Iran for business and teaching Persians the Quran. Now, most of them believed that the migration happened when the Persian Empire was defeated and the Persians became Muslims. So presumably this happened almost 1400 years ago, during Muhammad's times or even during the Khalifa’s rule after the his death.This raises serious issues, if they lived in Iran during that time, there were no Sunnis or Shiites, there were only Muslims. When Persia turned Shiite commencing from 1501, the Huwala were there, so why did they not turn Shiite as well? Are we saying that only the Arabs stayed Sunni? Or maybe just maybe there were Persians who didn't turn Shiite, who then became Huwala. This {{puts a lot of}} holes in the theory that they migrated {{in the early days of}} Islam to teach the Persians about Islam. <b>Certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Arabs went to Persia to teach them about Islam, but it is unsure if these were the Huwala.The second point is, if they were going there for business, why did they get disconnected with their so-called Arab roots? It even makes business sense to keep those roots. Nothing remained from the Arab culture at all? Not even names?Lets for a second believe that they are from Arab origins, the question is doesn’t 1400 years (or even 500 years) of mixing with Persian blood, effectively take away the Arab bloodline ? ...|$|E

I think probably more people liked it than didn't. But there was <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of shouting and a lot of arguing, and a sound which, you can hear in a lot of ballparks.

[...] And it sounded like they were booing him. Because you don't get the articulation of the consonant, so that a crowd shouting [...] "more, more, more" [...] at the end of Dylan's three songs sounded very much like booing. I've heard recently a recording of that night, and it doesn't sound to me like booing so much as a roar, just a kind of general hubbub between songs, and during Yarrow's attempt to get Dylan back on stage... I really wouldn't be prepared to say it was 50-50, or two thirds/one third, or whatever.

However, when Kelly Chan (Theresa Wong) enrolled at Summer Bay High both boys fell for her and things turned nasty. Brummer commented [...] "There's <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of tension in the air." [...] Kelly became more interested in Shane, but when she learned that he had lied about his court appearances, she turned to Damian and they went on a date.

Like most boys, he tries to impress the lads with tales of kissing and midnight fumbles - which of course aren't true." [...] Kelly decided she was better off being single and Shane and Damian fell out with each other. Doran told a writer from Look-in that the longer Damian and Shane are friends then the more likely he is to get into trouble. he explained that {{this was due to}} Shane being a [...] "crazy kid".

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick awarded the album 1½ stars stating [...] "Unfortunately, the results don't {{live up to}} expectations. [...] "Composition 82" [...] is written in an {{extremely}} dry academic style with little differentiation of its course. It is quite conceivable that a performance by a more polished orchestra or, better yet, one made up of creative improvisers would be a substantial improvement. And one must {{keep in mind that}} the piece is designed to place the audience in a central position, surrounded by the orchestras, and thus able to hear musical ideas and fragments tossed back and forth from one group to another. Still, the musical material itself sounds routinely dreary and uninspired, as if Braxton was declaring that he too could write music as sterile and vapid as his European contemporaries. One might more charitably, however, write this effort off as an interesting experiment that failed; ideas appear herein that would bear far more beautiful fruit in later works". Reviewing the rereleased recordings for All About Jazz Clifford Allen observed [...] "The work moves in cycles based around single chords, and though <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> busier than Morton Feldman's later orchestral works, there is an affinity for instrumental flurries presenting themselves in relation to a steady and central pulse. Furthermore, though the number of musicians participating, one never gets the sense of an overbearing sonic weight. Rather, each orchestra operates as a separate but interactive living organism, conducted and arranged in specific relation to the others. ... Braxton's Four Orchestras expand a color field without pushing those colors too far out of the canvas' edges".|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews, although Bruce Payne's performance was praised. Richard Scheib, writing for The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review Database said that [...] "as the Warlock, Bruce Payne, {{an actor who}} has magnificently theatrical charisma and presence is actually better in the part than the perpetually overwrought Julian Sands.". The film critic John Fallon stated that Payne gave [...] "a charismatic, subdued scary performance" [...] in the film and that he [...] "couldn't take" [...] his [...] "eyes off him" [...] as he was [...] "all charm". Payne {{was described as a}} suave warlock by The Fresno Bee. The director of the film, Eric Freiser, stated that [...] "in the first two movies, Julian was very smooth as the character, but Bruce makes for a scarier villain. You feel he is capable of more evil than Julian". John Fallon gave the film a score of three and a half out of four. A reviewer for Beyond Hollywood stated that the film is 'actually quite interesting, if a bit slow and plodding for the first hour'. A reviewer for A.V. club stated that 'it may be blandly competent, but everything about Warlock III seems painfully arbitrary'. In contrast, Richard Scheib stated that 'Warlock 3 is a halfway good film, <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better than the second one. It is rather flatly lit, but director Eric Freiser generates some often quite unusual atmosphere - like scenes where Ashley Laurence turns away from a mirror and unseen by her her reflection starts screaming; one victim being transformed into glass and then shattered; and a scene where Ashley Laurence thinks she has broken through a wall and runs away to freedom, only to become caught in a loop where she is not only running over and over but also watching herself run'.|$|E

Enormous effort went into those submissions from thousands of people. I was worried {{that we were going}} to get 4,000 hours, that would have been a real problem. Three hundred hours was manageable. Every day we saw something new. Every day was exciting.” Walsh said. Walsh spent six months editing the film and while there’s <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of love for Bruce in the documentary, there were some things that he steered away from. [...] "There were stories about how generous he is, stuff about 9/11, and he comes off a bit god-like, and I didn’t feel comfortable with those stories. I think this film doesn’t build Bruce to be a god. There’s an undercurrent that he’s a very decent man, and that does come across in the stories that are told. It’s just very heartfelt stories of people talking about how Bruce and his music has affected their lives. One guy from Israel says, ‘Bruce taught me how to be a man — a decent man.’ That’s who Bruce is. I really tried not to make it heavy-handed. I didn’t come to the film as a Bruce Springsteen fan. I’m leaving it as a great admirer. I think his career is astonishing. I think the fact that he’s still producing relevant music — the fact that 2012 he released Wrecking Ball at the age of 60, that’s an amazing achievement." [...] Walsh said that Springsteen saw the film and really enjoyed the humor in it. The people in the film were really eloquent. His management informed Walsh that Springsteen really enjoyed the film.|$|E

[...] It also praised the game for its [...] "true combination of arcade skills - avoiding guards and hazards - and adventure strategies and mapping." [...] However, the magazine considered the game’s graphics to be merely adequate, and, judging it among budget titles, felt it inferior overall to Blackwyche. Laurie Sampson of Commodore User gave it 3/6 for graphics, 3/6 for sound, 4/6 toughness, 4/6 for staying power, and 4/6 for value, saying it was [...] "split fairly and squarely between adventure and arcade", and noting that the game’s audiovisual qualities were above average for a budget title; he also compared it to Sorcery in its focus on acquiring spells and items to overcome enemies and obstacles. He concluded that the Doriath was [...] "a good helping of entertainment for those itching to get lost in a labyrinth." [...] Zzap!’s two reviewers were somewhat split; G.P. called it [...] "a fairly competent release and <b>certainly</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better than the other Rabbit/Virgin game, Zyto", but found the wizard’s jumping controls awkward and the game as a whole [...] "overpriced for what it offers". J.R., on the other hand, called it [...] "a pretty gruesome game", saying that the graphics were [...] "very poor" [...] and [...] "badly animated", and also found the music [...] "grating". He also said [...] "the instructions are very poor, with practically no indication of what you’re supposed to do", concluding that publisher Rabbit Software would have to [...] "get their act together" [...] in the future.
