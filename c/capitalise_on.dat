5|$|A {{grandson}} of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn {{was born into}} a prominent Jewish family. He was brought up without religion until the age of seven, when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian. Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> his talent.|$|E
5|$|A pilot episode for a Battletoads TV {{series was}} also {{produced}} by Canadian DIC Entertainment, {{in an attempt}} to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The pilot originally aired in syndication in the United States on the weekend of Thanksgiving 1992, but it was never picked up as a full series.|$|E
5|$|Going into {{production}} in summer 1984 – with studio recordings in September and October – the first series of As Seen On TV {{was intended for}} broadcast late that year. As a theatre tie-in, Wood arranged a short stand-up tour with the same name as the show, to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> her television appearances around the same time. This backfired when the BBC put back the opening broadcast to early the following year.|$|E

5000|$|Team {{principal}} Maurizio Arrivabene had set {{the team}} a target of winning 2 races in the 2015 season. Vettel won the [...] after <b>capitalising</b> <b>on</b> an early safety car. Räikkönen came home in fourth place after suffering a puncture following contact with another car {{in the early stages}} of the race. In Bahrain, Räikkönen had his best showing yet coming home in 2nd place. He <b>capitalised</b> <b>on</b> Vettel's troubles and Nico Rosberg's brake by wire issues.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre {{software}} products for the ZX81 came about {{as a result of}} music companies attempting to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> {{the success of}} his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E

Through providing improved website performance and uptime and providing more sophisticated performance metrics, the new hosting system should support more online orders, which the Eagle Boys IT chief says are worth 1.5 times the orders which are made in-store or by telephone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the opportunities, {{continuing}} to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the new circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The former RAAF Fairbairn, {{adjacent}} to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport, but the base continues {{to be used for}} RAAF VIP flights. A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst. A consortium of private and government investors is currently making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
5|$|After being {{handed the}} number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was {{expected}} of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2–0 opening win over Ecuador, disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match, his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> several scoring chances in Italy's 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.|$|E

5|$|During a {{brilliant}} student {{career at the}} Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though {{he chose not to}} <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth—were immediately successful.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{continued}} his good form {{at the start}} of the 195455 season, scoring 90 and 9 in the opening match against New South Wales. He then made 49 and 9 against the touring England cricket team of Len Hutton. In the Christmas match against South Australia, Harvey failed to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> his starts, making 31 and 35 as Queensland won by 34 runs. The following week, he made only 0 and 3 not out in the New Year’s match against New South Wales. He finished the truncated season with only 16 in the following match against Victoria, ending the summer with 242 runs at 30.25.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E

The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|Skipsea Castle was a Norman motte and bailey castle {{near the}} village of Skipsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Built around 1086 by Drogo de la Beuvrière, {{apparently}} on the remains of an Iron Age mound, it was designed to secure the newly conquered region, defend against any potential Danish invasion and control the trade route across the region leading to the North Sea. The motte and the bailey were separated by Skipsea Mere, an artificial lake that was linked to the sea during the medieval period via a navigable channel. The village of Skipsea grew up beside the castle church, and the fortified town of Skipsea Brough was built alongside the castle around 1160 to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> the potential trade.|$|E
5|$|The French Indian Ocean {{islands of}} Île Bonaparte and Isle de France had {{provided}} a secure base for French privateers and French Navy frigates to operate against British shipping {{in the region}} for the entire French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1808, determined to <b>capitalise</b> <b>on</b> this poorly defended region of British trade, the French government ordered Commodore Jacques Hamelin in Vénus to sail to Isle de France {{where he would be}} joined by three other large and powerful frigates with specific orders to target British trade. Dispersing his frigates into the Bay of Bengal, Hamelin had some success during 1809: Caroline capturing two East Indiamen at the Action of 31 May 1809 and Hamelin himself seizing three at the Action of 18 November 1809. The French squadron also captured a number of smaller British warships and the large Portuguese frigate Minerve.|$|E
