50|$|A {{spark plug}} (sometimes, in British English, a {{sparking}} plug, and, colloquially, a plug) is a device for delivering electric current from an ignition {{system to the}} combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by an electric spark, while containing combustion pressure within the engine. A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a <b>central</b> <b>electrode</b> by a porcelain insulator. The <b>central</b> <b>electrode,</b> which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto.

Uncovering how the sensorimotor cortical network is involved in this process could reveal directly how a prior intention can tune the intrinsic dynamics of M 1 before any peripheral intervention. Here, we used combined TMS-EEG to study the cortical integrative processes that are engaged both in the preparation to react to TMS (Resist vs. Assist) and in the subsequent response to it. During the preparatory period, the contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude {{was found to be}} smaller over <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> (FC 1, C 1, Cz) when preparing to resist compared with preparing to assist the evoked movement whereas a-oscillation power was similar in the two conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{patterns}} of activation of the P 600 waveform of the event-related potentials (ERP), applying principal component analysis (PCA) and repeated measures ANOVA, and whether these patterns are RF and gender dependent. The ERPs of thirty-nine healthy subjects (20 male and 19 female) were recorded during an auditory memory task in the presence and absence of RF, similar to that emitted by mobile phones. Both PCA and ANOVA produced congruent results, showing that activation of the P 600 component occurs early and more intensely in the region of the posterior electrodes and in a less intense manner in the <b>central</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Conversely, the activation at the anterior electrodes arises later with a considerably reduced intensity. In the absence of RF female subjects exhibited significantly lower amplitudes at anterior electrodes and earlier latencies at <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> than male subjects. These differences disappear in the presence of RF. Consequently, the P 600 component follows distinct patterns of activation in the anterior, central and posterior brain areas and gender differences are observed simultaneously at several electrodes within these areas. Finally, the gender-related functional architecture with regard the P 600 component appears to be RF sensitive. In conclusion, the application of the PCA procedure provides an adequate model of the spatially distributed event-related dynamics that correspond to the P 600 waveform.

40|$|Introduction: Shorter {{duration}} of untreated psychosis {{has been associated}} with better prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In Introduction: In this study, we measured duration mismatch negativity (dMMN), P 3 a and reorienting negativity (RON) in subjects with at-risk mental state (ARMS), patients with first-episode or chronic schizophrenia, and healthy volunteers. The main interest was to determine if these event-related potentials provide a biomarker associated with progression to overt schizophrenia in ARMS subjects. Methods: Seventeen ARMS subjects meeting the criteria of the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State, 38 patients with schizophrenia (19 first-episode and 19 chronic), and 19 healthy controls participated in the study. dMMN, P 3 a and RON were measured with an auditory odd-ball paradigm at baseline. Results: During the follow-up period (2. 2 years), 4 out of the 19 ARMS subjects transitioned to schizophrenia (Converters) while 15 did not (non-Converters). dMMN amplitudes of Converters were significantly smaller than those of non-Converters at frontal and <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> before onset of illness. dMMN amplitudes of non-Converters did not differ from those of healthy controls, while Converters showed significantly smaller dMMN amplitudes compared to control subjects. RON amplitudes were also reduced at frontal and <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> in subjects with schizophrenia, but not ARMS. Converter subjects tended to show smaller RON amplitudes compared to non-Converters. Conclusions: Our data confirm that diminished dMMN amplitudes provide a biomarker which is present before and after the development of psychosis. In this respect, RON amplitudes may also be useful, as suggested {{for the first time in}} this study...|$|R
40|$|Previous work in {{the area}} of gesture production, has made the {{assumption}} that machines can replicate "human-like" gestures by connecting a bounded set of salient points in the motion trajectory. Those inflection points were hypothesized to also display cognitive saliency. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to validate that claim using electroencephalography (EEG). That is, this paper attempts to find neural signatures of gestures (also referred as placeholders) in human cognition, which facilitate the understanding, learning and repetition of gestures. Further, it is discussed whether there is a direct mapping between the placeholders and kinematic salient points in the gesture trajectories. These are expressed as relationships between inflection points in the gestures' trajectories with oscillatory mu rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) in the EEG. This is achieved by correlating fluctuations in mu power during gesture observation with salient motion points found for each gesture. Peaks in the EEG signal at <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> (motor cortex) and occipital electrodes (visual cortex) were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. We found that a linear model predicting mu peaks from motion inflections fits the data well.

These results suggest that coordinated activity in visual and motor cortices is sensitive to motion trajectories during gesture observation, and it is consistent with the proposal that inflection points operate as placeholders in gesture recognition.

40|$|International audienceRepetitions of a sensory event elicit {{lower levels}} of brain {{activity}} than its initial presentation ("repetition suppression," RS). According to one view, RS depends on the biophysics of neuronal discharge, and is thus an automatic consequence of stimulus processing ("fatigue" model). Another account suggests that RS depends on the statistical structure of the environment, and occurs when repeated stimuli are less surprising than novel stimuli ("surprise reduction" model). In support of the latter view, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} studies have shown that RS is modulated by the local probability of repetition. However, single-cell recordings from macaque inferotemporal area (IT) have failed to replicate this finding. Here, we recorded scalp electroencephalography from human participants viewing pairs of faces that repeated (face(1) -face(1)) or alternated (face(1) -face(2)), in contexts in which repetitions were expected or unexpected. As previously described, event-related potentials in the range of 100 - 400 [*]ms recorded at posterior electrode sites and at the vertex differed between repetitions and alternations. Critically, at <b>central</b> <b>electrodes,</b> we observed that the difference between repeated and alternating stimuli was attenuated when repetitions were unexpected, as predicted by the surprise reduction model. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of RS by repetition probability is observable using direct neural recording methods in human participants, and that it occurs relatively late (> 300 [*]ms) post-stimulus. Finally, we found that theta-band (4 - 8 [*]Hz) spectral power over <b>central</b> <b>electrodes</b> varied with the three-way interaction between of repetition, expectation, and the rate of change of the environment, consistent with recent reports that frontal theta may be a hallmark of learning processes originating in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex...|$|R
