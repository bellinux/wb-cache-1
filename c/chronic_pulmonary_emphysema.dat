40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} unsolved {{clinical}} findings {{in patients with}} idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (i) predominance of fibrosis in the lower lung fields, (ii) digital clubbing, and (iii) patchy distribution of pulmonary fibrosis. To explain these unsolved problems, we hypothesized that regenerated or premature bronchoepithelial cells may circulate in the blood in patients with IPF. To prove this, we performed the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for cytokeratin 19 (CK 19) and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) in peripheral blood in patients with IPF and pulmonary fibrosis associated with collagen vascular disorders. In addition, 20 patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> as a disease control and 19 normal volunteers were also evaluated {{for the existence of}} circulating bronchoepithelial cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that CK 19 was expressed in 12 of 38 blood samples (31 · 6 %) of IPF and pulmonary fibrosis associated with collagen vascular disorders, seven of 20 (35 · 0 %) blood samples of <b>chronic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema,</b> and four of 19 (21 · 1 %) blood samples of normal volunteers. mRNA for SPA was positive in eight of 38 (21 · 1 %) blood samples of IPF. In contrast, SPA expressing cells were not detected in any blood samples obtained from patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> or normal volunteers.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} lung with which this paper is concerned, are the forces which are required to overcome the resistances in the re-spiratory system. These resistances are the elas-tic resistance of the lung to expansion, and the various viscous resistances involved in the move-ment of air {{into and out of}} the lungs with associ-ated movement of lung tissue. Simultaneous recording of air flow and intra-thoracic pressure enables assessment of the forces required to overcome these resistances. The elastic resistance of the lungs is expressed as the compliance (volume change in liters per centi-meter of water-pressure change from end expira-tion to end inspiration), while the viscous resist-ance can be differentiated into that proportional to the velocity of air flow (streamline resistance in the airways and movement of lung tissue) and that proportional to the square of the velocity of air flow (turbulent resistance in the airways) (1).

These cases were divided into two groups; Group A with 17 cases not showing emphysematous findings on the chest roentgenogram, and Group B with 12 cases exhibiting such findings. The degree of intensity and extension of small nodular shadows observed in Group A indicated a highly significant correlation with %VC and RV/TLC%. In Group A, as the severity of small nodular shadows increased, the %VC tended to decrease accompanied by an increased RV/TLC%. The severity of small nodular shadows correlated significantly with the results of the following tests, FEV 1. 0 %, %　 50, %　 25 and CC/TLC%. No correlation, however, was observed in Group B between the severity of small nodular shadows and the results of respiratory functions. Two possibilities were suggested by the observations made on Group B. First, emphysematous findings on the chest roentgenogram may have exhibited a greater influence on respiratory function than did small nodular shadows.

A (GT) n dinucleotide repeat in the 5 ′-flanking region of human HO- 1 gene shows length polymorphism and could modulate the level of gene transcription. To investigate the correlation between the length of the (GT) n repeat and susceptibility to the development of CPE, we screened the frequencies of alleles with varying numbers of (GT) n repeats in the HO- 1 gene in 101 smokers with CPE and in 100 smokers without CPE. Polymorphisms of the (GT) n repeat were grouped into three classes: class S alleles (< 25 repeats), class M alleles (25 – 29 repeats), and class L alleles (⩾ 30 repeats). The proportion of allele frequencies in class L, as well as the proportion of genotypic frequencies in the group with class L alleles (L/L, L/M, and L/S), was significantly higher in the smokers with CPE than in smokers without CPE. Moreover, we analyzed the promoter activities of the HO- 1 gene carrying different (GT) n repeats (n= 16, 20, 29, and 38), by transient-transfection assay in cultured cell lines. H 2 O 2 exposure up-regulated the transcriptional activity of the HO- 1 promoter/luciferase fusion genes with (GT) 16 or (GT) 20 but did not do so with (GT) 29 or (GT) 38.

These methods, both the open circuit (washout) and closed circuit (rebreathing fromn a balloon or spirom-eter), have in general followed a consistent historic trend in that longer and longer periods of washout or rebreathinig have been required in later methods: Davy in 1800 rebreathed for 20 sec-onids (1), Grehant in 1864 for 6 inspirations (2), Van Slyke and Binger in 1923 for 5 minutes (3), Christie and Bates for 7 minutes (4, 5), Darling, Cournand and associates for 7 or 11 minutes (6, 7) and Briscoe, Becklake and Rose for 12 minutes (8, 9).

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> {{disease is}} a major {{inflammatory}} disease of the airways and an enormous therapeutic challenge. Within the spectrum of <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> {{is characterized by the}} destruction of the alveolar walls with an increase in the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles but without significant pulmonary fibrosis. Therapeutic options are limited and palliative since they are unable to promote morphological and functional regeneration of the alveolar tissue. In this context, new therapeutic approaches, such as cell therapy with adult stem cells, are being evaluated. OBJECTIVE This article aims to describe the follow-up of up to 3 years after the beginning of a phase I clinical trial and discuss the spirometry parameters achieved by patients with advanced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> treated with bone marrow mononuclear cells. METHODS Four patients with advanced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> were submitted to autologous infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells. Follow-ups were performed by spirometry up to 3 years after the procedure.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> {{disease is}} {{associated}} with a chronic inflammatory response of the host to chronic exposure to inhaled toxic gases and particles. Although inflammatory cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system infiltrate the lungs in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> and form lymphoid follicles around the small airways, the exact role of the acquired immune system in the pathogenesis of emphysema is not known. Methods In this study, wild type Balb/c mice and immunodeficient scid mice – which lack functional B- and T-cells – were exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke (CS) for 5 weeks or 6 months. Results Subacute CS-exposure for 5 weeks significantly increased innate inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of wild type mice and scid mice, which correlated with the CS-induced upregulation of the chemokines Monocyte Chemotactic Protein- 1, Macrophage Inflammatory Protein- 3 α and KC (= mouse Interleukin- 8). Chronic CS-exposure for 6 months significantly increased the number of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes in BAL fluid and lungs of wild type mice compared to air-exposed littermates, and augmented the size and number of peribronchial lymphoid follicles. In contrast, neither B-lymphocytes, nor T-lymphocytes, nor lymphoid follicles could be discerned in the lungs of air- or CS-exposed scid mice. Importantly, <b>chronic</b> CS-exposure induced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> in both wild type animals and scid mice, as evidenced by {{a significant increase in the}} mean linear intercept and the destructive index of CS-exposed versus air-exposed animals. The CS-induced emphysema was associated with increased mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 12 in the lungs and increased protein levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α in the BAL fluid of CS-exposed Balb/c and scid mice compared to air-exposed littermates. Conclusion This study suggests that the adaptive immune system is not required per se to develop <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> in response to chronic CS-exposure, since emphysema can be induced in scid mice, which lack lymphoid follicles as well as functional B- and T-cells. </p...|$|R

The challenge is to understand the influence of multiple genetic factors and multiple environmental factors as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Careful clinical characterization of phenotypes for <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease is essential and this will include comparison of biomarkers of distinct pathologies including radiological assessment to separate the components of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> and small-airway disease...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> is a <b>chronic</b> degenerative lung disease characterized by an imbalance in alveolar destruc-tion and repair that results in progressive destruction of <b>pulmonary</b> alveoli and <b>chronic</b> respiratory failure [1]. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> is one of the components of <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease (COPD), a frequent condition with a worldwide prevalence of more than 10 % in men older than 40 years. The prevalence and mortality of COPD are predicted to further increase in the next decades [2]. Different processes are involved in alveolar destruction in emphysema, particularly excess of pro-tease expression and activity in the lung. In addition to neutrophil elastase, macrophage matrix metalloprotei-nase (MMP) - 1 and- 12 have a critical role in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> (see reference [3] for review).

40|$|The term ‘emphysema’ is {{generally}} {{used in a}} morphological sense, and therefore imaging modalities {{have an important role}} in diagnosing this disease. In particular, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a reliable tool for demonstrating the pathology of emphysema, even in subtle changes within secondary pulmonary lobules. Generally, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> is classified into three types related to the lobular anatomy: centrilobular emphysema, panlobular emphysema, and paraseptal emphysema. In this pictorial review, we discuss the radiological – pathological correlation in each type of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema.</b> HRCT of early centrilobular emphysema shows an evenly distributed centrilobular tiny areas of low attenuation with ill-defined borders. With enlargement of the dilated airspace, the surrounding lung parenchyma is compressed, which enables observation of a clear border between the emphysematous area and the normal lung. Because the disease progresses from the centrilobular portion, normal lung parenchyma in the perilobular portion tends to be preserved, even in a case of far-advanced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema.</b> In panlobular emphysema, HRCT shows either panlobular low attenuation or ill-defined diffuse low attenuation of the lung. Paraseptal emphysema is characterized by subpleural well-defined cystic spaces. Recent topics related to imaging of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> will also be discussed, including morphometry of the airway in cases of <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease, combined pulmonary fibrosis and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema,</b> and bronchogenic carcinoma associated with bullous lung disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{this study}} {{we set out to}} {{investigate}} the clinically observed relationship between <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease (COPD) and aortic aneurysms. We tested the hypothesis that an inherited deficiency of connective tissue might {{play a role in the}} combined development of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> and vascular disease. METHODS: We first determined the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease in a clinical cohort of aortic aneurysms patients and arterial occlusive disease patients. Subsequently, we used a combined approach comprising pathological, functional, molecular imaging, immunological and gene expression analysis to reveal the sequence of events that culminates in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema</b> in aneurysmal Fibulin- 4 deficient (Fibulin- 4 (R)) mice. RESULTS: Here we show that COPD is significantly more prevalent in aneurysm patients compared to arterial occlusive disease patients, independent of smoking, other clinical risk factors and inflammation. In addition, we demonstrate that aneurysmal Fibulin- 4 (R/R) mice display severe developmental lung emphysema, whereas Fibulin- 4 (+/R) mice acquire alveolar breakdown with age and upon infectious stress. This vicious circle is further exacerbated by the diminished antiprotease capacity of the lungs and ultimately results in the development of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>emphysema.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental data identify genetic susceptibility to extracellular matrix degradation and secondary inflammation as the common mechanisms in both COPD and aneurysm formation...|$|R
