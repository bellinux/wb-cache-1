5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid <b>coniine</b> from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|The pitfall trap {{has evolved}} {{independently}} {{in at least}} two other groups. The Albany pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis is a small pitcher plant from Western Australia, with moccasin-like pitchers. The rim of its pitcher's opening (the peristome) is particularly pronounced (both secrete nectar) and provides a thorny overhang to the opening, preventing trapped insects from climbing out. In at least one species, Sarracenia flava, the nectar bribe is laced with <b>coniine,</b> a toxic alkaloid also found in hemlock, which probably increases the efficiency of the traps by intoxicating prey.|$|E

2500|$|Most species use a {{combination}} of scent, drugged nectar, waxy deposits (to clog insect feet) and gravity to topple insect prey into their pitcher. <b>Coniine,</b> an alkaloid drug narcotic to insects, has been discovered in the nectar-like secretions of at least S.flava. Once inside, the insect finds the footing very slippery with a waxy surface covering the walls of the pitcher. [...] Further down the tube, downward-pointing hairs make retreat impossible, and in the lowest region of the tube, a pool of liquid containing digestive enzymes and wetting agents quickly drowns the prey and begins digestion. The exoskeletons are usually not digested, and {{over the course of the}} summer fill up the pitcher tube.|$|E
2500|$|Researching the case, {{he learns}} {{that on the}} day of the murder at the Crale's home, there were five others, each a {{possible}} suspect, and whom Poirot labels as [...] "the five little pigs" [...] - Meredith Blake, an amateur chemist; Phillip Blake, Meredith's brother; Angela Warren, Caroline's younger half-sister; Cecilia Williams, the Crale's governess; and Elsa Greer (now Lady Dittisham), a young model posing for Amyas' latest painting. The investigation into the murder by the police found that Amyas was poisoned by <b>coniine,</b> which had been put in a glass that he had drunk a cold beer from. The poison had been extracted by Meredith from poison hemlock and was subsequently stolen from his lab by Caroline, who confessed to its theft but claimed she did so with the intention of using it to commit suicide. Upon learning that Caroline had provided the glass and a bottle of cold beer, the police determined that she killed her husband over his relationship to his latest mistress, Elsa, who claimed that he planned to divorce his wife and marry her; this was a new development--although he frequently had mistresses, he had never shown signs of wanting to leave Caroline.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{reveals that}} the true murderer had been Elsa, who had become disillusioned and betrayed when she overheard Amyas reassure his wife {{that he had no}} {{intention}} of leaving her; he had made the promise to Elsa of doing so, merely to keep her from leaving so that he could complete his portrait of her, unaware that his model had taken his promise quite seriously. Although she falsely recalled the gist of this conversation, the mention of Caroline saying to Amyas, [...] "you and your women", showed to Poirot that Elsa was in the same category as all of Amyas' other, discarded mistresses, despite having been too young to realise this at the time, while he further notes that the remark made by Amyas of [...] "see to her packing" [...] was in regards to his intention to send Elsa packing once he was finished with his painting, and not about Angela; Caroline was distressed by his cruelty to Elsa despite his reassurances, and remonstrated with him on a second occasion about this. After overhearing their conversation, Elsa recalled seeing Caroline help herself to the <b>coniine</b> the day before, and stole some under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, which she then used on a glass of warm beer she provided Amyas; Poirot noted that his exclamation of [...] "everything tastes foul today," [...] meant that he must have drunk something already, before the cold beer that Caroline had provided, that had tasted foul as well. Amyas did not know he was poisoned until he began to become gradually weaker while Elsa was posing for his artwork, and that he knew by who by the [...] "malevolent glare" [...] he gave to the painting that Meredith had seen. Poirot notes the unusual vitality in the face of the portrait and says, [...] "It is a very remarkable picture. It is the picture of a murderess painted by her victim – it is the picture of a girl watching her lover die." ...|$|E
50|$|Further {{elongation}} of butyryl-CoA using 2 malonyl-CoA forms 5-ketooctanal. Ketooctanal then undergoes transamination using alanine:5-keto-octanal aminotransferase. The amine then spontaneously cyclizes and is dehydrated to {{form the}} <b>coniine</b> precursor γ-coniceine. This is then reduced using NADPH dependent y-coniceine reductase to form <b>coniine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Coniine</b> {{disrupts}} {{the workings of}} the central nervous system through action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In high enough concentrations, <b>coniine</b> can be dangerous to humans and livestock. Due to high potency, the ingestion of seemingly small doses can easily result in respiratory collapse and death. <b>Coniine</b> causes death by blocking the neuromuscular junction {{in a manner similar to}} curare; this results in an ascending muscular paralysis with eventual paralysis of the respiratory muscles which results in death due to lack of oxygen to the heart and brain. Death can be prevented by artificial ventilation until the effects have worn off 48-72 hours later. For an adult, the ingestion of more than 100 mg (0.1 gram) of <b>coniine</b> (about six to eight fresh leaves, or a smaller dose of the seeds or root) may be fatal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{complete}} biosynthesis of <b>coniine</b> {{is still}} being investigated. While the exact mechanism is still to be determined, much of the pathway has been elucidated. Originally thought to use 4 acetyl groups as feed compounds for the polyketide synthase that forms <b>coniine,</b> recent work {{has led to the}} conclusion that two malonyl and a butyryl CoA are what is coupled together before further operations are performed to finally form <b>coniine.</b> Initially, acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA, some of which is also used to form malonyl CoA. An acetyl CoA is further elongated using malonyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase to form butyryl-CoA.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coniine</b> has a {{chemical}} structure and pharmacological properties similar to nicotine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coniine</b> is {{the murder}} weapon in Agatha Christie's mystery novel Five Little Pigs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coniine</b> {{refers to}} a {{poisonous}} chemical compound, an alkaloid present in and isolable from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), where its presence {{has been a source}} of significant economic, medical, and historico-cultural interest; <b>coniine</b> is also produced by the yellow pitcher plant (Sarracenia flava), and fools parsley (Aethusa cynapium). Its ingestion and extended exposure are toxic to humans and all classes of livestock; its mechanism of poisoning involves disruption of the peripheral nervous system, with death caused by respiratory paralysis. The biosynthesis of <b>coniine</b> contains as its penultimate step the non-enzymatic cyclisation of 5-oxooctylamine to γ-coniceine, a Schiff base differing from coniiine only by its carbon-nitrogen double bond in the ring. This pathway results in natural <b>coniine</b> that is a mixture—a racemate—composed of two enantiomers, the stereoisomers (S)-(+)-coniine, and (R)-(−)-coniine, depending on the direction taken by the chain that branches from the ring. Both enantiomers are toxic, with the (R)-(−) enantiomer being the more biologically active and toxic of the two in general. <b>Coniine</b> holds a place in organic chemistry history as being the first of the important class of alkaloids to be synthesized, by Albert Ladenburg in 1886, and it has been synthesized by man in a number of unique ways, through to modern times.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coniine</b> is {{slightly}} soluble (1 in 90) in cold water, less so in hot water, {{so that a}} clear cold solution becomes turbid when warmed. On the other hand, the base dissolves about 25% of water at room temperature. It mixes with alcohol in all proportions, is readily soluble in ether and most organic solvents. <b>Coniine</b> dissolves in carbon disulfide, forming a complex thiocarbamate.|$|E

50|$|Conium {{contains}} the piperidine alkaloids <b>coniine,</b> N-methylconiine, conhydrine, pseudoconhydrine, and gamma-coniceine (or g-coniceïne), {{which is the}} precursor of the other hemlock alkaloids.|$|E
50|$|While {{the yellow}} pitcher plant and fool's parsley, which also contain <b>coniine,</b> but for these {{there are no}} reports of {{traditional}} uses.|$|E
50|$|The L-(−)-stereoisomer was {{obtained}} by Ahrens from residues left in the isolation of <b>coniine</b> as hydrobromide or by removing <b>coniine</b> as the nitroso-compound. It is a colourless, coniine-like liquid, bp. 175.6 °C/767 mmHg, specific rotation αD −81.92° at 20 °C. The monohydrochloride crystallises in leaflets, mp. 191-192 °C; the monohydrobromide in leaflets, mp. 189-190 °C; the platinichloride in orange crystals, mp. 153-154 °C; the aurichloride in leaflets, mp. 77-78 °C; and the picrate in long needles, mp. 121-122 °C.|$|E
50|$|Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) {{contains}} {{highly toxic}} amounts of <b>coniine,</b> where {{it contributes to}} hemlock's fetid smell; in addition, it contains trace amounts of other similarly poisonous alkaloids. Ingesting less than {{a tenth of a}} gram of <b>coniine</b> can be fatal for adult humans; this is approximately six to eight hemlock leaves. The seeds and roots are also toxic, more so than the leaves. While hemlock toxicity primarily results from consumption, poisoning can also result from inhalation, and from skin contact.|$|E
50|$|With Ludwig Hesse, he {{isolated}} the alkaloids atropine, aconitine, colchicine and hyoscyamine. In 1831 {{he was the}} first to obtain <b>coniine</b> in a pure state.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} synthesis of this substance by Ladenburg in 1886, N-methylpyridine, as its iodide salt, was isomerised at 250 °C to obtain 2-methylpyridine (α-picoline). Reaction of this, {{as shown in}} the scheme below, with the cyclic trimer of acetaldehyde, paraldehyde, {{in the presence of a}} base gave 2-propenylpyridine via a Knoevenagel condensation. This intermediate was reduced with metallic sodium in ethanol or by hydrogen gas [...] )as shown) to provide racemic (±) <b>coniine.</b> Enantiopure <b>coniine</b> was then obtained by a chiral resolution, specifically, fractional crystallisation of the diastereomeric (+)-tartaric acid salt.|$|E

50|$|Many syntheses of <b>coniine</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} over the last 50 years; {{one example of a}} stereoselective synthesis is that of Enders and Tiebes, who cite some of the earlier preparations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coniine</b> {{alkaloid}} {{is found}} in Sarracenia flava, the yellow pitcher plant. The yellow pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant found exclusively in the southeastern United States. The plant uses a mixture of sugar and <b>coniine</b> to simultaneously attract and poison insects, which then fall into a digestive tube. The naming of the plant arises from {{the shape of the}} opening to these tubes, which resembles a pitcher, which can grow up to three feet tall. The pitcher has a leaf above it that functions to prevent rain from diluting the digestive fluids deep in the tubes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coniine</b> {{gives no}} {{coloration}} with sulfuric or nitric acid. Sodium nitroprusside gives a deep red color, which disappears on warming, but reappears on cooling, and is changed to blue or violet by aldehydes.|$|E
50|$|While primary, secondary, and {{tertiary}} amines were stable when distilled at {{high temperatures}} under alkaline conditions, the quaternary amine was not. Heating quaternary tetraethylammonium hydroxide yielded tertiary triethylamine vapour. This {{became the basis}} of what is now known as the Hofmann elimination, a method for converting quaternary amines into tertiary amines. Hofman successfully applied the method to <b>coniine,</b> the cholinergic poison of hemlock, to derive the first structure of an alkaloid. His method became extremely significant as a tool for examining the molecular structures of alkaloids, and was eventually applied to morphine, coca amine, atropine, and tubocurarine, among others. <b>Coniine</b> eventually became the first of the alkaloids to be artificially synthesised.|$|E
50|$|Most {{alkaloids}} contain {{oxygen in}} their molecular structure; those compounds are usually colorless crystals at ambient conditions. Oxygen-free alkaloids, such as nicotine or <b>coniine,</b> are typically volatile, colorless, oily liquids. Some alkaloids are colored, like berberine (yellow) and sanguinarine (orange).|$|E
5000|$|The common {{criterion}} for enantiomeric homogeneity is the specific rotation, αD, a value {{that depends on}} such factors as temperature, solvent and concentration of the analyte. Modern values for the specific rotation of the enantiomers of <b>coniine</b> are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Keto acids {{appear in}} a wide variety of {{anabolic}} pathways in metabolism, across living organisms. For instance, in plants (specifically, in hemlock, pitcher plants, and fool's parsley), 5-oxo-octanoic acid is converted in enzymatic and non-enzymatic steps into the cyclic class of <b>coniine</b> alkaloids.|$|E
50|$|N-Methyl-D-coniine was {{prepared}} {{by the action of}} potassium methyl sulfate on <b>coniine</b> by Passon. Hess and Eichel have shown that D-coniine with formaldehyde and formic acid yields an active N-methyl-D-coniine, and that methyl-isopelletierine hydrazone yields N-methyl-DL-coniine when heated with sodium ethoxide at 150-170 °C.|$|E
50|$|Salts of given enantiomers do not {{necessarily}} have the same specific rotation as the same enantiomer of the free base. The hydrochloride salts of the (S)-(+) and (R)-(−) enantiomers of <b>coniine</b> have values of αD of +4.6° and -5.2°, respectively (c = 0.5, in methanol).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coniine,</b> {{the main}} poison in hemlock species, can be absorbed through the skin. People {{who have come}} into contact with these plants, {{including}} crushing the leaves to perform a [...] "smell test," [...] should wash their hands immediately and avoid touching their eyes or mouth.|$|E
50|$|The (R)-(−) {{enantiomer}} of <b>coniine</b> is {{the more}} biologically active, at least in one system (TE-671 cells expressing human fetal nicotinic neuromuscular receptors), and in mouse bioassay, the same enantiomer and the racemic mixture are about two-fold more toxic than the (S)-(+) enantiomer (see below).|$|E
5000|$|In 1844 Wertheim {{distilled}} a pungent substance from garlic, naming it [...] "allyl". In his research, {{he noticed}} the close relationship between garlic oil and mustard oil.
