5|$|The first {{scenes of}} {{dialogue}} are Floyd's encounters {{on the space}} station: chit-chat with the <b>colleague</b> <b>who</b> greets him, his telephone call to his daughter, and the friendly but strained encounter with Soviet scientists. Later, {{en route to the}} monolith, Floyd engages in trite exchanges with his staff while a spectacular journey by Earth-light across the Lunar surface is shown. Hal is the only character who expresses anxiety, as well as feelings of pride and bewilderment.|$|E
5|$|Vidya is {{revealed}} to be the widow of Arup Basu (Abir Chatterjee), an IB officer and Damji's <b>colleague,</b> <b>who</b> {{was killed in the}} poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee (Darshan Jariwala), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.|$|E

5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a <b>colleague,</b> <b>who</b> {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a <b>colleague</b> <b>who</b> worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the asked-for legate for Cappadocia had arrived, in {{the person}} of Lucius Caesennius Paetus, the consul of the {{previous}} year (61 AD). The army was divided between him and Corbulo, with IV Scythica, XII Fulminata, the newly arrived V Macedonica and the auxiliaries from Pontus, Galatia and Cappadocia going to Paetus, while Corbulo retained III Gallica, VI Ferrata and X Fretensis. Because of their antagonism for glory, the relations between the two Roman commanders were strained from the beginning. It is notable that Corbulo kept the legions he had spent the past few years campaigning with, and gave his <b>colleague,</b> <b>who</b> after all was expected to conduct the main campaign, the more inexperienced units. The total Roman force arrayed against the Parthians was nevertheless considerable: the six legions alone totaled some 30,000 men. The exact number and disposition of auxiliary units is unclear, but there were seven cavalry alae and seven infantry cohorts in Syria alone, comprising a force of 7-9,000 troops.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} considered by the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, {{but there was a}} movement to make Calgary the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works William Henry Cushing, Cross's cabinet <b>colleague,</b> <b>who</b> argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the Canadian fur trade and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8. It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada <b>colleague</b> <b>who</b> got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

25|$|Peace was remanded for a week, {{in which}} he refused to give his name.

25|$|In {{particular}} cases, usually {{because of}} illness {{or some other}} problem, an exarch of any rank can be assisted by {{the appointment of a}} <b>colleague</b> <b>who</b> is called Coadjutor exarch. The position of coadjutor exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to the position of Latin coadjutor bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Coadjutor exarchs are appointed with rights of succession. For example, in 1993 titular Bishop Christo Proykov of Briula was appointed Coadjutor to Apostolic Exarch of Sofia, Methodius Stratiev, and when later died in 1995, coadjutor exarch succeeded him as new Apostolic Exarch.|$|E

25|$|Keith Mann and {{a trusted}} <b>colleague,</b> <b>who</b> {{to this day}} is still unknown, in 2003 raided the {{research}} laboratory and removed 695 mice that were being used to test Dysport. He was then arrested by detectives at his home and the mice were returned to the laboratory. He argued that the tests were illegal because the product was being tested for cosmetic purposes, Botox which is banned in Britain. A court rejected his claims, {{and found that the}} tests were in compliance with UK regulations because Dysport is used for therapeutic purposes to prevent muscle spasms.|$|E

At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the <b>colleague</b> <b>who</b> is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
