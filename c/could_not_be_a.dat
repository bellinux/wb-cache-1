5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Kellogg {{went against}} the {{prevailing}} notion {{of the time that}} alcohol was a stimulant. Citing contemporary research, Kellogg believed that alcohol <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stimulant because it lessened vital activity and depressed vital forces. Seeing its effects on plants, animals, and humans, he felt that alcohol was a poison. Kellogg noticed deleterious effects that alcohol had on both the brain, the digestive system, and the liver, among other organs.|$|E
25|$|Under this paradigm, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} chemical reactions (such as {{the combination of}} water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by Dalton’s atomic theory, which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> chemical process.

25|$|In April 1897, Thomson {{had only}} early {{indications}} that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had thought they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be).</b> <b>A</b> month after Thomson's announcement of the corpuscle, he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. This became the classic means of measuring the charge and mass of the electron.|$|E

Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount (Elizabeth de Sodington Blount, née Elizabeth Anne Mould Williams) {{created the}} Universal Zetetic Society in 1893 in England {{and created a}} journal called Earth not a Globe Review, which sold for twopence, {{as well as one}} called Earth, which only lasted from 1901 to 1904. She held that the Bible was the {{unquestionable}} authority on the natural world and argued that one <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Christian and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College, Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham's experiments, generating some interesting counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary earth, including Terra Firma by David Wardlaw Scott.|$|E

25|$|On 18 October 2011 a hot-spot in {{a public}} square {{was found in the}} city of Kashiwa, Chiba in the Nedokoyadai district, by a {{resident}} walking with a dosimeter. He informed the city council. Their first readings were off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation reported a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick. Further investigations and check-ups were planned on 24 October 2011. These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive cesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. The first comments of town officials on the find of 57.7 microsieverts per hour were that there <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> link with the Fukushima disaster, but after the find of this large amount of cesium, officials of the Science Ministry could not deny the possibility that the cause could be found at the Fukushima-site.|$|E
25|$|The Bychowiec Chronicle {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the life of Petras Goštautas. He is not known from any other sources and details of his life cannot be reliably verified. Some of the details outright contradict facts known from other reliable contemporary sources. For example, Vilnius Voivodeship was established only in 1413 by Vytautas; therefore Goštautas <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> voivode during the reign of Algirdas. But it could be a confusion with Jonas Goštautas who was the voivode in 1443–58. The chronicle also mentions that Goštautas was appointed as regent of Podolia by Algirdas; in fact it was Petras Mantigirdaitis who was appointed by Vytautas. Polish historian Kazimierz Chodynicki expressed doubts about Goštautas' marriage to a member of the House of Buczacki as the family came into prominence only after Algirdas' death. Goštautas is also not known as the founder of the Franciscan church and monastery in Vilnius. The first more sizable donation by Goštautai to the Franciscans in Vilnius is known only from 1468. The Bychowiec Chronicle also mentions that the first Bishop of Vilnius was Motiejus, a monk from a local Franciscan monastery. No such bishop is known; the first bishop was Andrzej Jastrzębiec.|$|E
