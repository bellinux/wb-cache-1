Prima Games produces official, dedicated text-based video game walkthroughs and strategy guides for a variety of video games in both print and digital formats. <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Video Games (CVG) published both text and video based walkthroughs of video games on their website and official YouTube channel until their closure by Future in February of 2015 in asset consolidation between various Future brands.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} teachers' attitudes towards the usage of <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> information technology in education. The aim of this study is to find out whether school teachers are anxious about <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> information technology. This study also aims to investigate the relationship between availability of personal <b>computers,</b> course attendance <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> anxiety <b>and</b> also to investigate the relationship between availability of personal <b>computers,</b> course attendance <b>and</b> the usage of <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> information technology in the classroom. The subjects of this study are 50 school teachers in Sekolah Menengah Kuala Krai, Kelantan, of whom 17 were male and 33 female. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results of this study revealed that more than 50 percent of school teachers have a positive attitude towards <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> information technology in the education process. The other significant finding of this study is that many teachers, despite their positive attitude, do not prefer to use technology <b>and</b> <b>computers</b> in the classroom. Over half of the respondents, 56 percent, believe that without a computer in the classroom their teaching is still effective. Furthermore, 28 percent of the respondents also believe that computers should be used for certain subjects only. The results suggest that in general, factors like the availability of personal <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> attending courses do not affect teachers' attitudes. The respondents do not, for example, believe that computers threaten the relationship between teachers and students and they believe that <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> technology help slow learners. Based on the findings, several implications and recommendations are discussed...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in the decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> Mouse in the Maze, which used a light pen to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E
5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> video games.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
