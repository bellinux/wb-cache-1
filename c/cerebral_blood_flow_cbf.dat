Airflow, CO 2, Doppler <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity (<b>CBF),</b> ECG and blood pressure (BP) were recorded. To determine whether influences of mean BP (MBP) and systolic BP (SBP) on CBF were altered in Presyncopals, the coherencies and transfer functions between these variables and mean and peak CBF (CBFm and CBFp) were estimated. To determine influence of end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) on CBF, relative CO 2 reactivity was calculated. The two primary findings were, during tilt in Presyncopals: (1) In respiratory frequency region, coherence between SBP and CBFp (p= 0. 02) and transfer function gain between BP and CBFm was higher (MBP, p= 0. 01, and SBP, p= 0. 01) than in Non-Presyncopals. (2) In the last 3 minutes prior to presyncope, Presyncopals had a reduced relative CO 2 reactivity (p= 0. 005).

40|$|The most {{important}} early pathomechanism in {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) is alteration of the resting membrane potential. This may be mediated via voltage, or agonist-dependent ion channels (e. g. glutamate-dependent channels).

We hypothesize that glutamate is an important agonist in this process and may induce an increase in lactate, potassium and brain tissue CO 2, and hence a decrease in brain pH. Further we propose that an increase in lactate is thus not an indicator of anaerobic metabolic conditions as has been thought for many years. We therefore analyzed a total of 85 patients with TBI, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 8 using microdialysis, brain tissue oxygen, CO 2 and pH monitoring. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> studies (<b>CBF)</b> were performed to test the relationship between regional <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (rCBF) and the metabolic determinants.

Specifically, whereas associatively-related words demonstrate strong and robust priming effects when presented {{within the context of}} lexical-level tasks, generation of significant SR priming appears to require execution of an explicitly semantic task. This apparent levels-of-processing effect, if reflected in the neural-level implementation, would suggest that the mechanisms underlying priming may be localized to spatially and functionally distinct cerebral regions. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, an artifactual decision task (ADT) is developed and refined, which proved capable of producing strong immediate SR priming for auditorily presented words. Insertion of unrelated items between prime and target produced differential effects on priming, with AR targets exhibiting an interference effect that slowly diminished as more unrelated items were inserted.

Water content of the primary sensorimotor cortex, white matter, and thalamus, which was measured by the specific gravity method, significantly increased by 1. 9, 4. 1,and 0. 7 % g water/g tissue, respectively, after 12 hours of exposure to air. After six hours of exposure, the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the cortex, white matter, and thalamus significantly decreased from control levels of 56. 8 ± 12. 7, 21. 7 ± 5, 2, 44, 1 ± 13. 4 ml/ 100 g/min to 46. 5 ± 13. 2, 16. 3 ± 5. 0, and 31. 3 ± 11. 9 ml/ 100 g/min, respectively. These decreases were accompanied by diminution in the amplitude of the direct cortical responses (DCRs) and prolongation of N 1 latencies of the somatosensory evoked responses (SERs) recorded at the primary sensorimotor cortex. Both electrical activities were progressively suppressed in proportion to the reduction of ICBF after six hours of exposure. These results suggest that thalamocortical ischemia is probably responsible for the neural electrical suppression observed in this experimental edema. There was a significant correlation between the amount of edema and the degree of ischemia in the white matter. Accumulation of the edema fluid may induce ischemia affecting sensory conduction through the white matter as suggested by prolongation of the N 1 latency of SER...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Crossed {{cerebellar}} diaschisis (CCD) is a {{state of}} neural depression caused by loss of connections to injured neural structures remote from the cerebellum usually evaluated by positron emission tomography. Recently {{it has been shown that}} dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted MRI (PWI) may also be feasible to detect the phenomenon. In this study we aimed to assess the frequency of CCD on PWI in patients with acute thalamic infarction. Methods: From a MRI report database we identified patients with acute isolated thalamic infarction. Contralateral cerebellar hypoperfusion was identified by inspection of time to peak (TTP) maps and evaluated quantitatively on TTP, mean transit time (MTT), <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and volume (<b>CBF,</b> CBV) maps. A competing cerebellar pathology or an underlying vascular pathology were excluded. Results: A total of 39 patients was included. Common symptoms were hemiparesis (53. 8 %), hemihypaesthesia (38. 5 %), dysarthria (30. 8 %), aphasia (17. 9 %), and ataxia (15. 4 %). In 9 patients (23. 1 %) PWI showed hypoperfusion in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. All of these had lesions in the territory of the tuberothalamic, paramedian, or inferolateral arteries. Dysarthria was observed more frequently in patients with CCD (6 / 9 vs. 6 / 30; OR 8. 00; 95 %CI 1. 54 – 41. 64, p = 0. 01). In patients with CCD, the median ischemic lesion volume on DWI (0. 91 cm 3, IQR 0. 49 – 1. 54 cm 3) was larger compared to patients with unremarkable PWI (0. 51 cm 3, IQR 0. 32 – 0. 74, p = 0. 05). The most pronounced changes were found in CBF (0. 9460. 11) an...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported that the}} myogenic responses of the renal afferent arteriole (Af-Art) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) and autoregulation of renal and <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (RBF and <b>CBF)</b> were impaired in Fawn Hooded hypertensive (FHH) rats and were restored in a FHH. 1 BN congenic strain in which a small segment of chromosome 1 from the Brown Norway (BN) containing 15 genes including dual-specificity protein phosphatase- 5 (Dusp 5) were transferred into the FHH genetic background. We identified 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Dusp 5 gene in FHH as compared with BN rats, two of which altered CpG sites and another that caused a G 155 R mutation. To determine whether Dusp 5 contributes to the impaired myogenic response in FHH rats, we created a Dusp 5 knockout (KO) rat in the FHH. 1 BN genetic background using a zinc-finger nuclease that introduced an 11 bp frame-shift deletion and a premature stop codon at AA 121. The expression of Dusp 5 was decreased and the levels of its substrates, phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 (p-ERK 1 / 2), were enhanced in the KO rats. The diameter of the MCA decreased {{to a greater extent}} in Dusp 5 KO rats than in FHH. 1 BN and FHH rats when the perfusion pressure was increased from 40 to 140 mmHg. CBF increased markedly in FHH rats when MAP was increased from 100 to 160 mmHg, and CBF was better autoregulated in the Dusp 5 KO and FHH. 1 BN rats. The expression of Dusp 5 was higher at the mRNA level but not at the protein level and the levels of p-ERK 1 / 2 and p-PKC were lower in cerebral microvessels and brain tissue isolated from FHH than in FHH. 1 BN rats. These results indicate that Dusp 5 modulates myogenic reactivity in the cerebral circulation and support the view that a mutation in Dusp 5 may enhance Dusp 5 activity and contribute to the impaired myogenic response in FHH rats...|$|R
