40|$|In many {{precision}} machining {{processes such as}} surface grinding, coolant is typically used to provide functions such as lubrication and cooling. In order to reduce surface grinding temperatures effectively, an active coolant cooling system is proposed.

The coolant cooling system utilizes a commonly used air conditioner for ease of use and to reduce costs. In the proposed design, the evaporator of the heat pump is connected to the <b>coolant</b> <b>tank</b> of a surface grinding machine to reduce grinding temperatures for improved stability of accuracy and surface quality. This can be done without compromising production efficiency. System structure is explained, and a coolant temperature model presented. Experimental testing on a prototype active cooling system is presented. The coolant temperature can be reduced to approximately - 2 degreesC under no load condition, and to approximately 3 degreesC under loaded condition. The time constants of the cooling system were estimated The results of the experimental tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system for applications in surface grinding for active coolant cooling in comparison with passive cooling.

40|$|A {{submerged}} {{membrane distillation}} (SMD) process for fresh water production from Red Sea water using commercially available hollow fiber membranes {{has been successfully}} employed and compared with the conventional direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process. The hollow fiber membranes have been characterized for its morphology using field effect scanning electron microscope. In SMD process, a bunch of hollow fiber membranes are glued together at both ends to get a simplified open membrane module assembly submerged into the <b>coolant</b> <b>tank</b> equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Hot feed stream is allowed {{to pass through the}} lumen side of the membrane using a feed pump. Continuous stirring at the coolant side will reduce the temperature and concentration polarization. During the conventional DCMD process, using feed-coolant streams with co-current and counter-current flows has been tested and the results are compared in this study. In SMD process, a water vapor flux of 10. 2 kg m- 2 h- 1 is achieved when using a feed inlet temperature of 80 °C and coolant temperature of 20 °C. Under the same conditions, during conventional DCMD process, a water vapor flux of 11. 6 and 10. 1 kg m- 2 h- 1 were observed during counter-current and co-current flow streams, respectively. Results show that the water production in the SMD process is comparable with the conventional DCMD process, while the feed-coolant flow streams are in the co-current direction. During conventional DCMD operation, a 15 % increase in the water production is observed when feed-coolant streams are in the counter-current direction compared to the co-current direction. © 2014 © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe programme was concerned {{with the effects of}} processing variables on the structure and properties of coolant reservoir tanks. The work was concentrated on the extrusion blow moulding process and on propylene polymers, following an earlier similar research in the Institute on high density polyethylene. We have worked with a company which specialises in technical blow mouldings; the work has dealt with coolant tanks which are required for high temperature, high pressure service in the presence of antifreeze. It soon became apparent that the application made severe demands on polypropylene in that failure was possible by a variety of mechanisms, including environmental stress cracking and ductile blow-out failure. Additionally, the shaping process by extrusion blow moulding was not being carried out in the optimum way, either with respect to process economics or to product properties. Investigation of the surface texture of corn mercial tanks revealed that shrinkage from the mould occurred frequently due to inadequate holdon pressure; this loss of contact gives poor surface finish and retarded cooling. This phase of the research was supported by a programme carried out on the Bradford University equipment and by providing appropriate thermal data for the Bradford mathematical model for cooling. To reduce the cooling cycle time, the efficacy of internal cooling techniques, including forced air cooling and liquid carbon dioxide, was studied. Further, the possibility of shaping polypropylene in the supercooled region was investigated and a double extruder system was developed to examine the shear viscosity of supercooled polymers. The main concern has been failure caused by stress cracking and environmental stress cracking, especially of development grades of propylene polymers. The structures of various ethylene-modified polypropylenes have been elucidated, as have the relationship of structure' to processing history and its relevance to the severe stress cracking encountered. A new method for determining ethylene content of ethylene- propylene systems has been developed, as {{this is one of the}} important characteristics of ethylene modified polypropylene. The available processes of manufacturing the coolant reservoir tanks have been considered; in particular, competing methods of manufacture of extrusion blow moulding and injection moulding/welding have been compared. The design of coolant tanks, in particular the wall thickness required, has been examined. Stress analysis, supported by tensile failure and relaxation data, has been carried out to provide background to the failures encountered in practice. Finally, possible new candidate material for the <b>coolant</b> <b>tank</b> application, polypropylene-linear low density polyethylene (ethylene-octene copolymer) blends have been investigated...|$|E

All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, <b>coolant</b> recovery <b>tank</b> and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|R
