40|$|The {{proliferation}} of wireless devices {{calls for a}} suitable network infrastructure for sup-porting communication among them. Medium Access Control(MAC), the most {{crucial part of the}} protocol stack, is discussed in the thesis. The design of wireless MAC pro-tocols is signi cantly di erent from wired MAC protocols because of distinctive features of wireless medium, such as high error rates, limited radio propagation range and low bandwidth. An e cient, scalable and fair protocol { Wireless Window Protocol(WWP) { is pro-posed. WWP is a limited contention protocol in which the set of contending mobiles is chosen based on a global contention window maintained by every mobile station. The contention window is adjusted based on three possible channel states: no transmission, success and <b>collision.</b> <b>Window</b> bounds are functions of current channel load. Simulations have shown that WWP can resolve contention in an average of 2 : 4 contention slots, independent of the numberofcontending stations...|$|E
30|$|The co-existence {{behavior}} of Wi-Fi and Zigbee {{has been studied}} extensively. The physical layer effects of Wi-Fi and Zigbee coexistence are already considered in the IEEE 802.15. 4 standard [1]. Zhen et al. [2] study the cross-technology detection probability of Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) between Zigbee and Wi-Fi. They conclude that Zigbee is oversensitive to Wi-Fi, while Wi-Fi is insensitive to Zigbee beyond a Heterogeneous Exclusive CCA Range, which they calculate to be 25 m with the free space pathloss model. Yuan et al. [3] study the co-existence {{behavior of}} Zigbee and saturated Wi-Fi. They conclude through a model and simulation that 5.75 % of the Zigbee throughput remains {{under the assumption that}} Wi-Fi and Zigbee CCA can avoid all cross-technology collisions. They also conclude through simulation that no throughput remains in case Wi-Fi does not detect Zigbee. Pollin et al. [4] measure the coexistence impact of Zigbee and Wi-Fi. They conclude that standard Wi-Fi devices do not backoff for Zigbee traffic, even in very close proximity. They also show that the CCA mechanism of Zigbee can reduce collisions with Wi-Fi, but it is too slow to avoid all Wi-Fi traffic. Thonet et al. [5] measure up to 85 % Zigbee packet loss due to 802.11 b traffic. Consequently, we conclude that Zigbee might incur severe packet loss when it coexists with Wi-Fi. However, no model predicting the performance degradation has been proposed. Out of [1], it is possible to determine the Packet Error Rate (PER) depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) {{and the size of the}} <b>collision</b> <b>window,</b> given there is a collision. However, the amount of collisions is dependant on the channel access mechanism of both Wi-Fi and Zigbee. Hence, a detailed model for cross-technology collisions that considers realistic Wi-Fi and Zigbee channel access mechanisms is a key open issue. In [6, 7], we propose such a model and focus on exploring the economic value of introducing sensing engines in one specific business scenario. In this article, we focus on a thorough theoretical study of this model, and verify it against real-life measurements in a testbed environment.|$|E

Various man-made structures act as {{barriers to the}} movement of migrating birds. In the United States alone {{hundreds of millions of}} birds are estimated to die annually from <b>window</b> <b>collisions.</b> This risk increases when urban environments exist along important migratory corridors. Although all birds are susceptible to <b>collisions</b> with <b>windows,</b> nocturnally migrating songbirds make up the largest portion of observed window fatalities. Minnesota Point located on the western tip of Lake Superior is a valuable study location for quantifying collision fatalities because birds rely on this location to rest and forage during migration and because it is a highly developed landscape. To estimate mortality rates, a total of 42 residential homes were searched periodically during five migratory periods between 2006 and 2009 for avian window kills. To increase the accuracy of this estimate, an experiment was incorporated into the study to account for fatalities undetected by searchers due to removal by scavengers. A total of 40 identifiable species and 108 individual birds were recorded as <b>window</b> <b>collision</b> fatalities and of these, 90 % were short and long distance migrants. During the spring and fall of 2009, bird density estimates were calculated to compare the abundance of species flying through the area to the abundance of observed species fatalities. The density of migrants utilizing the area was greater than that of resident species and was reflected by the higher mortality rates observed for migrants. The probability of a carcass being scavenged within 6 d averaged 79 %. Variation in scavenging rate was best explained by the location {{of the house and the}} size of the carcass used. With adjustments made for scavenging, an annual estimate of avian window fatalities for houses on Minnesota Point during peak migration is 1333 ± 73 birds per year. Avian <b>window</b> <b>collisions</b> contribute significantly to annual mortality rates and are potentially avoidable.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Vehicle {{occupants}} {{involved in}} automobile side impact crashes {{are three times}} more likely to experience head injuries than occupants involved in frontal or other types of collisions. The most frequent contact source for an occupant in side impact crashes is the side window. In side impacts, failure of the side window glass affects the potential for the occupant head injury. Tempered glass in side window is easily shattered by exposing the occupant head into environment, where it can be directly impacted by the intruding or striking vehicle. In order to reduce the injury potential for occupant head in a <b>collision,</b> <b>windows</b> with laminated glass have been developed, which are gradually replacing the tempered glass. This study is mainly focused on understanding the dynamic response of the human head in side impact scenarios, when the tempered glass in the side windows is replaced with laminated glass. Quasi-static experiments are performed in this study with a free-motion headform impacting a laminated glass. The laminated glass is composed of two layers of glass separated by Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) interlayer. A Finite Element (FE) model of the laminated glass window is created and impacted with the FE headform at the same velocity as in the experiment, and the model is validated against experimental results. The properties of validated glass model are implemented into the side windows of a small car model to determine the performance of laminated glass in a typical side impact scenario. The responses of the occupant with the tempered and laminated glazing with and without restraints are compared. Based on the performance of the laminated glazing in side impact scenario, the laminated glass has shown to reduce the possibility of failure of the glass and thus contains the occupant from ejecting with virtually no change in injury potential values...|$|R

In North America, studies of this topic tend to be focused east of the Mississippi River, resulting in a paucity of data from the Western flyways. Additionally, few available data can critically evaluate factors such as time of day, sex and age bias, and effect of window pane size on collisions. We collected and analyzed 5 years of window strike data from a 3 -story building in a large urban park in San Francisco, California. To evaluate our <b>window</b> <b>collision</b> data in context, we collected weekly data on local bird abundance in the adjacent parkland. Our study asks two overarching questions: first-what aspects of a bird's biology might make them more likely to fatally strike windows; and second, what characteristics of a building's design contribute to bird-window collisions. We used a dataset of 308 fatal bird strikes to examine the relationships of strikes relative to age, sex, time of day, time of year, {{and a variety of}} other factors, including mitigation efforts. We found that actively migrating birds may not be major contributors to collisions as has been found elsewhere. We found that males and young birds were both significantly overrepresented relative to their abundance in the habitat surrounding the building.

However, the proximate drivers of collisions are not well understood, and no study has examined spatial variation in mortality in an urban setting.

In 2010 we documented bird-window collisions (BWCs) and characterized avian community structure at 20 buildings in an urban landscape in northwestern Illinois, USA. For each building and season, we conducted 21 daily surveys for carcasses and nine point count surveys to estimate relative abundance, richness, and diversity. Our sampling design was informed by experimentally estimated carcass persistence times and detection probabilities. We used linear and generalized linear mixed models to evaluate how habitat features influenced community structure and how mortality was affected by window area and factors that correlated with community structure. The most-supported model was consistent for all community indices and included effects of season, development, and distance to vegetated lots. BWCs were related positively to window area and negatively to development. We documented mortalities for 16 / 72 (22 %) species (34 total carcasses) recorded at buildings, and BWCs were greater for juveniles than adults. Based on the most-supported model of BWCs, the median number of annual predicted fatalities at study buildings was 3 (range = 0 – 52).

40|$|An {{animated}} reconstruction shows South Pacific plate kinematics, in {{the reference}} frame of West Antarctica, between 55 Ma and the present-day. The ocean {{floor in the}} region formed due to seafloor spreading between the Antarctic, Pacific, Phoenix and Nazca plates (a plate formed by fragmentation of the Farallon plate early in Oligocene times). The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge remained fairly stable throughout this time, migrating relatively northwestwards, by various mechanisms, behind the rapidly-moving Pacific plate. The Nazca and Phoenix plates also moved quickly, but relatively towards the cast or southeast, and were subducted in these directions beneath the South American and Antarctic plates. Segments of spreading centres forming at the trailing edges of the Nazca and Phoenix plates periodically collided with these subduction zones, resulting in the total destruction of the Nazca Phoenix spreading centre and the partial destruction of the Nazca-Antarctica spreading centre (the Chile Ridge) and Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge, which ceased to operate shortly before its northeasternmost three segments could collide with the Antarctic margin.
