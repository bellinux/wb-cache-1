Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms. Parliament has decided not to re-elect a sitting Councillor only four times, and only twice (in 2003 and 2007) {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|E

25|$|The light cone has an {{essential}} role within the concept of causality. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time ofnbsp&O to the position and time of D (Fig.nbsp&2‑4). It is hence possible for eventnbsp&O to have a causal influence on eventnbsp&D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, {{it is possible for}} a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.nbsp&B ornbsp&C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either effect eventnbsp&O, nor <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> affected by eventnbsp&O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between eventnbsp&O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.|$|E
25|$|The lovers, at last {{alone and}} {{freed from the}} {{constraints}} of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they can truly be together and only in the long night of death <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> eternally united ("O sink' hernieder, Nacht der Liebe"). During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that the night is ending ("Einsam wachend in der Nacht"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms. Marke is heartbroken, {{not only because of}} his nephew's betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde's betrayal as well ("Mir – dies?

500|$|Pennington {{argues that}} American Beauty defines its {{characters}} through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are {{a direct result}} of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from [...] "cold perfectionist" [...] to a more carefree soul who [...] " [...] happily along with" [...] the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, [...] "How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> so shameless?" [...] To which Ricky replies, [...] "That's the thing, Dad—they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of." [...] Pennington argues that Col.

Atad asserted it ultimately lead viewers to choose between their [...] "so-called justice and the competing value of empathy". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals we seek to discipline?" [...] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a [...] "morally complex idea" [...] without taking a side on the discussion.

Within the context of Mulan, the song both introduces audiences to the title character while demonstrating some Chinese traditions, revealing that Mulan must initially rely on marriage to [...] "settle her fate" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} film. A character piece, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] is performed by several older Chinese women, including Mulan's mother and grandmother Fa Li and Grandmother Fa, respectively, to Mulan as they prepare to the character to present her to the Matchmaker, hoping that she will be paired with a suitable husband and ultimately uphold their family's heritage. Before Mulan is introduced, the character can be heard reciting the [...] "Final Admonition": [...] "Quiet and demure. Graceful. Polite. Delicate. Refined. Poised. Punctual", values that are later visualized during [...] "Honor to Us All". The musical number is preceded by a scene in which Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, asks his ancestors to help his daughter impress the Matchmaker, and decides that more prayer is required upon realizing that Mulan is already late. Meanwhile, Fa Li is growing impatient waiting for her daughter to arrive at the village bathouse, regretting not having prayed to her ancestors herself earlier that morning, to which Grandmother Fa responds [...] "How lucky <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>be?</b> They're dead."

2500|$|The Catechism {{distinguishes between}} {{homosexual}} acts and homosexual tendencies. Regarding acts, it teaches that Sacred Scripture presents them as grave sins.
