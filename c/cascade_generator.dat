40|$|A {{stream cipher}} {{generator}} {{can not be}} considered as suitable for stream ciphers applications unless its output sequences have large periods, large linear complexities and possess certain randomness properties. The use of clock-controlled shift registers in keystream generators appears to be a good way of achieving sequences with these properties. In this thesis we look at clock-controlled generators, these are built up from two registers, one controlling the clock of a second register from which the output is taken. Examples that have appeared in the literature include the stop and go generator, the binary rate multiplier, the (a, b) clock-controlled generator, the <b>cascade</b> <b>generator,</b> and the shrinking generator. The binary rate multiplier and the (a, b) clock-controlled generator may be seen as generalizations for the stop and go generator.

On taking ratios of cumulants, geometrical effects due to spatial averaging cancel out.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{notion of}} multiplicative cascade was {{introduced}} into the statistical theory of turbulence by A. N. Kolmogorov as a phenomenological framework intended to accommodate the intermittency and large fluctuations observed in turbulent fluid flows. The basic idea is that energy is redistributed from larger to smaller scales via a splitting mechanism involving random multiplicative factors known as <b>cascade</b> <b>generators.</b> Primar-ily owing to the scaling structure of this class of models, applications have been extended {{to a wide variety}} of other naturally occurring phenomena such as rainfall, internet packet trac, market prices, etc. which exhibit intermittent and highly variable behavior in space and time. The probability distribution of the <b>cascade</b> <b>generators</b> represents a hidden pa-rameter which is reflected in the ne scale limiting behavior of certain scaling exponents calculated from a single sample realization. In this paper we describe the underlying sta-tistical theory for estimation of the distribution of the generators, discuss examples, and provide a number of open problems in the general theory. Some new results involving estimation of an important intermittency parameter, the Hausdor dimension of the sup-port set, are also included. We then proceed to identify an outstanding open statistical problem from turbulence data. 1...|$|R

40|$|The beam {{deflection}} magnet and energy control {{system of the}} Utrecht <b>cascade</b> <b>generator</b> are described. The uniform-field magnet has entrance and exit slits located outside the magnetic held. Since the <b>cascade</b> <b>generator</b> produces a vertical beam, the most convenient choice for the angle of deflection was 90 degrees. The radius of curvature of the beam {{in the region of}} the uniform-field is 20 cm, which makes it possible to deflect a one MeV beam of He+ or DeT ions with a field of 14. 5 kilograms. The value assembly of the magnet and slits can be repeated about the incoming beam in order to direct the beam to different experimental arrangements. Energy control is achieved in two steps: first the exciting current of the magnet is stabilized, the magnetic field being measured with a proton magnetic resonance fluxmeter, and second the high tension is controlled so as to maintain the deflected beam centered on the exit slit of the magnet. The expected energy resolution of the system has been verified down to an energy spread (full width at half maximum) of 0. 15 % in proton energy. At the resolution a useful beam (~ 2 μA is obtainable with a high-frequency ion delivering a total beam of about 40 μA protons...|$|E

There are many attack results using algebraic properties and side channel information against stream ciphers for hardware applications. Al-Hinai et al. presented an algebraic attack approach to a family of irregularly clock-controlled linear feedback shift register systems: the stop and go generator, self-decimated generator and alternating step generator.

It is shown that a rich family of such structures can be derived recursively from cascade predictors of two stages, denoted <b>cascade</b> <b>generators.</b> Generators are then proposed for two new cascade families, last-stage and multiplicative cascades, that generalize the two most popular cascade architectures in the literature. The concept of neutral predictors is finally introduced, enabling FCBoost to automatically determine the cascade conffguration, i. e., number of stages and number of weak learners per stage, for the learned cascades.

40|$|A {{method is}} derived of distributing the stage {{capacitances}} of a single-phase <b>cascade</b> <b>generator</b> which minimises the output ripple caused by load current. The {{design of a}} generator must also {{take account of the}} voltage-regulation characteristic, and a procedure is outlined for optimising the generator performance.

The presence of stray capacitance between the feed and load columns of the generator causes output ripple and loss of output voltage; the amplitude of ripple due to this cause is calculated. At low load currents the limitation upon performance is imposed by the characteristics of the rectifying components. This has been examined for the case of metal rectifiers. It is shown that the minimum output ripple obtainable is determined by the reverse conductivity of the rectifiers; the voltage regulation depends, upon the ratio of forward to reverse conductivity...|$|E

A recently developed scale-covariant multifractal model is then reformulated for numerical simulation of space-time rainfall fields. The two parameters of the log-Poisson distribution used as <b>cascade</b> <b>generator</b> within the model are systematically estimated from each selected rainfall sequence, and the dependence of one of these parameters on the large-scale rain rate is highlighted.

40|$|Under {{the theory}} of {{independent}} and identically distributed random cascades, the probability distribution of the <b>cascade</b> <b>generator</b> determines the spatial and the ensemble properties of spatial rainfall. Three sets of radar-derived rainfall data {{in space and time}} are analyzed to estimate the probability distribution of the generator. A detailed comparison between instantaneous scans of spatial rainfall and simulated cascades using the scaling properties of the marginal moments is carried out. This comparison highlights important similarities and differences between the data and the random cascade theory. Differences are quantified and measured for the three datasets. Evidence is presented to show that the scaling properties of the rainfall can be captured to the first order by a random cascade with a single parameter. The dependence of this parameter on forcing by the large-scale meteorological conditions, as measured by the large-scale spatial average rain rate, is investigated for these three datasets. The data show that this dependence can be captured by a one-to-one function. Since the large-scale average rain rate can be diagnosed from the large-scale dynamics, this relationship demonstrates an important linkage between the large-scale atmospheric dynamics and the statistical cascade theory of mesoscale rainfall.
