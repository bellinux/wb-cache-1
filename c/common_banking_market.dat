40|$|Our study {{reviews the}} process towards {{creating}} a single European retail <b>banking</b> <b>market.</b> The EU has aimed at integrating the traditionally heterogeneous <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> in Europe {{by means of}} harmonizing legislation. While the wholesale <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> integration {{is considered to be}} more advanced, retail banking integration is still in its infancy. Cross- border lending, cross-border mergers, and the promises of new technologies have not yet delivered the creation of a single retail <b>banking</b> <b>market.</b> In this paper we provide new evidence on this issue. In particular, we find that there are some tendencies for a more integrated corporate lending market, while consumer lending markets are still remaining more fragmented. We identify three reasons for a lack of integration: A lack of international arbitrage, a limited pass-through of interest rate changes onto lending rates, and a limited national and international competitive retail banking environment. The results also suggest that the introduction of the single currency may have already made a positive impact on retail <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> integration. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews how {{long-term}} {{relationships between}} firms and banks shape {{the structure and}} integration of <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> worldwide. <b>Bank</b> relationships arise to span informational asymmetries that are endemic in financial markets. Firm-bank relationships not only entail specific benefits and costs for both the engaged firms and banks, but also directly affect the structure of <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> In particular, the sunk cost of screening and monitoring activities and the 'informational capital' collected by the incumbent banks may act {{as a barrier to}} entry. The intensity of the existing firm-bank relationships will determine the height of this barrier and shape the structure of international <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> For example, in Scandinavia where firms maintain few and strong relationships, foreign banks may only be able to enter successfully through mergers and acquisitions. On the other hand, Southern European firms maintain many bank relationships. Therefore, banks may consider entering Southern European <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> through direct investment.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the structure of <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> and economic growth using a new dataset on manufacturing industry-level growth rates and <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> concentration for U. S. states during 1899 - 1929 - a period when the manufacturing sector was expanding rapidly and restrictive branching laws segmented the U. S. banking system geographically. Unlike studies of modern developing and developed countries, we find that <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> concentration had a positive impact on manufacturing sector growth in the early twentieth century, with little variation across industries with different degrees of dependence on external financing or access to capital. However, because regulations affecting bank entry varied considerably across U. S. states and the industrial organization of the U. S. banking system differs markedly from those of other countries, we also examine the impact of other aspects of <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> structure and policy on growth. We continue to find that <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> concentration boosted industrial growth. In addition, we find evidence that a greater prevalence of branch banking and more banks per capita increased the growth of industries that rely relatively heavily on external financing or have greater access to external funding sources, while deposit insurance depressed growth in the manufacturing sector. Regulations on bank entry and other <b>banking</b> <b>market</b> characteristics thus appear to exert an independent influence on manufacturing growth in geographically fragmented <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Bank</b> supervision; Banking market; Financial services industry; Economic development...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to {{investigate}} evidence of economies of scale and scope in various European <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> The thesis has also examined the cost implications from hypothetical bank mergers both within the French, German, Italian and Spanish <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> and cross-border in the EU. The analysis has been prompted by claims that substantial cost savings could be expected {{as the result of}} the EU's single market programme in the banking area. Economies of scale and scope, a substantial part of industrial organisations literature, have been widely examined in the US banking system, although little empirical work to date has been undertaken on European <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> This thesis aimed to rectify this imbalance in the literature by providing a detailed, in-depth and original analysis of scale and scope economies as well as investigating the cost implications of hypothetical bank mergers. Overall, the results suggest noticeable differences in cost characteristics across European <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> and strong evidence of economies of scale and scope at the plant (or branch) level in all but the Spanish market. Cost savings appear to occur mainly through the increased average size of established banks' branches rather than through adding new branches. The findings appear to indicate that scale and scope economies will be important in generating economic gains to EU <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> under the Single Market programme. The evidence from hypothetical mergers within the individual domestic <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> appears to be that mergers between large banks can generate substantial cost savings or increases depending on the particular merger partners. In general, the results indicate that opportunities for cost saving mergers seem to be greater in Germany and Spain than in the French and Italian <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> The prospects for cost saving big-bank mergers in Italy, appear to be limited. The selective results for the hypothetical mergers between the 20 largest banks within domestic <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> imply that substantial cost savings can be generated from mergers between top commercial banks in Germany. For the Italian <b>banking</b> <b>market,</b> the analyses shows that the majority of hypothetical mergers indicate an increase in predicted total costs. Moreover, the findings from Spain and France are less clear-cut. The evidence from our analysis of hypothetical cross-border mergers in the EU indicates only limited opportunities for costs saving from big bank mergers and that such mergers are more likely to result in an increase in total costs...|$|R
