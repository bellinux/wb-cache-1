5000|$|The Opel Commodore A was {{manufactured}} from 1967 to 1971, {{based on}} the Rekord C. After having offered a Rekord-6 powered by a 2.6 L 6-cylinder engine since March 1964, Opel in February 1967 launched the Commodore as a faster up-market version of the Rekord. The Commodore was initially available with the known A 2.2-litre six or a larger 2.5 L engine developing [...] with a single <b>carburettor.</b> <b>Body</b> styles comprised a two-door or four-door notchback saloon and a two-door hardtop/fastback coup√©. In September 1967 the sporty Commodore GS offering 130 hp (96 kW) from a double-carburettor 2.5 L-six was introduced.|$|E
50|$|A {{sporting}} version, the Ten-Six Special {{was also}} made in small numbers with tuned engine and twin SU <b>carburettors.</b> the standard <b>body</b> {{was an open}} four-seater, but some chassis were supplied to coachbuilders.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} often used with {{computerised}} <b>carburettors</b> or throttle <b>body</b> injection systems but is typically not used with multi-point fuel injection, {{as the problem}} of fuel falling out of suspension does not occur when the fuel injectors are located close to the inlet valves.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 and 1965, new {{modifications}} {{improved the}} torque. Then came {{a much more}} powerful version, obtained by a new camshaft, new valves, a 32 mm Solex double <b>body</b> <b>carburettor,</b> and by increasing the compression ratio by 9.2: 1. bringing the maximum power to 55 Ch SAE (49 hp DIN).|$|R
60|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} their interrupted love-scene at Reigelheimer's Restaurant that night of Lord Dawlish's unfortunate encounter with the tray-bearing waiter, Dudley Pickering's behaviour had perplexed Claire Fenwick. She had taken it for granted that next day at the latest he would resume the offer of his hand, heart, and automobiles. But time passed and he made no move in that direction. Of limousine <b>bodies,</b> <b>carburettors,</b> spark-plugs, and inner tubes he spoke with freedom and eloquence, but the subject of love and marriage he avoided absolutely. His behaviour was inexplicable.|$|R
40|$|This chapter starts by {{providing}} {{an overview of}} fuel-metering techniques developed for spark ignition (SI) engines, following by a case study on liquid versus gaseous phase liquified petroleum gas (LPG) port injection in a single-cylinder SI engine. Fuel-metering approaches, from the least to the most modern, include <b>carburettor,</b> throttle <b>body</b> injection (TBI), manifold port injection (MPI or sometime called PFI, port fuel injection), and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Based on the mixture formation process, GDI engines can be categorised into air-guided, wall-guided, and spray-guided methods while based on the ignition modes they can be homogeneous spark ignition - (HCI), stratified spark ignition (SPI) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The comparative study shows significant variations in cylinder to cylinder mixture distribution for both liquid and gaseous LPG phases. The experimental data confirms the power and efficiency advantages of liquid phase injection over gaseous phase injection. Analysis shows the charge state {{at the end of}} compression is the major contributor to the performance difference. Secondary differences such as the mixture homogeneity also have an important impact. The lower temperature combustion with liquid phase LPG also delivers substantial NOx emission reduction. Suggestions are made for overcoming the deficiency of gaseous phase injection which may be preferred as its application avoids the high cost of the high pressure in-tank LPG pump needed for liquid phase injection...|$|R
