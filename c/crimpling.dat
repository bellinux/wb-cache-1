5000|$|There {{are between}} 6 and 24 flowers on each inflorescence. The {{blossoms}} {{are the most}} variable in the Odontoglossum genus in terms of size, colour and degree of <b>crimpling</b> along the segment margins. The flowers are mostly white or pale rose, sometimes more or less spotted and blotched with brownish or reddish brown. The callus {{at the base of}} the lip is yellow and is often marked with red lines. The widely spread, flat-opening flowers are 3 to 4 inches across with very wide sepals that are elliptic, have sharply pointed tips, often overlap and are variously crisped or wavy-margined or toothed and notched along the margins. The dorsal sepal is lanceolate to egg-shaped, [...] on the margin and 1.2 to 2.0 inches long by 0.5 to 0.9 inches wide. The obliquely spreading lateral sepals are similar in size to the dorsal sepal. The horizontally spreading petals are egg-shaped to elliptic or oblong elliptic, 1.2 to 1.8 inches long by 0.7 to 1.5 inches wide, and have margins that are wavy and fairly deeply notched or toothed. The lip is oblong or somewhat fiddle-shaped. It is 0.8 to 1.2 inches long by 0.5 to 0.6 inches wide, has toothed margins and is rather sharply pointed at the apex. The callus is fleshy with a pair of diverging lobes at the apex. The slender, slightly arching column is 0.6 to 0.7 inches long and has a pair of broad wings with fringed margins toward the apex.|$|E

Cardiovascular diseases are the principal {{cause of death in}} the developed world. For computational analysis, ANSYS software was employed to study the mechanical behavior of stents. Contrary to conventional engineering materials, nitinol stent fracture is not stress based but strain based. The effects of <b>crimpling</b> and cyclic pressure loading on stent–graft fatigue life were simulated and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Received on 22 - 12 - 2013 Accepted on 20 - 01 - 2014 The {{present study}} is aimed to {{evaluate}} the in-vitro anti arthritic activity of chloroform extract of curcumalonga rhizomes using inhibition of protein denaturation model and human red blood cell membrane stabilization model. Diclofenac sodium {{was used as a}} standard drug. Results evaluated that the chloroform extract of curcumalonga at different concentrations possessed significant anti arthritic activity as compared to standard drug used as Diclofenac sodium. The results obtained in the present investigations indicate that chloroform extract of curcumalonga rhizomes showed anti arthritic activity. Key words: curcumalonga rhizomes, Anti arthritic, protein denaturation, membrane stabilization. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting the joints and particular tissue. Rheumatoid arthritis still remains a formidable disease, being capable of producing severe <b>crimpling</b> deformities and functional disabilities. Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an inflammatory arthritis,the disease comprises of three basic inter related processes like inflammation,synovial proliferation and joint tissue distruction.

Very good. If Mr <b>Crimple</b> neglects his meals, or fails to take his proper quantity of rest, that oil wanes, and becomes exhausted. What is the consequence?

When built Pannal Junction had its own separate signalbox.|$|R

To the east is Pannal which expanded, when <b>Crimple</b> Meadows {{was built in the}} 1970s, to the point at which it would have joined with Burn Bridge. A condition on building permission for <b>Crimple</b> Meadows was that there would be only a footpath and no roads, between the two villages, to maintain their separate identities.|$|R
