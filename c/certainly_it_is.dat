5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, <b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E

Swineside Knott has what has been claimed to be “the most sumptuous view” of Ullswater; <b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the most extensive view, {{from the head of}} the lake (and the fells on either side of Patterdale beyond that) {{all the way down to}} the foot of the lake at Pooley Bridge.|$|E

25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; {{it is a question of}} fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} of his extant works, {{known as}} Liber spectaculorum, {{was first published}} {{at the opening of}} the Colosseum in the reign of Titus. It relates to the theatrical performances given by him, but the book as it now stands was presented to the world in or about the first year of Domitian, i.e. about the year 81, by him. The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures at the imperial courtamong them of the notorious Crispinus, and probably (<b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> thrilling to consider) of Paris, the supposed author of Juvenal's exile, for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors xiii. and xiv., and known by the names of Xenia and Apophoretainscriptions in two lines each for presentswere published at the Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he bore for the world the first two of the twelve books on which his pendulous and sterling reputation rests.|$|E

[...] Dower cited a United Nations report from 1947 that put Chinese war dead at 9 million.|$|E
2500|$|High culture forms such as {{fine art}} and {{literature}} have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, University of Georgia literature professor Joel Black stated that [...] "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, <b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the act of murder". Black notes that [...] "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn {{be regarded as a}} kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" [...] (1991: 14). This conception of an aesthetic element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, Thomas de Quincey wrote that ...|$|E

[...] "There... essentially no research on the longitudinal stability of sexual orientation over the adult life span... It ... still an unanswered question whether... measure [...] will predict future behavior or orientation. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is...</b> not a good predictor of past behavior and self-identity, given the developmental process common to most {{gay men and lesbians}} (i.e., denial of homosexual interests and heterosexual experimentation prior to the coming-out process)." [...] Some studies report that [...] " [...] lesbian women, and some heterosexual women as well, perceive choice as an important element in their sexual orientations." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{argument}} {{is something of a}} straw man argument as very few proponents of the rule argue from Latin in any case. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear that dislike of the split infinitive does not originate from Latin. As shown above, none of the prescriptivists who started the split-infinitive controversy in the 19th century mentioned Latin in connection with it. Occasionally teachers and bloggers can be found who do oppose the split infinitive with such an argument, but it is not found in any statements of the position from the 19th or early 20th century, when the prohibition developed. Of the writers cited here (and the many others consulted) who ascribe the split-infinitive prohibition to Latinism, none cite an authority who condemned the construction on that basis. According to Richard Bailey, the prohibition does not come from a comparison with Latin, and the belief that it does is [...] "part of the folklore of linguistics".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Mansfield Park raised {{controversy}} among reviewers. In 1974, the American literary critic Joel Weinsheimer wrote that Mansfield Park was {{of all the}} Austen novels [...] "...perhaps the most profound; <b>certainly</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the most problematic". Many modern readers {{find it difficult to}} sympathise with Fanny's timidity and her disapproval of the theatricals, finding her [...] "priggish, passive, naive and hard to like." [...] They reject the idea made explicit in the final chapter that she is a better person for the relative privations of her childhood. Other critics point out that she is a complex personality, perceptive yet given to wishful thinking, and that she shows courage and grows in self-esteem during {{the latter part of the}} story. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin, who is generally critical of Fanny, argues that [...] "it is in rejecting obedience in favour of the higher dictate of remaining true to her own conscience that Fanny rises to her moment of heroism." [...] But Tomalin reflects the ambivalence that many readers feel towards Fanny when she also writes: [...] "More is made of Fanny Price's faith, which gives her the courage to resist what she thinks is wrong; it also makes her intolerant of sinners, whom she is ready to cast aside." ...|$|E
