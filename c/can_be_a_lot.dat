Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different.

[...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional.

Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
