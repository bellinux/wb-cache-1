Mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) genes {{are believed to}} cause a variety of NTDs in both mice and humans. SCRIB is a PCP-associated gene. Mice that are homozygous for the Scrib p.

We sequenced the SCRIB gene in 192 infants with spina bifida and 190 healthy controls. Among the spina bifida patients, we identified five novel missense mutations that were predicted-to-be-deleterious by the PolyPhen software. Of these five mutations, three of them (p. P 1043 L, p. P 1332 L, p. L 1520 R) significantly affected the subcellular localization of SCRIB. In addition, we demonstrated that the <b>craniorachischisis</b> mouse line- 90 mutation I 285 K, also affected SCRIB subcellular localization. In contrast, only one novel missense mutation (p.

Recently, the {{collection of}} congenital anomalies, comprising 360 specimens, was recatalogued and redescribed according to contemporary morphogenetic opinions. The original descriptions, as far as preserved, were compared with the clinical and additional findings. Based on the classification by closure site, proposed by Van Allen et al.

Sec 24 bY 613 mutants exhibit <b>craniorachischisis,</b> deficiencies in CE, and other PCP-related phenotypes. Vangl 2, {{a key component of}} the PCP-signaling pathway critical for CE, is selectively sorted into COPII vesicles by Sec 24 b. Moreover, Sec 24 bY 613 genetically interacts with a loss-of-function Vangl 2 allele (Vangl 2 LP) causing a marked increase in the prevalence of spina bifida. Interestingly, the Vangl 2 looptail point mutants D 255 E and S 464 N, known to cause defects in CE, fail to sort into COPII vesicles and are trapped in the ER. Thus, during COPII vesicle formation, Sec 24 b exhibits cargo specificity for a core PCP component, Vangl 2, the proper ER to Golgi transport of which is essential for the establishment of PCP, convergent extension, and closure of the neural tube.

40|$|Abstract Background The planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) signalling pathway {{is fundamental}} {{to a number of}} key developmental events, including initiation of neural tube closure. Disruption of the PCP pathway causes the severe neural tube defect of <b>craniorachischisis,</b> in which almost the entire brain and spinal cord fails to close. Identification of mouse mutants with <b>craniorachischisis</b> has proven a powerful way of identifying molecules that are components or regulators of the PCP pathway. In addition, identification of an allelic series of mutants, including hypomorphs and neomorphs in addition to complete nulls, can provide novel genetic tools to help elucidate the function of the PCP proteins. Results We report the identification of a new N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) -induced mutant with <b>craniorachischisis,</b> which we have named chuzhoi (chz). We demonstrate that chuzhoi mutant embryos fail to undergo initiation of neural tube closure, and have characteristics consistent with defective convergent extension. These characteristics include a broadened midline and reduced rate of increase of their length-to-width ratio. In addition, we demonstrate disruption in the orientation of outer hair cells in the inner ear, and defects in heart and lung development in chuzhoi mutants. We demonstrate a genetic interaction between chuzhoi mutants and both Vangl 2 Lp and Celsr 1 Crsh mutants, strengthening the hypothesis that chuzhoi is involved in regulating the PCP pathway. We demonstrate that chuzhoi maps to Chromosome 17 and carries a splice site mutation in Ptk 7. This mutation results in the insertion of three amino acids into the Ptk 7 protein and causes disruption of Ptk 7 protein expression in chuzhoi mutants. Conclusions The chuzhoi mutant provides an additional genetic resource to help investigate the developmental basis of several congenital abnormalities including neural tube, heart and lung defects and their relationship to disruption of PCP. The chuzhoi mutation differentially affects the expression levels of the two Ptk 7 protein isoforms and, while some Ptk 7 protein can still be detected at the membrane, chuzhoi mutants demonstrate a significant reduction in membrane localization of Ptk 7 protein. This mutant provides a useful tool to allow future studies aimed at understanding the molecular function of Ptk 7. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neural tube defects (NTDs) {{are very}} {{frequent}} congenital abnormalities in humans. Recently, we have documented independent association of Vangl 1 and Vangl 2 gene mutations with NTDs. In the Looptail mouse, homozygosity (but not heterozygosity) for loss-of-function alleles at Vangl 2 causes the severe NTD <b>craniorachischisis,</b> whereas heterozygosity for mutant variants of VANGL 1 {{is associated with}} NTDs in a human cohort of sporadic and familial cases. To understand the role of Vangl 1 in normal development, we created a mouse mutant with an inactivating mutation at Vangl 1 (Vangl 1 gt). Vangl 1 shows a dynamic pattern of expression in the developing neural tube and notochord {{at the time of}} neural tube closure. Vangl 1 gt/+ heterozygotes and Vangl 1 gt/gt homozygotes are viable and fertile, although Vangl 1 gt/gt display subtle alterations in polarity of inner hair cells of the cochlea. Remarkably, and as opposed to healthy Vangl 1 gt/+ and Vangl 2 lp/+ heterozygotes, Vangl 1 gt/+;Vangl 2 lp/+ double heterozygotes show profound developmental defects that include severe <b>craniorachischisis,</b> inner ear defects (disorganization of the stereociliary bundles of hair cells of the organ of Corti), and cardiac abnormality (aberrant right subclavian artery).

Unrelated congenital anomalies occurred less often among probands with low spina bifida (6. 7 %) than among probands with high spina bifida (19. 5 %). NTDs were seen in 7. 8 % of the siblings of probands with high spina bifida but in only 0. 7 % of the siblings of probands with low spina bifida, in 2. 2 % of the siblings of anencephalic probands, and in none of the siblings of probands with <b>craniorachischisis,</b> encephalocele, or multiple NTDS (P less than. 001).

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} of tissue convergence and extension (CE) driving axial elongation in mammalian embryos, and in particular, the cellular behaviors underlying CE in the epithelial neural tissue, {{have not been}} identified. Here we show that mouse neural cells undergo mediolaterally biased cell intercalation and exhibit both apical boundary rearrangement and polarized basolateral protrusive activity. Planar polarization and coordination of these two cell behaviors are essential for neural CE, as shown by failure of mediolateral intercalation in embryos mutant for two proteins associated with planar cell polarity signaling: Vangl 2 and Ptk 7. Embryos with mutations in Ptk 7 fail to polarize cell behaviors within {{the plane of the}} tissue, whereas Vangl 2 mutant embryos maintain tissue polarity and basal protrusive activity but are deficient in apical neighbor exchange. Neuroepithelial cells in both mutants fail to apically constrict, leading to <b>craniorachischisis.</b> These results reveal a cooperative mechanism for cell rearrangement during epithelial morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The role of Hedgehogs (Hh) in murine {{skeletal}} {{development was}} studied by overexpressing human Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in chondrocytes of transgenic mice using the collagen II promoter/enhancer. Overexpression caused a lethal <b>craniorachischisis</b> with major alterations in long bones because of defects in chondrocyte differentiation. Introduction: Hedgehogs (Hhs) are {{a family of}} secreted polypeptides that play important roles in vertebrate development, controlling many critical steps of cell differentiation and patterning. Skeletal development is affected {{in many different ways}} by Hhs. Genetic defects and anomalies of Hhs signaling pathways cause severe abnormalities in the appendicular, axial, and cranial skeleton in man and other vertebrates. Materials and Methods: Genetic manipulation of mouse embryos was used to study in vivo the function of SHH in skeletal development. By DNA microinjection into pronuclei of fertilized oocytes, we have generated transgenic mice that express SHH specifically in chondrocytes using the cartilage-specific collagen II promoter/enhancer. Transgenic skeletal development was studied at different embryonic stages by histology. The expression pattern of specific chondrocyte molecules was studied by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results: Transgenic mice died at birth with severe <b>craniorachischisis</b> and other skeletal defects in ribs, sternum, and long bones. Detailed analysis of long bones showed that chondrocyte differentiation was blocked at prehypertrophic stages, hindering endochondral ossification and trabecular bone formation, with specific defects in different limb segments. The growth plate was highly disorganized in the tibia and was completely absent in the femur and humerus, leading to skeletal elements entirely made of cartilage surrounded by a thin layer of bone. In this cartilage, chondrocytes maintained a columnar organization that was perpendicular to the bone longitudinal axis and directed toward its outer surface. The expression of SHH receptor, Patched- 1 (Ptc 1), was greatly increased in all cartilage, as well as the expression of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) at the articular surface; while the expression of Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), another member of Hh family that controls the rate of chondrocyte maturation, was greatly reduced and restricted to the displaced chondrocyte columns. Transgenic mice also revealed the ability of SHH to upregulate the expression of Sox 9, a major transcription factor implicated in chondrocyte-specific gene expression, in vivo and in vitro, acting through the proximal 6. 8 -kb-long Sox 9 promoter. Conclusion: Transgenic mice show that continuous expression of SHH in chondrocytes interferes with cell differentiation and growth plate organization and induces high levels and diffuse expression of Sox 9 in cartilaginous bones...|$|E
40|$|Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of common severe congenital anomalies which affect 1 – 2 infants per 1000 births. Most genetic and/or environmental {{factors that contribute}} to the pathogenesis of human NTDs are unknown. Recently, however, pathogenic mutations of VANGL 1 and VANGL 2 genes have been associated with some cases of human NTDs. Vangl genes encode proteins of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that regulates cell behavior during early stages of neural tube formation. Homozygous disrup-tion of PCP genes in mice results in a spectrum of NTDs, including defects that affect the entire neural axis (<b>craniorachischisis),</b> cranial NTDs (exencephaly) and spina bifida. In this paper, we report the dynamic expression of another PCP gene, Fuzzy, during neural tube formation in mice. We also identify non-synonymous Fuzzy amino acid substitutions in some patients with NTDs and demonstrate that several of these Fuzzy mutations affect formation of primary cilia and ciliary length or affect directional cell movement. Since Fuzzy knockout mice exhibit both NTDs and defective primary cilia and Fuzzy is expressed in the emerging neural tube, we propose that mutations in Fuzzy may account for a subset of NTDs in humans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractZic family zinc-finger {{proteins}} play various {{roles in}} animal development. In mice, five Zic genes (Zic 1 – 5) have been reported. Despite the partly overlapping expression profiles of these genes, mouse mutants for each Zic show distinct phenotypes. To uncover possible redundant roles, we characterized Zic 2 /Zic 3 compound mutant mice. Zic 2 and Zic 3 are both expressed in presomitic mesoderm, forming and newly generated somites with differential spatiotemporal accentuation. Mice heterozygous for the hypomorphic Zic 2 allele together with null Zic 3 allele generally showed severe malformations of the axial skeleton, including asymmetric or rostro-caudally bridged vertebrae, and {{reduction of the}} number of caudal vertebral bones, that are not obvious in single mutants. These defects were preceded by perturbed somitic marker expression, and reduced paraxial mesoderm progenitors in the primitive streak. These results suggest that Zic 2 and Zic 3 cooperatively control the segmentation of paraxial mesoderm at multiple stages. In addition to the segmentation abnormality, the compound mutant also showed neural tube defects that ran the entire rostro-caudal extent (<b>craniorachischisis),</b> suggesting that neurulation is another developmental process where Zic 2 and Zic 3 have redundant functions...|$|E
40|$|Cranial neurulation is the {{embryonic}} process {{responsible for}} {{formation of the}} brain primordium. In the mouse embryo, cranial neurulation is a piecemeal process with several initiation sites and two neuropores. Variation {{in the pattern of}} cranial neurulation occurs in different mouse strains, and a simpler version of this morphogenetic scheme has been described in human embryos. Exencephaly is more common in females than in males, an unexplained phenomenon seen in both mice and humans. As the cranial neural tube closes, a critical morphogenetic event is the formation of dorsolateral bending points near the neural fold tips, which enables subsequent midline fusion of the neural folds. Many mutant and gene-targeted mouse strains develop cranial neural tube defects, and analysis of the underlying molecular defects identifies several requirements for normal dorsolateral bending. These include a functional actin cytoskeleton, emigration of the cranial neural crest, spatio-temporally regulated apoptosis, and a balance between cell proliferation and the onset of neuronal differentiation. A small number of mouse mutants exhibit <b>craniorachischisis,</b> a combined brain and spine neurulation defect. Recent studies show that disturbance of a single molecular signalling cascade, the planar cell polarity pathway, is implicated in mutants with this defect...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{cellular}} properties {{that are essential}} for the organization of tissues during animal development, the importance of cell polarity in the plane of epithelial sheets has become increasingly clear in the past decades. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in vertebrates has indispensable roles in many aspects of their development, in particular, controlling alignment of various types of epithelial cells. Disrupted PCP {{has been linked to}} developmental defects in animals and to human pathology. Neural tube closure defects (NTD) and disorganization of the mechanosensory cells of the organ of Corti are commonly known consequences of disturbed PCP signaling in mammals. We report here a typical PCP phenotype in a mouse mutant for the Sec 24 b gene, including the severe NTD <b>craniorachischisis,</b> abnormal arrangement of outflow tract vessels and disturbed development of the cochlea. In addition, we observed genetic interaction between Sec 24 b and the known PCP gene, scribble. Sec 24 b is a component of the COPII coat protein complex {{that is part of the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -derived transport vesicles.

40|$|Oct 4 is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} pluripotency factor as it maintains Embryonic Stem (ES) cells in a pluripotent state, and, in vivo, prevents the inner cell mass (ICM) in murine embryos from differentiating into trophectoderm. However, its function in somatic tissue after this developmental stage is not well characterized. Using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase and floxed alleles of Oct 4, we investigated the effect of depleting Oct 4 in mouse embryos between the pre-streak and headfold stages, ~E 6. 0 -E 8. 0, when Oct 4 is found in dynamic patterns throughout the embryonic compartment of the mouse egg cylinder. We found that depletion of Oct 4 ~E 7. 5 resulted in a severe phenotype, comprised of <b>craniorachischisis,</b> random heart tube orientation, failed turning, defective somitogenesis and posterior truncation. Unlike in ES cells, depletion of the pluripotency factors Sox 2 and Oct 4 after E 7. 0 does not phenocopy, suggesting that ~E 7. 5 Oct 4 is required within a network that is altered relative to the pluripotency network. Oct 4 is not required in extraembryonic tissue for these processes, but is required to maintain cell viability in the embryo and normal proliferation within the primitive streak.

40|$|Neural tube defects (NTDs) are common, severe {{congenital}} malformations whose causation involves multiple genes and environmental factors. Although more than 200 genes {{are known to}} cause NTDs in mice, there has been rather limited progress in delineating the molecular basis underlying most human NTDs. Numerous genetic studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate candidate genes in cohorts of patients, with particular reference to those that participate in folate one-carbon metabolism. Although the homocysteine remethyla-tion gene MTHFR has emerged as a risk factor in some human populations, few other consistent findings have resulted from this approach. Similarly, attention focused on the human homologues of mouse NTD genes has contributed only limited positive findings to date, although an emerging association between genes of the non-canonical Wnt (planar cell polarity) pathway and NTDs provides candidates for future studies. Priorities for the next phase of this research include: (i) larger studies that are sufficiently powered to detect significant associations with relatively minor risk factors; (ii) analysis of multiple candidate genes in groups of well-genotyped individuals to detect possible gene–gene interactions; (iii) use of high throughput genomic technology to evaluate the role of copy number variants and to detect ‘private ’ and regulatory mutations, neither of which have been studied to date; (iv) detailed analysis of patient samples stratified by phenotype to enable, for example, hypothesis-driven testing of candidates genes in groups of NTDs with specific defects of folate metabolism, or in groups of fetuses with well-defined phenotypes such as <b>craniorachischisis...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A precise {{temporal}} and spatial regulation of gene expression is necessary to achieve neural tube closure. Med 12, a subunit of the mediator complex, can bind transcription factors and modulate expression of their target genes. Med 12 is essential during early mouse development and is important for neural tube closure. METHODS: We have made use of a mouse line carrying a conditional null allele of the X-linked Med 12 gene to generate heterozygous female embryos that express Med 12 in a mosaic fashion thus allowing {{the study of the}} role of Med 12 during neural tube closure. RESULTS: Mosaic expression of Med 12 causes a wide variety of embryonic phenotypes. Some embryos were unable to complete turning and were found with arrested development at embryonic day (ED) 9. 5. Others were able to pass ED 12. 5 and displayed defects in neural tube closure. These defects included exencephaly, spina bifida, <b>craniorachischisis,</b> split face, and curly tail. Histologic and skeletal analyses of these mutant females show that the neural plate is unable to elevate and is completely flat in the regions of the body axis where neural tube closure fails. CONCLUSIONS: We report examples of all known neural tube defects implying Med 12 in the full process of neural tube closure along the complete body axis. Our work points to Med 12 being an essential coregulator of transcription factors controlling neural tube closure...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{genetics}} {{has been}} a field of interest for over a hundred years. We have set out to perform an ENU mutagenesis screen in the mouse at E 10. 5. In the first chapter the pathways and developmental processes described in this thesis are introduced. In the second chapter we describe the ENU-mutagenesis screen for developmental abnormalities at E 10. 5 that was {{the basis of this}} thesis. We identified a series of novel mutants and alleles that display diverse defects. Cardiac and nuchal edema, neural tube defects, situs-inversus of the heart, shorter anterior-posterior axis and the absence of limbs and lungs are examples of the abnormalities we identified. Due {{to the nature of the}} mutagen ENU that induces point mutations we identified both mutants with severe protein truncations and mutants with interesting amino acid substitutions that may tell us more about the functional domains in the proteins. In chapter three, two mutants identified in the ENU-screen are described. The Sec 24 b and Scribble mutants both have a remarkable similar phenotype; they show <b>craniorachischisis,</b> abnormal arrangement of outflow tract vessels and disturbed development of the cochlea. All are characteristics of defects in the planar cell polarity pathway. Sec 24 b is involved in the formation of COPII coated vesicles that are responsible for ER to golgi protein trafficking. We show that Sec 24 b in specifically crucial in the transport of the PCP protein Vangl 2. Btaf 1, a protein involved in RNAII-polymerase transcription and a negative regulator of TBP, is essential for embryonic development. In the 4 th chapter of this thesis we describe a point mutation disrupting Btaf 1 function. Btaf 1 V 1330 M mutants are characterized by delayed development starting around E 8. 25 and severe edema in the pericardial sac at E 9. 5. By western blot we show a reduction in Btaf 1 protein levels at E 8. 5 and 9. 5 likely due to a steric clash of Btaf 1 V 1330 M with the tryptophan at position 1340. Microarray analysis showed a higher number of down-regulated genes vs. up-regulated genes. Apob and the heart specific gene Titin are amongst the down regulated genes, homozygous mutants for either of the genes die around E 10. 5. We suggest that the down-regulation of these genes, amongst others, in Btaf 1 mutant embryos may cause the lethality. In the chapter 5 we describe a mutant showing severe cardiac edema at E 9. 5. We identified a point mutation resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved asparagine by lysine at amino acid position 874. The affected gene encoding for the sodium calcium exchanger Ncx 1 has been under a lot of investigation and is important for the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Knock-out phenotypes in the mouse exhibit highly similar defects compared to our mutant. We demonstrated intrinsic functional abnormalities of cardiomyocytes by ex vivo analysis. By western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry we demonstrated normal levels and subcellular localization of the mutant protein. This suggests that the abnormalities are not caused by a major disturbance of protein structure, but by reduced protein activity. Here we show the first in vivo model for the importance of amino acid N 874 in sodium calcium exchange by Ncx...|$|E
40|$|Neurulation is an {{essential}} process during early embryogenesis that results {{in the formation of}} the neural tube, the precursor of the brain and spinal cord. Neurulation includes neural fold elevation and bending, and adhesion and fusion of the neural folds. Disruptions that modizy the union of the neural fold in any of these steps could prevent neural tube closure. Neurulation has long been of interest in order to understand the origin of neural tube defects (NTDs) because, NTDs, including spine bifida, are one of the most prevalent (around 1 / 1000 births) and severe congenital malformations among human pregnancies. The initial step on neural tube closure is shaping of the neural plate, a process driven by convergent extension movements and regulated by components ofthe Non-canonical Wnt pathway, particularly of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) branch. Wnt/PCP describes the polarization of cells perpendicular to their apical-basal axis and this pathway is regulated by a group of core genes including Frizzled, Dishevelled, Vangl 2 /Strabismus, and the intracellular proteins Prickle and Diego, among others. Studies in Xenopus and mice embryos have demonstrated that alterations ofthe Wnt/PCP signaling pathway disrupt convergent extension movements of the mesoderm and neuroectoderm resulting in shorter and broader embryos, with an abnormal neural plate and defective neural tube closure. The first indication for a role of Wnt/PCP genes in mouse development carne from the analysis of the Loop-tail (Lp) mouse which has a point mutation in Vang/ 2. The Lp mutant mouse provides a model for the most severe mutant NTDs, <b>craniorachischisis,</b> in which the brain and spinal cord remain open. In addition, analyses of mice mutants for Wnt/PCP core genes have revealed a growing list of new Wnt/PCP phenotypes such us convergence and extension of the Organ of Corti and orientation of stereociliary hair bundles in the sensory epithelia ofthe cochlea, among others. Previously, in our laboratory we have demonstrated that Xenopus Syndecan- 4 (xSdc 4), a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan and component of the extracellular matrix, is essential for convergent extension, neural tube closure and neural crest directed migration in Xenopus embryos through a non-canonical Wnt mechanism (Matthews et al., 2008; Muñoz et al., 2006). These evidences, together with the fact that components of the Wnt/PCP pathway are involved in gastrulation and neurulation movements suggest a possible interaction between xSdc 4 and components of the Wnt/PCP pathway. In this thesis we have evaluated the expression and function of Syndecan- 4 (Sdc 4) and its relation with the Wnt/PCP pathway during mouse development. Importantly, no role for Sdc 4 during mouse development has been described before. Here, we have found that Sdc 4 has a widespread expression pattern in many tissues including those that requires Wnt/PCP pathway and overlapped temporally and spatially with Vangl 2 and Frizzled- 3 in the neural tube and neural folds. The cochlea phenotype in Sdc 4 -/embryos shows an asymmetry in the hair cells of the organ of Corti and additional sensory hair cells outside of the sensory epithelia, a classical Wnt/PCP phenotype. The introduction of a heterozygous mutation of a Wnt/PCP gene, Vangl 2, in the Sdc 4 homozygous mutant resulted in abnormalities characteristic of Wnt/PCP mutants such as neural tube closure defects, disorientation of stereociliary hair bundles and disorganization of cell-cell contacts in the cochlea and in vivo defective wound healing. Moreover, we have found that Vangl 2 regulate Sdc 4 levels in the surface of non-neuronal ectoderm in the closing neural tube and otic vesicle. Additionally, other proteoglycans member family (Syndecan - 1 and - 3) were upxvi regulated in Sdc 4 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblast suggesting redundancy between syndecans in Sdc 4 null mice. Our results strongly suggest that Sdc 4 is as a new player of Wnt/PCP pathway unveiling its importance during neural tube closure in mammalian embryos and providing a novel genetic tool to help to understand the function ofthe Wnt/PCP pathway. In addition, this study will contribute to understand the precise molecular role of the extracellular matrix in predisposing NTD...|$|E
