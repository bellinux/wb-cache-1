We find most cybersecurity specialists in the popular domain use management guru techniques and manipulate common cognitive limitations in order to over-dramatize and over-simplify <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>risks</b> to critical infrastructure (CI). We argue there is a role for government: to collect, validate and disseminate more data among owners and operators of CI; to adopt institutional arrangements {{with an eye to}} moderating exaggerated claims; to reframe the debate as one of trade-offs between threats and opportunities as opposed to one of survival; and, finally, to encourage education programs in order to stimulate a more informed debate over the longer term...|$|R

40|$|With various views being posed on cybersecurity, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the proposition that}} <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>risks</b> are inflated. Due {{to the complexity of}} the <b>cybersecurity</b> environment, the <b>risks</b> will be dichotomised into two distinct categories—those posed by cybercrime, and those classified as cyber-warfare. In relation to cyber-crime, the paper examines the rise of cyber-crime, its costs, and the views of these factors by “alarmists” and “sceptics. ” In relation to cyber-war, the paper sets aside the emotive issue of the consequences and focuses on the likelihood of a catastrophic attack. The paper concludes that the risk of cyber-crime is real, but the sometimes mooted existential threat poses by cyber-war is inflated. The paper argues that it is important for cyber defences to improve in line with the risks, and to do this, researchers need to work across both categories of cybersecurity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: These days, {{ordinary}} {{people have become}} cybercitizens, or inhabitants of cyberspace, and they are more connected than ever. Unfortunately with this connectedness, comes serious <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>risks.</b> It is therefore important that as cybercitizens, people follow proper Cybercitizenship when online, and develop good cybersecurity habits. Especially digital natives such as university students, {{who grew up with}} technology, and are comfortable using it in all aspects of their life. They are deemed heavy users, but seem to ignore basic information security, which result in 40 % of them experiencing cybercrime (Norton Cyber Security Insights Report, 2016). For this reason, the Centre for Academic Technologies at the University of Johannesburg launched (January 2017) their online Cybercitizenship module (UJCYBER). It is an awareness programme with the objective to support students in their journey of understanding, appreciating and reacting to the dangers that loom in cyberspace, in order to proactively create a positive cyber footprint.

40|$|In today’s technologically {{dependent}} world, {{concerns about}} cybersecurity, data breaches, and compromised personal information infiltrate the news almost daily. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently {{emerged as a}} regulator that is keenly focused on cybersecurity, specifically with respect to encouraging disclosures in this arena by regulated entities. Although the SEC has issued non-binding “guidance” to help companies navigate their reporting obligations in this sector, the agency lacks binding cybersecurity disclosure regulations as they pertain generally to public companies. Given that the SEC has already relied on such guidance in threatening enforcement actions, reporting companies are increasingly pressured for compliance in this arena. This Article addresses the importance of establishing effective internal reporting channels and other internal compliance mechanisms in meeting the SEC’s expectations and highlights the role of “cybersecurity whistleblowers,” specifically those reporting internally, in building the type of improved corporate culture necessary to discover and remediate <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>risks.</b> <b>Cybersecurity</b> whistleblowers, like all whistleblowers, commonly experience retaliation for their efforts. Despite the SEC’s commitment to providing whistleblowers retaliation protections through statutes like the Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank Acts, the absence of binding cybersecurity regulations translates into a direct problem for cybersecurity whistleblowers, because their reports are likely to fall {{outside the scope of}} “protected activity” enumerated under these statutes. This Article discusses this gap in protections in light of the SEC’s heightened cybersecurity focus, the feasibility of SEC adoption of binding cybersecurity disclosure regulations, and the broad contributions of whistleblowers to compliance systems generally...|$|R
40|$|In {{critical}} infrastructures, communication {{networks are}} used to exchange vital data among elements of Industrial Control Systems (ICSes). Due to the criticality of such systems and the increase of the <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>risks</b> in these contexts, best practices recommend the adoption of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) as monitoring facilities. The choice of the positions of IDSes is crucial to monitor as many streams of data traffic as possible. This {{is especially true for}} the traffic patterns of ICS networks, mostly confined in many subnetworks, which are geographically distributed and largely autonomous. We introduce a methodology and a software architecture that allow an ICS operator to use the spare bandwidth that might be available in over-provisioned networks to forward replicas of traffic streams towards a single IDS placed at an arbitrary location. We leverage certain characteristics of ICS networks, like stability of topology and bandwidth needs predictability, and make use of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. We fulfill strict requirements about packet loss, for both functional and security aspects. Finally, we evaluate our approach on network topologies derived from real networks...|$|R
