5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new <b>cultural</b> <b>forms.</b> Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
25|$|In later films, Resnais {{moved away}} from the overtly {{political}} topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other <b>cultural</b> <b>forms,</b> including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} centuries {{confirmed the}} Byzantine {{orientation of the}} Georgian Church, and its estrangement from the Armenian Church.

The integration of western and eastern Georgian churches from the 9th century also sealed the Orthodox nature of the Georgian Church, as Byzantine liturgy and <b>cultural</b> <b>forms</b> spread {{to the detriment of}} traditional Oriental practice.|$|E
50|$|Like Huizinga, Caillois sees a {{tendency}} for a corruption {{of the values of}} play in modern society as well as for play to be institutionalised in the structures of society.

25|$|In 1901 (see 1901 in music), oil was {{discovered}} at Jennings and immigration boomed.

25|$|The Marxist {{linguist}} Valerian Borisovich Aptekar was {{an opponent}} of traditional ethnography, strongly expressing his opinion in a debate on 7 May 1928. He argued that the subject was not scientific, that its concepts were vague, and that by treating the development of mankind {{in terms of the}} evolution of <b>cultural</b> <b>forms</b> the ethnographers denied the more fundamental forces of production and class struggle. The subject could only be approached in terms of dialectical materialism.|$|E
25|$|According to Girard, just as {{the theory}} of natural {{selection}} of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains {{the origin of the}} infinite diversity of <b>cultural</b> <b>forms.</b> The analogy with Darwin also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary to the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.|$|E

40|$|This volume investigates urbanity as a <b>cultural</b> <b>form.</b> The essays {{illustrate}} {{the real and}} imaginary ways that we interact with the cities through the portal of the arts. It is designed to introduce readers to the interactions and crossovers between culture and the city. The volume in fact intends to investigate urbanity as a <b>cultural</b> <b>form</b> {{on the basis of}} a broader and geographically representative collection of case studies. In particular it offers a stimulating range of inter-disciplinary perspectives showing that urban space manifests itself as an interpretative gaze, anchored in human life not just as something to look at but as a <b>cultural</b> <b>form</b> to live in socially. The essays {{illustrate the}} real and imaginary ways that we interact with the cities through the portal of the arts. The authors seek to expand and enhance our understanding of how Art, Architecture, Music, Fashion, Film and Media critically engage with urban space and actively contribute to the creation of original cityscapes thus revealing various cultural models of development...|$|R
25|$|During the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean {{people began}} to assert their cultural, {{economic}} and political rights on the world stage. The Jamaican Marcus Garvey formed the UNIA movement in the U.S., continuing with Aimé Césaire's négritude movement, which was intended to create a pan-African movement across national lines. From the 1960s, the former slave populations in the Caribbean began to win their independence from British colonial rule. They were pre-eminent in creating new <b>cultural</b> <b>forms</b> such as calypso, reggae music, and rastafarianism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as Stokely Carmichael and DJ Kool Herc in the United States, was influential {{in the creation of}} the black power and Hip Hop movements. Influential political theorists such as Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon and Stuart Hall contributed to anti-colonial theory and movements in Africa, as well as cultural developments in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Radakovich's {{style is}} a {{combination}} of Appropriation, Neo-Expressionism and Neo-Surrealism. In his paintings, he uses cryptic relationships, sexual scenarios and psychologically charged tableaux. His Surrealistic atmospheres, cartoon like drawing and appropriated Modigliani-like heads are painted in a linear but expressionist technique. The paintings are frontal and highly colored often evoking the space of Indian miniatures. The sculptural works often incorporate totem structures that stack body parts and biomorphic elements. Although inspired by primitive <b>cultural</b> <b>forms,</b> the totems are modern urban signposts containing the dramas of city life. Disrupted narratives beg the viewer to unravel the tale that is set before them. His paintings are filled with urban dramas where the participants struggle with the problems of modern life, often with comical results. The figures in his work are posed in psychologically ambiguous terms. The elongated heads are Icons of humans in a mechanized society grappling with the questions of desire and nature.|$|E

[...] He argues that culture developed within the slave community independent of the slaveowners' influence. Blassingame notes, [...] "Antebellum black slaves created several unique <b>cultural</b> <b>forms</b> which lightened their burden of oppression, promoted group solidarity, provided ways for verbalizing aggression, sustaining hope, building self-esteem, and often represented areas of life largely free from the control of whites." ...|$|E
500|$|The maids also deliver {{their version}} of {{narrative}} justice on Odysseus and Telemachus, who ordered and carried out their execution, and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing. The maids {{do not have the}} same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to unauthoritative genres, though their persistence eventually leads to more valued <b>cultural</b> <b>forms.</b> Their testimony, contrasted with Penelope's excuses while condemning Helen, demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth. When compared with the historical record, dominated by the stories in the Odyssey, the conclusion, as one academic states, is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by [...] "who has the power to say who is punished, whose ideas count", and that [...] "justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics".|$|E
500|$|Following the Axis {{occupation}} of Yugoslavia, Drljević {{had become a}} proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs. As early as 1921, he had stated that Serbian and Montenegrin [...] "mentalities" [...] were diametrically opposed. He stated: [...] "The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable. The visage of the former was speckled with [...] slavery; liberty gave the latter a new visage." [...] It was not until 1941 that Drljević advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all, but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians. He wrote:Races are communities of blood, whereas people are creatures of history. With their language, the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic linguistic community. By their blood, however, they belong [...] According to the contemporary science of European races, [...] peoples are descended from the Illyrians. Hence, not just the kinship, but the identity of certain <b>cultural</b> <b>forms</b> among the Dinaric peoples, {{all the way from}} Albanians to South Tyroleans, who are Germanized Illyrians.|$|E
40|$|The {{cultural}} {{relation between}} media and its users is undergoing transition. One influence {{comes from the}} changing quality of the interrelation of media, commodities and events.

Firstly the <b>cultural</b> <b>form</b> (Raymond Williams 1975) of the relation between media, commodities, and situation for which Popstars is an example. The second strand of the essay will deal with the socialization process resultant from of this transitional <b>cultural</b> <b>form.</b> Differently expressed with a more actual wording of the available theories, a specific socialization process emerges with the complex of multimedia, intertextual cultural products, landscapes and mediated spaces of childhood...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that language evolution {{is a process of}} cultural change, in which linguistic structures are shaped through repeated cycles of learning and use by domain-general mechanisms. This paper draws out the implications of this viewpoint for understanding the problem of language acquisition, which is cast in a new, and much more tractable, form. In essence, the child faces a problem of induction, where the objective is to coordinate with others (C-induction), rather than to model the structure of the natural world (N-induction). We argue that, of the two, C-induction is dramatically easier. More broadly, we argue that understanding the acquisition of any <b>cultural</b> <b>form,</b> whether linguistic or otherwise, during development, requires considering the corresponding question of how that <b>cultural</b> <b>form</b> arose through processes of cultural evolution. This perspective helps resolve the "logical" problem of language acquisition and has far-reaching implications for evolutionary psychology...|$|R
