40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} optimal preservatives for a multidose formulation of a humanized monoclonal antibody using experimental design techniques. The effect of antimicrobial parenteral preservatives (benzyl alcohol, <b>chlorobutanol,</b> methyl paraben, propylparaben, phenol, and m-cresol) on protein stability was assessed using size-exclusion chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, right-angle light scattering, UV spectroscopy, and potency testing using a cell-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting method. A quick, cost-effective preservative screening test was designed. Combinations of preservatives were examined using an I-optimal experimental design. The protein was most stable in the presence of methylparaben and propylparaben, and was compatible with benzyl alcohol and <b>chlorobutanol</b> at low concentrations. Phenol and m-cresol were not compatible with the protein. The I-optimal experimental design indicated that as an individual preservative, benzyl alcohol was promising.

40|$|Abstract The {{possibility}} that enflurane defluorination is increased following treatment with isoniazid {{was investigated in}} male Fischer 344 rats. The effects of various isoniazid dosage regimens on the hepatic microsomal defluorination rates of enflurane were {{compared with those of}} several other ether anesthetics, and the conditions for production of maximal enflurane defluorination rates were determined. Seven to ten days of treatment with 50 mg/kg/day isoniazid (Nydrazid) resulted in maximal rates of defluorination of methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane with no overt sign of toxicity. Compared with saline treatment of control rats, isoniazid increased defluorination of enflurane 370 per cent, methoxyflurane 259 per cent, sevoflurane 283 per cent, and isoflurane 168 per cent. Previous studies have shown that while the enzyme inducer phenobarbital increased in vitro rates of methoxyflurane defluorination approximately 1000 per cent, the rate of enflurane defluorination remained unchanged or increased by 100 per cent at most. In this study, enhanced hepatic microsomal defluorination was not associated with an increase in cytochrome P- 450 per mg protein.

40|$|Although {{the release}} of {{oxytocin}} from the neurohypophysis has been demon-strated both after physiological stimuli such as suckling (Fitzpatrick, 1961) and after administration of pharmacological agents such as nicotine (Bisset & Walker, 1953), very little work {{appears to have been}} carried out to investigate how quickly oxytocin is repleted at the posterior pituitary gland after release. In the present investigation the oxytocin content of the pituitary gland was determined at 2, 10, 30 and 120 min after intravenous administration of nicotine to rats. The effect of previous admini-stration of pheniramine, an antihistamine, on the oxytocin-releasing action of nicotine was studied in a further series of experiments. Male albino rats (150 - 200 g) were used. Nicotine bitartarate at a dose of 1 mg/kg was injected slowly into the tail vein of the rat. Groups of rats were killed by decapi-tation at 2, 10, 30 and 120 min after the administration of nicotine.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the nonvolatile, water soluble, bis(hydroxyalkyl) N-nitrosamines produced from the reaction of spermidine and nitrite. The biologically occurring polyamine spermidine was reacted with nitrite in the presence of acid. The reaction products were isolated and converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. The derivatized products were separated by gas-liquid chromatography using an all glass, wall coated, capillary column. Mass spectral data were collected on the chromatographic effluent. Four isomers of bis(hydroxyalkyl) N-nitrosamine were synthesized by combining the appropriate aminopropanol with the appropriate <b>chlorobutanol.</b> Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectral, and thin-layer chromatographic data were collected on the synthetic compounds to assure their structure.

40|$|Nasal spray {{products}} containing desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) {{were tested}} in vitro to evaluate {{the effect of the}} contained preservatives on drug permeation across rabbit nasalmucosa. Experiments were performed using Franz-type diffusion cells with rabbit nasal mucosa as model barrier. Transport profiles obtained in comparison with a preservative-free solution evidenced that in the presence of preservatives DDAVP permeation in vitro always increased (p < 0. 05), although at different extents (<b>chlorobutanol</b> < benzalkonium < sorbate). While for benzalkonium structural damage of the mucosa could occur decreasing its barrier properties, the effect of sorbate on drug transport was further investigated, being less studied. After having found that sorbate permeated together with DDAVP, the hypothesis that the two compounds formed an ion pair in solution with improved permeability was made. Additional experiments with aqueous test solutions reconstructed ad hoc containing desmopressin and varying sorbate concentrations confirmed the enhancing effect of sorbate, which however resulted to be independent of sorbate concentration. In conclusion, preservatives significantly enhanced desmopressin permeation in vitro across rabbit nasal mucosa with different mechanisms. If a correlation existed between these data and in vivo DDAVP bioavailability after nasal administration, this could strengthen the safety concerns related to the use of this medication in adults and children...|$|E
40|$|Nebulized {{bronchodilator}} {{solutions are}} available in the United States as both nonsterile and sterile-filled products. Sulfites, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), or <b>chlorobutanol</b> are added to nonsterile products to prevent bacterial growth. Bronchoconstriction from inhaled BAC is cumulative, prolonged, and correlates directly with basal airway responsiveness. The multi-dose dropper bottle of albuterol sulfate solution contains 50  μg BAC per/ 2. 5 mg of albuterol, which may be below or at the lower limit of the threshold dose for bronchoconstriction. However, with repeated albuterol nebulization, the effect can be additive and cumulative, often exceeding the bronchoconstriction threshold. We report a case of a 17 years old patient, who received 32 mg of BAC via nebulization over a period of 3. 5 days that probably caused persistent bronchospasm evidenced by failure to improve clinically and to increase peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) from 125 L/min (27 % of predicted value) to 300 L/min (68 % of predicted value) within 2 hours of withdrawing BAC. The patient's respiratory status and PEFR improved dramatically once the nebulization solution was switched to BAC free lev-albuterol solution.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} instilling 13 commonly used preservatives on the murine cornea in vivo. Due to the instillation of preservatives, micro-lesions are formed on the cornea and can be selectively marked by fluorescein. The sum of the resulting fluorescent areas was measured using an episcopic microscope coupled to an image processing system. All the tested preservatives proved to be well-tolerated by the eye at commonly used concentrations. However, in some cases, increased concentrations of preservatives or combinations resulted in significant increase {{of the amount of}} corneal damage. With increasing the concentration, corneal lesion increased the most in the case of cetylpyridinium. While a combination of <b>chlorobutanol</b> 0. 5 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 5 % did not result in an increase in corneal damage (when compared to the use of each separately), the associations of thiomersal 0. 02 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 4 % on one hand and of edetate disodium (EDTA) 0. 1 % and benzalkonium 0. 01 % on the other, resulted in significant increases in the amount of corneal damage.

40|$|Purpose: Desmopressin acetate (DDAPV), a {{synthetic}} analogue of vasopressin, has been recommended {{to be used}} in diabetes insipidus, mild forms of hemophilia and Von Willebrand disease. The DDAPV is available for adminstration via different routes viz. oral, parenteral and nasal, however its dose is very less in case of nasal sprays (20 µg) and parenteral route (4 µg) compared to oral route (0. 1 to 0. 3 mg in tablet). A sensitive and selective method is needed to be developed and validated for assay of low concentrations of DDAPV in its pharmaceutical dosage form i. e. nasal spray. Methods: Simple and specific HPLC-Fluorescecne method has been proposed for the quantitation of DDAPV at nanogram level in nasal formulations for the first time. DAPV, DDAPV EP impurity-B, <b>chlorobutanol,</b> benzalkonoium chloride were successfully derivatised with Ortho-Phthalaldehyde (OPA) and co-eluted on a C 8 (50 × 2. 1 mm, 3. 5 µm particle size, 120 Å) with mobile phase composed of 0. 1 % trifluroacetic acid, acetonitrile and Isopropyl alcohol in ratio of 70 : 25 : 5. The emission was measured at 450 nm and flow rate was 0. 8 ml/min. The reaction was optimized in the terms of pH, stability of formed fluorophore and time consumed during the reaction. Results: The maximal fluorescence intensity was reached when the solutions were mixed for 3 min, and remained constant for at least 30 min at 20 - 25 ºC. The calibration curve was found linear from 50 to 5000 ng/ml with weight of 1 /X 2. The limit of detection was 10 ng/ml and precision was less than 2. 0. Conclusion: The developed HPLC-fluorescence assay method was successfully applied for quantitation of DDAPV in nasal spray. HPLC-Fluorescence method was specific, sensitive, precise and accurate for determination of DDAPV. The method was able to quantify DDAPV at 50 ng/ml with sufficient accuracy and precision.
