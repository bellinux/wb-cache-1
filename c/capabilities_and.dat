5|$|The destroyers are a {{follow-on}} of the Project 15 s, but {{are considerably}} more capable due to major {{improvements in the}} design, the addition of substantial land-attack <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> the fitting-out of modern sensors and weapons systems.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> would be cheaper to implement.|$|E

40|$|Although {{previous}} research has addressed the interface and logical association among marketing, information technology (IT) and supply chain management, there have been few, if any, attempts to investigate how IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> influence supply chain integration (SCI). Thus, this study investigates the direct and interacting effects of IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> on SCI. The hypothesised relationships were tested using survey data gathered from 329 firms in China’s manufacturing industry. The results reveal that both IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> have a significant positive effect on SCI. Interestingly, no significant interaction effect was found, indicating that marketing IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> influence SCI independently, and not synergistically. However, while IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capability</b> do not interact, IT capability does mediate the impact of marketing capability on SCI...|$|R

40|$|Drawing {{upon the}} resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study investigates the {{relationships}} among marketing <b>capability,</b> operations <b>capability,</b> <b>and</b> financial performance. Using archival data of 186 retail firms in the UK, we find that that marketing capability has {{a significant impact on}} operations <b>capability,</b> <b>and</b> that operations <b>capability</b> is significantly <b>and</b> positively related to retail efficiency. The results also suggest that operations capability fully mediates the relationship between marketing <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> financial performance. The findings of this study provide practical insights for practicing managers to consider when developing functional capabilities in order to achieve superior financial performance.

Firm specific IT resources are classified as IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. A matched-sample comparison group metho-dology and publicly available ratings are used to assess IT <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> firm performance.

40|$|The {{resource}} based view {{of strategy}} suggests that competitiveness in part derives from a firms ability {{to collaborate with}} a subset of its supply network to co-create highly valued products and services. This relational capability relies on a foundational intra and inter-organisational architecture, the manifestation of strategic, people, and process decisions facilitating the interface between the firm and its strategic suppliers. Using covariance-based structural equation modelling we examine the relationships between internal and external features of relational architecture, and their relationship with relational <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> relational quality. This is undertaken on data collected by mail survey. We find significant relationships between {{both internal and external}} relational architecture <b>and</b> relational <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> between relational <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> relational quality.

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle.

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{occurrence}} {{and frequency of}} use of attitudinal judgement in British advertisement texts. Judgement, {{as one of the}} main attitudinal categories in the discourse-semantic appraisal model (Martin and White 2005), is concerned with the evaluation of human character and behaviour. The article focuses on the judgement categories of <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> propriety, as the research described concludes that they are the most frequently occurring of the judgement categories. Some typical instances encoding <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> propriety are discussed in terms of explicit and implicit manifestation. The article demonstrates that <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> propriety often participate in attitudinal double-coding due to the brevity of advertising texts and the creativity of advertising language. <b>Capability</b> <b>and</b> propriety are strongly socially motivated: they impose values upon the potential consumer, and hence upon society, and through them create social roles for the participants in the advertising interaction...|$|R

5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking.

The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared.
