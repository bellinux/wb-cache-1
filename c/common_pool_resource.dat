40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> such as rangeland, forests, fallow fields, {{and ponds}} provide {{an array of}} social and {{economic}} benefits {{for a wide variety of}} users in semi-arid West Africa. However, poor definition and enforcement of the institutional arrangements governing the use of these resources sometimes lead to social conflicts and resource degradation. This problem arises partly due to the multiple functions and temporal variability of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> and partly due to the heterogeneity and overlapping rights of users. These features and increasing concerns about the future productive capacity of the natural resource base raise important questions concerning the choice of institutions most likely to promote sustainable management of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> This paper presents evidence from field studies on the current status, use and management of multi-product, <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> in semi-arid West Africa. The evidence suggests that the large number of heterogenous users and the multiple functions of these resources permit an intensive use of land and serve to minimize production risk. The divergent interests and preferences of various user groups, however, need to be reconciled to prevent resource degradation. The paper provides guidelines on institutional arrangements and policy measures to promote improved management of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> in semi-arid West Africa and other areas with similar agro-ecological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> through collective action {{is dependent upon}} {{the efforts of the}} resources users to establish an identity that is held collectively. It is widely accepted that the term <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> implies a resource that is common to a ‘pool’ of people, the resource users. Their interests in the resource connect users and potential users, and we propose that the more strongly they identify with the resources and commit to act collectively, the stronger the collective action. Achieving sustainable use of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> is thus determined by the interplay between collective identity and collective action. But collective identity as defined by the resource and its users is dynamic, making the identity vulnerable in directing the behaviour of users. In this paper, we draw on collective identity and resilience theories to develop a framework for exploring the role of collective identity in understanding collective action in the {{management of}} <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> We suggest that two key attributes of collective identity – identification and affective commitment, provide the premise for interpreting, tracking and directing change in collective identity. We interpret how the interactions between the two attributes contribute to resilience of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> as complex social-ecological systems. </span...|$|R

The management of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> is modeled as a strategic interaction process between two heterogeneous communities that are directly or indirectly dependent upon it.

40|$|Most of the {{environmental}} problems result from the over-exploitation {{and use of the}} so-called “common <b>pool</b> <b>resources.</b> ” From the perspective of the global commons, these resources are characterised as either the “common heritage of mankind” or the “common concern of mankind,” and are regulated under various treaty regimes.

[...] Water is inherently a common pool resource; however it takes on qualities of a private good when property rights are assigned and its consumption becomes both rival and excludable by a water rights holder. Still, water is not a pure private good when property rights are assigned because non-water rights holding beneficiaries can access water upstream. Irrigation water will also percolate and recycle back to the stream so non-water rights holding beneficiaries downstream will benefit from return flows.

Ostrom’s theory of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> management highlights the value of community-created institutions in the governing of a common resource (communication, rule-making, sanctions, conflict resolution etc.). German & Keeler’s proposal is to extrapolate these successful principles and apply them across “diverse property regimes”, for state-owned, private and communal resources, creating hybrid institutions that combine usually distinct governance regimes. The proposal is that thecombining technical and enforcement capacity of the state, the legal certainty of ownership, and the successful principles of self-organisation may help govern responses where property regimes are contentious or overlap, or where issues exist that do not respect discrete regimes of resource tenure (for example pests, weeds, or watercourse pollution).This proposal argues for hybridity not between two sectors or organisations, but between previously distinct institutional configurations associated with separate modes of governance: ...|$|E
5000|$|At its {{statehood}} (1850), California {{adopted the}} system of English Common Law riparian rights, but {{with the advent of}} the California Gold Rush and eventual abundance of water claims by miners, California adopted the appropriative rights system as well one year later. California also observes Pueblo rights, a remnant of Spanish law in modern-day California, which allows an entire town to claim right to water. There are other rights California observes, such as prescriptive rights and federal reserved rights, but riparian and prior appropriation rights are the two prominent types of rights in the state. Finally, California has observed the doctrine of [...] "reasonable use" [...] for groundwater since 1903. Because of the many water rights California recognizes, its water rights scheme is a considered a [...] "plural system". Bearing on water trading, because California adopted riparian rights before appropriative rights, riparian rights have priority over senior appropriative rights. California’s 1914 Water Commission Act established a permit system for surface water appropriative rights and created an agency (that would eventually become the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)), to administer those permits. All water application must meet beneficial use requirements (California Water Code §100) (beneficial use includes aquaculture, domestic use, fire protection, fish and wildlife, crop frost protection, heat control, industrial use, irrigation, mining, municipal, power, recreation, stockwatering, and water quality control) but post-1914 appropriative rights are subject to more scrutiny and regulation by the SWRCB. By law (California Water Code §102), water in California is public property (and therefore a common pool resource); water rights only entitle the holder to use of water, not ownership of water. In fact, §104 and §105 of the California Water Code expressly state the people have a [...] "paramount interest in the use of all water", the State may control surface and underground water for public use or public protection, and that the State should develop water for [...] "the greatest public benefit". Because of these provisions, and the characteristic of water as a <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource,</b> California law requires state agencies to review and approve independent market transfers on behalf of the public. California’s Division of Water Rights keep record of water appropriation and use, and the SWRCB reviews and issues permits, adjudicates rights, investigates complaints, and approves temporary transfers (duration is no longer than 1 year) of post-1914 appropriative rights. Injury to other legal water users, unreasonable effects on fish and wildlife, and unreasonable effects on the overall economy in the country from which water is transferred are legally obligated items the SWRCB must consider when reviewing a transfer. Chapter 7 of the California Water Code defines water transfers, declares voluntary water transfers results in efficient use of water that alleviates water shortages, saves capital outlay development costs, and conserves water and energy, and explicitly requires government to assist in voluntary transfers. Chapter 10.5 of the California Water Code states provisions for the process of water transfers for temporary (§1725-1732) and long-term exchanges (over 1 year in duration) (§1735-1737). Long-term exchanges can be subject to review by the Department of Fish and Game as well.|$|E

The social dilemma that is considered, is the so called <b>Common</b> <b>Pool</b> <b>Resource</b> (CPR) game, in which individuals make investment decisions which have negative externalities. After each investment decision, subjects have two rounds in which they can reward each other. We find that adding two stages of rewarding promotes cooperation in the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> only marginally. The addition of two stages of rewards triggers beliefs about the evolution of the game. These beliefs are then reinforced by the rewarding behavior. Subjects use the investment stage as a way to seek group members which whom they will exchange reward tokens in both stage 2 and stage 3. The influence of stage 1 on stage 2 is significant and prevalent. However, the influence of stage 1 on stage 3 is much smaller. Stage 3 rewards are mainly influenced by stage 2 rewards. The addition of the second stage of rewarding is {{the driving force behind the}} evolution of the use of the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource.</b> It is this stage that ensures that subjects can exploit their bilateral relationships.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} and {{illustrates the}} potential of intelligent agent based modeling and simulation {{as a tool for}} understanding individual action and group performance in <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> dilemmas. Three groups of models were developed, based on previously documented <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experiments, and simulated using the Swarm multi-agent simulation environment. Agents in these models were designed to represent the actions of the individual appropriators in the experiments and the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> itself. The three groups of models are differentiated by the capabilities of the appropriator agents and address; preassigned fixed strategies with no communication, a simple induction based approach to selecting amongst alternative strategies with no communication, and the induction based approach with two simple communication routines. Simulations of these three groups of models rendered observations of some potential relationships between individual action and group performance in <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resource</b> experimental situations. In particular, simulations of agents employing the induction based approach with no-communication generated group level behavior with similar performance characteristics to groups in actual experiments.

Household survey data collected under the Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF) are used in the analysis.

Fishery products are most important for direct consumption, while forest products are more important for cash income. Across the study area, the households that most heavily extract and depend most on these resources are the relatively poorer households. The households that highly depend on forest products are distinct, however, from the households that highly depend on fish. The results indicate that these households’ livelihoods are vulnerable to changes in the quality of <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> <b>resources</b> or restriction in access to them due to implementation of the Lower Sesan 2 hydropower project.
