50|$|Hoplites {{carried a}} large concave shield called an aspis (often {{referred}} to as a hoplon), measuring roughly 1 metre in diameter and weighing about 16 pounds. This large shield was made possible partly by its shape, which allowed it to be supported on the shoulder. The hoplon shield was put together in three layers with the <b>center</b> <b>layer</b> made of thick wood, the outside layer facing the enemy made of bronze and leather made up the inside of the shield. The revolutionary part of the shield was, in fact, the grip. Known as an Argive grip, it placed the handle {{at the edge of the}} shield, and was supported by a leather fastening (for the forearm) at the centre. These two points of contact eliminated the possibility of the shield swaying to the side after being struck, and as a result soldiers rarely lost their shields. This allowed the hoplite soldier more mobility with the shield, as well as the ability to capitalize on its offensive capabilities and better support the phalanx. The large hoplon shields, designed for pushing ahead, were the most essential equipment for the hoplites.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first edition}} Manual of the Planes by Jeff Grubb {{describes}} Yggdrasil as an astral landmark, noting {{that it is}} normally encountered by travelers from worlds that worship the Norse mythoi, but travelers from other Prime Material worlds can encounter the tree. It is a long-standing conduit from the Outer Planes to alternate prime worlds that was created {{by a group of}} deities and worshippers in the Prime Material plane. Yggdrasil is the [...] "World Ash" [...] that links several outer planes to the Prime Material plane, in the Norse mythos. It runs from Gladsheim, home of most of the Norse mythos, to Nifflheim, the <b>center</b> <b>layer</b> of the three Glooms of Hades and the dwelling place of the goddess of the same name. Roots and branches of Yggdrasil wind through most of the Prime worlds where these deities are recognized. The tree is a solid and permanent conduit that weathers the waxing and waning of faiths in the Prime Material and the fortunes of gods in the outer planes. The traveler is confronted with a huge tree rising from the mist of the Astral and disappearing far into the distance. The traveler can then climb the tree to the appropriate outer plane, descend to the reachable lower planes, or explore the alternate Prime worlds that the conduits touch upon. At the true terminus, the tree ends in a color pool similar to that of a fixed portal. The traveler can then pass into the outer plane as if moving into an alternate Prime Material or the Astral plane. Yggdrasil and Mount Olympus are the best-known of the permanent conduits that link the outer planes with the Prime and with other nonlinear outer planes. Magical interplanar portals generally only appear in the top layer of the outer planes, although some free-standing portals that pass through the Astral, like the Yggdrasil, pierce the lower reaches of some planes. The Norse gods are bound together, both by the permanent portal of Yggdrasil and by the highly dangerous nature of the plane of Gladsheim itself. The realm of Asgard is a conglomeration of many smaller realms and domains of the various gods near the permanent multiplanar portal that is Yggdrasil, the World Ash. The plane of Gladsheim is the topmost point of Yggdrasil. The roots of this mighty tree lie in the second layer of the plane of Hades, and its branches touch every alternate Prime Material world where the Norse pantheon has been or is being worshipped. The World Ash is the home of many giant stags who browse upon its leaves, and it also contains numerous nests of giant eagles. A giant squirrel named Ratatosk scales the tree continuously, conveying threats to the eagle and others from the dragons of Niflheim. The apertures that the Yggdrasil causes in the Prime worlds are fixed and limited to those places where the Norse gods are known. Yggdrasil reaches the lower layers of the plane of Hades. Niflheim is the second layer of Hades, the layer reached by the Yggdrasil in its course from Gladsheim. The main barrier between the layer of Oinos and Niflheim leads to the roots of the Yggdrasil, in full view of Hel's feast hall. The Yggdrasil (and the main barrier region from Oinos) decamps {{at the base of a}} low hill. At the base of the Yggdrasil is Nidhogg, a huge, very ancient red dragon, and that dragon's innumerable brood. Nidhogg's task is to gnaw at the roots of the World Ash and eventually cut the link from Niflheim to Asgard, but the ash sets down new roots even as Nidhogg consumes them. The Norns are said to have their well of souls at the very edge of the center of the plane of Concordant Opposition. They identify this area as an unattainable part of the Yggdrasil, though the behavior of this area is unlike that of any other part of the World Ash conduit.|$|E

Three-layered coextruded PET films were produced in which the <b>center</b> <b>layer</b> contained model solutes/contaminants and the outer layers were made with virgin material.

They have overtaken tasks which are too difficult or dangerous to perform or require the repetition of the same procedure {{over and over again}} and can become dull for a human to perform. The objective of this thesis is to develop and implement a multilayered fuzzy controller on an FPGA for the navigational control of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR). The navigational algorithm assists the robot in navigating through complex environments of passages and hallways. The FPGA implementation of the navigational algorithm employs a layered fuzzy control strategy where a control model is developed using three elementary <b>layers</b> of control: <b>Centering</b> <b>Layer,</b> Wall Hugging Layer, and Obstacle Avoidance <b>Layer.</b> The <b>centering</b> <b>layer</b> is used to control the robot motion through a passage with both walls within the range of robot side sensors. In such a scenario, this layer directs the robot {{to the center of the}} passage. If the side sensors for the robot detect wall only on one side, wall hugging layer is activated and the robot moves parallel to the side wall. These two layers are developed using a proportional-plus-derivative fuzzy controller and share the fuzzy sets and the rule base. The obstacle avoidance layer prevents the collision of the robot with objects and is activated if the front sensor detects an obstacle within a preset distance...|$|R

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{air injection}} lowered the modulus of rupture. To increase it, boards were pre-pressed {{prior to the}} air-injection pressing. Air injection lowers the temperature at the board surface {{at the start of}} pressing [4], which would likely inhibit the binder from curing at the surface layer from which the air is injected (injection side). Air injection is also highly likely to cause the discharge of the binder from the injection side [5], reducing the bonding strength. As a result, the modulus of rupture also reduced, because the modulus of rupture depends on the strength at the surface layer [12]. To prevent these reductions, the boards were pre-pressed. Because pre-pressing does not involve air injection, the injection side is thoroughly heated from the start of pressing, and thus the binder cures sufficiently. Pre-pressing does not cause discharge of the binder from the injection side either, and thus the binder remains and bonds the particles in the injection side. Due to these two reasons, pre-pressing was predicted to increase the modulus of rupture. After the pre-pressing process, air was injected to force out vapor, cure the binder in the <b>center</b> <b>layer,</b> and increase the strength in the <b>center</b> <b>layer.</b> For comparison, post-pressing was also tested.|$|E
