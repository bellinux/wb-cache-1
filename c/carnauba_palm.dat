Most houses have tile-covered roofs and the walls built with plaster-covered bricks (57 %), followed by bricks without plaster (33 %), and mud walls (7. 5 %). A total of 3082 triatomines were captured from different locations, according to the following capture plan: (a) intradomiciles: 238 Triatoma brasiliensis, 6 T. pseudomaculata, 9 Rhodnius nasutus, and 2 Panstrongylus lutzi; (b) peridomiciles (annexes) : 2069 T. brasiliensis, 223 T. pseudomaculata, 121 R. nasutus, and 1 P. lutzi; (c) wild, in <b>carnauba</b> <b>palms</b> (Copernicia prunifera) : 413 R. nasutus.

40|$|World {{chemical}} and energy supplies for industry are today {{highly dependent on}} unsustainable fossil reserves. Vegetable lipids with similar chemical structures to fossil oil could be the ultimate renewable solution to replace fossil oil and provide environmentally friendly feedstocks and energy resources. Wax esters and triacylglycerols (TAG) are two groups of lipid with applications in industry as lubricants, surfactants and biodiesel. However, global production of wax esters and TAG {{is limited to a}} few crop species such as jojoba, <b>carnauba,</b> oil <b>palm,</b> soybean and rapeseed. Further, there are restrictions on arable land for oilseed crop growth, and the demand for vegetable lipids is predicted to increase in coming decades. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies and develop new alternative oil crop species to meet an expected future vegetable lipid demand. This thesis examined the potential for production of wax esters and TAG with different qualities in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves, and in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm by metabolic engineering. In tobacco leaves, a new metabolic pathway was introduced into chloroplasts by combining bacterial- and plant-derived genes (AtFAR 6, AtPES 2, MaFAR, MhWS, tpMaFAR::MhWS, AtWRI 1) for wax ester biosynthesis. Combinations of the gene functions resulted in production of wax esters with differing composition to a level of 0. 9...|$|R
40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the occurrence and genetic structure of Rhodnius nasutus sampled in two sites using morphometry and microsatellites. These sites, presented distinct abiotic features and palm trees: (i) nine Attalea speciosa palm trees, so called babacu, were sampled from the Meruoca Mountain Ridge, a sloping region of reminiscent {{forest in the}} state of Ceara´, Brazil, and (ii) 17 Copernicia pruniferapalm trees, so called carnauba, were sampled in the scrub savanna region (Sobral district) that surrounds the mountain ridge. Of the twenty-six palm trees dissected, 70. 6 % of carnauba and 88. 9 % of babac ¸ u were infested by R. nasutus. The micro-climatic data where R. nasutus were sheltered demonstrated that the babacu and carnau´ ba palm trees presented significant differences (p < 0. 05) in relation to the external environment, except for temperature and relative humidity regulation, suggesting that the architecture of the babac¸ u crown keeps a more stable micro-environment. The morphometric studies of the F 1 generation demonstrated that insects from the babacu(A. speciosa) were significantly larger (p = 0. 000) than those collected in <b>carnauba</b> (C. prunifera) <b>palm</b> trees. Also, microsatellite analysis demonstrated a high genetic differentiation between the two groups of R. nasutus (R st = 0. 77). Our results suggest that the difference in size between the populations is probably related to an incipient process of genetic drift in populations associated to each palm tree, probably also driven by the different climatic features observed in these micro-environments...|$|R

The crafts are made by women with age ranging from 20 to 60 years and low education. They live deprived of basic sanitation, schools and public health of quality. The perception about the plant is attributed to carnauba utilitarian features. In the three communities damage to plant involves estate speculation. The artisans of Fazendinha and Vazantinha did not express a conservationist conscience, prevailing capitalist perception. In the community of Pedra do Sal, the artisans promote an environmental conservation. They contact environmental agencies and protest against the devastation of carnauba forest.

In the river’s margins, presenting high variability in the extension of the riverbanks, arise floodplains in pedologic complexes mainly composed by neossols and argissols, resulting from the deposition of sediments. In these areas of high fertility soils and subjected to flooding during part of the year, it develops a particular type of riparian vegetation dominated by <b>carnauba</b> <b>palm</b> tree (Copernicia prunifera (Mill.)
