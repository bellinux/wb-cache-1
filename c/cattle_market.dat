5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} in 1852, under the {{provisions}} of which a new <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> should be constructed at Copenhagen Fields, Islington. The Metropolitan <b>Cattle</b> <b>Market</b> opened in 1855, leaving West Smithfield as waste ground for about ten years during {{the construction of the}} new market.|$|E
5|$|It {{became the}} market centre {{for the area}} and also drew traders from further afield to its four annual fairs (now reduced to two). Cattle drovers {{bringing}} cattle, horses and sheep from Northumbria and Scotland regularly came to the town. The original <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> was by the church, but sheep were sold on High Street until {{the early part of}} the 20th century. With the arrival of the railway the mart was built close to the station, but this later closed and today the <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> is held in Applegarth Court.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> and southwards on a new wider bridge across <b>Cattle</b> <b>Market</b> Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.|$|E

It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 before being closed as a dockyard in 1869, and is currently known as Convoys Wharf. From 1871 until the First World War it was the City of London Corporation's Foreign <b>Cattle</b> <b>Market.</b> In 1912 The Times reported that over 4 million head of live cattle, and sheep, had been landed.|$|E

A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting a <b>cattle</b> <b>market,</b> with seed companies, such as Hubbard and Phillips, and Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century. The arrival of the railway made the town favourable for malting.

5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported ice before final sale and consumption, where they were often termed depots. In London, the early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New <b>Cattle</b> <b>Market</b> depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was unusual and did not build ice depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the channel marketing types, margin and profit of beef <b>cattle</b> <b>marketing</b> agency from Bone Regency to Makassar. The population of the study covered all beef <b>cattle</b> <b>marketing</b> agencies of Bone Regency to Makassar. Determination of the samples was done by snowball sampling method. Data were collected through direct observation and interviews. Data were then analyzed descriptively. The results showed {{that there were two}} forms of beef <b>cattle</b> <b>marketing</b> channel from Bone District to Makassar, the first channel: farmers to traders and then to the inter-area merchant and next to the slaughterhouse businessman, the second channel: farmers to inter-regional traders and next businessmen to the slaughterhouse. The marketing agency that received the largest margin was the cattle traders on the second channel, followed by the inter area cattle traders in the first channel, and the lowest was for the collector. However, the marketing agency that got the most benefit was the collector traders, followed by the inter area traders of the second channel, and the lowest was for inter area traders of the channel I.

5|$|In {{the late}} Anglo-Saxon period, the {{internal}} street layout of Canterbury was remodelled, but {{the line of}} the outer walls remained the same. A <b>cattle</b> <b>market</b> was created outside the city to the south-east, and Newingate, later renamed St George's Gate, was inserted into the walls to allow easy access to it. During this the period the main axis of the city shifted from the older line of streets running from London Gate and Riding Gate, to the new route between West Gate and Newingate. A lane was built running around the inside of the walls, in a similar way to the intramural streets built around the same time at Exeter and Winchester. Churches and chapels were built over the gates, including St Mary's above the North Gate; the Holy Cross over West Gate; St Michael's over Bargate; St Edmund's within Riding Gate; and, potentially, St George's Chapel over Newingate. Canterbury's walls were mentioned by the early chronicler, Bede, in his history of England.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the arrests}} {{occurred}} on 16–17 October, both in Gospić and Karlobag. The civilians, especially Serbs, were led away at gunpoint from bomb shelters starting on 16 October. Two days later, residents of Gospić witnessed civilians being loaded aboard eleven military lorries at the town's <b>cattle</b> <b>market,</b> {{never to be}} seen again. At least ten civilians were killed at Žitnik in the Gospić area known as Pazarište on 17 October. The killings continued at Lipova Glavica near Perušić on 18 October, where 39 or 40 people were executed by firing squad after being held in the Perušić barracks, where a battalion of the 118th Infantry Brigade was based at the time. Three additional Serb civilians were arrested in Gospić and Karlobag on 25 October. They were also shot and their bodies retrieved in the Ravni Dabar area on 3 December.|$|E
5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign <b>Cattle</b> <b>Market,</b> in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E
