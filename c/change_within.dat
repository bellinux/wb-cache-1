5|$|Her {{reign of}} 63 years and seven months {{is known as}} the Victorian era and was longer than that of any of her predecessors. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and {{military}} <b>change</b> <b>within</b> the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.|$|E
5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the <b>change</b> <b>within</b> the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently {{employed}} {{intrusion detection}} sensor configurations rarely change. This represents a broad, static attack detection domain. <b>Changes</b> <b>within</b> a dynamic environment, due either to policy <b>changes,</b> or <b>changes</b> <b>within</b> the system’s condition, can make certain attacks {{more important than}} others. Static scopes will either result in flooding administrators with relatively less important attack reports, or result in the elusion of more important attacks. We present a model which can dynamically incorporate <b>changes</b> <b>within</b> policy and the environment, resulting in autonomic sensor reconfigurations that more accurately detects and reports important attacks within the system...|$|R
5|$|Illia was deposed {{by a new}} {{military}} coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution. Alfonsín was detained while trying to hold a political rally in La Plata, and a second time {{when he tried to}} re-open the UCRP committee. He was forced to resign as deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Serafín Feijó. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military dictatorship and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing dictatorship aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfonsín clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military dictatorship and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more; and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfonsín created the Movement for Renewal and <b>Change</b> <b>within</b> the UCR, to challenge Balbín's leadership of the party. The military dictatorship finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balbín defeated Alfonsín in the primary elections, but lost in the main ones. Alfonsín was elected deputy once more.|$|E
