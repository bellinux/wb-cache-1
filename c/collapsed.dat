40|$|Analogue {{experiments}} {{investigate how}} flank <b>collapse</b> affects dike propagation within volcanoes. Water (magma analogue) is injected within a gelatin cone (volcano analogue) with a lateral <b>collapse.</b> The injections form dikes that, {{away from the}} <b>collapse,</b> become radial. The dikes propagating nearby the <b>collapse</b> focus towards the <b>collapse</b> sides, becoming subparallel to them, because of the stress reorientation due to the unbuttressing. Only dikes formed along the <b>collapse</b> axis (passing through the mean points of the <b>collapse,</b> map view) propagate radially within the <b>collapse.</b> This general model is applied at Stromboli. The Stromboli dikes cluster along and parallel to the <b>collapse</b> sides, similar to the experiments. Nevertheless, the current location of the conduit, along the <b>collapse</b> axis, leads to dike propagation within the <b>collapse</b> infill, rather than at its sides. This may have occurred during the 2002 - 03 eruption, when diking in the <b>collapse</b> triggered a landslide and tsunami within the <b>collapse...</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{the first}} {{geological}} reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region {{was published in}} 1925, its author, University of Oregon professor E. T.

40|$|Mining {{explosions and}} <b>collapses,</b> in {{addition}} to earthquakes, may trigger the future Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) monitoring system. Most naturally occurring mine <b>collapses</b> have source mechanisms similar to a closing void which might provide a physical basis to discriminate them from explosions. In this study, an explosively induced mine <b>collapse</b> is investigated. The <b>collapse</b> occurred immediately after the support pillars of an underground mine opening were destroyed by explosives. We estimated the time-dependent source moment tensor of the <b>collapse</b> by inverting the surface ground motion data (< 1200 m). The {{results indicate that the}} source mechanism of the <b>collapse</b> can be represented by a horizontal crack. A unique source characteristic of the induced <b>collapse</b> is that, unlike natural <b>collapses,</b> the induced <b>collapse</b> initiated as a tensile crack. Because of the initial expansion source mechanism, induced mine <b>collapses</b> may pose some difficulties to the seismic discrimination problem. On the other hand, the <b>collapse</b> has a more band limited source spectrum than a typical underground explosion...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Structural <b>collapse</b> is {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} exceedance of a target value of inter-story drift or plastic hinge rotation at structural components. However, such an approach may not accurately estimate the structural <b>collapse</b> potential due to load redistribution and variation of structural damage within the structure. Moreover, <b>collapse</b> prediction may be sensitive to such assumed threshold values. Therefore, in this study, energy balance of a structural system is utilized to represent the severe structural damage history that eventually leads to structural <b>collapse.</b> Performing energy-based <b>collapse</b> analyses, a new dynamic-instability based <b>collapse</b> criterion is developed and key <b>collapse</b> measures are identified. Using the results, a new <b>collapse</b> fragility model is then established for estimating and improving structural reliability against <b>collapse.</b> Moreover, extensive parametric studies are performed to investigate sensitivity of <b>collapse</b> fragilities to variability in structural and earthquake parameters. 1...|$|R

40|$|During an {{explosive}} volcanic eruption, an eruption cloud forms a buoyant eruption column or a pyroclastic flow. We investigated the critical condition that separates these two eruption styles (column <b>collapse</b> condition) by performing {{a series of}} three-dimensional numerical simulations. We identified two types of column <b>collapse</b> in the simulations: <b>collapse</b> from a turbulent jet which efficiently entrains ambient air (jet-type <b>collapse)</b> and that from a fountain with {{a high concentration of}} ejected materials (fountain-type <b>collapse).</b> Which type of <b>collapse</b> occurs depends on whether the critical mass discharge rate for column <b>collapse</b> (MDRC) is larger or smaller than that for the generation of fountain (MDRF) for a given exit velocity. When the magma temperature is relatively low, MDRC is smaller than MDRF; therefore, the jet-type column <b>collapse</b> occurs at the transition between a buoyant eruption column and a column <b>collapse.</b> When the magma temperature is high, on the other hand, MDRC is larger than MDRF; the column <b>collapse</b> always occurs in the fountain-type regime...|$|R
