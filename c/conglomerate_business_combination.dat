To evaluate the disclosure level, a disclosure index of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> (INDCOMB) was prepared, having the disclosure index developed by Shalev (2009) as a basis. We evaluated, {{in the light of the}} literature on disclosure and <b>business</b> <b>combinations,</b> whether the following factors influenced on the disclosure level: acquiring company size, recognized percentage of overprice for expected future profitability in relation to the transaction value, dispersion of capital of the acquiring company, audit firm size, and participation of the acquiring company in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) programs. The control variables used were listing of the acquiring company in the various segments of BM&FBOVESPA, operation sector, origin (state, private company with national capital or private company with foreign capital), and relative acquired company size in relation to the acquiring company.
