She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current.

He has run away from his father, and trudged through the streets, alone, to rejoin his mother. The woman <b>clasped</b> <b>her</b> child in her arms and decides to live for him in the future. The mother takes her child to humble lodgings, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to her husband. There she tries to make a living for herself and him by sewing, but is unable to do so. She has given the last crust of bread to the little one, and is herself in a starving condition, when the baby boy himself comes to the rescue by starting out on a business career, selling papers in the street. In this way the wolf is kept from the door for a little while longer, and the little fellow, while applying his trade on the street corner, is met and recognized by his father. With his son as his guide, the repentant husband, who now realizes his unjust action, goes to his wife, and with the baby as a mediator, the two become reconciled." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{practices}} {{related to}} the placenta varied. [...] Some midwives believed the woman would pass the placenta faster if she blew with great force into her fist or <b>clasped</b> <b>her</b> hands together really tight (Encyclopedia). [...] Some women were encouraged {{to sit on a}} pot filled with hot water to pass the placenta faster. [...] Placentas were buried deep enough so that they could not be dug up by a human or an animal. [...] If the placenta were dug up, this would bring bad luck, illness, or death to the mother and child. [...] Sometimes the placenta were buried or disposed of in a stream of running water to prevent fever in the mother.|$|E
