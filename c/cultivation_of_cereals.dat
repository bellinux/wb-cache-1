25|$|Leonid Grinin {{argues that}} {{whatever}} plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always {{took place in}} special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> started somewhere in the Near East: {{in the hills of}} Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.|$|E

The area was once full of [...] "rendezvous teahouses", equivalent of the modern love hotel. After the Pacific War the pond was drained and used for the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> and subsequently there were plans to turn the site into a baseball stadium or multi-storey carpark.

2500|$|The {{climate in}} the far north of Europe made <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south was a luxury in {{northern}} Europe. [...] Wheat could cost {{at least twice as}} much as the most common grains, barley and rye. Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive beer production, while rye was the principal bread grain. Like in the rest of Europe, oats was considered only fit as animal fodder and was only eaten when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel. Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins. Kale, a form of cabbage, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.|$|E

30|$|The {{rates of}} erosion process are {{strongly}} governed by anthropogenic {{factors such as}} land use and management practices, land tenure, and institutional support systems (Mekuria 2005). Shrinkage of grassland and the resultant loss of available fodder for livestock have caused overgrazing and consequent conversion of grasslands into degraded lands (Gete and Hurni 2001). Expansions of farmlands {{at the expense of}} other land cover classes and traditional farming practices are encouraging erosion and loss of available nutrients. These include <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops such as teff (Eragrostis tef) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), which require the preparation of a finely tilled seedbed, the single cropping of fields, and drainage ditch to facilitate drainage in croplands during rainstorms (Badege 2001).|$|R
5000|$|Some suggest [...] that a lack {{of metal}} and fine pottery finds may be {{indicative}} that the Cornovii were not a particularly wealthy or sophisticated British tribe and that they depended mostly on a pastoral economy even though some <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crops appears to have occurred in the river valley areas. However, archaeological evidence from the lowland site at Poulton has shown extensive evidence of metal working and ceramics. In particular, a fine example of the ritual deposition of an iron adze in the ditch of a round house, suggests a significant disposable wealth. These aforesaid lowland areas seem to have been populated by rural peasants who were obliged to pay tribute in cattle and grain to the local chieftains resident in the hillforts.|$|R

40|$|In {{dependence}} of nitrogen fertilisation, nitrogen {{supply in the}} soil, weather conditions and growth <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> exist after yielding <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> different amounts <b>of</b> nitrogen. High nitrogen fertilisation in the spring is connected with nitrogen losses. Water content of soil diminished during vegetation under semiaride climate. With mathematical equations is possible to estimate water and nitrogen contents in the soil. They are the basis for decision for <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> crops after <b>cereal</b> for temporary fixing <b>of</b> nitrogen. <b>Cultivation</b> <b>of</b> crops after <b>cereals</b> is useful, when the amount of nitrogen in the soil is higher than 100 kg N/ha.

The pollen and non-pollennext term palynomorphs (NPP) record largely reflects intensive human influence (clearing, cultivation and grazing) on the surrounding area from the Late Bronze Age and Hallstatt period. La Tène period is marked by drier conditions and {{a substantial increase in}} Alnus. During the Gallo-Roman period, high values of Alnus decrease to the benefit of Quercus. In the Early Middle Ages (5 th– 10 th C), the swamp becomes a temporary pond and Cerealia type and Secale are cultivated in this very open landscape. During the Late Middle Ages (13 th– 15 th C), the temporary pond is transformed into a larger and deeper pond, used by the Cistercians for hydraulic power and perhaps as a hemp-retting pit.
