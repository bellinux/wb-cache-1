40|$|The reformulated {{model of}} learned {{helplessness}} {{suggests that the}} tendency to explain the causation for bad events as due to internal, stable, and global causes can lead to increased levels of depression and, in the work setting, lowered levels of productivity. A Life Event Analysis Form (LEAF) was developed depicting 12 hypothetical bad events which might be experienced by adult life insurance agents. In two pilot studies using college students, the LEAF scores correlated positively with selected bad events from the original ASQ but did not correlate with depression or self-esteem. In the agent study, LEAF scores failed to correlate with productivity measures across participating companies. However, LEAF scores did correlate with new life <b>commissions</b> <b>earned</b> for Company 1 when the companies were analyzed individually. For this company, LEAF subscale analysis indicated significant correlations between stability and globality but not for internality. Also, agents scoring in {{the top half of}} composite LEAF scores, indicating attributional styles which were more external/unstable/specific, received 59 % greater commissions than those in the bottom half. Career Profile (CP) scores, a commonly used measure by life insurance companies, also failed to correlate with production across companies but did correlate with new life commissions and new lives written for one company. Thus, while LEAF and CP scores may have some usefulness in predicting productivity among life insurance agents, their results were not found to be consistent for all participating companies. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to generate a theory to predict the success levels of assurance sales representatives. A sample of 245 participants from a life insurance company in South Africa was selected to participate in the study. The sample consisted of 213 males and 32 females; of these, 159 were European, 78 African and 8 Asian; the average age was 40. 37 years. The Schepers Locus of Control Inventory (Schepers, 1995), the Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation Scale (EAOS) (Robinson, Stimpson, Huefner&Hunt, 1991) and a biographical questionnaire were administered to the participants. Factor analysis was conducted to test the psychometric quality of the locus of control and the attitude scale. Hypotheses were tested for the variables with two performance outcomes: <b>commissions</b> <b>earned</b> and lapse ratios. Using the information obtained from the analyses, a model was built of the significant relationships between the performance criteria and the independent variables. Results indicated that neither the EAOS nor the Locus of Control Inventory scales predicted performance outcomes as hypothesized for sales professionals. The significant correlations that did result were generally counter to expectations. Demographic variables had limited success in predicting performance outcomes of sales professionals. The nature of the employment contract (full or part-time w/NEK, F = 5. 61; p< 0. 05), population groups (White South Africans vs. African South Africans w/NEK, F = 5. 22; p< 0. 05), job status (Manager vs. Sales Representative wNEK, F = 3. 51; p< 0. 05), years in sales (w/NEK, r = • 0. 14345; p< 0. 05), and desired salary (w/NEK, r = 0. 19571; p< 0. 05) were correlated with the performance outcome measures. Cultural and management implications are discussed with regard to the use of psychometric measures for selection. Research implications also are discussed.
