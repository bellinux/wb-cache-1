50|$|The {{conditions}} in the atmospheres of late-type stars support the pumping of different maser species at different distances from the star. Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release. These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward. Hydroxyl masers occur {{at a distance of}} about 1000 to 10000 astronomical units (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and silicon monoxide masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU. Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the silicon monoxide masers. These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous silicon monoxide condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules. For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation. At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion. At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished. Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are supported <b>chemical</b> <b>pumping.</b> At the distances where these masers are found water molecules are disassociated by UV radiation.|$|E

Assuming a similar bulk composition, the extremity of a sharp metallic tip can mimic one of these catalytic particles. Field ion microscopy (FIM) is used to characterize these surfaces at the atomic scale at cryogenic temperatures and subsequently to image catalytic surface reactions at temperatures where they usually occur. As an example, interactions of CO and H 2 O gases over gold tips have been followed by FIM. Chemical waves are observed at room temperature without indication of surface-sensitivity. The combination of FIM with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the atom probe, allows a local chemical determination of the surface during the ongoing phenomenon and reveals here drastic changes in the surface composition {{before and after the}} travelling of the waves on the probed area.

We used radiative transfer models to analyze the observed CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs). The FTS CO data were complemented with ground-based observations of the low-J CO lines. We found that the warm molecular gas traced by the mid-J CO transitions has similar physical conditions (n_H 2 ~ 10 ^ 3. 2 - 10 ^ 3. 9 cm^- 3 and T_kin ~ 300 - 800 K) in most of our galaxies. Furthermore, we found that this warm gas is likely producing the mid-IR rotational H 2 emission. We could not determine the specific heating mechanism of the warm gas, however it is possibly related to the star-formation activity in these galaxies. Our modeling of the [CI] emission suggests that it is produced in cold (T_kin 10 ^ 3 cm^- 3) molecular gas. Transitions of other molecules are often detected in our SPIRE/FTS spectra.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{detection}} of a Galactic source of OH+ line emission: the Orion Bar, a bright nearby photon-dominated region. Line emission is detected over ~ 1 ' (0. 12 pc), tracing the Bar itself {{as well as}} the Southern tip of the Orion Ridge. The line width of ~ 4 km/s suggests an origin of the OH+ emission close to the PDR surface, at a depth of A_V ~ 0. 3 - 0. 5 into the cloud where most hydrogen is in atomic form. Steady-state collisional and radiative excitation models require unrealistically high OH+ column densities to match the observed line intensity, indicating that the formation of OH+ in the Bar is rapid enough to influence its excitation. Our best-fit OH+ column density of ~ 1 x 10 ^ 14 cm^- 2 is similar to that in previous absorption line studies, while our limits on the ratios of OH+/H 2 O+ (>~ 40) and OH+/H 3 O+ (>~ 15) are higher than seen before. The column density of OH+ is consistent with estimates from a thermo-chemical model for parameters applicable to the Orion Bar, given the current uncertainties in the local gas pressure and the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation field. The unusually high OH+/H 2 O+ and OH+/H 3 O+ ratios are probably due to the high UV radiation field and electron density in this object. In the Bar, photodissociation and electron recombination are more effective destroyers of OH+ than the reaction with H 2, which limits the production of H 2 O+.

40|$|Aims. Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric {{molecular}} lines may {{originate from}} nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, or far infrared, near-infrared, and optical fluorescences. As a template, we investigate {{the impact of}} each of these processes on the excitation of the methylidyne cation CH+ and on the intensities of its rotational transitions recently detected in emission in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) and in planetary nebulae. Methods. We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i. e. taking into account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic states by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical cross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H 2, He, and e-, and a Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the excited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+. To confirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we use to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules, namely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10 ^ 4 cm- 3, the excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative pumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the intensities of the radiation field at ∼ 0. 4, ∼ 4, and ∼ 300 are stronger than 10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 8, and 10 ^ 4 times those of the local interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the <b>chemical</b> <b>pumping</b> is the dominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic temperatures (∼ 1000 K). The far-infrared emission lines of CH+ observed in the Orion Bar and the NGC 7027 PDRs are consistent with the predictions of our excitation model assuming an incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field of ∼ 3 × 10 ^ 4 (in Draine's unit) and densities of ∼ 5 × 10 ^ 4 and ∼ 2 × 10 ^ 5 cm- 3. In the case of NGC 7027, the estimate of the density is 10 to 100 times lower than those deduced by traditional excitation codes. Applying our model to other X 1 Σ+ ground state diatomic molecules, we find that HF, and SiO and HCl are the species the most sensitive to the radiative pumping of their vibrational and bound electronic states. In both cases, the minimal near-infrared and optical/UV radiation field intensities required to modify their rotational level populations are ∼ 10 ^ 3 times those of the local ISRF at densities nH = 10 ^ 4 cm- 3. All these results point towards interstellar and circumstellar media with densities lower than previously established and cast doubts on the clumpiness of well-studied molecular clouds...|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{reactive}} HnO+ ions (OH+, H 2 O+ and H 3 O+) are {{widespread in}} the interstellar medium and act as precursors to the H 2 O molecule. While HnO+ absorption is seen on many Galactic lines of sight, active galactic nuclei often show the lines in emission. Aims. This paper shows the first example of a Galactic source of HnO+ line emission: the Orion Bar, a bright nearby photon-dominated region (PDR). Methods. We present line profiles and maps of OH+ line emission toward the Orion Bar, and upper limits to H 2 O+ and H 3 O+ lines. We analyze these HIFI data with non-LTE radiative transfer and PDR chemical models, using newly calculated inelastic collision data for the e-OH+ system. Results. Line emission is detected over ∼ 1 ′ (0. 12 pc), tracing the Bar itself {{as well as a}} perpendicular feature identified as the Southern tip of the Orion Ridge, which borders the Orion Nebula on its Western side. The line width of ≈ 4 kms− 1 suggests an origin of the OH+ emission close to the PDR surface, at a depth of AV ∼ 0. 3 – 0. 5 into the cloud where most hydrogen is in atomic form. Models with collisional and radiative excitation of OH+ require unrealistically high column densities to match the observed line intensity, indicating that the formation of OH+ in the Bar is rapid enough to influence its excitation. Our best-fit OH+ column density of ∼ 1. 0 × 1014 cm− 2 is similar to that in previous absorption line studies, while our limits on the ratios of OH+/H 2 O+ (> ∼ 40) and OH+/H 3 O+ (> ∼ 15) are somewhat higher than seen before. Conclusions. The column density of OH+ is consistent with estimates from a thermo-chemical model for parameters applicable to the Orion Bar, given the current uncertainties in the local gas pressure and the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation field.
