The treatments under study included : i) check (no fertilizer N applied), ii) standard approach (preplant and sidedress), iii) feedback approach (based upon soil and plant factors), and iv) 2 X feedback approach. The studies {{were carried out}} at two locations Maricopa (MAC) and Marana (MAR). MAC is a low elevation location with a coarser textured soil compared to the MAR location. 'DPL- 20 ' was the variety used in both locations, except for the early years at MAC where 'DPL- 90 ' was used. The sources of fertilizer N were urea and ammonium sulphate, which were sidedress and split applied. In general, for the MAC location the final N fertilizer rates (NFR) applied were higher than for MAR due to higher yield potentials. The total N uptake increased as the NFR increased. The N use efficiency (NUE) values were reduced as NFR increased. The N fertilizer uptake (NFU) showed a decreasing pattern in the first years, and then an increasing trend; which was coupled with rather high amounts of N taken up in the <b>check</b> <b>plot</b> (soil N mineralized).

Two villages in Pho Yen district, Bac Thai province; one in Thanh Hoa district, Vinh Phu province; and one in Luong Son district of Hoa Binh province were selected as pilot sites for implementing the FPR methodology. In 1994 : By using RRA and PRA methods in conducting diagnostic surveys, some main limiting factors in cassava production were identified, such as lack of suitable planting methods for soil erosion control and lack of knowledge about balanced fertilizer application and about high yielding varieties. Therefore, demonstration plot with 17 treatments on different ways to improve soil fertility and methods to control soil erosion, were established at the Agro-forestry College in Thai Ngyen, Bac Thai. Farmers' field days were held to show the demonstration plots to farmers and extensionists from two of the selected districts in mid Nov, 1994. Based on the results and discussion, seven treatments were identified by farmers as promising treatments for 1995. Farmers also discussed how to arrange these in simple FPR trials in their own fields. In 1995 : Twenty five farmers of two villages in Pho Yen and ten farmers in Thanh Hoa districts participated in the project by conducting research on their own fields. At time of harvest, a farmers field day was held in both districts in mid Nov, 1995. Fanners and researchers joined in the harvest and in the discussion of the results. Some best treatments were identified. The treatments of cassava intercropped with peanut and contour hedgerows of vetiver grass, combined with balanced NPK application, was considered as the most promising practice at both pilot sites, as soil erosion losses were reduced by 20 - 40 % compared to the <b>check</b> <b>plot</b> of cassava grown in monoculture and without hedgerows.
