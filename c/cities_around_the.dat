5|$|After subduing the <b>cities</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections.

All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
