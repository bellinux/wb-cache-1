25|$|Aloys Senefelder, the {{inventor}} of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography), where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished {{to be able to}} print someday. Although Senefelder recorded plans for <b>chromolithography,</b> printers in other countries, such as France and England, were also trying to find a new way to print in color. Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse in France was awarded a patent on <b>chromolithography</b> in July 1837, but there are disputes over whether <b>chromolithography</b> was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of playing cards.|$|E
25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated enough to do justice to the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of <b>chromolithography.</b> He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ <b>chromolithography,</b> and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Vicenza. After {{studying}} in a lyceum, he enrolled at the Accademia of Venice {{and then went to}} Milan, where he studied at the Brera Academy. After his first works he was invited to travel outside of Italy, and went first to Paris, then London for a number of years, painting mainly portraits, including M. C. Hamilton, Sir Blake, Sir M. Drake, and of the Emperors of the Indies by commission by M. Lourissen. He also engraved designs for Minozzi for lithographies and <b>chromolithographies,</b> provided designs for various illustrated English journals. He also traveled to Boston, where he completed works for Suzie M Barstow.|$|R
25|$|Senefelder had experimented {{during the}} early 19th century with {{multicolor}} lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings. Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by Godefroy Engelmann (France) in 1837 known as <b>chromolithography.</b> A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge {{was to keep the}} images aligned (in register). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.|$|E
25|$|He rose to {{prominence}} with his studies of Islamic decoration at the Alhambra, {{and the associated}} publication of his drawings, which pioneered new standards in <b>chromolithography.</b> Jones was a pivotal figure {{in the formation of}} the South Kensington Museum (later to become the V) through his close association with Henry Cole, the museum's first director, and another key figure in 19th century design reform. Jones was also responsible for the interior decoration and layout of exhibits for the Great Exhibition building of 1851, and for its later incarnation at Sydenham. Jones advised on the foundation collections for the South Kensington museum, and formulated decorative arts principles which became teaching frameworks for the Government School of Design, then at Marlborough House. These design propositions also formed the basis for his seminal publication, The Grammar of Ornament, the global and historical design sourcebook for which Jones is perhaps best known today.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{her life}} Louisa Meredith lived on {{properties}} around Swansea. In 1860 she published Some of My Bush Friends in Tasmania which contained elaborate full-colour plates printed by the new <b>chromolithography</b> process. The illustrations were drawn by herself, and simple descriptions of characteristic native flowers were given. In 1861 an account of a visit to Victoria in 1856, Over the Straits, was published, and in 1880 Tasmanian Friends and Foes, Feathered, Furred and Finned. This went into a second edition in 1881. In 1891, Meredith went to London to supervise the publication of Last Series, Bush Friends in Tasmania. Published {{at the beginning of a}} severe financial depression in the Australian colonies, this project and the collapse of the bank where {{most of her}} savings were held ruined her financially. In her final years Meredith suffered from chronic sciatica and became blind in one eye. She died in Collingwood, Victoria (a suburb of Melbourne) on 21 October 1895 and was survived by sons Owen and George.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Day & Son was {{commissioned}} by Matthew Digby Wyatt, known for his work as an architect, to produce the book The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century, an imposing imperial folio in two volumes which illustrates a selection of items from the Great Exhibition of 1851. There are 160 chromolithographed plates. Wyatt himself stated that he had used 'the best means of graphic representation available'. Wyatt proudly {{drew attention to the}} previously unsurpassed scale and speed of production of the book. But what brought the entire project into being was the desire of Day & Son to demonstrate the potential of <b>chromolithography.</b> The firm was particularly associated with the process. However, as Wyatt himself explained, the proposal was not even formalized until after the Great Exhibition had opened. Such a grandiose production must have called into play a significant proportion of Day's resources, including skilled craftsmen and lithographers such as Francis Bedford, J.A. Vinter and Henry Rafter, as well as significant capital, and management. According to Wyatt, four or five of Day's staff were constantly engaged upon the business details of the operation alone.|$|E
500|$|The series' art was {{inspired}} by a variety of sources, including the 1890s McLoughlin Brothers board game Game of Frog Pond, illustrations by Gustave Doré for Cervantes's Don Quixote, old illustrations for the Hans Christian Andersen story [...] "The Tinderbox", the Cheshire Cat illustration by John Tenniel from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and the [...] "Dogville Comedies" [...] short films. McHale referenced <b>chromolithography,</b> vintage Halloween postcards, magic lantern slides, and photographs of New England foliage to create the show's style.|$|E
500|$|With the {{industrialization}} and urbanization of the United States {{in the early}} 19th century, the American middle class experienced an increase in leisure time. The home gradually lost its traditional role {{as the center of}} economic production and became the locus of leisure activities and education under the supervision of mothers. [...] As a result, the demand increased for children's board games emphasizing literacy and Christian principles, morals, and values. Advances in papermaking and printing technology during the era made the publication of inexpensive board games possible, and the technological invention of <b>chromolithography</b> made colorful board games a welcome addition to the parlor tabletop.|$|E
500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page. Produced by <b>chromolithography,</b> each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed brown leather made to imitate carved wood. A little earlier {{there had been a}} compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the [...] "ivy-mantled tower" [...] in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator leans on a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British Museum (see below).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Chromolithography</b> {{became the}} most {{successful}} of several methods of colour printing developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875. [...] <b>Chromolithography</b> developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color. The initial technique involved {{the use of multiple}} lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers. [...] However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. [...] Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a [...] "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} the merger, 1868, [...] Gibson Bowles began {{planning}} his new Vanity Fair magazine. His new brand of society weekly was to carry satirical caricatures of {{the men of the}} day lithographed by Vincent Brooks. At a time when Punch magazine was still primarily using wood blocks this ‘process of <b>chromolithography</b> and wedding it to a new kind of visual humour helped to bring about a revolution in taste, preparing the way for the acceptance of less strictly representational art forms and breaching the fortifications of academic realism.’ The first issue to carry a cartoon came out in January 1869 featuring a portrait of Benjamin Disraeli. Later the magazine would claim that, ...|$|E
2500|$|Printing Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra {{had been}} a {{significant}} financial strain for Jones, but the publication had gained Jones a huge profile due to its pioneering standards of <b>chromolithography.</b> After, and possibly during, the long gestation period for Alhambra, Jones used his printing press to enter the lucrative market for illustrated and illuminated gift books which were becoming increasingly popular with the Victorian middle class. Jones designed both secular and religious books (collaborating most notably with the publishers Day & Son and Longman & Co.) and developed innovative new binding techniques using materials such as embossed leather, papier-mâché and terracotta – all {{in an attempt to}} do justice to the luxurious contents, much of which could trace its aesthetic lineage back to sumptuous medieval illuminated manuscripts and religious bindings. [...] Apart from these books, Jones's most significant (and most widely consumed) printing output was through his long-standing relationship with the firm of De La Rue. From the mid-1840s until the end of his life, some 30 years later, Jones designed an astonishing variety of products for De La Rue including playing cards, menus, biscuit-tin wrappers, postage stamps, chessboards, endpapers, scrap albums and diaries.|$|E
