50|$|Those with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder continually practice rituals or routines {{in order to}} satisfy their intrusive worries and fears. Emily Colas describes several routines that she completes daily {{in order to ensure that}} she does not <b>contract</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b> Colas has a rather complex routine for taking out the garbage. She had her husband undergo an extensive procedure of taking out the trash to ensure that no germs entered her home. Colas also had a habit of double checking things. When putting on the dishwasher she would check several times to be certain that her cats were not inside the appliance. Eventually she started locking the cats in the bathroom when it was time to wash the dishes. Routines like Colas' are typical of OCD patients. These routines are meant to satisfy their worries and make the person feel better temporarily. Often the patients feel compelled to perform these rituals. A person's worries generally fit into three categories: overestimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty, and the over-importance of one's thoughts and the desire to control these thoughts. Common rituals or routines of OCD patients include excessive cleaning, checking locks, ordering or arranging items in a certain way, and saving or sometimes hoarding items. These routines are exhausting for the person to keep up with and they only satisfy their worries temporarily.|$|E

50|$|Just Checking: {{scenes from}} the life of an {{obsessive-compulsive}} was written by Emily Colas in the year 1998. Separated into four parts, Emily Colas provides snapshots of her daily life and the struggles that she faces {{as a result of her}} disorder: obsessive-compulsive disorder. The anecdotes of her life are written in a journal-like manner. The entries cover all aspects of her life from her cheating college boyfriend, to her family life and raising her two children, and to her interaction with friends. Throughout all of the excerpts Emily Cola’s frantic worries are evident, especially her constant fear of contracting diseases from the most common daily interactions with other humans. Colas’ most evident worry is that she will instantaneously <b>contract</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> from the most minuscule sample of blood. When strangers, including the babysitter of her children, enter her home she becomes obsessed with every possible chance that they may infect her home. Therefore, Colas’ developed a system of checkpoints so she could determine whether or not the bathroom was used, a drawer opened, or anything touched. As the book proceeds the narrator begins to deal with her illness and she struggles to get better. Her marriage fell apart as a result of her disorder and she and her husband divorced. Eventually, after Colas’ married life disintegrated, she decided to take action and get help for her disorder. The narrative covers the stress that her condition placed on her family. A family member's negative response to the person's disorder can increase the OCD behavior. Colas started taking medication and made the conscious effort to stop obsessing over unimportant matters. The last section of entries demonstrates a healthier and more controlled person and the reader sees a change in the narrator.|$|E

Logistic regression is used to estimate mortality given malaria infection as a function of weight-for-age z scores. The clinical malaria morbidity and malaria mortality are analytically computed for a variety of policies involving supplementary food and insecticide-treated bed nets. Results: The portion of heterogeneity in susceptibility that is due to undernutrition is estimated to be 90. 3 %. Target...|$|E
40|$|Sharps injury among {{health care}} workers in HUKM has {{received}} serious attention lately due to the possible transmission of diseases like HIV, Hepatits B and Hepatitis C, which can cause serious consequences for the victim. The aim {{of the study was}} to gain a deeper understanding of the emotional problems experienced by {{health care workers}} who had incurred a sharps injury and the coping strategies adopted by them to overcome the problem. A 28 item semi-structured questionnaire was designed by the supervisors and the researcher as there was no existing questionnaire to be adopted, as no research had been carried out in this area prior to this. The target group consisted of 64 health care workers of different categories working in HUKM. Data was collected over a period of five months from November 2000 to March 2001. The results of the study revealed that the most frequently injured were the staff nurses, nearly 90 % of whom were emotionally upset and were worried that they might <b>contract</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b> There was no significant difference in the emotional stress experienced by the different categories of the health care workers, all were equally upset about the injury but each category of staff adopted different methods to overcome the tragedy.

Several views given by the participants were explored and discussed. Finally, several implications for nursing and recommendations have been presente...|$|E
40|$|It is a crisp {{morning in}} November of 2000, on the {{outskirts}} of the capital city. A man sits on the side of the road with a needle in his hand. Several individuals nearby make their home on the street. Some lay unconscious on the cold ground, some prepare to inject themselves with drugs, and still others wait for the droves of customers to pour into the area for their supply. It is an area characterized by rampant drug use, crime, and disease. Many of the people wandering these streets are infected with HIV, hepatitis, or tuberculosis. Rundown shacks and used needles evince the extreme poverty, social exclusion, and drug addiction that have become the norm here. Located on the fringe of Lisbon, Portugal, this place is called Casal Ventoso, and is notorious throughout Europe for being the continent 2 ̆ 7 s largest open-air drug market. Here, one could purchase illegal drugs as easily as one might draw a breath, and could <b>contract</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> with hardly more effort. The needle in the hand of the man on the street contains a dose of heroin, the predominant drug of use in the area. Looking around at this slum, one cannot help but wonder if the novel drug laws that take effect in July 2001 will provide any hope for this ravaged region. Nearly a decade later, across the Atlantic Ocean, a similar scene has developed. On a blistering summer day in the heart of a major tourist city, addicts search for their drug of choice. A man sits on the sidewalk and injects himself with a needle that may be filled with any of a number of substance - heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine have all become common among drug-using populations in this area. Just as in Casal Ventoso, poverty and disease have become prevalent. Illicit drugs can be readily purchased from what have become known as 2 ̆ 2 ice cream trucks. 2 ̆ 2 Roving the main streets of the town in broad daylight, these vehicles provide a constant supply of nearly any drug a customer could want. Yet there is more to the story here, in the northern Mexican town of Tijuana. Violence plagues the area and fear grips the citizens. Drug-trafficking organizations battle both each other and the government in their struggle to transport and sell drugs to their number one customer, the United States, and increasingly to domestic consumers. This phenomenon has spread to several areas throughout the country. Midday firefights have become a common phenomenon in many Mexican towns. Amid the addiction, disease, and violence, a shift in drug policy in 2009 seeks to eliminate the source of these ills for the citizens of these towns. In an effort to confront their escalating drug crises, both Portugal and Mexico determined that decriminalizing the possession of drugs would help to alleviate the problems in areas like Casal Ventoso and Tijuana. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized possession of all drugs for personal consumption and has since reported positive results in combating drug addiction, related health problems, and drug trafficking. Then, in 2009, Mexico became the most recent country to participate in this trend, occurring primarily in Latin America and Europe, to ease drug policies, when it passed a bill decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs. Although both Portugal and Mexico decided to explore drug decriminalization, as a result of their divergent drug legislation, the systems in each country are remarkably different. Thus far, Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s decriminalization scheme has not seen many, if any, of the positive effects witnessed in Portugal. Although it is too soon to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the outcomes of the decriminalization scheme in Mexico, this Note argues that Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s 2009 law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs will not be able to achieve the same positive results as the Portuguese law. By increasing penalties for small-scale dealers, only referring offenders to treatment after a third offense, and continuing to process offenders through the court system, the Mexican law focuses too much on criminal justice, at the expense of a more thorough public health approach. As a result, Mexican decriminalization fails to improve the ability of the government to address effectively drug use, drug-related disease, mortality, and the rights of the drug user. Though the current conflict in Mexico between law enforcement and drug-trafficking organizations creates a somewhat different landscape than the one in which Portugal enacted its decriminalization law, Mexico could nevertheless use Portugal 2 ̆ 7 s regime as a guide in developing a more public health-oriented approach to its drug problem. In doing so, Mexico would be able to enjoy reductions in many of the social ills that Portugal is currently experiencing...|$|E

40|$|Cue: Rearing {{livestock}} {{for meat}} and milk production, or for sale, is often recommended {{as a way}} for poor families to escape from poverty. This may be true, but profitable livestock production is not free of cost. In fact, if livestock are to be healthy and productive they need investment, investment of time, resources and money. Dominic Minyoi is a Chief Veterinary Officer working for the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. He recently spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of investment, and why the first priority for livestock farmers is to invest in the health of their new born animals, such as calves and lambs. Allowing a new born animal to feed on its mother?s milk is an extremely important first investment, as it helps to protect the animal against prevailing diseases. IN:		?Once a calf is born ? OUT:		?too late for anybody to intervene. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 16 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dominic Minyoi with advice for livestock keepers on the importance of investing in their animals. Transcript Minyoi	Once a calf is born it must be exposed to colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk that comes from the mother. Within 24 hours of birth that calf should be made to suckle with that one. It gives it all the protection because colostrum carries all the necessary antibodies to protect the calf against the prevailing diseases that are in that area. And also apart from that, most farmers you find they don?t really let the calf suckle. So from birth the calf should be let to suckle until they are satisfied, that?s when the farmers can get the milk. We do know that they rely on this milk as well but the calf needs it more for growth. And as the calf grows up they must at least organise the pasture, even from crop residues. They can put those in the kraal, whatever stover, maize stover that is left, whatever from the groundnuts and beans that can be fed to the animals during the dry season when the feed is inadequate. And it is important {{at this point in time}} that they must de-worm at least twice per year. This is before the rains and after the rains so that when the rains have come in and the grass is mushrooming, the calves have got access to grass; they can put on weight because they won?t have a worm burden. Vaccination is very very important in certain age groups. They can do that for anthrax, they can do that for all the other preventable diseases. Kakunta	Your emphasis has been on the calf. Are you saying when you look after a calf properly, you are guaranteeing that the future animals will be healthy? Minyoi	Definitely, once you start looking after a calf very well that calf will grow into a strong adult. And that strong adult can only be strong if it is also exposed to certain interventions like vaccinations, de-worming, good housing, provision of water, all those are things that should be made available to the animals. In the village set up they can even use troughs, these dug-out canoes; put water in there. The animals will have access to water whenever they feel like drinking water. Not where as of now, they graze somewhere else, they are taken for water somewhere else, and by the time they come back to the kraal they are really thirsty. So we should make these things available to the livestock for them to be able to live within the surroundings instead of venturing out where they might <b>contract</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> through mixing with other cattle. Kakunta	There are certain situations here in Zambia, Dr Minyoi, for instance in the southern part of the country, where we have East Coast Fever, commonly known as Corridor Disease. We are finding that the small-scale farmers? animals are dying, while in the same area the commercial farmers? animals are still healthy. What practical lessons have you learned from such a scenario? Minyoi	What it is, is that to prevent tick-borne diseases, one must dip the animals. And communal dip tanks are there, they exist, but these people are not co-operating, to be able to come together so that they can have their animals dipped. People should be able to invest a bit in livestock, so that they can buy the dip chemicals. And they can approach our officers, our officers can assist them in prescribing what kind of chemicals to buy. They should be doing that twice a month in the rainy season, and once every month in the dry season. Because if they dip regularly, then Corridor Disease will be something that they will hear about but not really their concern. Kakunta	But why do you think the farmers are so reluctant in terms of preventative measures? Does it mean there is a problem somewhere in terms of attitudes? Minyoi	I can attribute this partly to poor extension services. If the extension was good, farmers would have been taught how to look after animals, and then everybody would be taken on board. But what it is now, is that sometimes our extension is failing to reach the people. But where it is reaching some people don?t want to spend, they won?t invest in livestock. Livestock is a business just like any other business, they have to invest. And above all, they should attend to their regular requirements in as far as their health is concerned. Because these animals are just left to herdsmen, and when herdsmen come there is no request for a report. They should also keep their records so that these herdsmen are held accountable. Because what is happening, farmers don?t even know how the animals are, they are just told ?The animal is dead. ? And you can not run a business like that. They must be part and parcel of that livestock-rearing group. They must be able to monitor the animals and see how they are getting on, so that they can report on time. Reporting condition on time, or reporting a situation on time gets one better results than reporting late, because when you report late it may be too late for anybody to intervene. End of track. A Chief Veterinary Officer at the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture talks about the importance of preventative health care, and the value of investing in the health of young animal...|$|E
