5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{hot water}} recirculation system uses a dedicated return {{line from the}} point of use located farthest from the hot water tank back to the hot water tank. In homes where this return line was not installed the cold water line is used as a return line. The first of two system types has a pump mounted at the hot water heater while a [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic control valve gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater and closes once hot water contacts the valve to control crossover flow between the hot and cold lines. A second type of system uses a thermostatically controlled pump which gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater. These thermostatically controlled pumps often have a built-in [...] "normally closed" [...] check-valve which prevents water in the cold water line from entering into the hot water line. Compared to a dedicated return line, using the cold water line as a return has the disadvantage of heating the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (and the contained water). Accurate temperature monitoring and active flow control can minimize loss of cold water within the cold water line.|$|E

As with previous years, each task on the to-do list must {{be done in the}} order prescribed therein (roughly corresponding to the order in which they are introduced). Dan hits a snag on the first item (the soundproof headboard), but eventually finishes to work on getting the dug-in spacers out of his bathtub tiles. Matt chews through the first three items easily, though his towel rack returns to frustrate him. He soon completes it to work on grouting his tiles. Rob has time to assist Charlene in her tub drains, though her tub's water intakes still leak. Ajay is doing his tasks out of order (grouting before his <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> are installed), which isn't helping him go any faster; most of his time is focused on the tub's plumbing. By the time Ajay's tub is complete, Matt's entire room is complete, and only decorations remain. Rob's room and Dan's room both finish soon after, while Charlene and Ajay end up cutting corners to meet the deadline.|$|R
60|$|In Boston {{the houses}} are very spacious and excellent, and they are always {{furnished}} with those luxuries which {{it is so difficult}} to introduce into an old house. They have hot and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> into every room, and baths attached to the bedchambers. It is not only that comfort is increased by such arrangements, but that much labor is saved. In an old English house it will occupy a servant {{the best part of the}} day to carry water up and down for a large family. Everything also is spacious, commodious, and well lighted. I certainly think that in house-building the Americans have gone beyond us, for even our new houses are not commodious as are theirs. One practice which they have in their cities would hardly suit our limited London spaces. When the body of the house is built, they throw out the dining-room behind. It stands alone, as it were, with no other chamber above it, and removed from the rest of the house. It is consequently behind the double drawing-rooms which form the ground floor, and is approached from them and also from the back of the hall. The second entrance to the dining-room is thus near the top of the kitchen stairs, which no doubt is its proper position. The whole of the upper part of the house is thus kept for the private uses of the family. To me this plan of building recommended itself as being very commodious.|$|R
50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: Plumbing - The contestants must {{install the}} running water into their tubs by tapping into an {{existing}} plumbing line. After an extensive lesson by Geoff {{on how to}} install the shutoff valve. Ajay can't get his solder to stick due to holding the torch too far away and due to the water, so he inexplicably sprays the joint with more water. The other contestants also have similar problems, but Rob quickly addresses it by plugging the pipe with bread, having learned the trick from Geoff in the previous group challenge. However, Dan, who was also taught this trick by Geoff the previous day, doesn't pick up as quickly, but everyone eventually pick up on this trick. Ajay fails as he nearly burns himself with the torch after nearly dropping it. Rob's plumbing works and he passes, but he builds his pipes above the level of his tub deck. Matt's <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> works fine, but he twists and ultimately destroys his hot water pipe {{in the process of}} unclogging bread from his pipe for a water test, so he fails, though the rest of his plumbing is noted to be fine. Dan fails as his pipes leak (though it is a minor issue, as Andrew notes). Charlene, having installed a T pointing down toward the floor at a 45 degree angle, ends up slicing off the whole pipe in her efforts to fix it, and so is forced to restart from the beginning well after everyone else is finished.|$|E

The difference in temperature between a hot and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> is utilized via a thermo-electric generator {{to feed a}} DC/DC converter. A sufficiently large voltage can be gained even for moderate temperature differen-ces to power a DC/DC converter capable of stepping-up from low feed voltages {{in the range of}} a few millivolts. We could show that even the rather small temperature difference between ambient and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> temperatures is sufficient. An electronic circuit design is able to convert these voltages in the lower mV-range to necessary levels directly usable for low-power microprocessors and other elec-tronic components. In particular these thermo-electric converters are used successfully for sanitary electronics even allowing to bridge typical idle times by lithium-ion cells. To achieve optimal energy utilization a theoretical model was devised that includes the thermo-electric converter the thermal capacity of the pipes and all thermal resistances involved. The modeling of the thermal section was done using the differential equations solver SPICE in order to allow calculatory efficiency and coupling with electrical loads or step-up converters.

The main area of research conducted on the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> material was determining the effect of enhancement of HDPE with Alphaflex on hoop strength of the pipe. The effects realized were then analyzed for physical and economic viability for various ocean thermal energy conversion and seawater district cooling scenarios. All physical properties of the Alphaflex enhanced material tested exhibited favorable results when compared to HDPE. The comparison of the two materials is as follows.

Scenarios that require long pipes or supply small loads without room for expansion do not offer as great an advantage and in some cases are not able to meet economic expectations under the current production costs of Alphaflex.

The purpose of this essay is to get a view of how problematic moisture damagecurrently is as well as {{what can be done to}} prevent damage during the constructionand building of new housing. Statistics regarding moisture damage as well as several tools for damage preventionhave been studied and investigated. Industrial regulations have been reviewed tounderstand the requirements construction companies must legally follow during theconstruction and building of new kitchens. Home manufacturers and largerentrepreneurs have been contacted in order to get their point of view regarding theproblems with moisture damages in kitchens. The knowledge of moisture safe constructions is prevalent by home manufacturers,insurance companies and entrepreneurs. Despite this knowledge, the constructioncompanies predominately follow the industries regulations, which normally onlyimplement the minimum requirements. In order to get construction companies to design and build kitchens with increasedmoisture security, stricter industrial regulations might be needed to be implemented. Unlike bathrooms and laundry rooms, kitchens are not defined as a ”wet room” andthe regulations for the construction of kitchens are more lenient. It is difficult to detect water leaks in an early state and the moisture damage is usuallyextensive before it is discovered and repaired if the kitchen lacks moisture securedconstruction and water security. The most common cause of moisture damage is dueto pipe failure and, most likely in the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> where corrosion is the biggestproblem...|$|R

The report identifies five possible <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (CWP) approaches that are dependent on the geologic formation and hydrology of the site. For this survey, the site under consideration is Keahole Point on the west coast of the big island of Hawaii. The site was chosen because of the easy access to deep cold water provided by the steep offshore slope, the proximity to air and sea transportation, and the availability of land. The survey concludes that although many site-specific factors must be considered, tunneling or drilling is in general a viable option for meeting the long-term OTEC cost goals.

40|$|As {{climate change}} seems {{to become more}} and more of a serious issue, a sudden surge of {{interest}} in clean and renewable energy sources is inevitable. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), or the process of harnessing energy from the temperature difference between the warm upper ocean layer and the cold bottom ocean layer, is one of these renewable energy production methods. In order to pump up this cold water, a large diameter pipe of a length in the order of 1000 m is deployed. A pipe of such large properties will indubitably suffer from problems related to production, installation and drag forces. Up till now these problems have all largely been evaluated. One phenomenon that has been explored less frequently is VIV in OTEC, and this is therefore the main scope of this research. Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are the vibrations that occur when a current flows past a cylinder, shedding vortices at higher Reynolds numbers, leading to an asymmetrical pressure distribution. For this research, the pipe is modelled as a slender Euler-Bernoulli beam conveying fluid, with gravity and ambient flow considered. The model is discretised and rewritten into state-space representation, {{in order to make it}} suitable for Python’s odeint ordinary differential equation-solver. A wake oscillator model is introduced to model the VIV phenomenon, and the complete model is used to evaluate multiple scenarios to evaluate the influence of variables as pipe diameter, ballast mass and current velocity. A typical <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> is made of a light material as for example HDPE, has a length in the order of 1000 m and a diameter of around 2. 5 m, kept under tension by a ballast mass in the order of magnitude of 350 tonnes. For this research, this typical <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> is taken as a starting point and subjected to a uniform current flow of 0. 4 m/s. The VIV response of the pipe is then evaluated with a range of different variables. First, the pipe is evaluated in steel, FRP and HDPE to establish which material is most suitable. HDPE shows the best fatigue resistance, and is therefore chosen as the material in which the further research will be conducted. The pipe diameter is varied between 2. 0 and 6. 0 m, the diameter to wall thickness ratio between 12 and 26, the effect of the magnitude of the ballast mass is evaluated and the inflow velocity is changed between 1. 0 and 6. 0 m/s. Finally, the current flow is varied between a uniform current of 0. 1 m/s and 0. 8 m/s and a location specific sheared current profile is applied, in order to check whether VIV in the OTEC <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> might occur in a realistic setting. Depending on the chosen variables, in general the pipe will experience a maximum cross-flow displacement per diameter ranging between 0. 6 and 1. 0. Furthermore, for each set of variables the pipe will vibrate in a different normal mode, which might lead to the fact that a pipe with less maximum displacement will still experience more fatigue damage. Pipes in larger diameters will definitely suffer from a higher fatigue, however the maximum experienced damage per year was in the order of 10 - 15, meaning that this is insignificant. The wall thickness will not have a lot of effect. The ballast mass however, can better be chosen high since it prevents vibrations at a high mode and it seems that HDPE is strong enough in terms of yield strength to survive a large mass. Finally, when the pipe is subdued to high currents, it seems as if in-line displacement will become a larger problem then VIV, as the in-line bending reaches dangerously high levels when subjected to a current of 0. 8 m/s. It has to be noted however that certain measures can be taken against this displacement. It is very likely that VIV occurs in a <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> of an OTEC plant as it is subjected to certain current flows, but in the case HDPE is used, this does not seem a large concern.

40|$|Internal waves {{near the}} ocean surface have been {{observed}} {{in many parts of}} the world including the Andaman Sea, Sulu Sea and South China Sea. The factors that cause and propagate these large-amplitude waves include bathymetry, density stratification and ocean currents. Although their effects on floating drilling platforms and their riser systems have not been extensively studied, in the past these waves have seriously disrupted offshore exploration and drilling operations. In particular, a drill pipe was ripped from the Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) and lost during drilling operations in the Andaman Sea. Drilling riser damages were also reported from the South China Sea and other places. The motivations of this study were to find a valid numerical model conforming to the physics of internal waves and to study the effects on offshore drilling semisubmersibles, different types of offshore hull forms and riser systems, including the large diameter <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> of floating Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems.

40|$|Ocean {{thermal energy}} {{conversion}} (OTEC), {{the concept of}} extracting energy from the ocean by utilizing the temperature differential between the surface and deep oceanic waters, was first proposed by the nineteenth century French scientist Jacques-Arsène d’Arsonval in 1881. It was another Frenchman, Georges Claude, who made the first attempts to put the concept into practice {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. Between 1928 and 1930 Claude built the first OTEC electrical generating facility at Matanza Bay, Cuba. The facility only operated for 11 days generating sufficient power to light forty 500 watt bulbs during a demonstration; however backers were not sufficiently impressed to finance a proposed 25 megawatt plant (Chiles, 2009). In 1934, using mostly his own money, Claude made his second attempt at a commercial scale OTEC facility. This one was a plant ship for the production of ice off the coast of Brazil.

This paper presents an overview of internal R&D that SBM has carried out on OTEC during 2011 and 2012. OTEC systems have important similarities to our core Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) business and we have been working to understand possible future applications for OTEC in both the Power and Energy Industries.
