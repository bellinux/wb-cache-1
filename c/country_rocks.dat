2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the orogeny the {{emplacement}} of a large batholith {{of granite}} occurred below what is now Devon and Cornwall. This granite is now exposed as Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and several other exposures in Cornwall, including the Isles of Scilly. Granite tors form important elements in the landscape in these areas. Metamorphism of the <b>country</b> <b>rocks</b> and hydrothermal circulation of metal-rich fluids in the cooling rock provided the source of the extensive [...] deposits of the region (primarily copper and tin). Later weathering of the granite led to deposits of kaolin which has been excavated as it is an important source of china clay and ball clay used in the production of such products as porcelain and shiny printing paper.|$|E

40|$|The Jurassic Muskox and Jericho kimberlites (Northern Slave Province, Nunavut, Canada) {{contain a}} variety of facies exhibiting {{different}} geometries, contact relationships, internal organisation, <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> abundance and olivine shapes, although many have similar matrix/groundmass mineralogies and textures. Five facies are examined that either have characteristics consistent with coherent rocks in general (i. e. intrusive and extrusive non-fragmental rocks) or are mineralogically and texturally similar to kimberlite described as coherent (or apparent coherent). Three facies are interpreted as coherent {{on the basis of}}: (1) geological setting, (2) apparent-porphyritic texture, (3) sharp contacts with fragmental kimberlite, (4) relative abundance of elongate and unbroken olivine crystals and (5) paucity of <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> xenoliths, while the remaining two facies are interpreted as fragmental on the basis of: (1) the gradational contacts with demonstrably fragmental kimberlite, (2) relative abundance and range of sizes of <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> lithic clasts and (3) numerous broken olivine crystals. Comparisons are made with coherent and apparent-coherent kimberlite from the literature. Our three coherent facies are similar to literature reported coherent kimberlite dykes hosted in <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> (CKd) in terms of internal organisation, low abundance of <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> xenoliths, and apparent-porphyritic texture. Conversely, our two fragmental facies share attributes with previously described pipe-filling coherent and apparent-coherent kimberlite (CKpf) in terms of geometry, internal organisation and abundance of <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> xenoliths. We conclude that CKd and most CKpf, although similar in matrix/groundmass mineralogy and texture, can be distinguished on the basis of internal organisation, <b>country</b> <b>rock</b> lithic clast abundance, texture (e. g. apparent-porphyritic texture) and possibly olivine crystal shapes and suggest that fragmental kimberlite is more common than reported...|$|R
