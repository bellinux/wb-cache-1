5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing industry, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the <b>canning</b> <b>industry</b> and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for {{fertilizing}} fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E

The most important challenge facing the <b>canning</b> <b>industries</b> was a dependence on unsteady supply of raw material. The available technology, branding trademarks, product differentiation and product quality, versus abundance or scarcity of resources to be used as inputs and international trade presented contradictory effects on entry barriers. Deterrence was inefficient, some foreign firms delocalised to Portugal, and the sector is an interesting case-study in the historical context of globalisation. <b>canning</b> <b>industries,</b> Portugal, entry-barrier effects, deterrence factors, managerial abilities, branding, vertical integration, environmental history,...|$|R

25|$|Outlawed by the French Revolution, {{the slave}} trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, {{continuing}} it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a <b>canning</b> <b>industry</b> during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from Réunion in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on Réunion sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseilles were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours–Saint-Nazaire railway.|$|E

500|$|Crushed shells, {{available}} as a by-product of the seafood <b>canning</b> <b>industry,</b> {{can be used to}} remove pollutants from water. [...] It has been found that, as long as the water is maintained at an alkaline pH, crushed shells will remove cadmium, lead and other heavy metals from contaminated waters by swapping the calcium in their constituent aragonite for the heavy metal, and retaining these pollutants in a solid form. The rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) has been shown to reduce the levels of copper and cadmium in contaminated waters in the Persian Gulf. The live animals acted as biofilters, selectively removing these metals, and the dead shells also had the ability to reduce their concentration.|$|E

2500|$|Nantes {{became a}} major {{industrial}} city {{during the second half}} of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the <b>canning</b> <b>industry,</b> included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be [...] before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a -long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.|$|E
