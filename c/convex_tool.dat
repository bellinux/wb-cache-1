40|$|Abstract—Power {{control is}} {{critical}} for femtocell networks that allow spectrum sharing among Macrocell and Femtocell. In this paper, we derive an optimal power control strategy toward reducing the CO 2 emissions and maximize total throughput under both the probability of dropping a packet due to buffer overflow constraints at the Femtocell user equipment (FUE) and the interference constraints to the Macrocell base station (MBS) for uplink transmission. We use linear programming to solve the CO 2 emissions minimization problem. For maximizing the total throughput of FUEs, we propose a distributed power control algorithms by employing geometry <b>convex</b> <b>tool.</b> Numerical results are used to validate the analysis and demonstrate {{a high degree of}} accuracy for the derived expressions. Results indicate that the performance of the FUEs depends on not only the interference constraint of the MBS but also the delay constraint of the FUEs. I...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} robust {{beamforming}} {{to guarantee the}} physical layer security for a multiuser beam division multiple access (BDMA) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, when the channel estimation errors are taken into consideration. With the aid of artificial noise (AN), the proposed design are formulated as minimizing the transmit power of the base station (BS), while providing legal users and the eavesdropper (Eve) with different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It is strictly proved that, under BDMA massive MIMO scheme, the initial non-convex optimization can be equivalently converted to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem and the optimal rank-one beamforming solutions can be guaranteed. In stead of directly resorting to the <b>convex</b> <b>tool,</b> we make one step further by deriving the optimal beamforming direction and the optimal beamforming power allocation in closed-form, which greatly reduces the computational complexity and makes the proposed design practical for real world applications. Simulation results are then provided to verify {{the efficiency of the}} proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Six-degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) haptic {{rendering}} {{for fine}} manipulation in narrow space is a challenging topic because of frequent constraint changes caused by small tool {{movement and the}} requirement to preserve the feel of fine-features of objects. In this paper, we introduce a configuration-based constrained optimization method for solving this rendering problem. The six-dimensional configuration (position and orientation) of the graphic tool {{is defined as the}} solution variable of the optimization problem. Contact constraints are obtained based on identifying principal contacts between the graphic avatar of the haptic tool, called the graphic tool, and the virtual task environment. In order to maintain stability during contact switch, a hybrid method combining collision detection, local search and parallel optimization is introduced. Based on parallel optimization and selection of local solution, we can maintain the local solution of the optimization model. Our method has been validated in experiments of moving a <b>convex</b> <b>tool</b> to probe a narrow cavity with or without bulges. Force rendering is stable even when the free space is very small and involves fine features of objects. Non-penetration between the tool and the object forming the cavity are maintained under frequent contact switches. Update rate of the simulation loop including the optimization and constraint identification is maintained at about 1 kHz.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this work, {{the effect}} of {{different}} parameters, including stacking sequence, part thickness, and tooling material, on distortion of flat panels was investigated. A Romer arm equipped with a laser scanner was used to obtain {{the maximum amount of}} distortion as well as the 3 D pattern of distortion for each panel. Among the different stacking sequences, the maximum distortion was observed in the asymmetric and balanced panel, while the least distortion belonged to the symmetric and unbalanced one. Furthermore, thinner panels were more distorted than thicker panels with the same planar size and stacking sequences. This study showed that distortion of the flat panels caused by asymmetry in the stacking sequence was an order of magnitude greater than distortion of the panels due to imbalance in the stacking sequence. L-shaped and U-shaped panels were also fabricated to investigate {{the effect of}} stacking sequence on spring-in angle and warpage of the panels. Among all the stacking sequences, the panel with an asymmetric and unbalanced stacking sequence showed the least spring-in angle, while the largest angle was observed in the symmetric and balanced panel. Although asymmetry in the stacking sequences reduced the spring-in angle, significantly more warpage was observed in the panels with asymmetric stacking sequences, as compared to the symmetric ones. MSC Marc was used to predict the distortion of the panels, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results for several stacking sequences of the flat and the L-shaped panels. An L-shaped panel with the stacking sequence of [0 / 45 / 90 /- 45] 4 was simulated to investigate the effect of curve radius and tool geometry on the spring-in angle. The FEA results showed that curing the L-shaped panel on a concave tool led to less spring-in angle, as compared to the panel confined to a <b>convex</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|E

30|$|For {{the case}} of non-zero-interference-power {{constraint}} in CR MIMO-BCs, both the SUs’ SNR constraints and the PUs’ interference power constraints usually result in quadratically constrained quadratic programming problems, {{which may not be}} directly solved by <b>convex</b> <b>tools,</b> especially when there is a rank constraint. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation can be used to convert the aforementioned problem into a convex optimization problem by dropping the rank constraint, consequently generating a local optimum [18]. It is shown in [19] that under certain conditions, a new solution can be generated from the one obtained by SDP relaxation without ruining the constraints or changing the objection function. Actually, most of the resulting problems of joint beamforming and power control are inherently non-convex, and consequently, no global optimality of an efficient solution can be guaranteed theoretically [20]. Nonetheless, in [20], sufficient conditions were presented to constrain some design parameters, making the joint beamforming and power control problem become convex. Furthermore, in [21], a semi-distributed algorithm was proposed to obtain a local optimal solution to this problem. However, in general scenarios, the obtained local optimum may not be feasible for the original problem because its rank usually does not meet the solution’s requirement. As a result, approximation approaches may be used to generate a feasible solution [22 – 26].|$|R
