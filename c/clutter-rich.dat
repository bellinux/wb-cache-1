40|$|We {{present a}} new {{receiver}} design for spatially distributed apertures to detect targets {{in an urban}} environment. A distorted-wave Born approximation is used to model the scattering environment. We formulate the received signals at different receive antennas {{in terms of the}} received signal at the first antenna. The detection problem is then formulated as a binary hypothesis test. The receiver is chosen as the optimal linear filter that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the corresponding test statistic. The receiver operation amounts to correlating a transformed version of the measurement at the first antenna {{with the rest of the}} measurements. In the freespace case the transformation applied to the measurement from the first antenna reduces to a delay operator. We evaluate the performance of the receiver on a real data set collected in a multipath- and <b>clutter-rich</b> urban environment and on simulated data corresponding to a simple multipath scene. Both the experimental and simulation results show that the proposed receiver design offers significant improvement in detection performance compared to conventional matched filtering...|$|E
