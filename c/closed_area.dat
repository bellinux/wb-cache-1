40|$|The use of <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> (marine {{protected}} areas, marine reserves, no-take zones) {{has been}} suggested as a possible solution to the perceived global fisheries crisis. However, to optimize the design and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> we need to understand the interaction between larval dispersal, adult mobility, and fishing mortality. In this paper, a simple, spatially explicit dynamic population model was developed {{to examine the effects of}} these interacting factors on optimal closure size and resulting yields. The effect of using one large or several smaller <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> was also examined. Our model confirmed previous results: <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> do not improve the yield of populations that are optimally managed or underexploited and, as mobility increases, optimum closure size increases. The model also predicted some interesting counter-intuitive results; for overexploited stocks, the greatest benefit from <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> can be obtained for stocks with highest mobility, although this may require closure of 85 % of the total area. For the tested parameter settings, adult spillover had greater potential to improve yield than larval export, and using several small <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> rather than a single larger one had the same effect as increasing the mobility of the population. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The theoretical part of the diploma thesis focuses on problems of Integrated Rescue System, shows its units cooperated during the actions with the necessity of {{the entrance to the}} <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and specifies legislation focused to this type of incidents. It names the ways of entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> according to possible fire-fighting accesses, admission port to the objects and their technical provision in case of defalt in rescue of people. The main part of the diploma thesis in theoretical part is shot to the specification of fire-fighting technics, technical and material means, used for emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> at Fire Rescue Service Moravian-Silesian Region, Regional Fire Rescue Service Karviná. At the conclusion of the theoretical part there are the most important aspects of tactics of Fire Rescue Service forces in actions described, where they are obliged to open closed obstructions for the entrance and to enter the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> regarding to solve technical help, fires or rescue of people. Because Police of the Czech Republic is the component of the Integrated Rescue System it takes part in most cases of Fire Rescue Service´s actions. That is the reason why I introduced the tactics in the actions of Fire Rescue Service force relating to the Fire Protection, very interesting methods of entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> used by special Police force. In the practical part of the diploma thesis there are methods and ways of emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> using modern methods and technical support. To explain described methods of entrance and making obstructions up, I used the experiences obtained during my professional Fire Rescue Service. After the analysis of the separate methods there is an evaluation of their implementation and risks or complications during the actions. All methods and ways of emergency entrance are illustrated by photos. Then there is a summary of events from 2007 to 2012 when I was included to Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná. This summary shows frequency of actions in entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> in Moravian-Silesian Region in 2012. Next there is an analysis of means of Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná, used for opening and entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas.</b> The effect of the analysis is to detect facilities for effective implementation of actions. On the basis of results the optimalisation was suggested to guarantee preparedness for these actions. In conclusion a ?door and window opener? is designed, including the verification of functionality. The technical documentation and direction for use are in enclosures. In conclusion of the practical part of the diploma thesis there is a discussion and evaluation of all aims of the work as practical processes of emergency entrance of Fire Rescue Service (FRS) forces to <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> evaluation of different types of rescuing people, FRS data processing and designing of the ?door and window opener?. At the end of the discussion the exploratory question was confirmed which evaluated facilities of FRS for emergency entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> their insufficiency or necesity of inovation and, of course, if the door and window opener suggested in this work will improve the entrance to the <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and the action standard...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The Bering Sea is a {{productive}} ecosystem {{with some of}} the most important fisheries in the United States. Constant commercial fishing for groundfish has occurred since the 1960 s. The implementation of <b>areas</b> <b>closed</b> to bottom trawling to protect critical habitat for fish or crabs resulted in successful management of these fisheries. The efficacy of these closures on non-target species is unknown. This study determined if differences in abundance, biomass, diversity and evenness of dominant fish and invertebrate species occur among <b>areas</b> open and <b>closed</b> to bottom trawling in the eastern Bering Sea between 1996 and 2000. This study represented four areas: two within Bristol Bay <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> and two within comparable fished areas. Total abundance and biomass were not significantly different among fished and <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> or between pre-closure (1990 - 1994) and post-closure (1996 - 2000) years. Diversity and evenness were greater in fished <b>areas</b> than <b>closed</b> <b>areas.</b> The biomass of some functional feeding groups (i. e. piscivores, detritivores) of species decreased when compared among areas and in pre-closure versus post-closure years while others increased. These results support the need for continued research and monitoring of eastern Bering Sea <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> to determine recovery time and the efficacy of closures as a management tool...|$|R
