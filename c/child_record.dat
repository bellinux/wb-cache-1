50|$|The {{hierarchical}} database model {{mandates that}} each <b>child</b> <b>record</b> {{has only one}} parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records. In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node.This model is recognized as the first database model created by IBM in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a data-integrity {{mechanism}} is the parent-and-child relationship of related records. If a parent record owns one or more related child records all of the referential integrity processes are handled by the database itself, which automatically ensures the accuracy and integrity of the data so that no <b>child</b> <b>record</b> can exist without a parent (also called being orphaned) and that no parent loses their child records. It also ensures that no parent record can be deleted while the parent record owns any child records. All of this is handled at the database level and does not require coding integrity checks into each applications.|$|E
5000|$|Maplewood is an EP by Ed Harcourt. It was {{released}} in 2000. Harcourt recorded the album on a four-track in his grandma's Sussex house, and it was originally intended as a demo. Upon signing the artist to a record contract, Heavenly Records decided to make it his first solo release. The Guardian described it as [...] "a bedroom-produced gem". Some of the songs were later re-recorded during the sessions for Here Be Monsters. The track [...] "He's Building a Swamp" [...] features Hadrian Garrard on trumpet. Harcourt would later describe the release as [...] "the precocious youngest <b>child</b> <b>record.</b> The one everybody loved dearly and still thinks of very fondly, but it's still full of arrogance".|$|E

Winter Child, the next album released by Duke, was recorded on-and-off over the next year. [...] "Winter Child" [...] was primarily recorded in a New York studio with Stewart Lerman and Steuart Smith. Jim Klein contributed several tracks as well. During the making of Winter Child, Marcy Rauer Wagman arranged a meeting between MAD Dragon and Ryko Distribution; as a result, Ryko Distribution became interested in distributing content from MAD Dragon Records and other student-run record labels.

40|$|Biofeedback sensors {{for health}} {{monitoring}} are rapidly growing {{in terms of}} ubiquity and cost. They enable remote, accurate, and low-cost health monitoring and can provide personalized health monitoring and care with timely detection of health issues, especially for children. In this paper, we propose a novel system for real-time personalized health advisory system for children {{in order to promote}} healthy habits and activities (including food, clothing, and activities). The system utilizes Electronic <b>Child</b> <b>Record</b> (ECR) that is continuously updated according to the captured measurements from biofeedback devices, and ontologies for vitamins/allergies, to provide personalized semantic-based recommendations. The preliminary evaluation demonstrated the potential of the proposed system to promote wellbeing of children and facilitate the communication among parties involved in the children care (parents, school staff, and health care staff) ...|$|E

40|$|Ochoa, MACRO, International, Columbia, MD. We {{also thank}} Alberto Palloni who {{provided}} comments and advice o n Primary health care programs, including childhood immunizations, are intensively utilized {{by the majority}} of Latin American households. During 1985 - 1991, governments used national PHC infrastructures to implement the Regional Polio Eradication Initiative. Unprecedented vaccine coverage levels were attained through a combination of mass campaigns, house-to-house vaccinations and improvements in routine immunization services. Little is known, however, about the effects of these interventions on immunization demand; whether they reached so-called highrisk households and, if so, whether program effects were sufficient to offset the negative risk factors. Using the household production of health model, this paper examines the probability and timing of full immunization over this period in one case country, Colombia. Information on the immunization status of 3609 vaccine-eligible children born 1985 - 90 was extracted from Colombia's 1990 Demographic and Health Survey. Annual immunization coverage estimates from the Colombian Ministry of Health for 1985 - 90 for 148 sample municipios were appended to each <b>child</b> <b>record,</b> along with household-level data.

40|$|Rheumatic fever/rheumatic {{heart disease}} is a {{significant}} problem in {{children and young adults}} of our nation and hence needs attention on priority basis. This process documentation describes in brief how rheumatic activity (rheumatic fever and/or rheumatic heart disease) detection is being conducted via throat swab culture towards establishment of a RF/RHD registry in Tripura. Tripura is a state in North-East India which borders Bangladesh, Mizoram and Assam. This is a twinning project with PGIMER, Chandigarh. Agartala Govt. Medical College collects samples of throat swabs from school children (5 - 15 years) and also children coming to OPD/IPD. Agartala Govt. Medical College registers Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease cases on basis of Jones ’ criteria and ECHO cardiography respectively and provide secondary prophylaxis to all these cases at its paediatric OPD. There are three sub-registries functioning under AGMC in 3 districts, where cases are registered and secondary prophylaxis are provided. All the throat swab samples are cultured for the identification of Group A Beta haemolytic streptococcus at Dept. of Microbiology, AGMC. Beta haemolytic streptococcus strains are sent to PGIMER, Chandigarh for emm typing. This is supported by preparation and distribution of educational material; leaflets (Bengali) on RF/RHD were distributed to 33 schools. Doctor’s guideline modules, leaflets and posters to doctors of sub-registries were distributed. Various survey and study related forms include <b>child</b> <b>record</b> form, school survey form, consent form, registration form, patient card, requisition form, and monthly report form. Total 33 schools have been visited till now. Till date total number of throat swabs collected from schools was 1165...|$|E
40|$|The early {{detection}} of the law vision of pre-school children {{has been carried out}} through systematic check-ups by an ophthalmologist sent by the Department for preventive protection-Advisory Division at the Medical Center since 1977. The children are invited by the Advisory Center and during the systematic check-ups they are sent to the Cabinet for orthoptics and pleoptics for the ophthamologic check-up. The parents are motivated for the check-up and are explained how to prepare the child for cooperation during the examination. The findings are recorded in the <b>child</b> <b>record</b> card in the Advisory Center together with the findings of the psychologist, blood test, urine, faecal test of parasites and some other necessary tests. The records of the examination were obtained from the evidence on systematic check-ups at the Cabinet for orthoptics and pleoptics. From 1987 till August this year, 5. 414 children- 3. 609 at the age of 3 and 1. 805 at the age of 5 came for systematic check-ups at the Cabinet. Among the examined children, 5. 7 % were with echophobia, 2. 3 % were with astigmatism, 1. 6 % with amblyopia, 1. 4 % with hypermetropia, 0. 9 % with strabismus and 0. 2 % with miopia. Among the children with sight problems, the echophobia is present with 47. 3 %, astigmatism with 18. 8 %, amblyopia with 13. 2 %, hypermetropia with 11. 9 %, strabism with 7. 2 % and miopia with 1. 8 %. Children whose parents, brothers and sisters wear glasses were sent for check-ups at the age of 18 to 3 years. The earliest findings of sight difficulties are obtained with children who cooperate during the check-ups. As soon as the low vision is discovered, the defectologist-orthoptic therapist starts the necessary exercises and the sight is corrected with the glasses. At this age, children easily adapt to wearing glasses and they do not oppose them as the children whose sight correction started at the school age...|$|E
