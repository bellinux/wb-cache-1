Contrary to the ambiguous results of strategic trade policy for markets with a fixed number of firms, {{it is always}} optimal to subsidize exports as long as entry is endogenous, under both competition in quantities and in prices. With homogenous goods the optimal export subsidy is a fraction 1 /€ of the price, where € is the elasticity of demand, {{the exact opposite of}} the optimal export tax in the neoclassical trade theory.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is an S-Curve in Colombia using {{bilateral}} and disaggregated quarterly data for the period 1991 - 2014. More precisely, the short-run effects of a depreciation on the TB are analysed in 27 industries covered by the PAG Free Trade Agreement. The S-Curve found in sectors representing 30 % of total industrial production suggests that in these cases <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> {{have a positive effect on}} the TB in the short run. However, the regression analysis using both OLS and FE methods shows that sizable ones are needed to produce the desired effects on trade flows. Our findings have important policy implications: since only large <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> can restore TB equilibrium, industrial restructuring would appear to be a more sensible strategy, though this cannot be achieved in the short run and is instead a medium/long-term goal...|$|R
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation.</b> He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation.</b> Though he advised that rather than using protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E
5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation,</b> but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E

50|$|Second, another {{specificity}} of international optimal monetary {{policy is the}} issue of strategic interactions and <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations,</b> which is due to cross-border spillovers in quantities and prices. Therein, the national authorities of different countries face incentives to manipulate the terms of trade to increase national welfare in the absence of international policy coordination. Even though the gains of international policy coordination might be small, such gains may become very relevant if balanced against incentives for international noncooperation.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of Italy, the {{long-term}} single cause of the economic crisis {{is to be found}} in the move from an economy based on so-called <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> to one based on a strong currency, as well as the wrong economic policy that both the country’s government and the EU as a whole have (not) implemented to cope with this change. Moreover, as Aristotelous (2006) shows, Italy was unable to gain from the introduction of the Euro or in terms of greater trade integration with the rest of the Euro area.|$|R
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|Methods have {{included}} reducing {{the percentage of}} gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century, {{the proportion of the}} world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through seigniorage, especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation. A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held {{that the best way to}} encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870–1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place. However, currency war did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.|$|E
25|$|In October, Alan Beatie and Alice Ross for the Financial Times {{noted that}} the global trade {{imbalances}} which had driven the currency war have been sharply reduced. However, they suggest that without further reforms, the imbalances may soon widen again. They also note that Mantega once more raised the alarm about <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation,</b> following the United States's launch of QE3 in September.|$|E

30|$|Within the Eurozone, {{the impossibility}} to embark into <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> has {{rendered}} the leadership to internal devaluations. In this way, labour market reforms enforcing wage moderation {{have been one}} of the pillars of the policy response. On one side, these reforms are expected to allow employment to recover, while, on the other one, they should also help economic growth by boosting net foreign demand. Accordingly, wage moderation is seen as a very tempting response to the crisis, both at the labour market and at macroeconomic levels (even more so in a context of austerity and ineffective standard monetary policy).|$|R

25|$|Other {{commentators}} including world statesmen such as Manmohan Singh and Guido Mantega {{suggested a}} currency war was indeed underway {{and that the}} leading participants are China and the US, though since 2009 many other states have been taking measures to either devalue or at least check the appreciation of their currencies. The US does not acknowledge that it is practicing <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> and its official policy is to let the dollar float freely. While the US has taken no direct action to devalue its currency, there is close to universal consensus among analysts that its quantitative easing programmes exert downwards pressure on the dollar.|$|E

The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate (± 1 percent) by tying its currency to gold {{and the ability of}} the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation</b> of the currencies as well.|$|E

While many countries experienced undesirable upward pressure on their exchange rates and {{took part in the}} ongoing arguments, the most notable dimension of the 2010–11 episode was the rhetorical conflict between the United States and China over the valuation of the yuan. In January 2013, measures announced by Japan which were expected to devalue its currency sparked concern of a possible second 21st century currency war breaking out, this time with the principal source of tension being not China versus the US, but Japan versus the Eurozone. By late February, concerns of a new outbreak of currency war had been mostly allayed, after [...] the G7 and G20 issued statements committing to avoid <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation.</b> After the European Central Bank launched a fresh programme of quantitative easing in January 2015, there was once again an intensification of discussion about currency war.|$|E
5|$|Historically, <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluations</b> {{have been}} rare as {{countries}} have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency.

Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations.

Paul Krugman has echoed Eichengreen's view that central bank's unconventional monetary policy is best understood as a shared concern to boost growth, not as currency war. Goldman Sachs strategist Kamakshya Trivedi has suggested that rising stock markets imply that market players generally agree that central bank's actions are best understood as monetary easing and not as <b>competitive</b> <b>devaluation.</b> Other analysts have however continued to assert that ongoing tensions over currency valuation remain, with currency war and even trade war still a significant risk. Central bank officials ranging from New Zealand and Switzerland to China have made fresh statements about possible further interventions against their currencies.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} a nominal exchange rate devaluation on the current account, using an intertemporal model that highlights the interaction between leisure and consumption. An analytical solution demonstrates that household behavior may differ markedly from the simple consumption smoothing emphasized in most previous literature. This distinction has special significance for demand shocks, in which output rises through a rise in labor input and hence a fall in leisure. In particular, consumption tends to move closely with increased output in this context, so a devaluation tends not to improve the current account.
