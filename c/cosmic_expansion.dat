5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity {{have been made}} in the context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion,</b> for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion</b> or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion.</b> The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
40|$|If {{expanding}} and contracting regions coexist in the universe, {{the speed of the}} <b>cosmic</b> volume <b>expansion</b> can be accelerated. We construct simple inhomogeneous dust-filled universe models in which the speed of the <b>cosmic</b> volume <b>expansion</b> is accelerated for finite periods. These models are constructed by removing spherical domains from the Einstein-de Sitter universe and filling each domain with a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dust sphere possessing the same gravitational mass as the removed region. This represents an exact solution of the Einstein equations. We find that acceleration of the <b>cosmic</b> volume <b>expansion</b> is realized in some cases when the size of the contracting region is comparable to the horizon radius of the Einstein-de Sitter universe though this model {{is very different from the}} universe observed today.

25|$|Although widely {{attributed}} to Edwin Hubble, {{the law was}} first derived from the general relativity equations, in 1922, by Alexander Friedmann who published a set of equations, {{now known as the}} Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might expand, and presenting the expansion speed if this was the case.

25|$|Deuterium {{is thought}} to have played an {{important}} role in setting the number and ratios of the elements that were formed in the Big Bang. Combining thermodynamics and the changes brought about by <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion,</b> one can calculate the fraction of protons and neutrons based on the temperature at the point that the universe cooled enough to allow formation of nuclei. This calculation indicates seven protons for every neutron at the beginning of nucleogenesis, a ratio that would remain stable even after nucleogenesis was over. This fraction was in favor of protons initially, primarily because the lower mass of the proton favored their production. As the universe expanded, it cooled. Free neutrons and protons are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons had a strong energetic reason to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} the vacuum energy can have {{multiple}} stable energy states is a leading hypothesis {{for the cause of}} cosmic inflation. In fact, {{it has been argued that}} these early vacuum fluctuations led to the expansion of the universe and in turn have guaranteed the non-equilibrium conditions necessary to drive order from chaos, as without such expansion the universe would have reached thermal equilibrium and no complexity could have existed. With the continued accelerated expansion of the universe, the cosmos generates an energy gradient that increases the [...] "free energy" [...] (i.e. the available, usable or potential energy for useful work) which the universe is able to utilize to create ever more complex forms of order. The only reason Earth's environment does not decay into an equilibrium state is that it receives a daily dose of sunshine and that, in turn, is due to the sun [...] "polluting" [...] interstellar space with decreasing entropy. The sun's fusion power is only possible due to the gravitational disequilibrium of matter that arose from <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion.</b> In this essence, the vacuum energy can be viewed as the key cause of the negative entropy (i.e. structure) throughout the universe. That humanity might alter the morphology of the vacuum energy to create an energy gradient for useful work is the subject of much controversy.|$|E
2500|$|Several discourses {{that were}} {{attributed}} to the historical Buddha contain a remarkable resemblance to modern astronomical and cosmological claims denoted by modern scientific discovery.

In that thousand-fold cosmos there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sunerus — kings of mountains; a thousand Rose-apple continents, a thousand Deathless Ox-cart , a thousand northern Kuru , a thousand eastern Videha ,...Another seemingly compelling cosmological supposition is evident throughout the discourses regarding a narration similar to the Cyclic model (Big Bang and Big Crunch theory) proposed by Albert Einstein, as it is found in the Maha-Saccaka Sutta and Dvedhavitakka Sutta out of several others, as stated:When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of <b>cosmic</b> <b>expansion,</b> many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion...Out of the many eschatological proclamations made by the various religions and sects around the world, the one found in the Pali Canon match closest to modern cosmological claims of how the Earth would most probably be destroyed.
