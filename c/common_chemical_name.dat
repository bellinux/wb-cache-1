The proposed trade name for the orchard formulation of PP 581 is VOLAK™. Brodifacoum has been seen to possess several novel characteristics in work with commensal and other rodent species, suggesting a considerable general potential for control of many pest species of rodents and in various use situations. These characteristics are: 1. Single-feeding action for most species. (Defined as giving over 90 % control in 1 day no-choice or 3 day choice tests with 50 ppm bait) 2. Effective on anticoagulant resistant rodents. (As based on US and UK lab studies with warfarin-and cross-resistant rats and mice which were successfully killed by PP 581) 3. No bait avoidance. (Beyond that avoidance shown by rodents to any new object or foodstuff, bait avoidance is not a factor and bait is well accepted by most rodents. The lapse of several days till death reduces the chance of rodents associating bait ingestion with poisoning symptoms. 4. Antidotable. (Vitamin K 1 injections are antidotal, as is the case for existing anticoagulant products) 5. Low hazard. (PP 581 baits at 50 ppm should be as safe to most non-target animals and the environment as other antlcoagulants in current use...|$|E
40|$|The Gene Ontology (GO) is {{organized}} in three allegedly independent hierarchies: molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components. In this paper, we present an approach {{based on the}} Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology to identifying dependence relations in GO, especially relations across hierarchies. Our method {{is based on the}} identification of the names of ChEBI entities in GO terms. We distinguish between firstorder dependence relations between GO terms that share a <b>common</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>name,</b> and second-order dependence relations between GO entities whose names include two chemicals that are hierarchically related. Of the 10, 516 entities in ChEBI, 26 % were identified in the names of 9, 431 GO terms (55 % of all GO terms). A total of 771, 302 pairs of related GO terms (first-order associations) were computed. Of these, 44 % correspond to dependence relations across hierarchies. These results were compared to the 8, 714 pairs of GO terms identified as dependent by lexical and statistical methods in a previous study (once restricted to GO terms whose names include a ChEBI entity). Of these, 3, 932 (45 %) were identified as first-order relations, and 937 (11 %) as secondorder relations. We show that the two kinds of approaches are complementary. The ChEBI-based is independent of the annotations, allowing even rare dependencies to be identified. Moreover, it takes advantage of the subsumption relations between chemicals in ChEBI, and therefore helps identify second-order dependence relations. This approach can be generalized to other ontologies of chemicals as well as other kinds of ontologies...|$|E

These mites puncture leaf tissue with their chelicerae and cause loss of photosynthetically active area.

There {{has been a lot}} of interest of late in the use of botanical oils other than soybean, including those derived from the seeds of plants including spearmint, rosemary and clove. This project tested for differences in the efficacy of a mineral vs. a botanical oil. The botanical oil was a blend of rosemary and peppermint oil (Ecotrol®) and was tested against a petroleum based oil (Omni Oil®), then compared to a commonly used synthetic miticide (Nexter®, <b>common</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> pyridaben). The field experiment (San Juan Vineyards in Shandon, CA) tested effects on adult mite and egg populations, with five treatments: Omni Oil®, Ecotrol®, Nexter®, Ecotrol® + Nexter®, and water as a control. Laboratory experiments tested effects on adult females and eggs. Treatments were Omni Oil®, Ecotrol® (1. 0 %), Ecotrol® (0. 5 %) and water as a control. Field data showed that Omni Oil® (at 1. 5 %) was the only effective treatment, Ecotrol® (at 0. 5 % or 1. 0 %) did not differ from the control. Omni Oil® was the most effective treatment against adult mites in the laboratory studies, followed by Ecotrol® at 1. 0 %, with Ecotrol® at 0. 5 % not very effective.

40|$|The {{invention}} of azithromycin (1, Figure 1), the {{active pharmaceutical ingredient}} of the antibiotic Sumamed (Croatian brand name by PLIVA; Zithromax by Pfizer in the USA) belongs among the great achievements {{in the history of}} science in Croatia. From the viewpoint of commercialization of research results, it may {{have been one of the}} greatest. In addition to contributing to science and to medicine, azithromycin has also brought about an improvement in the quality of life on the global level. Owing to its exceptional therapeutic properties, it has come to be one of the most successful antibiotics worldwide. Marking the 30 th anniversary of the azithromycin Yugoslav patent application, this paper gives an overview of the research that led to its discovery and comes with a list of papers and patents through which the drug has been made known to the public (Table 1, Figures 4 and 6). The invention was due to the scientists from the Research Institute of the pharmaceutical company PLIVA in Zagreb, Croatia, D. Sc. S. Đokić, M. Sc. G. Kobrehel, D. Sc. G. Lazarevski, and D. Sc. Z. Tamburašev (Figure 3). Azithromycin became the first representative of the new class of 15 -membered macrolides known as azalides after the introduction of nitrogen in the macrocycle of erythromycin A (2, Figure 1). Its synthesis involved several steps (Figure 2) : oximation of erithromycin A, Beckmann rearrangement of erythromycin A oxime with aromatic sulphochlorides, reduction of the produced erithromycin A iminoether, and final methylation of the nitrogen introduced in the macrocycle of erythromycin A. Because of inadequate analytical support in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, the precise structure of the LD product (Figure 5) in the Beckmann rearrangement step of azithromycin synthesis was confirmed only later as 7 and not 6 as assumed (Figure 5). Today, azithromycin is known under the <b>common</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> of 9 -deoxo- 9 a-aza- 9 a-methyl-homoerythromycin A. This paper also deals with the negotiations and signing of a contract between PLIVA, Croatian pharmaceutical company, the patent holder, and Pfizer, one of the world largest pharmaceutical companies in the field of proprietary research. The dihydrate form of azithromycin is also discussed. The azithromycin (i. e. Sumamed and Zithromax) story, which dates from the second half of the last century, can be considered as the first and foremost example of successful knowledge and technology transfer in Croatia ever. On their web pages, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) reports the PLIVA azithromycin story as a case study and excellent example of proactive licensing strategy. For the discovery of azithromycin, in addition to receiving numerous awards, in the year 2000, PLIVA's scientists D. Sc. S. Đokić and M. Sc. G. Kobrehel, together with the representatives from the US-based Pfizer, were granted the honorable titles of "Heroes of Chemistry 2000 " by the American Chemical Society (ACS), a non-profit association of American chemists and chemical engineers, and the largest association of scientists in the world. This high award is rightly taken to be also recognition of the achievement of PLIVA's entire team working on azithromycin.

S aspekta komercijalizacije znanstvenih istraživanja vjerojatno je najveće. Ovaj izum ujedno je i velik doprinos znanosti, medicini i poboljšanju kvalitete života na globalnoj razini. Iznimno terapijsko djelovanje učinilo je azitromicin jednim od najuspješnijih antibiotika na svjetskoj razini.

Azitromicin je prvi predstavnik nove klase 15 -eročlanih makrolida, nazvane azalidi po dušiku uvedenom u eritromicinski prsten. Dobiven je u nekoliko sintetskih koraka: oksimacijom eritromicina A, Beckmannovom pregradnjom dobivena oksima eritromicina A s aromatskim sulfokloridima, zatim redukcijom iminoetera eritromicina A te konačno metiliranjem u eritromicinski prsten uvedenoga dušika. Današnje je uobičajeno kemijsko ime za azitromicin 9 -deokso- 9 a-aza- 9 a-metil- 9 a-homoeritromicin A.
