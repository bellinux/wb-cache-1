This is a quan 3 ̆eQual study, which began with a quantitative measurement to determine a <b>criterion</b> <b>sampling,</b> followed by the primary research method, a transcendental phenomenology of flow during voluntary, independent reading.

Quantitative methodology was utilized to obtain the <b>criterion</b> <b>sampling</b> through the Flow State Scale (FSS). This quantitative score was 2 ̆ 2 qualitized 2 ̆ 2 (Tashakkori 2 ̆ 6 Teddlie, 1998, p. 126), which is to transform quantitative data into qualitative, in order to compare the results of the FSS with the qualitative results (meaning units) to provide complementarity, development, and trustworthiness.

40|$|Abstract—The {{quality of}} {{selected}} AR models {{depends on the}} true process in the finite sample practice, {{on the number of}} observations, on the estimation algorithm, and on the order selection <b>criterion.</b> <b>Samples</b> are considered to be finite if the maximum candidate model order for selection is greater than 10, where denotes the number of observations. Finite sample formulae give empirical approximations for the statistical average of the residual energy and of the squared error of prediction for several autoregressive estimation algorithms. This leads to finite <b>sample</b> <b>criteria</b> for order selection that depend on the estimation method. The special finite <b>sample</b> information <b>criterion</b> (FSIC) and combined information criterion (CIC) are necessary because of the increase of the variance of the residual energy for higher model orders that has not been accounted for in other criteria. Only the expectation of the logarithm of the residual energy, {{as a function of the}} model order, has been the basis for the previous classes of asymptotical and finite <b>sample</b> <b>criteria.</b> However, the behavior of the variance causes an undesirable tendency to select very high model orders without the special precautions of FSIC or CIC.
