40|$|In this paper, {{the sensor}} of an optical mouse is {{presented}} as a counterfeit <b>coin</b> <b>detector</b> applied to the two-Euro case. The detection process is based on the short distance image acquisition capabilities of the optical mouse sensor where partial images of the coin under analysis are compared with some partial reference coin images for matching. Results show that, using only the vision sense, the counterfeit acceptance and rejection rates are very similar to those of a trained user and better than those of an untrained user...|$|E

The coin-based mobile battery charger {{developed}} in this paper for providing a unique service to the rural public where grid power is not available for partial/full daytime {{and a source of}} revenue for site providers. This can be quickly and easily installed outside any business premises. This type of charger will be very useful for the public people; many times the battery becomes flat {{in the middle of the}} conversation in particularly at inconvenient times when access to a standard charger isn’t possible. The power supply for the charger is determined from solar power and current supply. When we put a coin, the <b>coin</b> <b>detector</b> detects the coin and the input is given to the controller. MOSFET acts as the switch in the circuit. This circuit can be placed in public places such as Bus stands, Railway stations, Hospitals...|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, {{during the}} late 1990s some coin-operated slot {{machines}} would accept two Austrian Schillings glued together {{as if they were}} a £1.00 coin. Seeing as the two original coins had a net value of under £0.10 at the then-current exchange rate, this [...] "trick" [...] could net a profit when playing as the cost to play the machine had been reduced by over 90%. It did not take long for industry to reprogram the <b>coin</b> <b>detectors</b> to detect and reject the [...] "Austrian Schilling trick".Not long after it was possible to buy on the Internet a bag of 100 washers for under £20 that had been deliberately made to fool the machines into thinking they were £1 coins. Again profits could be made, and again the industry reacted and coin detection devices were replaced with improved ones.|$|R

Recent investigations into high-order processing {{in the fly}} visual system have revealed a class of neurons, <b>coined</b> small-target-motion <b>detectors</b> (STMDs), capable of responding robustly to target motion against the motion of background clutter. Despite limited spatial acuity in the insect eye, these neurons display exquisite sensitivity to small targets. ResultsWe recorded intracellularly from morphologically identified columnar neurons in the lobula complex of the hoverfly Eristalis tenax. We show that these columnar neurons with exquisitely small receptive fields, like their large-field counterparts recently described from {{both male and female}} flies, have an extreme selectivity for the motion of small targets. In doing so, we provide the first physiological characterization of small-field neurons in female flies. These retinotopically organized columnar neurons include both direction-selective and nondirection-selective classes covering a large area of visual space. ConclusionsThe retinotopic arrangement of lobula columnar neurons sensitive to the motion of small targets makes a strong case for these neurons as important precursors in the local processing of target motion. Furthermore, the continued response of STMDs with such small receptive fields to the motion of small targets in the presence of moving background clutter places further constraints on the potential mechanisms underlying their small-target tuning...|$|R

40|$|We {{synthesize}} â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FDin our institution using L-ethyl-N trifluoroacetyl-[13 - 3, 4 -dimethoxy- 6 -mercuric-trifluoroacetyl phenyl) ]alaninate (obtained from BIS Chem. Inc., Quebec, Canada) and â€˜ 8 F-acetylhypofluoriteproduced from â€˜ 8 F-F 2 {{made from}} proton reaction on t 8 o [...] o, (5). Purification of the 8 F- 6 -FD product essentially followed the method by Adam and Jivan (4) except the semi-prep HPLC mobile phase we used was 0. 02 M NaOAc pH 3. 5. As Chen et al. (1) {{and others have}} observed, we found that shortly after neutralization to pH 6 - 7, the HPLC purified â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FDsolution turned brownish in color which further darkened with time. In light of the finding by Chen et al. (i) that the addition ofO. I 5 % Na 2 EDTA prevented or at least significantly slowed decomposition of â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FD,we included 0. 15 % Na 2 EDTA to the HPLC mobile phase used without affecting the separation of â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FD. How ever, even with this added EDTA, slight darkening of the solution containing the â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FDHPLC peak was observed within an hour after neutralization even though the solution was kept in ice and in the dark as recommended by Chen et al. (1). Due to the known instability ofL-DOPA at pH 7 and above (6), we suspectedpH to be a most critical factor in the decomposition of â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FD. To test this hypothesis, we divided a dose of â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FD(8 mCi, 500 mCi/mmol, 10 ml 0. 02 M NaOAc pH 3. 5 + 0. 15 % Na 2 EDTA) into four sterile and capped vials. Two vials were neutralized to pH 7 using lM NaOH while {{the other two were}} kept at pH 3. 5. One pH 7 sample and one pH 3. 5 sample were bubbled with He gas while another pH 3. 5 sample was bubbled with 02 gas. These vials were kept overnight in ice and in a dark room. As seen in the photograph (Fig. 1), low pH is indeed critical to the stability of â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FDwhile the effect of oxygen is more pro nounced at neutral pH. HPLC analysis using three detectors, UV = 254 nm, electrochemical = +O. 9 V,and a pair of <b>coin</b> cidence <b>detectors,</b> showed unchanged â€˜ 8 F- 6 -FDin both pH 3. 5 samples. On the other hand, more complicated chromat ograms were seen in the UV and radioactivity tracings for both pH 7 samples. No electrochemical trace was seen in the pH 7 sampleunder ambient air whilea late elutingpeak was seen for the pH 7 sample under He. Further studies to identify the products are under way to elucidate the mechanism o...|$|R
