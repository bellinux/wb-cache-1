40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} in 2003 of automated <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> {{of traffic}} offences brought {{a major change}} to road safety policy in France. What is required now is an appraisal of how it has been "accepted". The first part looks at the need to deconstruct the notion of social acceptance {{within the framework of}} an analysis of public policy and points up the interest of the focus group method in understanding this acceptance. The paper draws on recorded discussions by focus groups in the city of Nantes, in western France, {{in the second half of}} 2009 and the first half of 2010. The second part shows that the instrument in question is perceived as destabilising for the identity of the professionals in charge of its functioning. The road users questioned seem less bothered by the automated system, this being explained by greater practical adaptability on their part...|$|R
40|$|The {{transportation}} of freight by truck has been fully deregulated and opened to {{competition in the}} European Union, without any quotas or restrictions since Huly 1998. This deregulation has caused problems, mainly due to the delay in adopting common fiscal and social measures, road <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctions</b> for firms that commit offenses. Unscrupulous companies have used this legal vacuum in the EU to factitiously "outsource" activities and dodge national rules and regulations about taxes, labor relations and welfare. As a result, working conditions have worsened as barriers have been lifted. By definition, turnover is high among wage-earners. Truck drivers, semi-skilled, have become interchangeable on the EU marketplace. They can be profitably replaced with drivers from eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Bulgaria), who are much cheaper and less protected. The spread of such practices is a cause of concern for labor organizations in Europe. Shipping by truck is a textbook case for analyzing how the EU is trying to counter the devious effects arising out of the deregulation of {{a branch of the}} economy. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} horizontalization in {{government}} prompts {{a debate on}} safeguarding public accountability. This paper contributes to the debate by presenting categories of horizontalization in government, types of horizontal accountability and criteria for judging the appropriateness of arrangements for public accountability. Accountability arrangements must {{meet the requirements of}} the democratic constitutional state to provide adequate <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. This implies, among other things, that responsibilities must be clear and the information supply, debate <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> options must all be established. A discussion of existing mechanisms for horizontal accountability indicates that the requirements of a democratic constitutional state are generally not sufficiently met. This makes it imperative to establish more balanced arrangements for public accountability that fit more horizontal forms of government...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we compare}} {{the causes and}} effects of {{immaterial}} rewards <b>and</b> <b>sanctions</b> on cooperation in a voluntary contribution experiment. It appears that both rewards <b>and</b> <b>sanctions</b> increase contributions (<b>and</b> that rewards are more effective than sanctions) only when subjects interact repeatedly within the same group. The effect is, however, insignificant, which {{could be due to}} the higher variance in presence of rewards <b>and</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Furthermore, it is evidenced that rewards have some negative effect on the future contribution for both the imposer and the imposed when the partner matching is applied, but both rewards <b>and</b> <b>sanctions</b> have mainly positive effects under the stranger matching. Thus it seems that the recipient of the feedback takes the message as a reliable external evaluation of her contribution only under the stranger matching protocol when the strategic use of feedback can largely be excluded.
