25|$|The {{first use}} of channel I/O was with the IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe, whose Model 766 Data Synchronizer was the first <b>channel</b> <b>controller,</b> in 1957. Its {{transistorized}} successor, the IBM 7090, had two or more channels (the 7607) and a channel multiplexor (the 7606) which could control up to eight channels.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001 the BBC {{decided to}} {{reposition}} and rebrand their two digital channels {{so that they}} could be more closely linked to the well established BBC One and BBC Two. Their plan was for BBC Knowledge to be replaced with BBC Four—which took place in 2002—and for BBC Choice to be replaced with BBC Three. However, questions were raised over the proposed format of the new BBC Three, as some thought the new format would be too similar to the BBC's commercial rivals, namely ITV2 and E4, and would be unnecessary competition. The channel was eventually given the go ahead, eleven months after the original launch date, and launched on 9 February 2003. The channel was launched by Stuart Murphy, who previously ran BBC Choice, and before that UK Play, the now-discontinued UKTV music and comedy channel. At 33, Murphy was still the youngest <b>channel</b> <b>controller</b> in the country, a title he had held since launching UK Play at the age of 26; although on 20 October 2005 it was announced that Murphy was soon to leave the channel to work in commercial television.|$|E
25|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>controllers</b> {{are making}} a {{comeback}} {{in the form of}} bus mastering peripheral devices, such as PCI direct memory access (DMA) devices. The rationale for these devices is the same as for the original <b>channel</b> <b>controllers,</b> namely off-loading transfer, interrupts, and context switching from the main CPU.|$|R
25|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>controllers</b> {{have also}} been made as small as single-chip designs with {{multiple}} channels on them, used in the NeXT computers for instance. However, with the rapid speed increases in computers today, combined with operating systems that don't 'block' when waiting for data, <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> have become correspondingly less effective and are not commonly found on small machines.|$|R
50|$|HBA is {{also known}} to be {{interpreted}} as High Bandwidth Adapter in cases of Fibre <b>Channel</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R

2500|$|PMC-Sierra offers {{products}} for storage networks and systems. The company provides an interconnect and controller product family for SAS and SATA storage systems and server computer RAID controllers. PMC-Sierra provides Fibre <b>Channel</b> <b>controller</b> and system interconnect products. PMC-Sierra acquired the channel storage business from Adaptec. This business was named [...] "Adaptec by PMC" [...] and makes SAS/SATA RAID Adapters. In July 2013 PMC completed {{the acquisition of}} IDT's Flash controller business and in August 2014 introduced the Flashtec line of non-volatile memory drives.|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} to the BBC in August 1995 to present a series of retrospective shows, Parkinson: The Interviews, featuring memorable excerpts, eventually presenting a new, revived version of his chat show on BBC One in January 1998. However, in April 2004, ITV announced that it had [...] "poached" [...] the interviewer from the BBC from the autumn of that year. Parkinson {{said that he was}} sad to be leaving the BBC but that he and the <b>channel</b> <b>controller,</b> Lorraine Heggessey, could not agree on a suitable slot for his show following the return of Premiership football highlights to the BBC One Saturday evening schedule. The ITV version of the programme, produced by Granada, debuted in September 2004, with an identical set, theme tune and format to the BBC edition. Its audience was around 6m viewers.|$|E
50|$|It also {{included}} a number of <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> for handling I/O. The CPU could hand off short programs written in the <b>channel</b> <b>controller's</b> own machine language, which would then process the data, move it to or from the memory, and raise an interrupt when they completed. This allowed the main CPU {{to move on to}} other tasks while waiting for the slow I/O to complete, a primary feature of time sharing systems.|$|R
50|$|High-end systems {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} <b>channel</b> <b>controllers,</b> which were essentially small computers dedicated to handling the input and output of a given bus. IBM {{introduced the}}se on the IBM 709 in 1958, and they became a common feature of their platforms. Other high-performance vendors like Control Data Corporation implemented similar designs. Generally, the <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> would {{do their best to}} run all of the bus operations internally, moving data when the CPU was known to be busy elsewhere if possible, and only using interrupts when necessary. This greatly reduced CPU load, and provided better overall system performance.|$|R
50|$|The PP also {{included}} a set of sixty-four 32-bit communications registers (CRs). The CRs stored the state required for communication between the {{various parts of the}} ASC: the CPU, VPs, and <b>channel</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The idents {{are based}} on a circle motif, with content much more diverse than the previous: {{swimming}} hippos, motorcycle stunt riders, children playing [...] "ring a roses", lit windows, surfers, football players, the moon, kites, and a red arc circling the logo. The first of the new idents shown was 'Kites', appearing at 9:58 BST on 7 October. According to former <b>channel</b> <b>controller</b> Peter Fincham, the new circle motif is both a link to the classic globe icon used since 1963, and a 'nod' to the channel's heritage, as well as a symbol of unity, in the way the channel brings people together. The [...] "Moon" [...] and [...] "Windows" [...] idents were dropped in July 2008. On 2 May 2009, the circle idents were edited with shorter video sequences and new soundtracks (except [...] "Hippos" [...] and [...] "Surfers").|$|E

25|$|Before Sveriges Television {{was formed}} in 1978, {{television}} broadcasting was controlled by <b>channel</b> <b>controllers.</b> Nils Erik Baehrentz was the controller between 1958-1968.

50|$|From 1986 to 1991, {{faced with}} {{repeated}} threats from various <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> from the BBC {{to cancel the}} programme, Top Gear embarked on subtle changes designed to raise its profile, increase its audience and cover a much wider range of motoring topics. In this period, many new presenters were added, including former Formula One driver Tiff Needell, Tom Boswell and rallying's Tony Mason.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, General Instrument {{sold their}} {{microelectronics}} division {{and the new}} owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date. The PIC, however, was upgraded with an internal EPROM to produce a programmable <b>channel</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E

50|$|LTR is {{distinguished}} {{from some other}} common trunked radio systems in {{that it does not}} have a dedicated control channel. Each repeater has its own controller and all of these controllers are coordinated together. Even though each controller monitors its own channel, one of the <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> is assigned to be a master and all the other controllers report to it.|$|R
50|$|The Agnus is the Address Generator Chip. Its main function, in chip area, is the RAM Address Generator and Register Address Encoder which handles all DMA addresses. The 8361 Agnus {{is made up}} of {{approximately}} 21000 transistors and contains DMA <b>Channel</b> <b>Controllers.</b> According to Jay Miner, original Agnus was fabricated in 5 µm manufacturing process like all OCS chipset. The Blitter and Copper are also contained here.|$|R
25|$|Despite these above-average ratings, {{the show}} {{did not go}} to series. The {{proximate}} cause for this was a changeover in <b>channel</b> <b>controllers</b> at BBC One. Bill Cotton, who had approved the pilot, vacated his position soon thereafter. He was replaced by Alan Hart, who simply disliked the idea and the resulting product. Further episodes were therefore not commissioned. The show was repeated once on BBC2 during the Christmas period of 1982.|$|R
