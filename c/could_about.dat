5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her as best she <b>could</b> <b>about</b> the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{shared a}} love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who {{after graduating from high}} school had the {{intention}} of directing a film version of Homer's The Iliad. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, The March of Time, Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he <b>could</b> <b>about</b> filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.|$|E
5000|$|Mackenzie's lyrics on Sulk {{are often}} cryptic and ambiguous. Speaking to NME {{at the time}} of the album's release about the band's biggest hit single, Mackenzie said, [...] "'Party Fears' <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> a whole lot of things. It <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> a husband and wife arguing with each other. It <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> {{communism}} and conservatism, political party extremes. It <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> schizophrenics. The lyrics of a song like that go deliberately to the extremes to get something across, like an actor using a heavy hand gesture when he speaks a line." ...|$|R

5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they <b>could.</b> <b>About</b> 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he <b>could</b> <b>about</b> business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> an ex-girlfriend. It <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> a rock diva that we all know, it <b>could</b> be <b>about</b> your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|R

25|$|Her {{interest}} in obstetrics began after working with new mothers in hospital. At the time, standard childbirth procedures involved giving mothers {{large amounts of}} medication, and keeping them in hospital for 10 days after they gave birth.

After talking about her experiences at the hospital {{with one of her}} part-time private patients, she learned of Grantly Dick-Read's book Natural Childbirth. She was unable to meet Read or other like-minded individuals because of the outbreak of World War II, so she taught herself as much as she <b>could</b> <b>about</b> obstetrics.|$|E

The text then proceeds to mention that the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Huni had died and was succeeded by Sneferu. Kagemni was appointed as overseer of the pyramid town and Vizier by Sneferu.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Gerbic {{organized}} a sting on well-known psychic Chip Coffey which she code-named Operation Bumblebee. She and two associates created false identities and false dead relatives complete with backstories and pictures (of real, still living people) and attended a Coffey event in San Jose, CA. Mingling with attendees {{before the show}} started, the three talked {{as much as they}} <b>could</b> <b>about</b> their supposedly dead relatives, hoping that some of Coffey's assistants might overhear. During the show, Coffey did indeed do readings on each of the three, claiming to be in contact with each of the supposedly dead relatives, confidently relating details about completely made up people, including some of what Gerbic and her associates had talked about before the show.|$|E
25|$|De Keyser's {{career was}} not limited to Amsterdam, and his {{international}} contacts helped him {{to keep in touch with}} the mainstream of European architecture. The Amsterdam city administrators sent him to England where he worked with Inigo Jones (1573-1652). Jones was the first English architect who went to Italy to learn all he <b>could</b> <b>about</b> classical architecture. He studied the famous treatises written by the Roman architect Vitruvius (circa 30 BC), and his intimate knowledge of the work of Palladio (1518-1580) gave him the nickname the English Palladio. The Banqueting House in London, designed for the Stuart monarchs, became the prototype of classical architecture in England. When De Keyser returned to Amsterdam one of Jones’ assistants, Nicholas Stone, joined him. Stone worked with De Keyser in Amsterdam from 1607 to 1613 and even became his son-in-law. De Keyser attention to England and English architecture reflect Amsterdam's position as a commercial centre in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought she was much too young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself everything she <b>could</b> <b>about</b> the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, she talked to anyone she happened to find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they <b>could</b> <b>about</b> a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
500|$|At Kabul, {{the group}} was {{accommodated}} as state guests at the Emir's palace at Bagh-e Babur. Despite the comfort and the welcome, it was soon clear {{that they were all}} but confined. Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to requests for an audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the time to find out as much as he <b>could</b> <b>about</b> the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt as much as he <b>could</b> <b>about</b> his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E
