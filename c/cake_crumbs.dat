Karkade which was not pH-controlled, caused a real reduction in cake volume, cake specific volume, and <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> pH, which increased with increasing concentration of karkade.

Physical tests were used to study the effect of karkade on wheat flour properties. Karkade had a little effect on flour properties such as volume sedimentation, alkaline water retention capacity, and amylograph peak viscosity. The unsatisfactory use of karkade in chocolate cakes is attributable at least in part to organic acids in karkade which lower the pH value of <b>cake</b> <b>crumb.</b> With the pH value of <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> controlled to the optimum level, karkade powder at up to 5 % level of supplementation can be used in the production of chocolate cakes...|$|R

40|$|Pound cake, {{a common}} European cake type, is {{prepared}} from equal portions of flour, sugar, fat and eggs. During baking, both starch and egg components form a gel. This results in water binding and structure setting. Temperature gradients during conventional pound cake batter baking cause structure setting {{to take place}} at different times in {{different regions of the}} batter. As a result, <b>crumb</b> of conventional <b>cake</b> is heterogeneous in terms of moisture content and starch and protein properties. During storage, <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> firms through mechanisms that, when this work started, were still poorly understood. Still, most authors agreed that crumb to crust moisture migration has a large impact on crumb firming. We here set out to study the mechanisms by which crumb firming occurs. In a first experimental chapter, model systems of different complexities, i. e. flour-water, flour-sugar-water, egg-water, egg-sugar-water and flour-egg-sugar-water models, were analyzed by proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide a basis for studying proton mobility in pound <b>cake</b> and its <b>crumb.</b> Crumb proton populations were assigned to (A) non-exchanging CH protons of crystalline starch, proteins and crystalline fat, (B) and (C) non-exchanging CH protons of amorphous starch and gluten, which are in little contact with water, (D) exchanging protons of water, starch, gluten, egg proteins and sugar and (E) protons of lipids from margarine and egg yolk. In a next chapter, electrical resistance (ER) heating was used to produce cakes with minimal moisture gradients. In the further experimental work, this technique was applied to study processes other than moisture migration during storage of cakes. The baking process in an electrical resistance oven (ERO) was first compared with that in a conventional oven. In an ERO, the structure setting of cakes, which is the result of both starch and egg gel formation, progressively and uniformly takes place throughout the entire cake batter and ultimately results in homogeneous <b>cake</b> <b>crumb.</b> For conventional <b>cakes,</b> a batter moisture content of 26. 9 % was sufficient to gelatinize all starch in the center crumb. More moisture evaporation during baking in the ERO resulted in the need to increase the batter moisture content to 30. 0 % to allow all starch to gelatinize in these cakes (further referred to as ERO cakes). Minimal temperature gradients during baking in the ERO resulted in cakes with minimal moisture gradients. Furthermore, starch gelatinization and protein network formation by covalent linkage formation occurred in a similar way during both conventional and ERO baking. All in all, ERO baking allows producing homogeneous cake samples, with starch and protein properties {{similar to those of the}} center of conventional cakes. Only in the outer crumb layer, i. e. at a distance of up to 1 cm from the side walls in the ERO, starch and protein properties may be slightly different because of the small temperature gradient close to the surface. Moisture migration from crumb to crust contributes to firmingof <b>crumb</b> of conventional <b>cakes</b> and evidently not to that of ERO cakes. DSC and 1 H NMR measurements showed that the contribution of amylopectin retrogradation to crumb firming was rather small but significant in both cake types. To further study the importance of amylopectin retrogradation for pound <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> firming, amylases were included in the recipe. The texture of the resultant ERO cakes was monitored during storage. First, activity of amylases with varying modes of action, i. e. maltogenic, maltotetraose forming and endo-amylases, was measured in different sucrose concentrations and at different temperatures. To work properly during cake baking, the amylases should be active at high temperature (85 &# 176;C) and in high sucrose concentrations. Our results showed that the maltotetraose forming amylase was the least sensitive to both high temperature and high sucrose concentrations. Based on the results, different amylases with varying working mechanisms, i. e. two maltogenic amylases, an endo-amylase and a maltotetraose forming amylase, were selected for cake making and enzyme dosages appropriate for cake making were determined based on dose-response curves for cake volume. In the last part of this study, the amylases selected in the previous chapter were added to the recipe of ERO cakes in doses determined as described above. The crumb texture evolution of these cakes during storage was monitored and related to changes in amylopectin retrogradation and proton mobility. The impact of amylases on cake firming during storage depends on their mode of action and the effects on <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> firming resemble those found for bread crumb firming. Since starch in cake batter is much more diluted than in bread dough, and because of the high levels of sugar in cake batter, it is hypothesized that starch in pound cake is present in more or less intact swollen granules, surrounded by a limited amount of leached amylose, and embedded in a protein network. Exo-amylases limit crystallization of the side chains of amylopectin inside the granular structures. In contrast, endo-amylases had only a limited impact on amylopectin retrogradation. The anti-firming effect of exo-amylases was more pronounced than that of endo-amylases in line with what is known for bread systems. All in all, we conclude that some exo-amylases are effective anti-firming agents in cake. Their anti-firming properties very likely result from inhibition of amylopectin retrogradation. Although amylopectin retrogradation was reduced to a great extent in cakes baked with (some) amylases, crumb firming of these cakes was much less affected. Therefore, we conclude that the firming of ERO cakes during storage is also influenced by processes other than amylopectin retrogradation. In conclusion, comparison of the changes in crumb properties of conventional and ERO cakes during storage allowed putting forward a crumb firming mechanism maintaining that crumb to crust moisture migration is the dominant and amylopectin retrogradation is only a minor factor in <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> firming. Further work will be needed to unravel the role of other components such as amylose, protein and lipids in <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> firming during storage. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} temperature and moisture gradients on starch gelatinization and egg denaturation, and on protein extractabilities during cake baking. Differences in crumb structure in the center, top, and bottom zones of cake as measured with X-ray microfocus-computed tomography were successfully related to the moment at which starch gelatinized and protein aggregated during baking, which stiffened the cell walls. The temperature in {{the top and bottom}} zones of cake increased faster than {{in the center of the}} cake due to facilitated heat transfer. This resulted in lower water availability in top and bottom zones, leading to incomplete gelatinization of starch after baking in these zones. In the top zone, extended starch gelatinization and protein polymerization led to later cell wall formation, resulting in a broader cell size distribution. The bottom zone of cake reached the highest temperatures during baking with more substantial starch gelatinization and egg denaturation within the first 25 min of baking. During the final 20 min of baking, little if any change in gelatinization enthalpy and protein extractability was found due to the very low water availability in this region. The bottom zone of the crumb showed a broader cell wall size distribution, which was associated with more collapse.

40|$|Storage {{of shell}} eggs for 28 days at 6 or 23 C {{converts}} ovalbumin (which represents over 50 % of egg white protein) into its more thermostable intermediate and S-ovalbumin forms. Their increased thermostability {{causes them to}} expose their sulfhydryl groups only at higher temperatures than does ovalbumin itself. During pound cake baking, the loss in protein extractability under non-reducing conditions (further taken {{as a measure of}} protein network formation) occurred later when egg white from stored eggs rather than from fresh eggs was used. The incorporation of the more thermostable forms of ovalbumin (i. e. intermediate and S-ovalbumin) in the protein network occurred later than did that of ovalbumin. The moment at which ovalbumin denatures determines when the largest decrease in overall protein extractability occurs, which points to ovalbumin having a key role in protein network formation during cake baking. However, {{at the end of the}} process, the overall baking induced loss of protein extractability was similar when egg white from either fresh or from stored eggs was used. Rapid Visco Analyser measurements showed that this delay in protein network formation impacts cake batter viscosity.

40|$|An early {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if a high ratio cake, normally made with soft wheat flour, could be made from a composite of two Nebraska agricultural products, hard red winter wheat and grain sorghum flours. Initial results indicated that when a composite flour was used, the quality decreased with losses in both volume and crumb quality. This study, therefore, was directed toward identifying the component(s) responsible for these changes. Soft wheat and sorghum flours then were fractionated into their basic components and the sorghum fractions (lipids, water-solubles and starch) used to systematically replace the corresponding wheat fractions in a model high ratio cake system. ^ The sorghum lipids did not display the same functionality as did wheat lipids. The resulting cake had a greatly decreased volume and an inferior crumb structure. It was hypothesized that the low levels of glycolipids found in sorghum, as compared to wheat might explain this apparent lack of functionality. ^ Sorghum water-solubles had no apparent detrimental effects on the volume of the cakes and only a slight decrease in the quality of the crumb. ^ When sorghum starch replaced wheat starch, both the volume and the texture of the resulting cake were markedly inferior. Examination of the baked crumb revealed that most of the sorghum starch still displayed birefringence and therefore was not gelatinized. ^ Replacing sucrose in the sorghum starch formula with dextrose, resulted in a cake with a volume and texture nearly equal to that of the control. Examination of the <b>cake</b> <b>crumb</b> revealed that most of the sorghum starch had lost birefringence, suggesting that the starch had gelatinized.

40|$|Oat {{and rice}} bran {{were treated with}} {{different}} levels (0, 70 and 700 ppm) of an endoxylanase enzyme and added to cakes on 30 % flour weight basis. The water binding and holding capacity of brans were decreased while their soluble dietary fiber content was increased.

No differences were observed in the batter's specific gravity and the <b>cake</b> <b>crumb's</b> moisture content and Browning Index (BI). The level of endoxylanase treatment did not alter significantly (P < 0. 05) the functional properties of the brans and the quality characteristics of the cakes probably because the treatment time (30 min) was too short to indicate a significant effect. The optimum cake characteristics were obtained when oat bran treated with 70 ppm endoxylanase was used. Overall, endoxylanase treated brans could be incorporated into cakes and improve their nutritional and quality characteristics. Industrial relevance: The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of the enzyme (xylanase) treatment of 2 commonly used cereal brans (oat and rice) in order to develop a functional bakery product. By using cereal bran one can upgrade agricultural products and by-products for use as food ingredients without any additional cost. Furthermore, the treatment of raw cereal brans with xylanase alters the composition and functional properties of brans, influencing the characteristics of the final product as well. Endoxylanase treated brans were found to have improved functional properties that are essential for a successful incorporation, as well as higher nutritional value. The results of the study show the potential of using enzymes to modify underutilized sources of raw materials that can be properly incorporated in baked goods, improving their nutritional value and quality characteristics.

However, the specific role of S-ovalbumin on pound cake batter and product crumb properties is not clear. We here investigated the impact of S-ovalbumin on pound cake baking and on cake quality. To obtain egg white with different levels of S-ovalbumin, fresh eggs were stored for 28 days at 6 °C and at 23 °C. Batters were made with different combinations of egg white from fresh and stored eggs and egg yolk. Batter viscosity and enthalpy changes during heating were evaluated with the Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Volume and texture of the resulting pound cakes were determined. Both DSC profiles and RVA viscosity profiles of the batters were significantly impacted by the level of S-ovalbumin which was higher after storage at 23 °C. With higher levels of S-ovalbumin, egg denaturation in the batter takes place at higher temperatures (from 86 °C to 90 °C in excess of water) and the viscosity {{at the end of}} the RVA profile was lower (from 21 Pa. s to 14 Pa. s). <b>Cake</b> volume and <b>crumb</b> hardness were not impacted by the S-ovalbumin level but cakes baked with egg white enriched in S-ovalbumin had a lower crumb springiness (from 86 % to 83 %) and cohesiveness (from 65 % to 61 %).

There were significant differences between the Dieters and Non-dieters in their Early Family Eating Behavior Construct scores (with a mean of 3. 052083 ± 1. 45363 for the Dieters) and for the Non-dieters, a mean of (1. 555556 ±. 9466031) and a [t of 7. 8619 and a p-value of 0. 0000] for the differences between the two groups. A Multiple Regression with Compensation as the dependent variable and Restraint, BMI and group as the independent variables was a significant finding for the use of compensation behaviors as measured by the compensation construct and differential use by the two groups [t of - 1. 97 and p-value of 0. 000]. A Multiple Regression with BMI scores as the dependent variable and group, Restraint, Hunger for the Next meal, Sweet taste ratings, Compensator scores, Early family Eating Behaviors, Diet to Avoid Gaining Weight and ‘I wish I weighed less’ as the independent variables showed significance for the EFEB construct [t of 6. 18 p-value of 0. 00] and ‘I wish I weighed less’ [t of 3. 44 and p-value of 0. 0001]. BMI was significantly associated with our participants’ class in college [f of 25. 03 and p-value of 0. 000] their current Age [f of 14. 94 and p-value of 0. 0002] and BMI was significant for the number of times our participants lost weight, a dichotomous component on the Early Family Eating Behavior Construct where a score of three weight loss attempts or more scored a 1 and two or fewer weight loss attempts was scored a 0 [f of 16. 93 and a p-value of 0. 0001]. Implications: It was an important finding that a healthy BMI was achieved and maintained by 101 of the 159 { 50 were Dieters and 51 were Non-dieters} students in our study. We also found that eating behavior on the college campus today included a focus on ‘watching what they ate in order not to gain weight’ (Nichter, Ritenbaugh, Nichter, Vuckovic, Aicken, 1995) as well as dieting and non-dieting behaviors. Dieting, historically, was believed to be equivalent to Restrained Eating by Polivy and Herman (Herman, Polivy, 1975; Lowe, Foster, Kerzhnerman, Swain, Wadden, 2001 p 254)) but there is now debate as to whether Dieting and Restrained Dieting do not reflect the same eating behaviors in those Non-obese, with BMI’s below 30 (Lowe, Doshi, Katteran, Feig, 2013, p 1). It is a positive outcome, we believe, that the 63 {Non-dieters} do not to ‘diet’ for weight loss, but our results also indicate that an educational intervention teaching the utilization of hunger and satiety sensations to those ‘chronically dieting’ (46) students with BMI’s outside the normal range is still necessary on the University campus...|$|R
