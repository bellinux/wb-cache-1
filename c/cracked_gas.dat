40|$|It is the {{consensus}} that sapropelic matter generated oil initially, subsequently, the oil <b>cracked</b> into <b>gas</b> {{in the process}} of hydrocarbon generation evolution; however, there exist a dispute considering how much gas is generated directly by kerogen as well as how to identify it. The experimental samples are low mature sapropelic shale from the Xiamaling Formation in North China; the experimental devices are high-temperature and high pressured golden tube system and normal autoclave thermal simulation; gas generation simulation experiments of original kerogen, residual kerogen and oil from the same shale are developed. It is concluded that: (1) the gas generated from kerogen directly accounts for about 20 % after the oil generation peak period. The main gas generating stage is from 422  °C to 566  °C (RO =  1. 3 %– 2. 5 %), and the amount produces 85. 5 %. (2) The value of ln (C 1 /C 2) and ln (C 2 /C 3) increase with the growth of evolution degree for both kerogen <b>cracking</b> <b>gas</b> and oil <b>cracking</b> <b>gas.</b> However, at over-mature period, the value of ln (C 2 /C 3) increases for the kerogen <b>cracking</b> <b>gas</b> while the value for oil <b>cracking</b> <b>gas</b> remains constant, and the value of ln (C 1 /C 2) at low heating rate is greater than that at a high heating rate. (3) The new oil <b>cracking</b> <b>gas</b> discrimination chart is established whilst taking into considering the evolution degree.

40|$|Based on {{quantitative}} {{modeling and}} experimental data on n-tetracosane cracking to generate gaseous hydrocarbons in a confined system, we calculated the generation kinetics and carbon isotope kinetics of methane, ethane and propane and determined the main controlling factors influencing the variation of delta C- 13 (2) and delta C- 13 (3). The carbon isotope of gaseous hydrocarbons from n-C- 24 <b>cracking</b> to <b>gas</b> {{are comparable to}} those from crude oil reported recently, {{and they can be}} used to investigate the geochemical characteristics of crude oil <b>cracking</b> to <b>gas</b> under geological conditions. The geological model Of n-C- 24 cracking suggests it is stable at 150 - 160 degrees C and its cracking temperature ranges from 180 to 200 degrees C, consistent with geological models of crude oil cracking currently reported. With increasing degree of thermal stress, the changes in delta C- 13 (2) and delta C- 13 (3) are larger than that of delta C- 13 (1). It is shown that isotope accumulation controlled by the recharging history of a reservoir has a considerable impact on the carbon isotope distribution of natural gas. Compared to that of cumulative gas, the carbon isotope ratio of partly accumulation gas is heavier and influences the fractionation of the delta C- 13 (2) and delta C- 13 (3) curves to a greater extent.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the application of}} Fischer Tropsch biowaxes as a feedstock in a pilot-scale hydroprocessing unit at operating conditions very similar to industrial size hydrotreating plants of traditional refineries. The project focus on a future coprocessing of biowax/gasoil blends due to produce bio-products derived from lignocellulosic biomass: <b>crack</b> <b>gases,</b> naphtha, kerosene, diesel and a residual product. Hydro-processing plants operating at mild cracking conditions support the production of high amounts in middle distillates at reduced coke formation. Premium bio-diesel and bio-kerosene with excellent cold flow properties are the main objective of the investigations. Various test runs with different hydrotreating catalysts have been conducted due to {{determine the influence of}} waxy feedstock on catalyst behavior and product distribution. Depending on the catalyst selected, the fixed bed reactor streamed by hydrogen operates under specified cracking condition defined by the following parameters: reactor temperature, hydrogen pressure and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). Test runs with selected catalysts - isodewaxing (IDW), hydro-desulphurization (HDS) and the catalytic deparaffination (CDP) catalyst - have been executed at constant process conditions in order to compare the product spectrum and properties of product groups. Highest amounts of bio-diesel and bio-kerosene with excellent cold flow properties can be obtained with the IDW catalyst. This NiW- based catalyst with special additives generates cleaved and reshaped molecular fragments via skeletal isomerisation increasing the isoparaffin content of naphtha and middle distillates. Further investigations with this catalyst type have been executed due to determine the catalyst aging effect in a separate long term test run. The loss of cracking severity during operation of the catalyst can be observed by a steady decline in conversion. Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and diolefines in the bio-feedstock support the formation of a coke layer on the catalyst surface resulting in reinforced deactivation. As the consequence naphtha and finally the <b>crack</b> <b>gases</b> and the kerosene fraction are shifted to higher molecular fragments increasing the diesel and residue yield. Physicochemical properties of the product groups obtained during the test run vary and especially the cold flow properties from the diesel and kerosene fraction degrade significant. Balancing the conversion decline of the catalyst in operation can be realized by increasing the reactor temperature and the hydrogen pressure, but the effect is time limited. </p...|$|R
