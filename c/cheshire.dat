5|$|There are 20 castles in {{the county}} of <b>Cheshire</b> in North West England. <b>Cheshire</b> {{is one of the}} {{historic}} counties of England and its historic boundaries are different from the modern county lines. Some castles that were formerly in <b>Cheshire</b> are now in Greater Manchester. In addition, Warrington Castle is historically a part of Lancashire but is within the current boundaries of <b>Cheshire.</b> Before the Norman conquest of England began in 1066, defensive sites in England were communal, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs built as a defence against the Danes. Castles were popularised in England by the Normans– although a few sites in the south-east pre-dating the Norman conquest– and were owned by the feudal lords. The primary purpose of a castle was military: {{to be used as a}} base of operations and to control the surrounding areas. A castle was considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area, and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor.|$|E

Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows.

By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
