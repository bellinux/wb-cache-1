5|$|During the Second World War Dahl was a {{pilot in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the {{subsequent}} injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C.S. Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use {{in an article in}} The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the <b>Champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight <b>Champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E
