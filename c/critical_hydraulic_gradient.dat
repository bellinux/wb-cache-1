40|$|Granular {{filters are}} used in {{embankment}} dams to prevent core materials from internal erosion, while draining seepage water to prevent saturation of the downstream embankment. Current filter design criteria based on particle size ratios are not valid for cohesive soils, which provide significant resistance to erosion due to cohesion. Relying on this, filters are designed for many dams using coarse gravels with pore sizes {{in the range of}} 5 - 10 mm. Performances of dams in field condition are reported satisfactory except when very large sizes gravels are used, leading to insufficient compaction of clay with gravel and the likely problem of reduced particle contact. The problem of 2 ̆ 7 crack 2 ̆ 7 is identified in the impervious core. Generally this type of cracking has not been a consideration at the design stage and thus subsequent failures are detected. To mitigate this, filter gradations are reduced to pore sizes between 0. 3 - 5 mm. The erosion of soils and performance of filters or dam structure in general all depend on the actual field condition existing in the core: intact or cracked. In the case of intact core, soil erosion is insignificant and filter gradations are much wider, however, those perform successfully. Where a crack develops in the core, the seepage pressure is large, erosion is significant (the eroded particles are in the range of 10 microns), and filter gradations are narrow. The proposed analytical models reveal that the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> is a key indicator in designing filters for cohesive dam cores. For a particular soil in an intact core, the required <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> for destabilization of soil particles is significantly high (around 1000) and thus filter gradations are wider. In a cracked core, however, the seepage condition can be quite severe, the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> is comparatively small (around 100), and the required filter gradations are thus narrower. The predicted results are verified by experimental modeling and also by comparing them with the results of previously proposed models. Experimental investigations have been carried out using compacted clay with a central pinhole representing a crack. Both the analytical and experimental results show that the effective cohesion (C) in intact core and the critical shear stress (Tc) in cracked core are the key governing factors respectively in evaluating the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient.</b> Filter properties, such as pore sizes, also have a significant influence. In addition, the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> varies with effective stresses due to the weight of overlying layers. When filter pores are small, there is potential for the filters to become clogged, since porosity and subsequent permeability are too low. Clogging is a specific characteristic of interface of base and filters where filter pores are blocked by eroded base particles. This leads to improper drainage, which is responsible for high pore pressures in the core thus promoting failure of the dam. Another aspect of this thesis is to investigate clogging in granular filters due to the flow of clay slurry generated from crack walls. According to laboratory tests, clogged filters are identified based on the gradual decrease in flowrate and permeability over 5 hours of testing period, without attaining a constant value. The experimental results indicate that the uniformity coefficient, porosity and subsequent permeability of filters are the main factors in evaluating clogging...|$|E

40|$|Suction {{caissons}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} bottom founded and floating offshore applications, in shallow and deep waters. The present research focuses on the analysis of suction-assisted installation in sand. Suction pressure measurements from a number of field projects and laboratory centrifuge tests in sandy soils led to find that, in 70 % of the studied cases, the critical suction pressure is underestimated by current design methods. The main goal of the present thesis is to improve the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. More reliable assessment of the critical suction pressure will result in more cost-effective foundations. Five hypotheses were introduced as possible driving mechanisms of the attainment of critical suction: H 1 : Change in void ratio (?e) and permeability (?k) of the sand plug. H 2 : Soil arching caused by friction at the inner caisson wall. H 3 : Uplifted soil particles of the plug surface at the final phase of installation. H 4 : Soil internal stability (internal rearrangement of soil particles). H 5 : Transient versus steady-state flow pattern during installation in sand. A physical model was used to investigate the validity of hypotheses H 1 through H 4, namely the Laboratory Upward Flow Test (LUFT). LUFT is a normal ground gravity (1 g) experiment based on ASTM standards for measuring the permeability of granular soils, using a constant head method. It constitutes a simplification of the suction caisson installation process. Twenty five LUFT experiments were performed. An experimental parametric study was carried out by varying: relative density (Dr), sample gradation (sand grain size, coefficients of uniformity (Cu) and curvature (Cc)), sample height over sample diameter or aspect ratio (?) and hydraulic head difference (?h). The term “experimental critical hydraulic gradient” was introduced in order to express the mean value of the hydraulic gradient along the sample when the critical condition occurs. It is proven that the assumption of steady-state conditions during suction-assisted caisson installation in sand (hypothesis H 5) is valid, based on Finite Element (FE) analyses. The experimental approach of the hypotheses H 1 though H 4 is well based. It is concluded that the aspect ratio (?) and the coefficient of uniformity (Cu) influence the experimental <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient.</b> The hypotheses which are linked to those two parameters are H 2 and H 4. Hypotheses H 1 and H 3 do not affect the experimental <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient,</b> based on LUFT results. Experimental <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> values 15 % higher than the “theoretical critical hydraulic gradient” were observed for non-uniform samples with ? of 1. 0 and 1. 5 (most common in practice). This can be explained by presence of fine particles in between the coarser ones, increasing the soil structure stability that results in higher pressure differences. Higher experimental <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> values are obtained with greater ? in dense samples. Interface (soil-wall) shear resistance increases with sample height and greater seepage forces can be applied before failure occurs. The observed failure mechanism for uniform samples is piping. Absence of finer particles facilitates pipe creation through the soil structure. Non-uniform samples with ? > 0. 5 fail with sample separation, which is thought to be a shear failure mechanism. Voids between coarse particles are obstructed by finer ones and water cannot escape through. The internal soil resistance is higher than the shear resistance at the wall and shear failure occurs.

A stress-controlled apparatus was designed to investigate the piping behavior of cohesionless soil under upward flow condition. The components of the new apparatus included a loading chamber, a vertical and confining loading system, an upstream water supply device, a soil-water separating system, and a water collecting system. The loading chamber provides space for a soil specimen setting and loading. The combination of a vertical and a confining loading system was designed to apply complex stresses to a soil specimen. Under the stresses, the specimen was then eroded by the gradually increasing hydraulic head supplied by the water supply system. The eroded particle and spilling water were collected and detected by the soil-water separating system and the water collecting system. A series of experiments were carried out using the new apparatus. Results demonstrated the repeatability experiments and usefulness of the apparatus.

40|$|Internal erosion in soil can be {{initiated}} by suffusion, which involves selective erosion of fine particles within the matrix of coarse soil particles under seepage flow. Suffusion in an internally unstable soil will {{occur when the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> exceeds a certain critical value. Often the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> are found using conventional 1 -D seepage tests. The core wall and filters in an earth dam are however typically under complex shear stress states. As internal erosion propagates backward in an earth dam, the soil pipe may collapse and the dam failure process may then evolve into an overtopping process. Most landslide dams fail by overtopping directly. The erodibility of soils, therefore, also {{plays an important role}} in evaluating the development of breaching of dams. The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate the internal erosion process under complex stress states, characterize the erodibility of soils, and model the dam breaching process. A stress-controlled erosion apparatus was developed to investigate the initiation and development of internal erosion under complex stress states and to study the mechanical response of soil to internal erosion. It allows independent control of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> and stress state. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> is controlled using a water-head control method. The eroded soil and the outflow rate are measured using a soil collection system and a water collection system, respectively. Extensive internal erosion tests were conducted on a gap-graded soil under complex stress states following three stress paths: isotropic, drained triaxial compression and triaxial extension stress paths. After loss of a significant amount of fine particles in the soil, the original dilative stress-strain behaviour changes to be contractive one and the shear strength decreases. The entire internal erosion process can be divided into four phases: stable, initiation, development, and failure. Accordingly, three critical gradients named initiation, skeleton-deformation, and failure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> can be defined. The initiation <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> is mainly controlled by the pore structure of the soil. The initiation <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> under compression stress conditions generally increase with the shear stress ratio first and then decrease when the soil approaches shear failure. The skeleton-deformation <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> is associated with buckling of the strong force chains within the soil due to the loss of lateral support by the fine particles. It is much larger under isotropic stress conditions than under compression or extension stress conditions. The failure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> depends on the initial stress state and soil shear strength. A theoretical equation is derived to determine the failure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient.</b> The geometric control variables for internal stability of different types of soil were studied based on physical understanding of microstructures of these soils. Modified geometric criteria for these types of soil were developed using such control variables based on information from an internal-stability test dataset. Field jet index tests were conducted at 27 locations on two landslide dams formed during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake to investigate the erodibility of fresh landslide deposits before the deposits were disturbed. The bulk density increases and the coefficient of erodibility decreases with the depth of deposition. The main factors that control soil erodibility are found to be grain-size distribution, void ratio, fines content, and plasticity index. Particularly, the coefficient of erodibility decreases exponentially with the degree of compaction. Two empirical equations are developed for estimating the coefficient of erodibility and critical erosive shear stress of the fresh landslide deposits based on their basic soil properties. A physically-based breach model considering the variations in soil erodibility along depth is developed to simulate the breaching process of earth dams and landslide dams. The breach evolution, erosion rate, and outflow hydrograph can be predicted. A spreadsheet is developed to numerically implement the model. The erosion processes of Tangjiashan Landslide Dam and Xiaogangjian Landslide Dam induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake are analyzed.

A new energy analysis of tests is developed, linking the expended power to the erosion rate. This method permits to avoid the effect of specimen height...|$|E
30|$|A first {{event of}} this kind had been {{observed}} in 2008 and was traced back to vibrations caused by cavitational effects in an HPP valve (Mutschler and Triantafyllidis 2009). It was thought that these vibrations could have reduced the shear strength of the clayey fillings and the <b>critical</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient.</b> But as such events repeatedly appeared also seasonal effects were discussed besides dynamic triggers. These seasonal effects {{can be described as}} a cyclic alternation of sedimentation and erosion of the clayey cavity fillings. With rising water level, these deposits become inundated, pressurized by a local hydraulic gradient, and—after a continuous flow path has formed—washed out by retrograde erosion. Cyclic changes of the fillings’ consistency and shear strength may also play a role even, though a complete dryout of the karst is not expected. The understanding is that the occurrence of hydraulic breakthroughs could be triggered either by sudden pressure changes or dynamic events.|$|E

For the kaolinite crust, the flux q gradually increased with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> i, and reached its peak at different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> ranging from 80 to 100 and ended as a down-ward curve. For consolidated crusts at 70 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> of valid region of Darcy's a law, the q-i relationobtained by being tested at the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> below 70 was expressed as a straight line which had the saturated hydraulic conductivity of k= 6. 80 × 10 ^ cm/s. For the red soil crust, all experimental data points of q and i were approximately on a straight line at the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> below 30, and thus k= 2. 50 × 10 ^ cm/s was given...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> in regions of an earth dam where fine grained soils are inadequately filtered can sometimes lead to internal erosion and piping failure. This paper investigates the stochastic nature of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> through two different earth dam cross-sections both with simple drains. In particular, {{the magnitude and}} location of maximum <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> are studied via Monte Carlo simulation to derive their probability distributions and assess their variability. These results {{can be used to}} guide designers with respect to minimizing the risk of internal erosion in the presence of uncertain soil permeability. The effect that the stochastic nature of the permeability field has on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> distribution is compared to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> obtained in the deterministic case. This enables an evaluation of the importance of considering permeability randomness in the design process. 1...|$|R
50|$|As {{seen in the}} equation, q/W and θ {{carry the}} same units and are {{directly}} related to one another by means of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> i. At a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1.0, they are numerically identical. At all other values of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> they are not equal. Also note that the system should be saturated and flow must be laminar in order to use transmissivity. When in doubt, it is usually best to use flow rate per unit width.|$|R
