However, it is unclear whether these predictive advantages stem from (a) use of observers who have a frame of reference more closely aligned with the <b>criterion</b> (narrower <b>scope)</b> or (b) observers having greater accuracy than targets themselves (clearer lens). In a primary study of 291 raters of 97 targets, we found predictive advantages even when observers were personal acquaintances who knew targets only outside of the work context. Integrating these findings with previous meta-analyses showed that colleagues unique perspectives did not predict incrementally beyond commonly held trait perceptions across all raters (except for Openness) and that self-raters who overestimate their Agreeableness and Conscientiousness perform worse on the job. Broadly, our results suggest that observers have clearer lenses for viewing targets personality traits, and we discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for studying and measuring personality...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe growing {{concerns}} of power efficiency, silicon reliability and performance scalability motivate {{research in the}} area of adaptive embedded systems, i. e. systems endowed with decisional capacity, capable of online decision making so as to meet certain performance <b>criteria.</b> The <b>scope</b> of possible adaptation strategies is subject to the targeted architecture specifics, and may range from simple scenario-driven frequency/voltage scaling to rather complex heuristic-driven algorithm selection. This paper advocates the design of distributed memory homogeneous multiprocessor systems as a suitable template for best exploiting adaptation features, thereby tackling the aforementioned challenges. The proposed solution lies in the combined use of a typical application processor for global orchestration along with such an adaptive multiprocessor core for the handling of data-intensive computation. This paper describes an exploratory homogeneous multiprocessor template designed from the ground up for scalability and adaptation. The proposed contributions aim at increasing architecture efficiency through smart distributed control of architectural parameters such as frequency, and enhanced techniques for load balancing such as task migration and dynamic multithreading...|$|R
40|$|In ferroelectroelastic ceramics, {{the process}} of {{fracture}} is accompanied by significant inelastic deformation due to domain switching. This leads to an apparent toughening of the material, which is known as R-curve behavior. A promising approach to predict R-curves is based on one parameter fracture <b>criteria.</b> The <b>scope</b> {{of this paper is}} the examination of the physical validity of these criteria for realistic material behavior. Besides a general discussion of the problem, fracture of the lead zirconate titanate ceramic PIC 151 is examined. Thereby, restriction is made to purely mechanical material behavior. The results indicate that the usage of one parameter fracture criteria is questionable. This is due to a conflict between the length scale of the zone wherein the asymptotic crack tip singu larity dominates in the field solution of the continuum model and the length scale associated with the fracture process zone. It is concluded that an incorporation of the fracture process into the used fracture mechanics model is necessary to capture transient fracture of ferroelectroelastic ceramics properly...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in developing natural language understanding lies in semantic representation and interpretation (SRI). Semantic representation concerns how elements of sentences represent semantic constituents and what kind of relationships semantic constituents are. Semantic interpretation concerns how to interpret these constituents and relationships semantically. The field of semantic representation and interpretation has witnessed a number of significant advances in the past years. The traditional methods include first-order predicate calculus (FOPC), case frames and grammars, and logical form (LF). Recently, unified natural language (UNL), flat and deep ABox, ontologies, and latent semantic acquisition (LSA) have been developed for the shared formal conceptualizations of particular domains. These methods, as specifications of the concepts in a given field, and of the relationships among those concepts, provide insight into the nature of information produced by that field and are an essential ingredient for any attempts to arrive at a shared understanding of concepts in a field. However, some design issues must be considered to achieve a good SRI. For this reason, this lecture introduces four evaluation <b>criteria</b> – <b>scope</b> portability, accuracy, facility, and efficiency (SAFE). After comparing previous SRI techniques under SAFE, we find several methods are deficient in scop...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{measuring}} air leakage {{is to use}} a single blower door to pressurize and/or depressurize the test unit. In detached housing, the test unit is the entire home and the single blower door measures air leakage to the outside. In attached housing, this 'single unit', 'total', or 'solo' test method measures both the air leakage between adjacent units through common surfaces as well air leakage to the outside. Measuring and minimizing this total leakage is recommended to avoid indoor air quality issues between units, reduce energy losses to the outside, reduce pressure differentials between units, and control stack effect. However, two significant limitations of the total leakage measurement in attached housing are: for retrofit work, if total leakage is assumed to be all to the outside, the energy benefits of air sealing can be significantly over predicted; for new construction, the total leakage values may result in failing to meet an energy-based house tightness program <b>criterion.</b> The <b>scope</b> of this research is to investigate an approach for developing a viable simplified algorithm that can be used by contractors to assess energy efficiency program qualification and/or compliance based upon solo test results...|$|R

The specimen workflow is strongly linked to curatorial processes which will impact on the prioritisation, selection and preparation of the specimens.

The data workflow includes the concept of three main categories of collection data: label data, curatorial data and supplementary data. It is shown that each category of data has its own properties which influence the timing of data capture within the workflow. Development of software has been carried out for the rapid capture of curatorial data, and optical character recognition (OCR) software is being used to increase the efficiency of capturing label data and supplementary data.

Author Kevin Holm-Hudson believes that [...] "progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics." [...] According to musicologists Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, Bill Martin and Edward Macan authored major books about prog rock while [...] "effectively accept the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics. ... they each do so largely unconsciously." [...] Academic John S. Cotner contests Macan's view that progressive rock cannot exist without the continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock. While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.
