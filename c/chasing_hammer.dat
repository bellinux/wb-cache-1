50|$|Thick wire, of 16-gauge and heavier, {{is harder}} to bend and {{requires}} more expert handling. Hammering wire with a plastic or rawhide mallet will harden wire without changing its shape. Hammering wire with a metal jeweler's hammer (<b>chasing</b> <b>hammer)</b> will harden and flatten wire.|$|E
50|$|Other useful tools used {{in making}} wire wrapped jewelry are nylon jaw pliers, a ruler, step jaw pliers, a pin vise to twist the wire, a <b>chasing</b> <b>hammer,</b> an anvil or bench block, a cup bur, loop closing or bent closing pliers and a jewelry making jig.|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{tools are}} used to work the metal. A [...] "liner" [...] is a steel tool/punch with a very thin, {{slightly}} rounded end, {{that is used to}} create the initial lines on the metal. The liner is hit on the end with a <b>chasing</b> <b>hammer,</b> pushing a thin line of metal into the pitch. The side facing up will consequently be the front of the piece. Once all the lines have been chased, the metal is then turned over on the pitch, and repouss√© technique is then applied, using other various steel punches/tools to push the metal so that it is raised {{on the front of the}} finished piece.|$|E

50|$|Vannini {{was highly}} skilled in metalwork. A Processional Cross he created in 1455 {{was made by}} taking sheets of silver that he <b>hammered,</b> <b>chased,</b> and gilded to create a design, then {{attached}} to a wooden core. Some of his other works reside at the Municipal Art Gallery of Ascoli Piceno. He died in Marche.|$|R
50|$|The {{treasure}} {{includes a}} pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with <b>chased</b> and <b>hammered</b> pastoral scenes in relief around the edge, four hemispherical bowls with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and frog engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of jewellery: a finger ring, a cameo, {{a pair of}} ear rings, several intaglios and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones. The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.|$|R
5000|$|Headsex {{contained}} {{their biggest}} hit, [...] "I Wanna Be a Hippy". The remix by Flamman & Abraxas {{was accompanied by}} a video featuring three youths with shaved heads, wearing Mokum T-shirts and carrying inflatable <b>hammers,</b> <b>chasing</b> a hippy on a bicycle around a park in Amsterdam. It reached number 1 in 12 different countries including Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, and number 6 in the UK in February 1996, which culminated in two performances on Top of the Pops in January and February of the same year.|$|R
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} the basse-taille enamel areas began by marking {{the outline of the}} design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a [...] "tracer". Then the interior area was worked with <b>chasing</b> tools, <b>hammering</b> and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used. Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way. After the enamel was added and fired the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|R

Then the interior area was worked, either with <b>chasing</b> tools, <b>hammering</b> and punching rather than cutting, or with chisels, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; for example in the Royal Gold Cup the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In the example illustrated with Luke's ox the lowest lobe shows tufts of grass formed by cutting deeper into the background. In many of the recessed areas further decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way. Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, perhaps including scraping off any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.|$|R
5000|$|On its {{original}} release, the film made little impact at the box-office and its press was mainly negative. This was partly {{because at the}} time the issue of paedophilia and child sexual abuse was a great taboo, rarely referred to or spoken about, and merely to produce a film dealing openly with the issue was deemed sordid and distasteful. Another hindrance to commercial success was that the film was far from easy to categorise, so it was difficult to market to any specific film audience demographic. In terms of genre it had elements of suspense, horror, courtroom drama and social commentary, but did not fit neatly into any general classification. In addition some of the publicity chosen for the film [...] - [...] such as a promotional poster with an image of armed police with tracker dogs, and the tagline [...] "A nightmare manhunt for maniac prowler!" [...] - [...] was misleading as it implied a fugitive-on-the-run <b>chase</b> thriller. <b>Hammer</b> Studios boss James Carreras later commented: [...] "Message pictures? I tried one [...] - [...] Never Take Sweets from a Stranger. Nobody bought it. I'm not an artist. I'm a businessman." [...] The film did garner some positive reviews, with Variety for example saying: [...] "Gwen Watford and Patrick Allen, as the distraught parents, and Alison Leggatt, as a wise, understanding grandmother, lead a cast which is directed with complete sensitivity by Cyril Frankel. Both Watford and Allen are completely credible while Leggatt, well-served by John Hunter's script, is outstanding. Aylmer, who doesn't utter a word throughout the film, gives a terrifying acute study of crumbling evil." [...] The film quickly disappeared from view, and for many years remained little-known and rarely screened. Indeed no indication can be found that it was ever shown on British television.|$|R
