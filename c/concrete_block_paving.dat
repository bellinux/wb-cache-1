40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>block</b> <b>paving</b> is a {{cost-effective}} road construction method suitable for medium to low traffic roads. However, this <b>concrete</b> <b>block</b> <b>paving</b> technique {{is yet to}} develop as a fully fledged road construction method. Literature review has shown {{that there are some}} contradictions among past findings on block shapes and laying patterns. However, field performance has not been evaluated in selecting the most suitable block shape and laying pattern. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the most effective block shape and laying pattern for roads with medium to low traffic. Under this study, concrete blocks were cast according to the specifications in predetermined shapes, and paving was done with different block shapes and patterns in a road that contains vehicular traffic with a high percentage of heavy trucks and buses. A selected 100 m road length was divided into 10 equal parts, and blocks were paved according to selected patterns and block shapes from a finite-element model (FEM) analysis of a previous study in each different section. Deflection was measured using the Benkelman beam deflectometer, and block displacement was measured using a vernier caliper. The most effective block shape and pattern were selected by comparing deflections and block displacement in each combination of block shape and patterns. The analysis of results shows that the most effective combination of variables for cement concrete block laying are the unistyle block shape, the stretcher and herring block pattern, and the zero or 90 ° block angle.

40|$|It is in {{the last}} five years that the {{stakeholders}} of <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> (CPBs) are awakening to engineer the CPBs in Sri Lanka. Although large scale production of CPBs has already flourished in Sri Lanka, their adherence with stringent standards (both Sri Lankan and International) remains dubious. This reluctance to meet the performance and durability criteria according to codes of practices, curtails the life span of <b>concrete</b> <b>block</b> <b>paved</b> roads to a greater extent. The scope of the present paper is limited to verifying whether the local <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> are made on par with international standards. Sample blocks were obtained from local CPB manufacturers and investigated. Though these blocks met the criteria in Sri Lankan Standard for CPBs for strength classes 2, 3, 4 roads, none of them met the compressive strength criteria for strength class 1 roads. Besides, tensile strength requirement specified in the BS EN 1338 : 2003 was met by none of the blocks tested. Since, Sri Lankan Standard is planned to incorporate splitting tensile strength as the dominant measure to assess <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> in the near future, this study also attempted to identify a mix proportion to meet the splitting tensile strength requirement specified in BS EN 1338 : 2003.

Therefore development of economical road construction methods is a high priority for a developing country like Sri Lanka. <b>Concrete</b> <b>block</b> <b>paving</b> is one of the predominant road construction method used in most of the developing counties due to economic adaptability and this has emerged as a cost effective road construction method suitable for certain local conditions.

As a result, there is a great need to develop knowledge and establish proper methods of block paving. Load spreading in <b>concrete</b> <b>block</b> <b>paving</b> roads is accomplished by interlocking actions. Because of that concrete blocks act as a major load spreading component in concrete block paved surfaces. Therefore the aim of this research is to evaluate the effective block shape and effective block laying pattern which can improve the interlocking action. This research was covered the real ground situation and the behavior and the effects of blocks due to traffic weights. Under this study, concrete blocks were cast according to the specifications in predetermined shapes and paving was done with different block shapes and patterns in a road which contains vehicular traffic about 30 CV/day.

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>Block</b> <b>Paving</b> (CBP), {{which is}} a {{predominant}} construction method used nowadays, {{is based on the}} ancient road construction technology “Stone Paving”. The use of CBP is a common sight in most of the developing countries due to its economic adaptability. Although it has emerged as a cost-effective paving material, it is yet being developed as a full-fledged construction technique. The aim of this research was to determine optimum dimensions for concrete blocks using a finite element model, evaluating the deflections and stresses in pavement with the application of loads. A three-dimensional finite element model was built to measure the elastic deflection basin with ANSYS finite element modelling software. The reason for developing a finite element model is, as the construction of concrete block pavements for experimenting is costly and challenging, a finite element model simulating the field conditions could be used to overcome these issues and perform further research. Previously developed finite element models and laboratory models were studied. The results obtained from the developed finite element model were verified with the deflection values obtained in a laboratory scaled model. Similar deflection basins could be observed for different load cases. Several block types were considered initially and block dimensions with best performance were identified. Based on those results a new block type which optimizes the performance was proposed carrying out finite element analysis. An alternate block type to the proposed block type was also analysed and it could only be recommended for non-traffic areas. In addition, the effects of wheel path on concrete block pavement in both longitudinal and transverse directions were considered to have an idea about the variation of stress and deflection at different locations of the pavement. Although no significant values were observed with the block orientation, closer the wheel path to the edges higher the stresses obtained...|$|E

The <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> were tested in terms of their strength and the characteristics of their microstructure by measuring compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength, and skid resistance. Field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier Transform Infra- Red(FTIR) analysis werecarried out on the <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> specimen. When 10 % of the natural aggregate was replaced with waste tyrerubber granules, there was no substantial difference in the compressive strength but the flexural and splitting tensile strength increased to a certain extent. When more than 20 % of waste tyrerubber granulesis incorporated in the <b>paving</b> <b>blocks,</b> the strength is acutely reduced even though there is a growth in ductility. The results proved that even after failure, the <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> did not shatter but still stayed imperforated.

At the same time it also provides sufficient strength or minimum required strength (30 MPa) in accordance to MA 20 for 60 mm thickness rectangular block to be used on pavement for vehicles of less than 3 tonnes gross weight...|$|R
40|$|<b>Paving</b> <b>block</b> {{pavement}} {{is already}} {{widely used in}} Indonesia. Materials made of <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> are easy to make and easy to implement. Currently the manufacture of <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> SNI 03 - 0691 - 1996 refers to a method that consists of a mixture of cement, sand/gravel: water. Our research uses bamboo pieces of waste material {{as a substitute for}} gravel. Comparison of the composition of the bamboo pieces that are used to dry conditions weighing 10 kg, 20 kg and 30 kg. Based on compressive strength testing performed at the age of 7, 14 and 28 days can be known ability <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> receives compressive strength. The research using bamboo fiber material at 28 days had compressive strength 171 kg/cm 2, 190 kg/cm 2, and 199 kg/cm 2. While using bamboo fiber material and fly ash at 28 days have compressive strength 231 kg / cm 2, 176 kg/cm 2, 252 kg/cm 2. Test results meet the quality of type C, D and the use of bamboo waste as aggregate paving can support green infrastructure in the future...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic {{companies}} worldwide produce {{large amounts}} of polishing tile waste, which are piled up {{in the open air}} or disposed of in landfills. These wastes have such characteristics that make them potential substitutes for cement and sand in the manufacturing of concrete products. This paper investigates the use of ceramic tile polishing waste as a partial substitute for cement and sand in the manufacturer of <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> A <b>concrete</b> mix design was defined and then the sand was replaced with wastes from three production lines (porcelain tile, porous tile and stoneware tile) of a Brazilian ceramic tile industry in the percentages of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 % and 30 %. Another group of concrete was produced with porcelain tile waste replacing the cement. The concretes were characterized using a slump test. <b>Paving</b> <b>blocks</b> were produced and subjected to compression strength, water absorption and porosity tests. Compression strength values were compared to Brazilian Standards for <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> A reduction in slump was observed for all concretes as the percentage of waste addition increased, in relation to the control concrete. The compression strength values were higher for concrete cured for 28 days, and all blocks met the standard requirement of 35 MPa for light vehicle traffic at a curing age of 7 days. The strength values obtained when the porcelain tile waste replaced sand were higher than when this waste replaced cement, and those values were even higher than the control concrete, and met the standard requirement of 50 MPa for heavy vehicle traffic. Water absorption values tended to decrease as sand was replaced by ceramic tile wastes, due to the filler effect. These results show {{that it is possible to}} replace 30 % of fine aggregate or 20 % of cement with ceramic tile wastes and produce <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> suitable for use in heavy vehicle traffic. Thus, this research demonstrates that the use of ceramic tile waste as a component of <b>concrete</b> for <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> manufacturing is technically feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{road network}} of Sri Lanka has been {{developing}} rapidly in recent years. Parallel {{to the expansion of}} the road network, most of the urban areas are also being upgraded with township development. Some of these developments follow a proper master plan, while there are others which do not pay attention to proper strategies. The attention paid for sustainable, law cost materials has been minimal. Hence, these unplanned developments are causing severe environmental issues such as global warming, heat island effect, lowering the ground water table, losing the natural appearance etc. Therefore, it is essential to invent new sustainable and low cost materials to counter balance the stated issues. This research is focused on developing a <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> using mud <b>concrete</b> as a replacement for existing artificial paving materials used in urban walkways along the road network and within recreation areas. The main aim of this research is to produce a mud <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> that can withstand the required strength according to the SLS standard, and which has a wet compressive strength of 15 N/mm 2. The suitability of the developed block is then evaluated for their thermal performance and skid resistance. The current research status is identified through a literature survey. An online questionnaire survey is carried out to identify public perceptions on pedestrian pavements and paving materials used in them. A field survey was carried out among the <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> manufacturers to identify the cement percentage used by them. This was then used to develop the mix-designs for the laboratory experimental work. In the laboratory, blocks are cast in three stages and are tested for four variables, viz: cement content, soil composition, moisture content and vibration time. Temperature measurements are taken of different pavement systems to evaluate their performance. The skid resistance of the block surfaces is measured using the Pendulum Skid Resistance Tester. Results have proven that the mud <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> is a good alternative to pedestrian walkways while reducing thermal impact on the surrounding environment...|$|R
40|$|Crumb rubber {{represents}} a potentially valuable resource {{as a replacement}} of fine aggregate in <b>concrete</b> <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> (CPBs). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of three curing conditions on compressive strength of crumb rubber CPBs. Four batches of crumb rubber CPBs where produced in a commercial plant with replacement of sand at 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % with crumb rubber by volume. Only 0 % and 10 % replacement of crumb rubber CPBs satisfied the 28 days compressive strength (30 MPa) for 60 mm thickness rectangular <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> to carry traffic load in accordance to Concrete Masonry Association of Australia (MA 20). In general, the natural weather cured gives better compressive strength than air cured and water cured at 182 days of age. In addition, high volume of daily production of CPBs makes natural weather curing to be more applicable and economic...|$|R
