IIMS provides Diploma, BTEC HNC and HND level courses by distance learning that are awarded by Pearson edexcel. The IIMS membership consists of marine <b>surveyors,</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>surveyors,</b> yacht and small craft surveyors and other professionals in the field. Suny Maritime College provides online survey classes in Cargo, Hull and Yacht and small craft.In Australia The Australasian Institute of Marine surveyors has the first accredited course under the Mar 13 training package which meets the requirements for AMSA Accreditation. The offer Certificate 4 to Diploma level qualifications.Lloyd's Maritime Academy offers a Diploma and MSc in Marine Surveying by distance learning since 1998 with the UK National Maritime Training Centre at the North Kent College in Gravesend and Middlesex University. Maritime Training Academy offers {{a large number of}} industry recognised vocational distance learning diplomas to students within the marine industry including ship surveying.|$|R
5000|$|NAMS {{certified}} surveyors {{are considered}} to be as highly qualified within their specific area as anyone else in the industry. They are fit to serve as consultants, special project directors, and educators. The amount of knowledge and experience required to become a NAMS-CMS in part explains their slow numeric growth over the last 45 years. The certification process begins when a member has “served as a professional marine surveyor for not less than five years,” [...] although provisions are made for those with less surveying experience when it is coupled with extensive industry experience in other capacities. Candidates for certification are then screened by NAMS governing bodies for professional ethics and reputation. Finally, they are examined for high competence in the portion of the industry they represent. NAMS surveyors work in one or more of three general disciplines: Hull and Machinery (commercial and large vessels), Yacht and Small Craft (which includes vessels of up to 300 feet in length), and <b>Cargo.</b> <b>Surveyors</b> often specialize further within these three categories, subdividing into NAMS Codes of Service. Demonstration of mastery over a NAMS Code of Service is the last step in the certification process. Once certified, NAMS Surveyors are required to earn 6 continuing education credit hours every year. Once certified, NAMS members are not to consult in areas in which they are not certified to work, but are not required to have errors and emissions insurance to protect their clients.|$|R
5000|$|A Marine {{surveyor}} (including [...] "Yacht & Small Craft Surveyor", [...] "Hull & Machinery Surveyor" [...] and/or [...] "Cargo Surveyor") is {{a person}} who conducts inspections, surveys or examinations of marine vessels to assess, monitor and report on their condition and the products on them, as well as inspects damage caused to both vessels and <b>cargo.</b> Marine <b>surveyors</b> also inspect equipment intended for new or existing vessels to ensure compliance with various standards or specifications. Marine surveys typically include the structure, machinery and equipment (navigational, safety, radio, etc.) and general condition of a vessel and/or cargo. It also includes judging materials on board and their condition. Because certifications and subsequently payments are processed only after the surveyor has expressed his or her satisfaction, a marine surveyor holds a prestigious position and is held with much regard in the shipbuilding industry. Marine Surveyors are highly qualified and technically sound and are usually selected after thorough evaluation procedures as vessels ranging from small ferries to enormous crude oil carriers and cruise liners are approved to sail into the high seas based purely on their judgement,competence and integrity.|$|R
