40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{strategy}} is proposed to predict physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration and degradability of nonionized, nonpolymeric organic chemicals.

This chapter proposes a strategy for using structural features of organic chemicals, structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including some recently developed <b>computerized</b> <b>methods)</b> and laboratory screening tests to predict the chemical fate of nonionized, nonpolymeric organic chemicals (figure 13 - 1).

System and method for controlling a virtual environment of a userUnited States 11,840,647Issued August 17, 2007 A method and a system for controlling a virtual environment of a user, e.g., a child is provided. In the virtual environment, users are able to interact with other users using messages. Each message is made up of one or more items contained in a dictionary. Information is transmitted, e.g., by e mail, to an agent, e.g., a parent. The transmitted information is information that may be used to authorize the agent to control the virtual environment of the user. The virtual environment of the user is controlled by setting a level of interaction at which the user is permitted to interact with others. The messages may include pre-written messages and messages composed by a user using items contained in the dictionary.

In the 1960s, a mechanism called the ecological inventory process was developed to document existing surrounding land conditions to help inform the analysis for the land in question. These mechanisms were computerized upon the advent of computers due to inefficiencies in the methods, such as the inability to overlay a large number of transparencies.|$|E

The recent proliferation of computer behavior-observation systems has provided observers with an efficient means for collecting direct behavior observational data (Kahng 2 ̆ 6 Iwata, 2000; Shapiro 2 ̆ 6 Kratochwill, 2000 a, 2000 b). Although <b>computerized</b> <b>methods</b> are less cumbersome than other recording methods (e. g., partial-interval form, narrative recording), it is not clear if <b>computerized</b> <b>methods</b> offer improvement by enhancing observational accuracy or reducing judgment bias that is generally initiated in applied settings (e. g. referral information; Arkes 2 ̆ 6 Harkness, 1980; O 2 ̆ 7 Reilly, Northcraft, 2 ̆ 6 Sabers, 1989). Undergraduate participants (N = 243) were trained to perform a 10 -minute observation using a computer observation program, partial interval form, narrative recording method, or a no-recording method. In addition, the participants were randomly given an internalizing, externalizing, or a non-specific psychopathology referral.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} the vertical stress on a coal seam at depth is important for mine design. Vertical stress calculation techniques presently available either are not sufficiently accurate or cannot handle complex surface topography. Therefore, the U. S.

Two input data sets are required: a digital elevation model containing topographic elevations and a coal seam file defining coal seam elevations at depth.

The <b>computerized</b> <b>method</b> was tested on a coal seam overlain by a complex topography where a vertical stress map encompassing several square miles was produced. Results show that depth mitigates the affects of surface topography, while the coal seam topography has a direct effect on the vertical stress.
