5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> drool {{and food}} particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E

50|$|Fly Buys points <b>can</b> be <b>collected</b> {{across a}} wide range of {{household}} expenditure categories. Everyday shopping categories include food (New World), fuel (Z Energy) and liquor (Liquorland). Typical household services such as energy (Contact Energy) and insurance provider (State) are also covered. General retailers from whom points <b>can</b> be <b>collected</b> include stationery, pharmacy, hardware, optometry, furniture, carpet, travel, accommodation, car servicing and others. Additional points <b>can</b> be <b>collected</b> from transactions on Bank of New Zealand credit cards, and by completing online surveys with Colmar Brunton.|$|R
5|$|All of the minigames in Brain Age 2 are {{different}} from those of the original Brain Age. Brain Age 2 contains six minigames: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Serial Subtraction, Symbol Match, Math Recall, Number Memory, and High Number. The game's Training mode includes the following activities: Sign Finder, Piano Player, Word Blend, Word Scramble, Change Maker, Calendar Count, Memory Sprint, Math Recall, Clock Spin, and Block Count. During their training, the player <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> stamps by completing minigames, and only one stamp can be collected per day. When a certain numbers of stamps are collected, new minigames and features are unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E

5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{a day and}} night cycle, with enemies becoming stronger during the night. During nighttime, players <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> hidden fireflies, with a reward available for collecting them all. Other collectible creatures include Warp Squids, which are squid-shaped items hidden within dungeons, and which can be given to larger mother squids in each town {{in exchange for the}} ability to instantly warp there. Finally, heart vessels can be obtained to increase Shantae's maximum health. The game also features various minigames, such as dancing or gambling, in order to earn additional gems.|$|E
50|$|Beer <b>can</b> <b>collecting</b> {{was a minor}} fad in {{the late}} 1970s and 1990s. However, the hobby waned rapidly in popularity. The Beer Can Collectors of America (BCCA), founded in 1970, was an {{organization}} supporting the hobby, but has now renamed itself Brewery Collectibles Club of America to be more modern.|$|R

5|$|While {{exploring}} the world, Naija <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> various ingredients from interaction with plants and animals, mainly by combating her foes. These ingredients {{can be used}} to cook dishes, which have varying effects on Naija. The most common effects are healing and enhancing various characteristics such as speed and defense, but there are some more exotic dishes which grant her new abilities. The player can learn new recipes by collecting new dishes directly, but can also learn them by combining ingredients without first knowing the recipe.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} items {{the player}} <b>can</b> <b>collect,</b> such as coins, {{which can be}} gathered by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines, Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras, the latter of which become more elusive as the game progresses. The coins {{can be used to}} buy new cars and player outfits, some of which are required to progress through the game. The player can also collect Itchy and Scratchy cards. By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be fined 50 coins.|$|E

Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{year after}} the events of Guilty Gear, reports of a newly {{discovered}} commander Gear surfaced. Amid concern about a second war, another Holy Knights Tournament begins; whoever captures and kills Dizzy will receive 500,000 World Dollars. She is defeated, but her life is spared by Sol Badguy, as she proves to be inoffensive. Shortly after, she is found by Ky Kiske, the police chief of the United Nations and ex-chief of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. He entrusts her care to Johnny and May, members of the Jellyfish Air Pirates, who welcome her as one of their own. Jam Kuradoberi, a bounty hunter and struggling chef, claims the credit for Dizzy's disappearance so she <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> the reward and finance her restaurant.|$|E
5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally {{categorized as}} pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode II is a {{role-playing}} video game; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} characters that expands {{during the course of}} the game, navigating them through a variety of environments tied to the progression of the story. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told mainly through traditional full-motion cutscenes. Exploring environments, the party <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> a variety of items from destroying objects; some items can be used in gameplay to boost a character's statistics or restore health. Most areas can be navigated on foot, but some require the use of mechs. In addition to the main campaign, the party can engage in side quests which vary from finding items to completing difficult battles, and unlock optional dungeon environments in which players can fight enemies and obtain rare items.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and <b>can</b> <b>collect</b> in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
