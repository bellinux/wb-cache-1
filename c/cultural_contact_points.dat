40|$|The 27 th Symposium of the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) Study Group on Ethnochoreology {{took place}} at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Ireland, from 22 nd – 29 th July, 2012. The University, {{situated}} on the River Shannon in the mid-west of Ireland, provided a beautiful location for the Symposium. The year, 2012, marked a fiftieth-year celebration of the Study Group that evolved within the earlier International Folk Music Council (IFMC). Hosting this Symposium was, therefore, of special significance to the University of Limerick particularly since the first Master of Arts degree in Ethnochoreology, at any university in Europe, was established at the University of Limerick in 1996. The success of this event was due to the assistance and support of many people and institutions. Micheál Ó Súilleabháin (Director), Sandra Joyce (Acting Director), and faculty and staff of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, facilitated and supported this biennial meeting of the Symposium. The Arts Council of Ireland, the European <b>Cultural</b> <b>Contact</b> <b>Point,</b> Fáilte Ireland, and the University of Limerick Foundation all provided financial assistance. The National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, Dance Research Forum Ireland, and ICTM Ireland also provided support. The many talented students at the Irish World Academy, including alumni of the postgraduate programmes in Ethnochoreology and Irish Traditional Dance Performance contributed {{to the success of the}} meeting by performing at the Opening Reception and at the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Like all important events, rigorous organisation in programming combined with social interaction and networking was pivotal. The Local Arrangements Committee: Catherine Foley (Chair), Colin Quigley, Mats Melin, and Orfhlaith Ni Bhriain coordinated their efforts to make the Symposium run in a smooth and professional manner. The Programme Committee: Colin Quigley (Chair), Hanafi Bin Hussin, Mehmet Öcal Özbilgin, Daniela Stavelová, and Judy van Zile, skillfuly arranged a programme schedule. The board of the ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology, in particular Laszló Felfoldi (Chair) and Anne von Bibra Wharton (Secretary), also provided much support and assistance. Presenters at the Symposium came from far and near including Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. They presented on two themes. Theme 1 : Dance and Place; and Theme 2 : Dance and Festival. Thirty-eight individual presenters and one roundtable presented on Theme 1, while eighteen individual presenters presented on Theme 2. Throughout the week, various Study Group meetings took place. In addition, recent scholarly publications of individuals of the Study Group together with DVD compilations of previous Study Group symposia were made available for purchase. The Organising Committee included a number of social and cultural events throughout the week. On Monday evening, 23 rd July, it hosted a Céilí dance workshop. This was in preparation for the barbecue Céilí on Saturday evening, 28 th July. A film evening was also introduced during the Symposium. On Tuesday evening, 24 th July, the film evening took place in Theatre 1 of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance. The Pearse Moore Oscar Academy Award nominated film, Dance Lexie Dance (1996) was shown as well as the 2 ̆ 7 Master Class 2 ̆ 7 documentary programme from the televised Rising Steps series, produced by Stirling Productions. These were based on Irish dance. Three short UNESCO films followed on Flamenco, Slovatsco, and the Mevlevi Ceremony. On Wednesday afternoon, participants went on an excursion to the village of Killaloe in County Clare. Here they had the opportunity to explore the village and go on a short boat cruise on Lough Derg. On board, members of the Local Arrangements Committee entertained with some Irish traditional music and dance and Symposium participants also shared music, song and dance from their cultures. This was followed by dinner in Flanagan 2 ̆ 7 s Restaurant on the banks of Lough Derg. After the Study Group 2 ̆ 7 s Business Meeting on Thursday afternoon, 26 th July, the participants had the opportunity to visit the National Dance Archive of Ireland at the Glucksman Library, University of Limerick. This was followed by the Pioneers 2 ̆ 7 Dinner and the 50 th Anniversary Concert. Students, alumni, and faculty of the Irish World Academy performed at this concert. It included traditional Irish dance and music performances and new choreographed Irish theatrical solos and ensemble works. On the final day, participants went on an optional excursion to the Burren in County Clare. They also visited the village of Doolin, the Cliffs of Moher, and finished with dinner in Bunratty Castle where they were entertained by local traditional musicians and dancers. All participants of the Symposium contributed to a stimulating, enjoyable, and a culturally enriching experience. This publication is a record of the entire event and the scholarly presentations at the Symposium. Abstracts are included for those scholars who did not submit their papers. A number of the texts are written by scholars whose first language is not English. To unify the style of the volume, the editors, Elsie Ivancich Dunin and Catherine Foley, standardised the language use and the reference style format of all papers. They endeavoured to retain the voices of the authors. Also, when representing the voices of field consultants in papers some scholars chose to use italics while others did not. The editors permitted both. The Dunin and deAlaiza 2 ̆ 7 s DdA reference format for dance as an internationally friendly style format was applied, and British English spelling was used throughout. The publication of papers from the 27 th Symposium of the Study Group on Ethnochoreology would not have been possible without the financial support of the European <b>Cultural</b> <b>Contact</b> <b>Point</b> and institutional support of the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, and the University of Limerick...|$|R

40|$|Contact state {{information}} is indispensable for performing skillful tasks {{in which an}} end-effector should be {{in contact with the}} environment. In previous work, the authors introduced the concept of a pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> that is useful for tasks involving contact as one expression of the contact state. In this paper, an extended definition of the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is proposed. The pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is defined as the foot of the perpendicular from the nearest point on a reference object to the line on which the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> and external force vector lie. The system may estimate the contact state and its transitions by monitoring the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{in spite of the fact}} that the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> does not always denote the real <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method, which is particularly valuable in providing an intuitive positional description of a contact state...|$|R

40|$|The {{outcomes}} of the integration process of immigrant youth are affected by two dimensions, namely “acculturation attitudes”: the attitude towards {{the maintenance of the}} heritage culture (cultural maintenance) and the attitude towards the contact with the host culture (<b>cultural</b> <b>contact).</b> <b>Cultural</b> maintenance and <b>cultural</b> <b>contact</b> affect the psychosocial adjustment of immigrant youth either directly and indirectly, through the mediator action of other variables, such as intergroup attitudes. The study was aimed at analyzing the relations between acculturation attitudes and psychosocial adjustment among Tunisian adolescents living in Sicily. Particularly, the aims of the study were twofold: (a) to analyze the relations between <b>cultural</b> maintenance, <b>cultural</b> <b>contact,</b> and attitudes towards participants’’ ethnic in-group and out-groups; (b) to analyze the role played by the intergroup attitudes within the relation between acculturation attitudes and adolescents’’ psychosocial adjustment. One hundred forty-eight Tunisian adolescents (73 males and 75 females), aged from 14 to 18 years old and living in Mazara Vallo (TP), participated to the study. Data were collected during the school time thorough self-report measures of the following dimensions: acculturation attitudes; in-group attitude; out-group attitude; self-esteem; perceived discrimination; perceived quality of intercultural relations. Data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Model technique. The results are in line with the study’’s hypothesis. Firstly, cultural maintenance and <b>cultural</b> <b>contact</b> give separate contributions to immigrant’’s adjustment: on the one side, high levels of cultural maintenance promote a positive attitude towards the in-group; on the other side, high levels of <b>cultural</b> <b>contact</b> promote a positive attitude towards the out-group. Secondly, the action of acculturation attitudes on adolescents’’adjustment seems to be not direct, but mediated by the intergroup attitudes: cultural maintenance and <b>cultural</b> <b>contact</b> affect, respectively, the attitude towards the in-group and the attitude towards the out-group which, on their turn, positively affect the levels of self-esteem, perceived discrimination and perceived quality of intercultural relations showed by the participants to the study...|$|R

Calculation of <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> positions is directly estimated in the case of a single wheel–rail <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> For the identification of multiple <b>contact</b> <b>points,</b> an undirect approach should be applied.

50|$|Identically-shaped balls {{help the}} {{pressure}} waves converge on the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{of the last}} ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off {{the opposite side of}} the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> because the first wave reflects off {{the opposite side of the}} last ball and it meets up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the 2nd ball.
