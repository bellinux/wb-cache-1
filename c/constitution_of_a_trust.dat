40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{assess the}} welfare costs and gains of {{different}} scenarios of pension reforms in France, using a life-cycle model including various sources of heterogeneity and distinguishing between socio-occupational groups. The pension reforms considered combine features regarding {{the generosity of}} the pension system as well as features regarding the financing schemes: PAYG, the build-up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporary fund and that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permanent one. We focus on both macro and distributional issues. It appears that (i) a considerable increase in savings is to be expected, even in the case where pensions remain generous, (ii) a considerable crowding-out effect would occur in the case <b>of</b> the <b>constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fund <b>trust,</b> (iii) reducing the generosity of pension seems relatively more beneficial to low-income low-life expectancy agents, while (iv) postponing the legal retirement age benefits relatively more high-income high-life expectancy agents...|$|R
