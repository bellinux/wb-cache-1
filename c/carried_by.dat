5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> folic acid and the methyl group <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This report {{describes}} {{the salience of}} social networks to the phenomena of adolescent weapon carrying. METHODS: A random-walk network sampling design was used to survey 113 adolescents about topics, including weapon carrying. RESULTS: In a probability sample of 12 - to 15 -year-olds, 20. 9 % reported ever carrying a weapon. Carriers were eight times as likely as noncarriers to report weapon <b>carrying</b> <b>by</b> an older associate, and 19 {{times as likely to}} report weapon <b>carrying</b> <b>by</b> a peer. A significant dose-response effect was present. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence supports the interpretation that modeling of weapon <b>carrying</b> <b>by</b> personal network members is important for its initiation and maintenance in adolescence...|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of all passengers travelling by air {{to or from}} the UK are <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> UK airlines, {{of which there are}} around forty, {{and at the end of}} 2006 the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft, flying just under 1.2million flights and averaging over eight hours of flying daily. Together the two largest airlines as measured by passenger numbers; British Airways and easyJet, account for nearly half of the 127million passengers flown on UK airlines. In terms of capacity, both available and used, British Airways is again the largest airline, whilst easyJet is pushed into third place by Virgin Atlantic Airways. British Airways passenger flights also account for over 50 per cent of all cargo <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> UK airlines, and when combined with its cargo operations the airline carries over 60 per cent of all cargo <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> UK airlines.|$|E
