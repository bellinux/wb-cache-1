50|$|A {{fog bell}} tower was added in 1873. In 1883, the {{lighthouse}} {{was raised to}} two full stories with a summer kitchen and additional bedroom added at the southwest corner. Also in 1883, a buoy repair depot {{was built on the}} south side of the light; in 1884, a <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> shed was built to the south of the buoy repair depot. The new structures obscured the fog bell, which was then replaced with a new fog bell on the east end of the <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> shed. In 1927, the lighthouse was converted to a duplex, more than doubling the size of the building. The duplex allowed for a keeper and assistant keeper to live on-site and still have some privacy.|$|R
5|$|The {{power station}} {{is the leading}} coal {{customer}} in Northumberland, burning 1,200,000 tonnes of coal a year, with a weekly coal consumption between 25,000 and 27,000 tonnes.

50|$|Major {{modifications}} {{were completed}} in 1974 {{at a cost}} of $4.2 million to accommodate switching the facility from using natural gas as the primary fuel to low sulfur coal. Involved was the construction and installation of enlarged <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> and handling facilities necessary in making the transition to using only low sulfur coal.|$|R
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|R
25|$|In {{coal-fired}} power stations, the {{raw feed coal}} from the <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next pulverized into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be ball mills, rotating drum grinders, or other types of grinders.|$|R
5|$|The reduced length while {{retaining}} the same beam as the prior Connecticut class {{resulted in a}} disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class.

They also had 25% less <b>coal</b> <b>storage,</b> further reducing their operating range.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, one of {{the risks}} that is a substantial amount occurring in the coal mines is ‘‘spontaneous combustion’’. Other terminologies of ‘‘Coal Spontaneous Combustion’’ are ‘‘Coal Self-burning’’, ‘‘Coal Self-heating’’ and ‘‘Coal Self-ignition’’. Coal spontaneous combustion can occur in underground mines, open pit mines, abandoned mines, <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> locations, waste dumps, and during transports, especially on ocean-going vessels.|$|R
50|$|Located {{at the far}} {{western end}} of the Workshops site is a 200 m by 50 m dam. Initially created as a storage dam for water {{supplies}} in the late 1890s, it was increased in size in 1947 for <b>coal</b> <b>storage.</b> A treatment plant built on the site in 1974 used the dam to discharge wastewater.|$|R

When the two 15-storey blue {{concrete}} <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> silos were demolished on November 27, 1998, {{the most visible}} reminder of the tragedy was erased. The damaged mine shaft had been permanently sealed following the decision to abort further recovery attempts in May 1992 and after investigations were completed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 [...] "Nelson" [...] {{was sold}} to the Union Steamship Co. of New Zealand, and in July was towed from Sydney to Beauty Point on the Tamar River, Tasmania, {{for use as a}} <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> hulk.

40|$|AbstractThe air-supported {{membrane}} shed is a {{new type}} of building structure for storing coal. Performance-based fire design for these sheds is needed because they meet the requirement of fire compartment and safe evacuation distance stipulated by current fire protection design specification difficultly, and has danger of structural collapse in fire, due to their uniqueness in building volume and membrane material. A domestic raw <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> shed taking advantage of air-supported membrane structure was taken for example: 1. Field simulation software FDS was used to verify the effectiveness of evacuation corridors as fire barrier. 2. In the most unfavorable fire scenes, the dangerous coming time of carbon monoxide, temperature and flue gas visibility at the clear height, i. e. available safe evacuation time was simulated in FDS, and the required safe evacuation time was calculated by Pathfinder software. The structural instability time of the air- supported membrane <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> shed was get by combustion characteristic experiment of the membrane material and numerical simulation finally. 3. Reliability of the fire protection design was determined by comparing the three times mentioned above. The results show that, both the available safe evacuation time and the structural instability time are longer than the required safe evacuation time, so the existing fire design in the air-supported membrane <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> shed can ensure the personnel safety evacuation. But the collapse risk still exist in fire scenes, therefore, the minimum distance between coal pile and membrane structure should be controlled properly in engineering applications...|$|R
50|$|As the Perth {{railway network}} grew {{it became clear}} that the C class had {{insufficient}} fuel capacity. Both were rebuilt as 0-6-0STT saddle-tank tender engines with a small four-wheeled tender and new cylinders. This conversion necessitated the removal of the back cab wall. The original coal bunkers and cab front were retained although the bunkers were not used for <b>coal</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|R
