50|$|The {{problem of}} epiphenomena {{is often a}} {{counterexample}} to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, {{is said to be}} caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> seems to be insufficient.|$|E

I develop a multi-country model in which imports and growth are connected by technological innovations and their international diffusion through trade. Fitting the model to data on innovation, productivity, and trade in varieties, I find {{that most of the}} growth-imports correlation is explained by these two mechanisms.

50|$|<b>Counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> enables evaluators to {{attribute}} {{cause and effect}} between interventions and outcomes. The ‘counterfactual’ measures {{what would have happened}} to beneficiaries {{in the absence of the}} intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in impact evaluation is that the counterfactual cannot be directly observed and must be approximated with reference to a comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate comparison group for <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis,</b> using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective (ex post) evaluation design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries (the ‘treatment group’) and non-beneficiaries (the ‘comparison group’); they may involve selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase and may exploit existing survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{evaluation}} {{assesses the}} changes that {{can be attributed to}} a particular intervention, such as a project, program or policy, both the intended ones, as well as ideally the unintended ones. In contrast to outcome monitoring, which examines whether targets have been achieved, impact evaluation is structured to answer the question: how would outcomes such as participants’ well-being have changed if the intervention had not been undertaken? This involves <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis,</b> that is, “a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened {{in the absence of the}} intervention.” Impact evaluations seek to answer cause-and-effect questions. In other words, they look for the changes in outcome that are directly attributable to a program.|$|E
5000|$|The International Monetary Fund has {{published}} within [...] "Spillovers from U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization on Brazil and Mexico’s Sovereign Bond Yields" [...] (Goes, C.; et al., 2017) Using vector error-correction models, {{we find that}} the U.S. 10-year bond yield was a key driver of long-term yields in these countries, and that Brazilian yields were more sensitive to U.S. shocks than Mexican yields during 2010-13. Remarkably, the propagation of shocks from U.S. long-term yields was amplified by changes in the policy rate in Brazil, but not in Mexico. Our <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that yields in both countries temporarily overshot the values predicted by the model {{in the aftermath of the}} Fed’s “tapering” announcement in May 2013. This study suggests that emerging markets will need to contend with potential spillovers from shifts in monetary policy expectations in the U.S., which often lead to higher government bond interest rates and bouts of volatility.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} cross-country variation {{in levels of}} household wealth and in wealth inequality. This paper assesses {{the extent to which}} these differences can be accounted for by differences in the distributions of households’ demographic and economic characteristics. A <b>counterfactual</b> decomposition <b>analysis</b> of micro data from five countries (Italy, UK, US, Sweden and Finland) is used to identify the effects of characteristics on component wealth holdings, their value and their distribution. The findings of the paper suggest that the biggest share of cross-country differences is not attributable to the distribution of household demographic and economic characteristics but rather reflect strong unexplained country effects...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} of overdetermination. First, overdetermination is problematic in particular {{from the viewpoint}} of a standard counterfactual understanding of causation, according to which an event is the cause of another event if and only if the latter would not have occurred, had the former not occurred. In order to employ this formula to actual complex situations, implicit or explicit conditions need to be accepted to be circumstantial, since the list of counterfactually acceptable causes would otherwise be impractically long (e.g. the Earth's continued existence could be said to be the (necessary) cause of one drinking one's coffee). Unless a circumstance-clause is included, the putative cause to which one wishes to draw attention could never be considered sufficient, and hence not comply with the <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis.</b> Second, overdetermination is problematic in that {{we do not know how}} to explain where the extra causation [...] "comes from" [...] and [...] "goes". This makes overdetermination mysterious.|$|E
50|$|Past {{research}} using the gravity model has {{also sought to}} evaluate the impact of various variables {{in addition to the}} basic gravity equation. Among these, price level and exchange rate variables have been shown to have a relationship in the gravity model that accounts for a significant amount of the variance not explained by the basic gravity equation. According to empirical results on price level, the effect of price level varies according to the relationship being examined. For instance, if exports are being examined, a relatively high price level {{on the part of the}} importer would be expected to increase trade with that country. A non-linear system of equations are used by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) to account for the endogenous change in these price terms from trade liberalization. A more simple method is to use a first order log-linearization of this system of equations (Baier and Bergstrand (2009)), or exporter-country-year and importer-country-year dummy variables. For <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis,</b> however, one would still need to account for the change in world prices.|$|E

Specifically, we estimate: i) LATEs; ii) ATETs for the currently eligible; and iii) ATETs for those made eligible by a non-marginal (counterfactual) expansion in Medicaid eligibility. Both estimation methods can control for observable differences across individuals, while SPM can also control for unobservable differences.

40|$|We {{estimate}} a {{model of}} importers in Hungarian micro data and conduct <b>counterfactual</b> policy <b>analysis</b> to investigate the effect of imports on productivity. We find that importing all foreign varieties would increase firm productivity by 12 percent, almost two-fifths of {{which is due to}} imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic goods. The effectiveness of import use is higher for foreign firms and increases when a firm becomes foreign-owned. Our estimates imply that during 1993 - 2002 one-third of the productivity growth in Hungary was due to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity gain from a tariff cut is largest when the economy has many importers and many foreign firms, implying policy complementarities between tariff cuts, dismantling non-tariff barriers, and FDI liberalization. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of the distribution of unconditional and conditional - on technology - wages in Europe, using both industry and individual level data for the period 1995 - 2007. We find that the unconditional wage distribution shows scant signs of polarization in Europe. On the other hand, the effect of technology is more nuanced. At the industry level, technological changes have an effect on polarization of jobs, but not on polarization of wages. At the individual level, we use a <b>counterfactual</b> distributional <b>analysis</b> which accounts for the heterogeneity of tasks across occupations, and we find only mild evidence of wage polarization. Technology affects the lower and upper part of the wage distribution in different ways, with service tasks affecting the lower quantiles and abstract tasks affecting the higher ones...|$|R
30|$|Finally, we have {{performed}} a few <b>counterfactual</b> policy <b>analysis</b> exercises {{with the aim}} of shedding light on how the estimated retirement probabilities respond to small changes in the economic incentive mechanisms underlying the Spanish public pension system. The reason for considering only small changes of the baseline rules is to minimize the Lucas’ critique, and also to check whether these small changes would have enough sizeable effects on retirement or more drastic changes would be needed. The analysis in this section should also be interpreted as being only valid during a short period of time, within which individuals would not change their expectations. Therefore, the results in this section should only be considered as an exercise that provides a quantification of {{what would have happened if}} alternative retirement reforms were proposed, given the observed behavior of individuals after the pension reform in 2002.|$|R
40|$|This study quantifies {{the effects}} of {{persistently}} low interest rates near to the zero lower bound and the unconventional monetary policy on pension fund risk incentives in the United States. Using two structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models and a <b>counterfactual</b> scenario <b>analysis,</b> {{the results show that}} monetary policy shocks, as identified by changes in Treasury yields following changes in the central bank's target interest rates, lead to a substantial increase in pension funds’ allocation to equity assets. Notably, the shift from bonds to equity securities is greater during the period where the US Federal Reserve conducted unconventional monetary policy measures. Additional findings show a positive correlation between pension fund risk-taking, low interest rates and the decline in Treasury yields across both well-funded and underfunded public pension plans, which is thus consistent with a structural risk-shifting incentive...|$|R
40|$|Brogaard and Salerno 2005 {{have argued}} that antirealism resting on a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> of truth is flawed because it commits a {{conditional}} fallacy by entailing the absurdity that there is necessarily an epistemic agent.

If this argument were conclusive, antirealism resting on a <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> of truth should probably be abandoned.

Quantile Regression (QR) techniques are used to control for various characteristics at different points of the wage distributions. <b>Counterfactual</b> decomposition <b>analysis,</b> adjusted for the QR framework, is utilised to examine if the gap is attributed to differences in gender characteristic, or differing returns between genders.

This suggests that the observed wage gap is a result of differences in returns to genders.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{structural}} estimation model for sequential investment decisions emerging in real options applications. The optimization methodology, Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), {{is used to}} solve our structural model {{in order to reduce}} computational complexity. We show, using a generated stylized dataset, that the estimated parameters resemble the equivalent parameters in the theoretical real options model. The model's ability to forecast behavior of real firms is investigated with data from U. S. coal-fired power plant investments. Our analysis reveals that investments in coal-fired power plants are complex with both economic and non-economic factors influencing decisions. While our structural model only accounts for expected dark spreads, we find that a more elaborate model is required to capture the complexity of power plant investments. Finally, we suggest further work that will improve the models ability to conduct <b>counterfactual</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between sick leave, income and unemployment. In particular, it investigates this relationship under the generous German sick leave regulation of 100 % wage replacement, i. e., {{in an environment where}} workers do not bear any direct costs from missing work due to sickness. Using information from the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) I identify three stylized facts of sick leave in Germany. First, sick days show a strong pro-cyclical pattern. Second, average use of sick days is hump-shaped over income quintiles. Third, the number of sick days is a strong predictor of becoming unemployed. Using this micro-evidence I develop a structural model that rationalizes these facts. I argue that in absence of direct costs of sick leave the fear of future unemployment is the main driving force restraining sick leave.

40|$|<b>Counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> has a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} history in comparative research. To some, <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> is central to comparative inquiry because such research typically embraces {{only a handful of}} empirical cases (Fearon 1991). If {{there are only a few}} instances (e. g., of revolution), then researchers, of necessity, must compare empirical cases to hypothetical cases. The affinity between <b>counterfactual</b> <b>analysis</b> and comparative research, however, derives not from its focus on small Ns, but from its configurational nature. Case-oriented explanations of outcomes are often combinatorial in nature, stressing specific configurations of causal conditions. Rather than focus on the net effects of causal conditions, case-oriented explanations emphasize their combined effects. To support an argument emphasizing combinations of causal conditions, it is necessary for researchers to compare cases that are closely matched with each other. The ideal comparison is between pairs of cases that differ on only one causal condition (Mill 1843). Such comparisons help researchers establish whether or not a specific causal condition is an integral part of the combination of conditions that generates the outcome in question. It is very difficult to match empirical cases in this manner, however, due to th...|$|E
40|$|Background: “Obesity paradox” {{refers to}} an {{association}} between obesity and reduced mortality (contrary to an expected increased mortality). A common explanation is collider stratification bias: unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias. Here, we test this supposition through a realistic generative model. Methods: We quantify the collider stratification bias in a selected population using <b>counterfactual</b> causal <b>analysis.</b> We illustrate the bias {{for a range of}} scenarios, describing associations between exposure (obesity), outcome (mortality), mediator (in this example, diabetes) and an unmeasured confounder. Results: Collider stratification leads to biased estimation of the causal effect of exposure on outcome. However, the bias is small relative to the causal relationships between the variables. Conclusions: Collider bias can be a partial explanation of the obesity paradox, but unlikely to be the main explanation for a reverse direction of an association to a true causal relationship. Alternative explanations of the obesity paradox should be explored. See Video Abstract at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis {{of three different}} economic studies that played major roles in the policy debate over the Compact. It draws an important distinction between before and after <b>analysis</b> and <b>counterfactual</b> impact <b>analysis</b> and highlights constraining assumptions in models. Over time, the Compact increased raw milk price 2 - 3 cents per gallon, but if the Compact {{had not been in}} place during {{the first three years of}} its operation, raw milk prices would have been approximately 10 cents lower. Over time, retail prices went up by much more than 2 - 3 cents because other costs increased and channel firms increased tacit collusion and net profits. Studies give different counterfactual estimates for retail prices without the Compact. They range from a drop of 5. 7 cents per gallon to 20. 7 cents per gallon and are very sensitive to modeling approach.
