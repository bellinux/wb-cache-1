BROMP observers view different students in turn, and take notes using an Android app that records data. This app synchronizes with an internet time server. BROMP observations are carried out by field observers trained and certified through a multi-day training process; according to the 2015 <b>coding</b> <b>manual,</b> there are around 130 BROMP-certified coders in 3 countries. Training methods involve both training in coding affect and engagement, and training in observing students non-obtrusively.

50|$|The Elixhauser {{comorbidity}} {{measure was}} developed using administrative {{data from a}} statewide California inpatient database from all non-federal inpatient community hospital stays in California (n = 1,779,167). The Elixhauser comorbidity measure developed a list of 30 comorbidities relying on the ICD-9-CM <b>coding</b> <b>manual.</b> The comorbidities were not simplified as an index because each comorbidity affected outcomes (length of hospital stay, hospital changes, and mortality) differently among different patients groups. The comorbidities identified by the Elixhauser comorbidity measure are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and include both acute and chronic conditions. van Walraven et al. have derived and validated an Elixhauser comorbidity index that summarizes disease burden and can discriminate for in-hospital mortality. In addition, a systematic review and comparative analysis shows that among various comorbidities indices, Elixhauser index is a better predictor of the risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalisation.|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) <b>coding</b> <b>manual</b> has been a collaborative process involving Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Violent Injury Statistics System (NVISS) and contracted software developers. CDC has taken the lead on developing the case definition, table structure, the document-based architecture of the system, and several new data elements. NVISS supplied most of the data elements and definitions based on an earlier pilot for the NVDRS. The NVISS Child Fatality Module Team developed the Child Fatality data elements that are being piloted in NVDRS. This revised version of the <b>coding</b> <b>manual</b> incorporates updates to the system and input from states {{and others who have}} been using the system since its creation. The NVDRS data elements are drawn in part from the NVISS, a pilot for the system. NVISS was developed in 1999 with the financial support of six private foundations. Without the vision and financial support of these foundations, the early work to develop the national system would not have been possible. These foundations include the Atlantic Philanthropies, the Center on Crime, Communities and Culture of the Open Society Institute, the Joyce Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation. This project {{is a reflection of the}} expertise of all the developmental partners, participating state health departments, state and local coroner/medical examiner offices and state and local law enforcement agencies.

Toward answering this question, we interviewed 120 participants in one of four conditions. All conditions involved a HDTV camera {{on top of a}} university building that overlooked a public plaza. In one condition, 30 participants were {{in the office of the}} university building with a view through a window onto the public plaza. In a second condition, 30 participants were in the same office except that now the window was covered with a large display, and real-time HDTV image of the public plaza was displayed on the large-display “window. ” In a third condition, 30 participants were in the original office after it had been closed off with drapes (in effect, an inside office). In a fourth condition, 30 participants were in the public plaza.
