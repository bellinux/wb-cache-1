50|$|One {{justification}} for privatization {{has been that}} it would accelerate the increase of access to water and sanitation, in particular the poor.

5000|$|A {{system of}} <b>cross-subsidization</b> is practiced {{based on the}} {{principle}} of 'the consumer's ability to pay'.

5000|$|Water supply {{providers}} can {{be either}} public, private, mixed or cooperative. Most urban water supply services {{around the world are}} provided by public entities. As Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (2002) stated, [...] "The water crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governance — not of water scarcity." [...] The introduction of cost-reflective tariffs together with <b>cross-subsidization</b> between richer and poorer consumers is an essential governance reform {{in order to reduce the}} high levels of Unaccounted-for Water (UAW) and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest households who remain unconnected.

5000|$|By {{organizing}} small independent providers {{into larger}} units, social franchises can yield {{returns to scale}} in investment in physical capital, supply chains, advertising, and worker training and supervision. Additionally, social franchises can offer the ability to: faster scale up programs, decrease transaction costs, provide uniform services to a broad market, collectively negotiate financial reimbursement mechanisms, and replicate best practice services among a large group. [...] Franchisees can also cross-subsidize less profitable services with the more profitable ones supported by the franchisor. The use of brand advertising makes social franchising compatible with social marketing. In addition, social franchising for health services allows an expansion of services because of <b>cross-subsidization,</b> addition of less-profitable services if fractionally franchised, and access to costly medicines if subsidized by the coordinating organization.|$|E

50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the <b>cross-subsidization</b> using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|E
30|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{determine}} whether a minimum coverage legislation (henceforth MCL) can implement some degree of <b>cross-subsidization</b> among different risks. The idea is that undesirable cream skimming deviations might be ruled out through such legislation. As mentioned above, since <b>cross-subsidization</b> comes at the expense of low risks, such legislation is often accompanied by mandatory enrollment laws.|$|E
30|$|First, {{the model}} {{would require the}} {{introduction}} of a user-pays principle for the ‘strong’ segments of society. This is a deviation from current practice, where users typically pay only part of the direct costs related to their trips. Indeed, as has been shown in the literature, the transport domain abounds with <b>cross-subsidization</b> between various user groups, such as users of different types of vehicles (diesel, gasoline, electricity), different types of users (private versus commercial, person versus freight transport), and different types of regions (center versus periphery) [27, 54, 62, 71]. Such <b>cross-subsidization</b> is clearly at odds with a market-led approach and a comparison with the housing domain underlines the peculiarity of these financial arrangements. <b>Cross-subsidization</b> would not be ruled out across the board, but would require additional justification, for instance based on considerations of environmental externalities including climate change.|$|E
30|$|The <b>cross-subsidization</b> in the {{tariff system}} is also {{evidenced}} {{by the fact that}} the industrial tariff is greater than the residential tariff in many cases. The residential tariffs should be higher than the industrial tariffs because it costs more. More facilities are needed and greater losses are incurred due to the lower supply voltage. In the situation of EU, the industrial tariffs are lower than the residential tariffs. Consequently, <b>cross-subsidization</b> in the tariff system distorts consumption decisions and make a country’s industry less competitive.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of price cap regulation include: the transformation from rate-of-return regulation, {{the adoption of}} a price cap formula, <b>cross-subsidization,</b> and the relationship between regulation and competition. The experience of price cap regulation reveals that it does not protect monopoly customers, and it allows utilities to engage in <b>cross-subsidization.</b> These results imply that the regulator must periodically review price cap results to realign prices with the cost of service and to ensure that a level playing field that would nurture competition develops in every market. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cross-subsidization</b> between {{services}} in multi service pricing firms becomes increasingly important as regulators favour the deregulation as {{a mean of}} promoting efficiency. When previously restricted markets are completely opened to new entrants, the existence of cross-subsidies could encourage (and result in) entry by inefficient providers. Prior allowing wide-scale entry into fixed local telecommunications market, regulators need to {{know whether or not}} there is <b>cross-subsidization</b> in existing regulated local phone prices to avoid creating profit-making opportunities for inefficient producers. The empirical applications of <b>cross-subsidization</b> test proposed by G. Faulhaber (1975) have been limited basically due to the requirement of unobservable data on stand-alone costs of producing each service in isolation. In telecommunications industry this requirement becomes dramatical since the services are produced using shared infrastructures. This study reviews the pertinent <b>cross-subsidization</b> theory and uses a method of testing the presence of cross-subsidies that does not require observations on stand-alone cost: an engineering process model, named Lecom (Local Exchange Cost Optimal Model) by its creators, the Profs.

40|$|Faulhaber's (1975) {{concept of}} <b>cross-subsidization</b> is of crucial {{importance}} for regulatory activities. Its basic idea that customers demanding a good should not {{pay more than}} they would if they "stood alone" is a fundamental fairness rule which can be applied by independent regulators in infrastructure industries. In reality, however, regulators frequently do not restrict the pricing policy of a regulated firm to zero profits due {{to the influence of}} politicians and pressure groups or, in the case of state-owned firms, because of a mandate to generate profits to reduce the state's budget deficit. They approve of prices generating positive economic profits. In this case, Faulhaber's (1975) concept is not applicable. We develop a less restrictive concept of <b>cross-subsidization</b> which can be applied when regulators are not independent and allow firms to make non-zero profits. We generalize the usual stand-alone and incremental cost tests to the case when regulated firms make positive profits, and provide an equivalence result for the (generalized) stand-alone cost (GSAC) test and the (generalized) incremental cost (GIC) test.
