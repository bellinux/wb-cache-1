5|$|The Bill Thomas Cheetah American sports/racing <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> Chevrolet-based coupe first {{designed}} and driven in 1963, {{was an attempt}} to challenge Carroll Shelby's Shelby Cobra in American sports car competition of the 1960s era. Due to only two dozen or fewer chassis ever being built, with only a dozen of these being complete cars, the Cheetah was never homologated for competition beyond prototype status, with its production ending in 1966.|$|E

25|$|Exocentric {{compounds}} occur {{more often}} in adjectives than nouns. <b>A</b> V-8 <b>car</b> is <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> V-8 engine rather than <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that is <b>a</b> V-8, and <b>a</b> twenty-five-dollar <b>car</b> is <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> worth of $25, not <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that is $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffixal morpheme is added, esp. -ed. Hence, a two-legged person is a person with two legs, and this is exocentric.|$|R

5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the <b>car</b> (<b>a</b> white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock <b>Car,</b> <b>a</b> typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E

5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production <b>car.</b> <b>A</b> five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Mulder—on {{his way to}} England {{investigating}} heart chakra-shaped crop circles—calls Scully {{and asks}} her to meet a contact of his, Colleen Azar (Colleen Flynn), to obtain some information. As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, Batman confronts a {{group of}} Gotham City crime bosses led by Chuckie Sol, who are {{intending}} to launder millions of counterfeit dollars in a casino. As Sol escapes to his <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out {{the side of a}} parking garage and into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite Commissioner Gordon's protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in {{the vestibule}} end and separate men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the <b>car</b> <b>a</b> maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} <b>car,</b> <b>a</b> couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E

He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive the bomb SUV off the end of the ferry before it explodes.

5|$|On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a <b>car</b> <b>a</b> short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the <b>car.</b> <b>A</b> police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his <b>car.</b> <b>A</b> June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E
