40|$|The Engineers Centre of Expertise of the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA) has {{conducted}} a study on <b>countermine</b> in peace <b>operations.</b> This study, finished in 2002, concluded that the final solution to countermine will depend {{in the first place}} on better detection of buried low-metal mines, e. g. by direct detection of the explosive components in mines. Until such detection systems are available, intermediate solutions are necessary in order to assure freedom of movement in peace <b>operations.</b> Because <b>countermine</b> <b>operations</b> consist of a number of different activities (area preparation, detection, clearance, etc) and the suitability of the different types of available equipment depends on the scenario, the toolbox concept for countermine equipment was adopted. In 2003 a procurement process was started in order to fill this toolbox with commercial-off-the-shelf and military-off-the-shelf equipment. The paper gives a concise description of the study on <b>countermine</b> <b>operations</b> and the procurement process, and subsequently focuses on the set-up of the tests that were conducted in the framework of the procurement of hand-held mine detection systems, like metal detectors and dual-sensor mine detectors. Programs of requirements for these systems were drawn up, aiming at systems for general use and special purpose systems. Blind tests to check the compliancy to the detection performance requirements were designed and conducted in the short timeframe that was available in the procurement process. These tests are discussed in this paper, including the set-up of the test lanes, the targets used and their depths, {{and the role of the}} operator. The tests of the capability of the detectors to discriminate small targets adjacent to large targets were conducted according the guidelines of the CEN Workshop Agreement on metal detector tests. Although the results of the tests are commercially confidential, conclusions and lessons learned from the execution of these tests are presente...|$|R

Opposed by troops from the Ottoman 47th Regiment, for the remaining {{three months of the}} campaign, the two Australian battalions would alternate their positions in the front line as the Ottoman and Australians engaged in mining and <b>countermining</b> <b>operations</b> against each other's positions. The stalemate continued as both the Australians and Ottomans lacked the strength to mount a determined attack and this situation ultimately lasted until the Allied evacuation in December 1915.|$|R

The offensive largely failed and heavy casualties resulted. In order to replace the men that were lost and give the survivors a rest, the decision was made by Allied commanders to move the 2nd Division from Egypt. After being moved to Lemnos Island, the 23rd Battalion embarked for Gallipoli on 4 September, arriving there at 9:30pm that evening. A day of familiarisation followed before the battalion took up defensive positions at Lone Pine. On 12 September, the 23rd, along with their sister battalion, the 24th, took over responsibility for the post from the 1st Division battalions that had held it previously. During the stalemate that followed, manning positions that, in some places, were only a few metres from the Ottoman lines, the 23rd Battalion began <b>countermining</b> <b>operations</b> after Turkish mining operations were discovered. For the next three months, due to the intensity of the fighting in the sector, the battalion alternated their position with the 24th Battalion almost every day until the evacuation of Allied troops from the peninsula occurred, embarking with the last troops to leave on the night of 19/20 December 1915.|$|R
40|$|When {{operating}} in a sea borne environment, sea mines can prevent U. S. Navy vessels from meeting operational objectives. Sea mines have the potential of damaging, or destroying ships at sea. The U. S. Navy conducts mine warfare (MIW) operations to meet this threat. Although effective against mining, our <b>countermining</b> <b>operations</b> are currently employing 1960 â s technology {{in an attempt to}} keep pace with new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS). Todayâ s legacy MIW processes currently employed by the warfighter, although capable of countering the mining threat, are a reactive process that is slow to engage and employ assets that are cumbersome to operate. With the advent of new technologies, a transformation of MIW capability is on the horizon and has the potential of influencing how the U. S. Navy maintains maritime dominance in the openoceans and littoral environments. The influence that technologies bring to MIW includes multi-spectral sensors, laser imagery, compact modular systems, unmanned and semi-autonomous weapons, as well as new communications architecture and tactics. Although these technical innovations present a level of capability superior to the existing legacy systems, developmental barriers and the lack of an overarching systems architecture will hinder or prevent these systems from being effectively integrated into tomorrowâ s CONOPS...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, {{the next}} experiment," [...] {{continued}} Firebrand, {{glad to have}} an opportunity of changing the subject, [...] "is meant to illustrate our method of countermining. You must know that our enemies may sometimes sink torpedoes at the entrance of their harbours, to prevent our ships of war entering. Such torpedoes consist usually of casks or cases of explosives, which are fired either by electric wires, like the telegraph, when ships are seen to be passing over them, or by contact. That is to say, an enemy's ship entering a harbour runs against something which sets something else in motion, which explodes the torpedo and blows it and the ship into what natives of the Green Isle call smithereens. This is very satisfactory when it happens to an enemy, but not when it happens to one's-self, therefore when we have to enter an enemy's harbour we <b>countermine.</b> This <b>operation</b> is now about to be illustrated. The last experiments exhibited the power of offensive torpedoes. There are several different kinds, such as Mr Whitehead's fish-torpedo, the Harvey torpedo, and others." ...|$|R

An end-to-end, overall systems approach {{for the new}} USV systems and technology and an overall system architecture are considered for mission effectiveness and cost optimization for future system operations in the MCM warfare. Following the procedures described in DoD and Naval operation code, we try to combine and optimize major steps of the mine warfare procedure and related latest technology achievements in the autonomous vehicle systems. Fundamental considerations for development of CONOPs for future MIW USV systems are: the combined dedicated and organic MCM capabilities must be optimized with a systems view; confirm procedures for selecting the best route and MCM sequences based on ISR databases; assess the mine threat for situational awareness, including future trends; effective C 4 I ISR operation and information sharing; contingency plan for joint <b>countermine</b> warfare <b>operations</b> forces and ISR assets; technical issues related to communications and interoperability, navigation/position errors for sensor contacts, type of sensor information; develop environmental databases, CAD/CAC algorithms and associated thresholds for detection and classification; an overall MCM systems architecture is needed to ensure that common standards; compatibility with MEDAL should be a given.

40|$|The basic {{principle}} of Maneuver Warfare in the 21 st century is the seamless integration of sea and land as maneuver space. Unfortunately, {{our inability to}} conduct <b>countermine</b> and counterobstacle <b>operations</b> in the littorals severely curtails our ability to conduct Amphibious Warfare, a key ingredient to maneuver. Hydra- 7, a possible solution to this problem, {{is one of the}} most promising countermine weapons under development, but its final performance level will depend on the effectiveness of subcomponent technologies. These subcomponent technologies have yet to reach maturity and may not perform as well as desired. This thesis provides analysis procedures and models to predict Hydra- 7 effectiveness for a broad range of possible performance values of subcomponent systems.

40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} {{detection}} of explosives, energetic materials, and their associated compounds would provide valuable information to military commanders {{in a wide}} range of military operations: protection of fast moving convoys from mobile or static IED threats; more deliberate <b>countermine</b> and counter-IED <b>operations</b> during route or area clearance; and static roles such as hasty or deliberate checkpoints, critical infrastructure protection and support to public security. The detection of hidden explosive hazards is an extremely challenging problem, as evidenced by the fact that related research has been ongoing in many countries for at least seven decades and no general purpose solution has yet been found. Technologies investigated have spanned all major scientific fields, with emphasis on the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, robotics, computer technology and mathematics. This paper will present a limited, operationally-focused overview of the current status of detection technologies. Emphasis will be on those technologies that directly detect the explosive hazard, as opposed to those that detect secondary properties of the threat, such as the casing, associated wires or electronics. Technologies that detect explosives include those based on nuclear radiation and terahertz radiation, as well as trace and biological detection techniques. Current research areas of the authors will be used to illustrate the practical applications. © 2011 SPIE...|$|R
