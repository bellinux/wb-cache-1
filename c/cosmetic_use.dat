A {{significant proportion of the}} insoluble carmine pigment produced is used in the cosmetics industry for hair- and skin-care products, lipsticks, face powders, rouges, and blushes. A bright red dye and the stain carmine used in microbiology is often made from the carmine extract, too. The pharmaceutical industry uses cochineal to colour pills and ointments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} cue for forming impressions, particularly of women. Those wearing heavy makeup are seen as significantly more feminine than those wearing moderate makeup or no makeup and those wearing heavy or moderate makeup are seen as more attractive than those wearing no makeup. While a woman wearing no makeup is perceived as being more moral than the other two conditions, there is no difference between experimental conditions when judging personality or personal temperament.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889, Florence Maybrick bought flypaper {{containing}} arsenic {{from a local}} chemist's {{shop and}} later soaked it {{in a bowl of}} water. At her trial, she claimed that this method allowed her to extract the arsenic for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use.</b> James Maybrick was taken ill on 27 April 1889 after self-administering a double dose of strychnine. His doctors treated him for acute dyspepsia, but his condition deteriorated. On 8 May Florence Maybrick wrote a compromising letter to Brierley, which was intercepted by Alice Yapp, the nanny. Yapp passed it to James Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family. By Michael's orders Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May a nurse reported that Mrs Maybrick had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Mrs Maybrick later testified that her husband had begged her to administer it as a pick-me-up. However, he never drank its contents.|$|E

2500|$|Secretions of the urpoygial gland {{of greater}} {{flamingos}} (Phoenicopterus roseus) contain carotenoids, organic pigments which give flamingos their pink colour. [...] During the breeding season, greater flamingos increase {{the frequency of}} their spreading uropygial secretions over their feathers and thereby enhance their colour. [...] This <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> of uropygial secretions {{has been described as}} applying [...] "make-up".|$|E
2500|$|As for Mehndi, natural brown henna dyes {{are safe}} to use when mixed with {{ingredients}} such as lemon juice. However, a commonly marketed product called [...] "black henna", is not {{safe to use}} because the product has been made by mixing natural henna with synthetic black dyes containing PPD, which can cause serious skin allergies, and should be avoided due to the substantial risk of serious injury. Another option is Jagua, a dark indigo plant-based dye that is safe to use on the skin and is approved for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> in the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Pesticides {{may cause}} acute and delayed health effects {{in people who}} are exposed. Pesticide {{exposure}} can cause a variety of adverse health effects, ranging from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer. A 2007 systematic review found that [...] "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" [...] and thus concluded that <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> of pesticides should be decreased. [...] There is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations. Limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, and fetal death.|$|E

2500|$|As an herbal text, the book's {{content is}} {{primarily}} on the medicinal uses and properties of the materials described. Exceptions to this rule are suggestions for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> or folklore associated with the item. One well-known entry concerns the Mandrake, an herb with the mythical human form of a [...] man and a woman. Accompanying woodcuts demonstrate this belief, but the Grete Herballs entry text dismisses the myth outright: [...] "Some say that the male hath figure or shape of a man. And the female of a woman, but that is false. For nature never gave forme or shape of mankynde to an herbe. But it is of trough (truth) that some hath shaped such figures by craft." [...] Entries can also hold warnings for those seeking to use the items, such as the entry for Spodium (elephant ivory), which describes dog bones sometimes being passed off as ipodium (elephant bones) by unscrupulous physicians. Each plant and non-botanical is also described as being either hot or cold, dry or wet, and the [...] "degree" [...] of each. This categorization allowed doctors to prescribe a corresponding medicine for diseases, which were defined by the same system in a separate section of the book.|$|E
2500|$|Cosmetic neuro-pharmacology, the use {{of drugs}} to improve {{cognition}} in normal healthy individuals, is highly controversial. Some case reports with the antidepressant Prozac indicated that patients seemed [...] "better than well", and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>use</b> of these antidepressants. [...] Opponents of cosmetic pharmacology believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher Arthur Caplan, state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine [...] whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes. Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued that western medicine stands {{on the brink of a}} neuro-enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means. [...] Jacob Appel, a Brown University bioethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers. The ethical concerns regarding pharmacological enhancement are not limited to Europe and North America, indeed, there is increasing attention given to cultural and regulatory contexts for this phenomenon, around the globe.|$|E

A key enzyme, tyrosinase, catalyzes the first and only rate-limiting steps in melanogenesis, and the down-regulation of enzyme activity is the most reported method for the inhibition of melanogenesis. Because of the cosmetically important issue of hyperpigmentation, there is a big demand for melanogenesis inhibitors.
