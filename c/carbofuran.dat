5000|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> is an {{endocrine}} disruptor and a probable reproduction/development intoxicant. At low-level exposures <b>carbofuran</b> may cause transient alterations in {{the concentration of}} hormones. These alterations may consequently lead to serious reproductive problems following repeated exposure. When exposed in utero or during lactation, a decrease in sperm motility, sperm count along with increase in percent abnormal sperm was observed in rats at 0.4 mg/kg dose level. [...] In one study, the exposure of rats to sublethal amounts of <b>carbofuran</b> decreased testosterone by 88%, while the levels of progesterone, cortisol, and estradiol were significantly increased (1279%, 202%, and 150%, respectively).|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> {{has one of}} {{the highest}} acute toxicities to humans of any {{insecticide}} widely used on field crops (only aldicarb and parathion are more toxic). Most <b>carbofuran</b> is applied by commercial applicators using closed systems with engineered controls so there is no exposure to it in preparation. Since its toxic effects are due to its activity as a cholinesterase inhibitor it is considered a neurotoxic pesticide. A recent study reports that <b>carbofuran</b> is a structural mimic of the neurohormone melatonin and could directly bind to MT2 melatonin receptor (Ki = 1.7 uM). Disruption of melatonin signaling could impact the circadian rhythm balance and linked to elevated risk of developing diabetes.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{announced}} that it intends to ban <b>carbofuran.</b> In December of that year, FMC Corp., the sole US manufacturer of <b>carbofuran,</b> {{announced that}} it had voluntarily requested that the United States Environmental Protection Agency cancel all but six of the previously allowed uses of that chemical as a pesticide. With this change, <b>carbofuran</b> usage in the US would be allowed only on maize, potatoes, pumpkins, sunflowers, pine seedlings and spinach grown for seed. However, in May 2009 EPA cancelled all food tolerances, an action which amounts to a de facto ban on its use on all crops grown for human consumption.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> {{has been}} {{illegally}} used to intentionally poison wildlife in the US, Canada and Great Britain; poisoned wildlife have included coyotes, kites, golden eagles and buzzards. Secondary fatal poisoning {{of domestic and}} wild animals has been documented, specifically, raptors (bald eagles and golden eagles), domestic dogs, raccoons, vultures and other scavengers. In Kenya, farmers are using <b>carbofuran</b> to kill lions and other predators.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{carbamate}} pesticides. It is marketed under the trade names Furadan, by FMC Corporation and Curater, among several others. It is used to control insects in a wide variety of field crops, including potatoes, corn and soybeans. It is a systemic insecticide, which means that the plant absorbs it through the roots, and from here the plant distributes it throughout its organs where insecticidal concentrations are attained. <b>Carbofuran</b> also has contact activity against pests.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} {{or chemical}} name of <b>carbofuran</b> is 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate and its CAS number is 1563-66-2. It is manufactured by {{the reaction of}} methyl isocyanate with 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-hydroxybenzofuran.|$|E

50|$|Representative commercially {{significant}} chemicals {{produced from}} methylamine include the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and theophylline, the pesticides <b>carbofuran,</b> carbaryl, and metham sodium, and the solvents N-methylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. The preparation of some surfactants and photographic developers require methylamine as a building block.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> usage has {{increased}} in recent years because {{it is one of}} the few insecticides effective on soybean aphids, which have expanded their range since 2002 to include most soybean-growing regions of the U.S. The main global producer is the FMC Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control has}} shown {{some success in}} {{reducing}} S. bradys population. Four granular nematicides (aldicarb, oxamyl, <b>carbofuran</b> and miral) applied as post-plant sidedressing treatments effectively reduced the nematode population {{during the growing season}} and significantly increased yield without toxic accumulation in the harvested tubers.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} {{carbamate insecticides}} feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included {{in this group}} are aldicarb (Temik), <b>carbofuran</b> (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning.|$|E

50|$|A carbamoyl {{chloride}} is {{the functional}} {{group with the}} formula R2NC(O)Cl. The parent carbamoyl chloride, H2NCOCl is unstable, but many N-substituted analogues are known. Most examples are moisture sensitive, colourless, and soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. An example is dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (m.p. −90 °C and b.p. 93 °C). Carbamoyl chlorides are used to prepare a number of pesticides, e.g. <b>carbofuran</b> and aldicarb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> {{exhibits}} toxicity {{mediated by}} the same mechanism {{as that of the}} notorious V-series nerve agents and presents a risk to human health. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbofuran</b> {{is known}} to be {{particularly}} toxic to birds. In its granular form, a single grain will kill a bird. Birds often eat numerous grains of the pesticide, mistaking them for seeds, and then die shortly thereafter. Before the granular form was banned by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1991, it was blamed for millions of bird deaths per year. The liquid version of the pesticide is less hazardous to birds since they are not as likely to ingest it directly, but it is still very hazardous.|$|E

5000|$|Chemical {{control of}} Ditylenchus {{destructor}} {{can be achieved}} with soil-applied nematicides such as <b>carbofuran,</b> ethylene dibromide, VAPAM HL, and TELONE. [...] Fumigation with these nematicides is often paired with mechanical measures to attain optimal control. For example, Wisconsin has eradicated these nematodes from potatoes by repeated use of ethylene dibromide and restricting the movement of infected tubers. [...] Another management method was demonstrated by the control of potato rot nematodes in garlic. The seeds were coated with thiram or benomyl wettable powder before being planted, resulting in very good control of the disease.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012 {{consumer}} action groups demanded four unlisted toxic pesticides {{found on}} common vegetables at levels 100 times the EU guidelines (which are banned in developed countries) be banned. Chemical companies are requesting to {{add them to}} the Thai Dangerous Substances Act so {{they can continue to}} be used, including on exported mangoes to developed countries which have banned their use. In 2014, Khon Kaen University concluded after a study, that Thailand should ban 155 types of pesticides, with 14 listed as urgent: <b>Carbofuran,</b> Methyl Bromide, Dichlorvos, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Methidathion-methyl, Omethoate, Zeta Cypermethrin, Endosulfan sulfate, Aldicarb, Azinphos-methyl, Chlorpyrifos-ethyl, Methoxychlor and Paraquat.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} methods to control nematodes {{have been tried}} over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, <b>carbofuran,</b> and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with <b>carbofuran</b> had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield. [...] In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage planting system. This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus. [...] If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease {{the density of the}} nematodes may be needed. The problem with that is there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would {{have to be very careful}} in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well. [...] In 1992 Vast demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could enhanced the plant’s resistance to nematodes by being a physical barrier. [...] This would be something that could be used as a seed treatment to protect the newly emerging seedlings from being infested.|$|E
