The phase composition, surface micro-topography and elemental characteristics of the active porous calcium-phosphate films were investigated with XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS. The biocompatibility was assessed using corrosion testing, the in vitro osteoblast <b>cultivation</b> <b>test</b> and implantation in soft tissue (subcutaneous and musculature). The osteoconduction was evaluated using the simulated body fluid test and by implantation in hard tissue. The results show that the active porous films are mainly composed of TiO 2 anatase and rutile. The oxide layer is a kind of porous ceramic intermixture containing Ca and P. Immersion in simulated body fluid can induce apatite formation on the porous calcium-phosphate films resulting in excellent bioactivity. Cell cultures revealed that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells grew on the surface exhibiting favorable morphologies. These results indicate that the Ti- 3 Zr- 2 Sn- 3 Mo- 25 Nb biomedical alloy coated with an active porous calcium-phosphate film has been shown to have excellent corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility and osteoconduction, which can promote cell proliferation and bone formation.

40|$|The use of {{mulching}} films {{made from}} non-renewable fossil fuels causes the serious drawback of huge quantities of plastic wastes to be disposed of. Over {{the last years}} the growing environmental awareness has prompted researchers {{to develop a new}} generation of mulching products starting with raw materials from renewable origin. These materials have to retain their physical and mechanical properties while in use, to be compostable or digestible anaerobically {{at the end of their}} life, and to be degradable via micro-organisms into carbon dioxide or methane, water and biomass when integrated directly in the soil. Aim of the research was the development of biodegradable polymeric materials based on hydrolyzed proteins, derived from waste products of the leather industry. Particular attention has been devoted to evaluate the application of such biobased materials in the agricultural practice of mulching. Biobased mulching films were generated in situ by low-pressure spraying of polymeric water dispersion on the soil; the mulches were tested in a Romaine Lettuce Mortarella cultivation inside a greenhouse from November 2013 to January 2014.

40|$|Vanillin (4 -hydroxy- 3 methoxybenzaldehyde) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} aromatic and flavoring additives in food and cosmetic industry. The industrial interest in vanillin could also apply to its biodegradation products. The microbial transformation of vanillin can open the possibility of new products with new areas of application for products related to vanillin. For example, vanillyl alcohol, vanillic acid and ferulic acid are currently used in the pharmaceutical or food industry. Some species reported to biodegrade vanillin into the related products vanillyl alcohol and vanillic acid, are: Brettanomyces anomalus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, certain microorganisms possess the ability to accumulate lipids when cultivated on different carbon sources, opening the possibility of microbial lipid production as another industrial application. The present investigation focuses on the optimization of extraction methods for vanillin biodegradation products, as well as identifying the isolates of a collection of microorganisms originating from the Faroe Islands that are amenable to being cultivated on a lignin-based media. Finally, the potential for microbial lipid accumulation was also studied. Two analytical methods, Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) were employed for characterizing the biodegradation products obtained after 24 hours and 72 hours of culture in growth medium supplemented with 1 mM of vanillin. The results showed that after 24 hours of incubation, the model microorganism, strain FMYD 002, had consumed some of the vanillin and transformed it into biodegradation products. TLC retention factors and GC chromatograms revealed that the main biodegradation product after 24 hours - when compared to a standard – is likely to be to vanillyl alcohol. Furthermore, vanillin and its biodegradation products were relatively temperature-stable based on a temperature test of supernatant from a 24 -hour culture, however, when the 72 -hour culture had been subjected to the highest temperature (60 °C) some spontaneous decomposition occurred. The biodegradation pattern of the 72 -hour culture evidenced by TLC revealed two additional biodegradation products, one of which migrates in a similar fashion to vanillic acid. After 72 hours of incubation, the biodegradation product presumed to be vanillyl alcohol was no longer observed. Acidification tests showed that the best route for extraction of the product believed to be vanillyl alcohol is to adjust the extracted sample to a pH of 9. The <b>cultivation</b> <b>test</b> of the isolates in media prepared from different lignin-based residual products showed that 26 out of 60 initial strains grew regardless of the concentration of lignosulfonates and vanillin. Moreover, 17 strains grew in nitrogen-limited medium. Eight of the strains accumulated lipids. A preliminary categorization of isolates based on their colony morphology and capacity of growth on different substrates showed that to some extent, their morphology can predict the ability to grow on lignin- and vanillin-based media. This could help future scientists to easily screen for and select isolates with interesting activity for the ligno-cellulose industry...|$|E

Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection can be made by invasive and non-invasive methods. In order to proceed to the invasive method, a biopsy sample of the gastric mucosa must be taken. This sample is later submitted for histological and microbiological examination. The microbiological methods include microscopic examination, rapid urease test and H. pylori <b>cultivation</b> <b>test.</b> In principal, non-invasive methods (breath test, stool antigen test) are used for the verification of eradical infection treatment. The topic of the thesis dealt with the comparison of individual microbiological examination methods ? microscopy, cultivation and rapid urease test which are used at the Bacteriology Institute of Hospital of České Budějovice, a. s. in order to diagnose Helicobacter pylori. Biopsy samples of the gastric mucosa sent to the Bacteriology Institute in 2011 were used as the main material for the given study. The samples were most frequently taken at the Gastroenterology Department and Children´s Department. Each biopsy sample was divided into three parts for individual methods. A microscopic preparation was elaborated from a part of the sample. The stain device - MIRASTAINER? system was used for the Gram staining. During observations in the optic microscope (immersion lens system with 1000 ×) fine S-shaped Gram-negative rods were visible in the event of a positive finding. Other parts of the sample were used for the urease hydrolyses test (Christensen´s) in the liquid media. The test was assessed the following day, in the case of a positive finding the media went red. The remaining part of the sample was used for the cultivation examination. The material was inoculated into the HPFA diagnostic cultivation media provided by the Dulab Company and, at the same moment, on non-selective blood agar (in order to exclude contaminating microflora). The cultivation was executed in a microaerophilic atmosphere (obtained in the LAS system) from 5 to 7 days at 37 °C. In the event of a positive cultivation finding (often represented in case of H. pylori by typical, finer, slightly grey and partially transparent colonies) the sensitivity to antibiotics was tested. In 2011, the Bacteriology Department at the Hospital of České Budějovice, a. s. examined 599 biopsy samples of the gastric mucosa. The examination proved the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the bodies of 161 patients. The results of the study reveal that the sensitivity of the cultivation examination is comparable to microscopy. The lowest sensitivity was proved in the case of the urease test. The infection was the most commonly diagnosed in the age group between 40 and 59 years (47. 5 % of men and 52. 2 % of women). The sensitivity to selected antibiotics was determined in the case of 137 phyla. 42 % of phyla were resistant to metronidazole and 18 % of phyla to azithromycin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a high density {{cultivation}} model for rotifer which is used as a design basis of the establishment of a high density cultivation system for rotifer mass culture. The designed parameters of the high density rotifer cultivation model were obtained by its environment and feed factors tests. The results of the environmental experiments have shown that the best environment conditions for rotifer cultivation were set at a temperature of 30 ℃, salinity 25 ppt, pH 7. 5 ~ 8. 5 and aeration with 0. 045 vvm. In the feed factor tests, the effects of the initial density and the ESD (equivalent spherical diameter) of feeds were investigated. The three initial feed densities, 1, 000, 1, 500 and 2, 000 × 104 cells/ml were selected for the cultivation tests. The results of experiments had demonstrated that a higher initial feed density obtained a greater egg ratio of the rotifer. The test with the initial feed density 2, 000 × 104 cells/ml held the highest egg ratio and the growth rate with 0. 5543 eggs/female and 0. 0686 hr- 1, respectively. The density at 24 hr after inoculation was up to the initial inoculation density of 1. 92 times. The experimental results had also expressed a good linear relationship between the egg ratio and the interval growth rate of the rotifer. Therefore, it will be plausible to utilize this linear relationship with egg ratio predict the trends for the growth of rotifer density in the future. During the feed factor tests, the effects using the same kind of alga with different ESD were also performed. The experimental results had shown that the ESD had significantly influenced the growth of the rotifer density, while the rotifer feeding with a larger ESD could have a better growth rate. Based on the environmental and feed experimental results, a semi-continuous culture experiment was conducted to explore the relationship with the feed density and the growth of rotifer. The experimental results had shown that as the feed consumption rate kept between 0. 2 ~ 0. 6 × 104 cells/ind., it was able to maintain an appropriate egg ratio, as well as to increase the growth of the rotifer. The highest density 6, 876 ind. /ml was detected after 64 hr of inoculation and the density was 8. 76 times as compared with the initial inoculation density of 785 ind. /ml. Ultimately, this study established a high density rotifer cultivation system. The system was constructed and combined with the parts of the microalgal reactor and the rotifer culture tank to verify the influence of the rate of feed consumption to the growth rate in the actual rotifer cultivation system. For the <b>cultivation</b> <b>test</b> of 104 hr, the average feed consumption was maintained at 0. 4 × 104 cells/ind. The experimental results indicated that a good cultivating performance of the system with excellent rotifer growth and egg ratio was obtained. The final numbers of the rotifer were 17, 355, 000 individuals, and it was 2. 56 times of its initial numbers 6, 780, 000 individuals. The average of the egg ratio was also maintained with 0. 559 eggs/female. This result had demonstrated that the system with excellent capability of feed density control and high density rotifer cultivation was developed. 本研究旨在建立一高密度輪蟲養殖系統模型，藉以作為未來建立一較大培養量之高密度輪蟲培養系統之設計依據。本研究由環境與餌料因子試驗結果獲致系統模型設計參數，其中環境因子試驗獲致溫度設定為 30 ℃、鹽度 25 ppt、pH 7. 5 ~ 8. 5 之間及曝氣量 0. 045 vvm之條件下，驗証輪蟲能有良好之增殖環境；而餌料因子試驗則分別測試初始餌料密度與餌料粒徑對輪蟲增殖之影響，三種初始餌料密度 1, 000 、 1, 500 及 2, 000 × 104 cells/ml之測試結果，顯示較高之初始餌料密度 2, 000 × 104 cells/ml組，輪蟲有較大之帶卵率 0. 5543 eggs/female，亦獲致其輪蟲比增殖率最高達 0. 0686 hr- 1 ，且其密度於接種後 24 hr，最高可達初始接種密度的 1. 92 倍，試驗結果亦獲致帶卵率與輪蟲區間比增殖率呈良好之線性關係，因此未來將可利用此關係，即以其帶卵率預測批次培養時輪蟲增殖趨勢；同時餌料因子試驗亦以相同微藻但不同粒徑之餌料進行測試，顯示輪蟲攝取之餌料粒徑影響其增殖速度，且餵飼粒徑較大者可有較佳之增殖現象。本研究亦依據環境與餌料因子試驗所獲致之培養條件作為半連續培養試驗參數，探討於半連續培養時餌料餵飼密度與輪蟲增殖之關係，結果顯示當餌料消耗率保持於 0. 2 ~ 0. 6 × 104 cells/ind. 之間，可保持適當之帶卵率，並提昇輪蟲增殖率，培養 64 小時後輪蟲密度達 6, 876 ind. /ml之極高密度，為初始密度 785 ind. /ml之 8. 76 倍。本研究亦已建立一高密度輪蟲養殖系統，系統包括微藻反應器與輪蟲培養槽兩部份，以進一步驗証餌料消耗率與實際養殖系統中之增殖率，系統經 104 hr培養測試後，平均餌料消耗率為 0. 4 × 104 cells/ind. ，並由放大培養過程中獲致良好之輪蟲增殖與帶卵率，終止時輪蟲數為 17, 355, 000 隻，為初始接種數 6, 780, 000 隻之 2. 56 倍，且其全程平均帶卵率亦達 0. 559 eggs/female，顯示本系統已有良好之餌料密度控制與高密度輪蟲培養能力。謝誌	i 摘要	ii Abstract	iv 目錄	vi 表目錄	ix 圖目錄	x 第一章	緒論	 1 1 - 1 	前言	 1 1 - 2 	研究目的	 2 第二章	文獻探討	 3 2 - 1 	實驗對象浮游生物簡介	 3 2 - 1 - 1 	海水輪蟲分類與型態	 3 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 	系統分類	 3 2 - 1 - 1 - 2 	型態	 3 2 - 2 	輪蟲生長估計模型	 5 2 - 3 	影響輪蟲成長之因子	 7 2 - 3 - 1 	溫度	 7 2 - 3 - 2 	鹽度	 8 2 - 3 - 3 	光照	 8 2 - 3 - 4 	pH值	 8 2 - 3 - 5 	溶氧量	 9 2 - 3 - 6 	氨氮	 9 2 - 3 - 7 	餌料及其相應球型直徑	 10 2 - 3 - 8 	餌料及其營養價	 10 2 - 3 - 9 	擬球藻	 12 2 - 3 - 10 	海水輪蟲高密度養殖	 13 第三章 材料與方法	 15 3 - 1 	系統設計概念	 15 3 - 2 	試驗材料	 16 3 - 3 	試驗量測方法	 18 3 - 3 - 1 	微藻與輪蟲量測方法	 19 3 - 3 - 1 - 1 	微藻密度量測方法	 19 3 - 3 - 1 - 2 	輪蟲密度與帶卵率量測方法	 19 3 - 3 - 2 	統計分析	 20 3 - 3 - 3 	輪蟲成長試驗	 20 3 - 3 - 4 	輪蟲環境因子試驗-溶氧因子	 20 3 - 3 - 5 	輪蟲環境因子試驗-pH值因子	 21 3 - 3 - 6 	輪蟲養份因子試驗-初始餌料餵飼密度	 21 3 - 3 - 7 	輪蟲成長因子試驗-餌料粒徑	 22 3 - 3 - 8 	半連續培養餌料密度試驗	 23 3 - 3 - 9 	高密度輪蟲培養系統試驗	 25 第四章 結果與討論	 30 4 - 1 	輪蟲成長試驗結果	 30 4 - 1 - 1 	輪蟲環境因子-溶氧因子試驗結果	 31 4 - 1 - 2 	輪蟲環境因子-pH值因子試驗結果	 34 4 - 1 - 3 	輪蟲養份因子-初始餵飼密度試驗結果	 37 4 - 1 - 4 	輪蟲養份因子-餌料粒徑因子試驗結果	 54 4 - 2 	半連續培養餌料密度試驗結果	 59 4 - 2 - 1 	高密度輪蟲培養系統試驗結果	 70 第五章 結論與建議	 76 5 - 1 	結論	 76 5 - 2 	建議	 78 第六章 參考文獻	 7...|$|E

40|$|Low density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{films are}} widespread used in agriculture for soil mulching. The use of LDPE mulching films causes the serious drawback of huge quantities of waste to be disposed of. Over {{the last years}} the growing environmental awareness has been prompting the research {{to develop a new}} generation of mulching products starting with raw materials from renewable origin. These materials have to retain their physical and mechanical properties while in use and have to be compostable or biodegradable {{at the end of their}} life, degrading via micro-organisms into carbon dioxide or methane, water and biomass. The research is focused on the development of novel biodegradable polymeric materials based on hydrolyzed proteins, derived from waste products of the leather industry. Biodegradable soil mulching coatings were realized with these biodegradable polymeric materials by means of spray techniques; the coatings were tested in a Ligustrum ovalifolium cultivation carried out inside a greenhouse. This paper describes the functionalities of the new bio-based mulching coatings, which were developed and tested in real scale greenhouse <b>cultivation</b> <b>tests.</b> During the trial, the biodegradable soil mulching materials showed suitable properties for an efficient and profitable use in agriculture. The innovative biodegradable spray coatings lasted up to 18 months. The biodegradable materials could be the environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic petro-chemical polymers and could contribute to a sustainable agriculture...|$|R
