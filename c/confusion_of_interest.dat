40|$|In {{planning}} a suitable road network, planners put into consideration factors like gradients or {{slope of the}} area, available land-use and soil type, community or national landmarks and governmental interest. These different considerations and interest make the planning process complex and as such there might be <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the decision making. The use of GIS and Multi-criteria analysis has helped planners to achieve desired and more accurate results and as such reducing the complex nature in the planning process allowing different stakeholders to reach a general conclusion. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) prevents the imposition of limit on the form of criteria and gives opportunity to decision makers to enter their own judgments. This provides a better communication among the decision makers and the entire community and as such creating a more open choice for analysis and possible changes if necessary. The aim of this thesis is to introduce {{the possibility of using}} GIS and MCA in road path planning in Nigeria, using Lokoja, the capital of Kogi state as a case study. In actualizing the aim, satellite images of the area of study was obtained from the Landsat home page and analyzed to derive the land-use map. The land-use over the area of study was classified into five different classes using the unsupervised method of classification. A DEM over the area of study was downloaded from the website of the Consortium of Spatial information (CSI) and the DEM was used to derive the slope map over the area of study and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used in weighting the criterions according to preference. As the conclusion of the analysis, a road path between two points was obtained. The start point of the road was located on an approximate coordinate of 219002, 958986 meters and the destination point on an approximate coordinate of 320322, 878101 meters. The start and destination point were selected randomly without any pre-knowledge of the area. The thesis has succeeded in showing {{that it is possible to}} determine a road path between two points using Geographic information system (GIS) and Multi-criteria analysis in Nigeria...|$|E

Its thesis is that a primary source <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> in conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> doctrine is its failure to clearly articulate and answer the central questions which {{lie at the heart}} of the subject. In essence it argues that to remedy this confusion we need to rethink attorney conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> doctrine so that it focuses more clearly on articulating and answering these central questions...|$|R

50|$|Much {{confusion}} {{is caused by}} and much mis-information given about this method <b>of</b> calculating <b>interest.</b> Because <b>of</b> its complexity for consumers, advisors from Motley Fool (2005) to Credit Advisors (2005) advise consumers to be very wary of this method (unless they can analyze it and achieve true value from it). Despite the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> variable <b>interest</b> rates, the bank using this method does have a rationale; that is it costs the bank in strategic opportunity costs to vary the amount loaned from month-to-month, {{because they have to}} adjust assets to find the money to loan when it is suddenly borrowed, and find {{something to do with the}} money when it is paid back. In that sense, the two-cycle average daily balance can be likened to electric charges for industrial clients, in which the charge is based upon the peak usage rather than the actual usage. And, in fact, this method <b>of</b> charging <b>interest</b> is often used for business cardholders as stated above. These accounts often have much higher credit limits than typically consumer accounts (perhaps tens or hundreds of thousands instead of just thousands).|$|R

40|$|An asymmetric-RLL(d_ 1,k_ 1,d_ 0,k_ 0) {{system is}} a subshift of { 0, 1 }^ Z with run of 1 and 0 {{restricted}} to S=[d_ 1,k_ 1]⊆ N_ 0 = N∪{ 0 } and S'=[d_ 0,k_ 0]⊆ N_ 0 respectively. We extend this concept to the case when S and S' are arbitrary subsets of N_ 0 and {{we call it a}} (S,S') -gap shift. Moreover, for i= 1, 2, if X_i is a synchronized system generated by V_i={v^iα_i:α_i v^iα_i∈ B(X_i),α_i⊆ v^i} where α_i is a synchronizing word for X_i, then a natural generalization of (S,S') -gap shifts is a coded system Z generated by {v^ 1 α_ 1 v^ 2 α_ 2 :v^iα_i∈ V_i, i= 1, 2 } and called the intertwined system. We investigate the dynamical properties of Z with respect to X_ 1 and X_ 2. Comment: We like to withdraw, because by some alterations, the main results of sections two and three has been published in " British Journal of Mathematics & Computer Science". Moreover, we are working on another paper where among other things will also include the remaining results of this paper. We ought to withdraw the paper, to prevent the possible <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> those <b>interested</b> in our result...|$|R
