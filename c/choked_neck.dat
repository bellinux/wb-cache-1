With wild whoops he pulled another gun and shot at the mirror, the lamps. He shot the neck off a bottle and drank till he <b>choked,</b> his <b>neck</b> corded, bulging, and purple.

500|$|Horse harness, ("trace" [...] or [...] "breast"): Throughout {{the ancient}} world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness {{was used for}} {{harnessing}} horses that pulled carts; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly <b>choked</b> at the <b>neck.</b> A painting on a lacquerware box from the State of Chu, dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft. The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a breast strap, which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Eventually, the horse collar was invented in China, at least by the 5th century.|$|R

Rushing refused, and Martin told him that {{on the way back to}} Lake Charles the woman threatened to report him for rape.

5000|$|In September 2011 Li {{was accused}} of {{domestic}} violence by his American wife, Kim Lee, also known as Li Jin (...) [...] Lee had posted photos of bruises on various parts of her body on Sina Weibo - a Chinese microblog website similar to Twitter. While Li Yang at first {{did not respond to}} the allegations, he later admitted the accusations were true and apologized via his official microblog to his wife and three children. However, he also criticized her for discussing private things in public. On October 27, Li and his wife filed for divorce. The case gained national attention and raised discussions over domestic violence and was subject of a feature presentation on the TV program Legal Report. Li said he [...] "wholeheartedly" [...] apologised to his wife and three daughters for [...] "committing domestic violence". He added: [...] "This has caused them serious physical and mental damage". Mr Li's statement came more than a week after his wife, Kim Lee, posted photographs of her bloodied and bruised face on the internet, opening her husband to a barrage of criticism." [...] You knocked me to the floor. You sat on my back. You <b>choked</b> my <b>neck</b> with both hands and slammed my head into the floor," [...] she wrote. She added that Li had only stopped after one of their three daughters intervened. Afterwards, she said Li had made a planned appearance on Chinese television as she was being treated in hospital. [...] "Seeing that you were having make-up applied for a TV appearance while I was in hospital hurts more than you slamming my head on the floor," [...] she wrote on Weibo. According to a national survey by the All China Women's Federation in 2009, one-third of Chinese homes have seen incidents of domestic abuse, with 85 percent of them directed against women.|$|R
60|$|Sir Nigel had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when the}} mist seemed to thin in the valley, and to shred away into long ragged clouds which trailed from {{the edges of}} the cliffs. The gorge in which they had camped was a mere wedge-shaped cleft among the hills, three-quarters of a mile deep, with the small rugged rising upon which they stood at the further end, and the brown crags walling it in on three sides. As the mist parted, and the sun broke through, it gleamed and shimmered with dazzling brightness upon the armor and headpieces of a vast body of horsemen who stretched across the barranca from one cliff to the other, and extended backwards until their rear guard were far out upon the plain beyond. Line after line, and rank after rank, they <b>choked</b> the <b>neck</b> of the valley with a long vista of tossing pennons, twinkling lances, waving plumes and streaming banderoles, while the curvets and gambades of the chargers lent a constant motion and shimmer to the glittering, many-colored mass. A yell of exultation, and a forest of waving steel through the length and breadth of their column, announced that they could at last see their entrapped enemies, while the swelling notes of a hundred bugles and drums, mixed with the clash of Moorish cymbals, broke forth into a proud peal of martial triumph. Strange it was to these gallant and sparkling cavaliers of Spain to look upon this handful of men upon the hill, the thin lines of bowmen, the knots of knights and men-at-arms with armor rusted and discolored from long service, and to learn that these were indeed the soldiers whose fame and prowess had been the camp-fire talk of every army in Christendom. Very still and silent they stood, leaning upon their bows, while their leaders took counsel together in front of them. No clang of bugle rose from their stern ranks, but in the centre waved the leopards of England, on the right the ensign of their Company with the roses of Loring, and on the left, over three score of Welsh bowmen, there floated the red banner of Merlin with the boars'-heads of the Buttesthorns. Gravely and sedately they stood beneath the morning sun waiting for the onslaught of their foemen.|$|R
5000|$|Lucky Shimoda(ラッキー下田) (20 yrs old)Shimoda, like Megumi, is {{a member}} of the Naniwa wrestling team and is {{considered}} as their most skilled pro-wrestler, specializing in grapples and throws. She is also their sexiest most buxom member. When fighting in the ring, she is a flamboyant attention-seeker who has a strong tendency for humiliating her opponents during matches. By the time Mao made her debut in her [...] "Mao Tiger" [...] pro-wrestler persona, Lucky Shimoda was already the defending champion in women's wrestling. Shimoda first met Mao when the latter accompanied her grandfather's entourage to the wrestling gym where the Naniwa Women's Wrestling team were practicing in the hopes of preparing Mao for Primat. Initially antagonistic to both Mao and Megumi, she saw Mao as a strict competition upon seeing her enter the gym, and challenged her afterwards to decide whether or not Mao deserves to wear the mantle of the Mao Tiger, only to be miserably defeated by Mao's family style brand of martial arts. Humiliated, Shimoda seek to return the favor by participating as Mao's opponent in her debut as Mao Tiger; this was easily consented as she was the reigning female wrestling champion at that time. It is also for this reason why Cao presented her with a bouquet of flowers as a special guest audience, right before proceeding to shake Mao's hand. But Shimoda, impatient to start the match, quickly strode over to Mao's corner and used the bouquet Cao just gave her to whack Mao over the head. Lucky Shimoda began the match with her inexperienced foe at an obvious disadvantage, since the it was pro-wrestling and thus, Mao could not resort into using the style her grandfather taught her. That, along with the fact that Shimoda witnessed Mao's training with Megumi enabled the much experienced wrestler to see through Mao's pattern of attacks allowed Shimoda to effectively counter them. After hitting Mao with the bouquet, Shimoda quickly followed with a descending elbow to Mao's lower back, doubling her over even more, before pinning her to the nearest corner post with her forearm <b>choking</b> Mao's <b>neck.</b> She then whispers some words audible only to Mao, saying that [...] "even though she's (Mao) garbed in a revealing pro-wrestler's outfit, she is no wrestler and that she will meet a brand new Lucky Shimoda in this ring - one who won't lose so easily in this match, and she (Mao) shall be the stepping stone to her (Shimoda) success". She soon becomes a sort of cheerleader, when Mao and Megumi compete in Prime Mat.|$|R
