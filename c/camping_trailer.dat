500|$|On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported [...] {{from the}} Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He had elected {{to serve as}} his own attorney, and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Concealed behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle. The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a <b>camping</b> <b>trailer</b> on Maroon Lake, [...] south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way. Three days later, he stole a car {{at the edge of}} Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days. In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{trailers}} prevail within the motorcycle camping trailers category: clamshell and platform camper trailers. Fabric material {{is attached to}} the top and bottom halves of the clamshell trailer. The tent is created when the trailer is opened. Once a platform <b>camping</b> <b>trailer</b> is opened, however, the tent is pitched on it. These platform style camping trailers are larger than clamshell camping trailers and can fit full-sized to king-sized air mattresses. Most often, clamshells can only accommodate a single occupant.|$|E
50|$|After WWII Plon {{was chosen}} as the site for King Alfred School, a {{secondary}} school for British Forces children under the headmastership of Freddie Spencer Chapman with his staff at the Ruhleben Barracks site, As such the town holds a place of affection with many former pupils across the world and the declining number of surviving teachers and their families. King Alfred School, Plön can rightly claim to be the first fully comprehensive school in the UK system. This school existed from 1948 to 1959. The Ruhleben Barracks site had been the German Navy U-Boat training school and has now reverted to a similar function as M.U.S the non-commissioned officer school.

50|$|Like all brands, Instant Coffee {{has worked}} hard to ensure certain ideas are {{associated}} with its name. The Instant Coffee brand evokes feelings of conviviality; it’s self-aware but fun. This brand identity is the result of collective’s consistent production of art-related events in which the distinction between artwork and audience is blurred. This strong emphasis on the social aspect of art connects Instant Coffee to the broader artworld trend of relational aesthetics. Often an Instant Coffee event consists of works made in a single format that flies below the radar of medium specificity, such as the bumper sticker or stencil, to allow a broad range of artists, and the artistically-inclined, to participate. The Urban Disco Trailer, a retrofitted <b>camping</b> <b>trailer,</b> was an early platform used to present artworks in this mode. In more recent projects, the collective has focused on creating a participatory environment for its audience. The Instant Coffee Bass-Bed, contained a subwoofer connected to a sound system that made the bed vibrate. Instant Coffee’s Nooks created four moveable replicas of a kitchen nook, complete with window, inside of which audiences could sit and enjoy a series of art-related events. An ongoing project, the Light Bar reconstructs the gallery as a bar complete with full spectrum light therapy units to fight Seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

50|$|Domestic <b>Trailers</b> (including <b>camping</b> <b>trailers)</b> for use {{on public}} {{highways}} often have different tires than those seen on cars.

50|$|Business ventures {{have also}} been Bethany’s primary source of funding through the years.
