40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the actor model with real-time, including deadlines associated with messages, and explicit application-level scheduling policies, e. g.,"earliest deadline first" which can be associated with individual actors. Schedulability analysis in this setting amounts to checking whether, given a scheduling policy for each actor, every task is processed within its designated deadline. To check schedulability, we introduce a compositional automata-theoretic approach, based on maximal use of model checking combined with testing. Behavioral interfaces define what an actor expects from the environment, and the deadlines for messages given these assumptions. We use model checking to verify that actors match their behavioral interfaces. We extend timed automata refinement with the notion of deadlines and use it to define compatibility of actor environments with the behavioral interfaces. Model checking of compatibility is computationally hard, so we propose a special testing process. We show that the analyses are decidable and automate the process using the Uppaal model <b>checke...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{delivery}} of fracture work {{to the tip of}} an advancing planar crack is strongly reduced by surface phonon emission, leading to forbidden ranges of crack speed.

We also {{show that the}} energy release rate which enters the Griffith criterion for the crack advance can be described as the product of the continuum solution with a function that only depends on the lattice geometry and describes the lattice influence on the phonon emission. Simulations are performed using a new finite element model for simulating elasticity and fractures. The model, built to allow fast and very large three-dimensional simulations, is applied to the simplified case of two dimensional samples.

40|$|It is {{notoriously}} difficult to develop reliable, high-performance distributed systems that run over asynchronous networks. Even if a distributed system {{is based on}} a well-understood distributed algorithm, its implementation can contain errors arising from complexities of realistic distributed environments or simply coding errors. Many of these errors can only manifest after the system has been running for a long time, has developed a complex topology, and has experienced a particular sequence of low-probability events such as node resets. Model checking or systematic state space exploration, which has been used for testing of centralized systems, is also not effective for testing of distributed applications. The aim of these techniques is to exhaustively explore all the reachable states and verify some user-specified invariants on them. Although effective for small software systems, for more complex systems such as distributed systems the exponential increase in number of explored states, manifests itself as a problem at the very early stages of search.

40|$|Finding {{errors in}} {{software}} {{is a difficult}} problem: millions of dollars are spent in testing and debugging, yet latent bugs continue to be discovered even in thoroughly tested programs. Apart from the undesirable effects of producing incorrect results, crashing systems, and corrupting data, bugs also raise security concerns: memory-safety errors like buffer overruns and stale pointer dereferences can be exploited by malicious agents to acquire confidential data or seriously compromise the target system, sometimes in undetectable ways. A key feature of the C programming language {{is that it allows}} low-level control over memory usage and runtime behavior; this flexibility is crucial for many programming set-tings, such as at the system level, and is one reason why C programs continue to be widely used today. However, this flexibility is achieved at the price of safety: the language syntax is too weak to prevent type errors and memory-safety errors from occurring at runtime. This work explores three related approaches to detect errors in C programs via runtime monitoring. The Memory-Safety Enforcer is a tool that detects memory-safety errors at runtime, and can be used for both security and debugging. The Sensitive Location <b>Checke...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools {{encourage}} {{users to}} codify {{the requirements for}} the design of a system early in the development process. They often use graphical formalisms, simulation, and prototyping to help express ideas concisely and unambiguously. Some tools provide little more than syntax checking but others can test the model for reachability of conditions, nondeterminism, or deadlock. In this paper, we present an example of how commercial CASE tools can be linked with formal methods to build more thorough forms of analysis into these tools. The CASE tool STATEMATE [12] makes use of an extended state transition notation called statecharts. We have formalized the semantics of statecharts by embedding them in the logical framework of an interactive proof-assistant system called HOL. A software interface is provided to extract a statechart directly from the STATEMATE database and translate it into a textual representation that can be directly input into the HOL system. Using HOL in combination with Voss, a binary decision diagram-based verification tool, we have developed a model checker for statecharts, which tests whether an operational specification, given by a statechart, satisfies a descriptive specification of the system requirements. The model checking procedure is a simple higher-order logic function which executes the semantics of statecharts in Voss.

This predisposes them to potential drug–drug interactions (DDIs), {{which can lead to}} an increase in morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and health care cost. Methods: This was a 30 -month retrospective study that reviewed the medical case records of consenting adult CKD patients from January 2014 to June 2016. The Medscape drug reference database was used to evaluate patients’ medications for potential DDIs. Results: This study involved 123 adult CKD patients (63 [51. 22 %] males and 60 [48. 78 %] females) {{with a mean age of}} 53. 81 ± 16. 03  years. The most common comorbid conditions were hypertension (112 [91. 10 %]) and diabetes mellitus (45 [36. 60 %]). Regarding the form of nephrological interventions being offered, the majority of the respondents - 66 (53. 66 %) were on maintenance dialysis, followed by 53 (43. 09 %) respondents on conservative care, while 4 (3. 25 %) respondents were on renal transplantation. A total of 1264 prescriptions were made, and the mean number of prescribed medications per patient was 10. 28 ± 3. 85. The most frequently prescribed medications were furosemide (88 [71. 6 %]), heparin (67 [54. 47 %]), lisinopril (65  [52. 9 %]), oral calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (63 [51. 2 %]), α-calcidol (62 [50. 4 %]), and erythropoietin (61 [49. 6 %]). A total number of 1851 potential DDIs were observed among 118 patients. The prevalence of potential DDIs in this study was 78. 0 %, while the mean DDI per prescription was 1. 50. Among the potential DDIs observed, the severity was mild in 639 (34. 5 %) patients, moderate in 1160 (62. 7 %) patients, and major in 51 (2. 8 %) patients and only 1 (0. 1 %) patient was of contraindicated drug combination. The most frequent DDIs’ pattern observed was between oral CaCO 3 and oral ferrous sulfate. There was a statistically significant association between the number of prescribed medications and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; pre-ESRD and ESRD staging) with a P-value of 0. 00000119. This implies that the number of prescribed medications increases as the eGFR declines in advance CKD stage patients. Conclusion: Most of these interactions have moderate severity and delayed onset, hence the need to follow-up these patients after prescription in order to reduce associated morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and health care cost. Physicians and clinical pharmacists should utilise available interaction software to avoid harmful DDIs in these patients.
