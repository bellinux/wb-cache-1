5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> to the boiler rooms.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{deposited}} by Ledingham {{show that}} each house had a ground area of about 350 sq. ft.(the projecting end of terrace houses were slightly larger) with a frontage of about 18ft. On {{the ground floor}} front was a living room containing a range. To the rear was a scullery with a sink and access to a back yard containing an ash house, <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> and a gate to a service road. On the first floor front was a bedroom with a fireplace and walk in wardrobe. On the mezzanine level was a WC.|$|E
25|$|The {{congregation}} dwindled and {{the fabric}} of the church fell into disrepair during the 18th and early 19th century. In 1843 the south porch was being used as a <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> and the roof was leaking. In the 1850s George Robinson was appointed as vicar and revitalised the church. He rebuilt the vicarage for his 13 children, established a church school, and raised money for the restoration of the church itself. This included the removal of box pews, restoration of the windows and rebuilding of the arches in the nave. Gas lighting was installed, the roof rebuilt and walls re-plastered. The total cost was about £4,000 pounds and much of the restoration work was undertaken by Benjamin Ferrey 1861-1863. In parallel with the restoration of the building the number of services increased and the congregation grew despite some conflicts with parishioners about his style of preaching. Robinson left in 1870 and was replaced by Joseph Gray who continued to develop the church and its charitable works both locally and in support of missionaries around the world. During his incumbency the churchyard became full and a new cemetery was developed.|$|E

This {{was built in the}} 14th century but contains stones from the previous building, which show oblique tooling found in Norman architecture. The two-storey hall is [...] long and [...] wide. It was originally used as the refectory, with a window being added by Bishop Beckington in the 15th century, and later became a <b>coal</b> <b>store.</b> The hall also has arches into bays and an ogee-headed recess which may have been an aumbry. At the eastern end of the hall is a parlour on the ground floor and, on the first floor, is a dormitory. The chapel next to the dormitory can be see through a squint which is unusually combined with a piscina.|$|E
500|$|The South station {{had five}} {{generating}} sets and the North station had four. Each generating set had a bunker for 1,250 tonnes of coal, fed by a conveyor from the <b>coal</b> <b>store.</b> This conveyor belt system {{was built by}} E.N. Mackley & Co, Gateshead. Each bunker fed coal into a pulveriser, manufactured by Raymond. From here it was fed into a boiler in powder form and burned. All of the boilers were suspended from the boiler houses' steel frames, and were made by Clarke Chapman Group Ltd, Gateshead. The boilers were forged in Sheffield, {{the first of the}} nine arriving at Stella South in 1953. At 62tonnes, the boilers were at the time the largest ever made in the UK. The boilers were of the radiant-heat type, comprising a water-cooled combustion chamber, controlled-type superheater and an economiser. Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F. Each boiler was equipped with two forced and two induced Howden fans, twenty-two electrically operated Clyde soot blowers, an automatic control system made by Bailey and Sturtevant electrostatic precipitators. [...] Each station was designed to burn 2,000 tonnes of bituminous coal a day.|$|E

Old Bowlish House, which now offers pre-arranged tours, dates from the first half of the 17th century and was remodelled in about 1720 in the Palladian style. Bowlish House, also in the Palladian style and now a hotel and restaurant, was built in 1732 by a prosperous local clothier; a spring is reported to rise in the cellar. Park House in Forum Lane dates to about 1700 and was modified about 1750. Others among the 19 grade II listed buildings in Bowlish include Coombe House, which was built c. 1820; 14, 15 and 16 Combe Lane, which were built around 1700 with 18th-century alterations; 26 to 29 Combe Lane, which is a former mill built around 1700 and enlarged in 1850; and 30 and 31 Combe Lane, which are two weaver's cottages dating to about 1850. What is now a stained glass studio in Ham Lane was formerly a <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> attached to a stable which belonged to the public house next door, The Butcher's Arms, which ceased trading in 1860. The studio has provided stained glass for, among others, the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost, Midsomer Norton. As a consequence of its historic nature, Bowlish is included within Shepton Mallet's conservation area and is a site of special archaeological interest.|$|E

500|$|The complex {{was first}} {{opened to the}} public on Good Friday 1976. [...] The {{official}} reopening, on 26 October 1976 (exactly 100 years after Number 2 Engine was first fired up), came after the <b>coal</b> <b>store</b> was converted into an exhibition and educational area. [...] At this time, it was named the Brighton and Hove Engineerium; the complex was given its present name on 30 May 1981. [...] By this time, about 1,500 exhibits were on display, and the boilers and Number 2 Engine were fired up every weekend. [...] The cost of running the Engineerium and employing 18 people (including six professional engineers) was running at about £250,000 per year. [...] Although the Southern Water Authority, which still owned the site, paid for improvements in 1983, and grants came in from East Sussex County Council and Hove Borough Council, there was no financial backing from central government—although the Engineerium was acknowledged as a national and international leader in industrial heritage and [...] "the world's only centre for the teaching of engineering conservation". [...] (Employees of the Engineerium have helped to set up or renovate more than 20 similar institutions across the world, and it was designated as England's South East Regional Centre during Industrial Heritage Year in 1993.) [...] The centre's second royal visit, by the Duke of Kent in 1993, coincided with a fundraising plea for £4 million, to be spent on extensions to the exhibition space and workshop; Minns also applied unsuccessfully for a National Lottery grant. [...] Vodafone paid for the right to attach a mobile phone mast to the chimney, though.|$|E

The design staff was generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired boilers for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being oil-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the <b>coal,</b> <b>stored</b> in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts.
