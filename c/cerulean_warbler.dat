50|$|In {{fragmented}} forest areas, this bird {{is vulnerable to}} nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird. This bird's numbers are declining faster than any other warbler species in the USA; its population in 2006 was less than one-fifth {{of what it was}} 40 years before. The American Bird Conservancy (ABC) is working with its Colombian partner, Fundación ProAves, to protect wintering habitat for cerulean warblers and other migrating songbirds. Together they have created the <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> Bird Reserve, the first protected area created for a neotropical migrant. In an effort to advance protection of the <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler,</b> ABC and its South American partners (Fundacion ProAves, ECOAN and Fundacion Jocotoco), in 2009 produced a <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> Wintering Ground Conservation Plan.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{was founded}} in 2005 by Fundación ProAves, a {{non-profit}} environmental organization that owns and manages several reserves in Colombia, {{with the assistance of}} the American Bird Conservancy. It was established to provide an area of protected habitat for migratory birds from North America such as the <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler</b> as well as locally threatened species. The reserve has incorporated a 15 ha coffee farm, producing shade-grown coffee which it promotes and sells as conservation-friendly <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> Coffee to cover the operating costs of the reserve.|$|E

5000|$|The area is {{distinctive}} {{for having}} tree species typically found further south, and reaching their northern limits. One example is pitch pine (Pinus rigida).

There is high bird diversity, including the <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler,</b> considered nationally endangered owing {{to the destruction of}} forests. Although the most important factor producing the fauna and flora is likely the bed rock, the moderating effect of the Great Lakes may also be factor.

5000|$|The exposed {{sandstone}} {{walls of}} Parfrey's glen contain pebbles and boulders of embedded quartzite. The walls {{were covered with}} moss and remained moist from seepage before the 2010 floods, which washed away nearly all vegetation in the glen. The mosses and ferns have yet to grow back as of September 2016. The glen has a cool and shaded climate. This results in a flora more typical of northern Wisconsin with yellow birch, mountain maple, and red elder and several rare plant species, including the federally threatened northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense) and state-threatened round stemmed false foxglove (Agalinus gattingeri). Additional rare species found here include cliff goldenrod (Solidago sciaphila), and two state-threatened birds, the <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga cerulea) and Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens).

In a 1930 paper, Pierce noted the unusual (for the area) birds he had spotted between 1923 and 1928. Among these were one specimen each of the ruffed grouse (1923), <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler</b> (1927), and in 1928 a yellow-bellied flycatcher and a Connecticut warbler. As late as 1945, the Monti woods were home to at least 62 species of bird; the area was used as one of fourteen birding stations in the state. The woods contained the largest confirmed populations of gray-cheeked thrushes, bobolinks, eastern vesper sparrows, eastern field sparrows, and ruby-crowned kinglets in the state during the Spring of 1945.

50|$|By 2004, Richard, in middle-age, {{has finally}} found {{success as a}} minor indie rock star. His {{breakthrough}} album Nameless Lake was secretly inspired by his affair with Patty at the lakeside cabin. Richard is uncomfortable with commercial success, and he burns through his new-found money. Walter, {{who has been working}} in Washington, D.C., for an unorthodox environmental organization called the Cerulean Mountain Trust, calls him to enlist his help for a personal project. The Trust is funded by a coal mining magnate who wants to strip mine a section of West Virginia territory before turning it into a preserve for the <b>cerulean</b> <b>warbler,</b> a songbird. Walter hopes to use some of the Trust's funding for his pet project, a campaign against human overpopulation, the common factor behind all his environmental concerns. Believing that Richard's rock star reputation could greatly help the campaign, Walter meets up with him, and Richard is introduced to Walter's beautiful young assistant, Lalitha.

40|$|<b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> {{breeding}} distributions {{are often}} clustered, {{which suggests that}} settlement is induced by certain external cues, such as vegetation structure. However, habitat selection studies have been inconsistent when reporting microhabitat structure associated with <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> settlement. In this study I assessed the role of both social information and habitat structure on <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> settlement and distribution. I tested the role of social information on male <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> settlement decisions by broadcasting conspecific vocalizations in areas that had low relative abundance. I assessed the influence of habitat structure on male <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> occurrence and density by incorporating lidar-derived metrics of canopy structure into habitat models. Conspecific social information {{had no effect on}} <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> settlement; however, it is unknown how many individuals were exposed to the settlement cues. Canopy structure variables only improved density habitat models. The top model examining the relationship of habitat variables to <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> occurrence indicated that occurrence was more likely on northeast facing slopes, lower elevations, steeper slopes, and in areas with greater hickory (Carya sp.) basal area (m 2 /ha). Other influential variables were a tall canopy and greater total basal area (m 2 /ha) and tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera) basal area (m 2 /ha). The top models examining the relationship of habitat variables to <b>Cerulean</b> <b>Warbler</b> density indicated that high-use areas are more likely to exist on steeper slopes, with less total basal area (m 2 /ha) and large trees (≥ 53 cm DBH), more white oak (Quercus alba) basal area (m 2 /ha), and contain a homogeneous horizontal and vertical canopy structure. Other influential variables were areas lower in elevation with more small shrubs and saplings ≥ 3 < 10 cm DBH per ha.
