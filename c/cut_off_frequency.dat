40|$|A thermal–hydraulic {{system code}} is an {{essential}} tool for the design and safety analysis of a nuclear power plant, and its accuracy quantification {{is very important for}} the code assessment and applications. The fast Fourier transform-based method (FFTBM) by signal mirroring (FFTBM-SM) has been used to quantify the accuracy of a system code by using a comparison of the experimental data and the calculated results. The method is an improved version of the FFTBM, and it is known that the FFTBM-SM judges the code accuracy in a more consistent and unbiased way. However, in some applications, unrealistic results have been obtained. In this study, it was found that accuracy quantification by FFTBM-SM is dependent on the frequency spectrum of the fast Fourier transform of experimental and error signals. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} reduce the frequency dependency of FFTBM-SM evaluation. For this, it was proposed to reduce the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>frequency,</b> which was introduced to cut off spurious contributions, in FFTBM-SM.
