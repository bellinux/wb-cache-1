In view of this, {{the correlation between the}} <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> and the geological characteristics as well as hydraulic fracturing was analyzed. It is shown that fracture and bedding (hereinafter collectively referred to as fractures) in faults are the internal cause for <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> and hydraulic fracturing is the external cause. Then, the mechanism of <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> was clarified. As the fracturing fluid flows along a certain passage into the natural fracture, the pore pressure in the fracture rises. When the critical pressure is reached, the natural fracture is activated to move, and consequently <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> occurs. Fluid may flow along three pathways, i. e., the hydraulic fracture, the axial fracture along the borehole axis created during hydraulic fracturing and the micro-annulus of cement sheath induced by repeated fracturing. Finally, some specific preventive measures were put forward. First, install packers in the whole sections with fractures and beddings. Second, improve the properties of slurry to avoid the formation of micro-annulus of cement sheath. And third, adopt the fracturing technologies to avoid the casing from repeated high pressure.

40|$|Due to {{downhole}} complexities, shale-gas {{horizontal well}} fracturing in the Sichuan Basin suffered from <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> {{and failure to}} apply the technique of cable-conveyed perforation bridge plug. In view of these problems, a new technique of staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by sand filling is employed. Based on theoretical analyses and field tests, a design of optimized parameters of coiled tubing-conveyed multi-cluster sand-blasting perforation and temporary plugging by sand filling was proposed. It was applied in the horizontal Well ZJ- 1 in which <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> occurred. The following results are achieved in field operations. First, this technique enables selective staged fracturing in horizontal sections. Second, this technique can realize massive staged fracturing credibly without mechanical plugging, with the operating efficiency equivalent to the conventional bridge plug staged fracturing. Third, full-hole is preserved after fracturing, thus {{it is possible to}} directly conduct an open flow test without time consumption of a wiper trip. The staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by sand filling facilitated the 14 -stage fracturing in Well ZJ- 1, with similar SRV to that achieved by conventional bridge plug staged fracturing and higher gas yield than neighboring wells on the same well pad. Thus, a new and effective technique is presented in multi-cluster staged volume fracturing of shale gas horizontal wells...|$|E

Active casing structures with embedded piezoelectric actuators {{appear to be a}} promising solution. They can control static and dynamic tip clearance, compensate for uneven deflections, and accomplish electromechanical coupling at the material level. In addition, they have a compact design. To assess the feasibility of this concept and assist the development of these novel structures, the NASA Lewis Research Center developed in-house computational capabilities for composite structures with piezoelectric actuators and sensors, and subsequently used them to simulate candidate active casing structures.

So, the collapse experiments were performed on the YAW- 200 pressure testing machine by using one production casing which is often used in the oilfield and then the reshaping test of deformed casing (C 110) was performed in turn by using two spinning casing swages of which the diameter is 126  mm and 129  mm respectively. The continuous rotator and thrust bearing were used to provide the torque and reshaping force respectively in the repairing process. The reshaping force and torque required to reshape the deformed <b>casing,</b> the <b>deformation</b> law and the springback value of deformed casing were obtained.

Furthermore, in order to ensure the safety and reliability of {{the implementation of}} post-production technologies, the mechanical properties of deformed casing before and after reshaping were tested. It was found that all the mechanical parameters of the deformed casing after reshaping reduced, which resulted in the decrease of the strength of the reshaped casing.

40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory was {{requested}} {{to conduct a}} literature survey for the best available cement {{to use in the}} proposed casing patch as part of the Geothermal Drilling Organization (GDO) project on remediation of deformed casings. A total of 50 wells has been identified with deformed production casing in Unocal's portion of The Geysers geothermal field. Reduced internal diameter and casing doglegs result in lost production and the possible need for abandonment. The cause of the deformations is believed to be formation movement along fault planes and/or along weaker layers or interfaces between high impedance contrast media. Apparently, it is unclear whether shear or axial compression is the dominant failure mechanism. A procedure to address the <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> and avoid abandonment of these wells has been developed as described in the Geysers Deformed Casing Remediation Proposal. The proposed remediation procedure involves isolation of the zone of interest with an inflatable packer, milling the deformed casing and cementing a 7 inch diameter liner to extend approximately 100 ft above and 100 ft below the milled zone. During the milling operation {{it is possible that the}} original cement and surrounding formation may slough away. In order to specify a suitable cement formulation for the casing patch it is first necessary to identify and understand the deformation mechanism/s operating in The Geysers field. Subsequently, the required cement mechanical properties to withstand further deformation of the repaired system must be defined. From this information it can be determined whether available cement formulations meet these requirements. In addition to The Geysers, other geothermal fields are at possible risk of <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> due to subsidence, seismic activity, lateral and vertical formation movement or other processes. Therefore, the proposed remediation procedure may have applications in other fields.

The casing length is not {{significantly}} long, so that the pipe body weight does not cause a tremendous axial load. However, the load caused by bending effect needs to be thoroughly analyzed and considered in the selection of the proper casing. Since there is a horizontal displacement around the surface, which could result in <b>casing</b> <b>deformation,</b> all the casings may produce an extra axial load that is generated by bending.

40|$|In {{the life}} of a well, the cement sheath not only {{provides}} zonal isolation but also supports casing and increases casing-collapse resistance. Due to the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions, the cement sheath {{plays an important role in}} maintaining wellbore integrity. During the production process in HPHT wells, the pressure differential inside the casing and the surrounding formation is larger than the conventional wells. The stress induced by fluid withdrawal in highly compact reservoirs can cause the cement and the casing failure in these wells. These present a greater challenge to the wellbore integrity than the conventional wells. To have reliable data, extensive experimental work on Class G cement was carried out to measure the principal parameters for mechanical structural calculations. The experiment was also set up to simulate conditions under which cement low-cycle fatigue failure could occur. Zero-based cyclic pressure was applied to the casing in the cement low-cycle fatigue test. Three types of cement (72 -lbm/ft 3, 101 -lbm/ft 3 and 118 -lbm/ft 3) were cured and tested at 300 ?F to study the cement mechanical properties under high-temperature conditions over the long term. The tests included a 1 -year mechanical properties measurement such as compressive strength development; i. e., Young?s modulus and Poisson?s ratio. Finite element methods (FEM) were used to study the <b>casing</b> buckling <b>deformation</b> characteristics of reservoir compaction in some south Texas wells. The 2 D and 3 D FEM models were built to study the effects of mechanical properties and reservoir compaction on HPHT well integrity. As the confining pressure increases, the cement shows more plasticity and can withstand more pressure cycles. The cement with a higher Poisson?s ratio and lower Young?s modulus showed better low-cycle fatigue behavior. Casing collapse resistance is very sensitive to void location, cement Poisson?s ratio, cement Young?s modulus, and pore pressure. Casing eccentricity and voids shape have minor effect on the casing-collapse resistance. Casing shear failure, tension failure, and buckling failure are the most likely failure modes in reservoir compaction. For different casing wall thickness, the critical buckling strain is almost identical. This study presents a better understanding of casing failure and cement failure in HPHT wells. The results of the study will help improve cement and casing design to maintain wellbore integrity that can in turn be expected to extend throughout {{the life of}} the well...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of fluid pressure during reservoir production promotes {{changes in the}} effective and total stress distribution within the reservoir and the surrounding strata. This stress evolution is responsible for many problems encountered during production (e. g. fault reactivation, <b>casing</b> <b>deformation).</b> This work {{presents the results of}} an extensive series of 3 D numerical hydro-mechanical coupled analyses that study the influence of reservoir geometry and material properties on the reservoir stress path. The stress path is defined in terms of parameters that quantify the amount of stress arching and stress anisotropy that occur during reservoir production. The coupled simulations are performed by explicitly coupling independent commercial geomechanical and flow simulators. It is shown that stress arching is important in reservoirs with low aspect ratios that are less stiff than the bounding material. In such cases, the stresses will not significantly evolve in the reservoir, and stress evolution occurs in the over- and sideburden. Stiff reservoirs, relative to the bounding rock, exhibit negligible stress arching regardless of the geometry. Stress anisotropy reduces with {{reduction of}} the Young's modulus of the bounding material, especially for low aspect ratio reservoirs, but as the reservoir extends in either or both of the horizontal directions, the reservoir deforms uniaxially and the horizontal stress evolution is governed by the Poisson's ratio of the reservoir.

30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing <b>casing</b> <b>deformation,</b> supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|E

In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug.

40|$|Recovered core {{samples from}} the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), located near Parkfield, CA, offer a unique {{opportunity}} to study the products of faulting and to learn about the mechanisms of slip at 3 km depth. <b>Casing</b> <b>deformation</b> reflects active creep along two strands of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) at SAFOD. The two fault strands are referred to as the Southwest Deforming Zone (SDZ) at 3194 m measured depth (MD) and the Central Deforming Zone (CDZ) at 3301 m MD. The SDZ and CDZ contain remarkably similar gouge layers, both of which consist of a clay-bearing, ultrafine grain matrix containing survivor clasts of sandstone and serpentinite. The two gouges have sharp boundary contacts with the adjacent rocks. We have used X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) imaging, at two different sampling resolutions, to investigate the mesoscale and microscale structure of the fault zone, specifically to characterize the shape, preferred orientation, and size distribution of the survivor clasts. Using various image processing techniques, survivor clast shape and size are characterized in 3 D by best-fit ellipsoids. Renderings of survivor clasts illustrate that survivor clasts have fine tips reminiscent of sigma type tails of porphyroclasts observed in myolonites. The resolution of the XCT imaging permits characterization of survivor clasts with equivalent spherical diameters greater than 0. 63 mm. The survivor clast population in both the SDZ and CDZ gouge layers have similar particle size distributions (PSD) which fit a power law with a slope of approximately - 3; aspect ratio (major to minor axis ratios) distributions also are similar throughout ranging between 1. 5 and 4, with the majority occurring between 2 - 2. 5. The volume- and shape- distributions vary little with position across the gouge zones. A strong shape preferred orientation (SPO) exists in both creeping zones. In both the SDZ and CDZ the minor axes form a SPO approximately normal to the plane of the San Andreas Fault (SAF), and the major axes define a lineation in the plane of the SAF. The observation that the size-, shape- and orientation-distributions of mesoscale, matrix-supported clasts are similar in the SDZ and CDZ gouge layers, and vary little with position in each gouge layer, is consistent with the hypothesis that aseismic creep in the SDZ and CDZ is achieved by distributed, shearing. The consistency between the SPO and simple-shear, strike-slip kinematics, and the marked difference of PSD, fabric, cohesion and clast lithology of the gouge with that of the adjacent rock, is consistent with the hypothesis {{that the vast majority of}} the shear displacement on the SAF at SAFOD is accommodated within the gouge layers and the gouge displays a mature, nearly steady-state structure...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{understood}} that injection and production activities can induce additional stress fields that will couple with the {{in situ stress}} field. An increased shear stress may cause serious casing stability issue, and casing integrity {{is one of the}} major issues in the development of an oilfield. In this thesis, I will present a methodology for semi-quantitatively addressing the physical processes, the occurrence, and the key influential factors associated with large-area casing shear issues in Daqing Oilfield. In the research, I will investigate reservoir heterogeneity and the far-field stress field in the Daqing Oilfield, China; I will review fundamental theories of rock strength, rock failure, casing shear, and techniques for coupling fluid flow and mechanical response of the reservoirs; and I will present mathematical simulations of large-area casing shear in one typical area (X 1 - 3 B) in Daqing Oilfield, under different regimes of water-affected shale area ratio and block pressure difference. Heterogeneity in Daqing Oilfield varies according to the scale. Mega-heterogeneity is not too serious: the geometry of the oilfield is simple, the structure is flat, and faults are numerous and complex, but distributed evenly. Macro-heterogeneity is, however, intense. Horizontal macro-heterogeneity is associated with lateral variations because of different depositional facies. Vertical macro-heterogeneity of Daqing Oilfield because of layering is typified by up to 100 individual sand layers with thickness ranging from 0. 2 to 20 m and permeability ranging from 20 to 1600 mD (average 230 mD). Furthermore, there are a number of stacked sand-silt-shale (clastic lithofacies) sequences. Mercury porosimetry and photo-micro-graphic analyses were used to investigate the micro-heterogeneity of Daqing Oilfield. This method yields a complete pore size distribution, from several nanometers to several thousands of micro-meters as well as cumulative pore volume distributions, pore-throat aspect ratios, and fractal dimensions. The fractal dimension can be used to describe the heterogeneity at the pore scale; for sandstones, the larger the fractal dimension of a specific pore structure, the more heterogeneous it is. Reservoir sandstones of Daqing Oilfield have similar porosity and mineralogy, so their micro-heterogeneity lies in a micro-structure of considerable variability. Differences in micro-structure affect permeability, which also varies considerably and evidences a considerable amount of micro-scale anisotropy. Finally, the number and nature of faults in the oilfield make the macro-scale heterogeneity more complex. Rock strength is affected by both intrinsic factors and external factors. Increased water saturation affects rock strength by decreasing both rock cohesion and rock friction angle. In Daqing Oilfield, is seems that a 5 % increase of water content in shale can decrease the maximum shearing resistance of shale by approximately 40 %. Hysteretic behavior leads to porosity and permeability decreases during the compaction stage of oilfield development (increasing σ'). Also, injection pressures are inevitably kept as high as possible in the pursuit of greater production rates. These lead to non-homogeneous distributions of pressures as well as in changes of material behavior over time. Loss of shear strength with water content increase, inherent reservoir heterogeneity, and long periods of high-pressure water injection from a number of wells are three key factors leading to casing shear occurring over large areas in Daqing Oilfield. Reservoir heterogeneity and structural complexity foster uneven formation pressure distribution, leading to inter-block pressure differences. Sustained long-term elevated pressures affect overburden shale mechanical strength as well as reducing normal stresses, and the affected area increases with time under high-pressure injection so that the affected areas overlap at the field scale and alter the in situ stress field. Once the maximum compressive stress parallels or nearly parallels the differential pressure, and the water-affected shale area is big enough, the shear stability of the interface between the shale and the sandstone is severely compromised, and when the thrust stress imposed exceeds the shearing resistance, the strata will slip in a direction corresponding to the vector from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The change in this slip and creep displacement field is the major reason for the serious <b>casing</b> <b>deformation</b> damage in Daqing Oilfield. To quantify the scale effect of the water-affected shale area on casing stability, coupled non-linear poroelastic fluid flow was simulated for a typical area. The Daqing Oilfield simulation result is in coincidence with the in situ observation of disturbed stress fields and casing displacement. The water-affected area has a scale effect on the casing stability. The ratio of the water-affected shale formation area to the total area influences the stability coefficient much more than the block pressure difference. In the studied area, under conditions of injection pressure of 12. 7 MPa and no more than 2. 5 MPa block pressure difference, the water-affected ratio should be smaller than 0. 50 or so in order to maintain areal casing stability. By history matching, in the studied area under current development condition and considering the water-affected ratio, so long as the injection pressure and pressure differential between blocks are controlled to be less than 12. 7 MPa and 0. 86 MPa respectively, formation shear slip along a horizontal surface will no longer occur...|$|E
