40|$|This study {{investigated}} the catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> the microalga Isochtysis zhanjiangensis over a modifled ZSM- 5 catalyst {{with the aim of}} producing C 2 -C 4 light olefins. Compared with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> this microalga displayed higher selectivity for and greater yield of these olefins. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light olefins. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light olefins at 36. 7 %. The yields of light olefins obtained from catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light olefins. Isochrysis zhanjiangensis with an elevated neutral lipid content will therefore give the highest yield of light olefins through catalytic cracking.

Phillips dropped to the ground, struck by two musket balls, and the band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.

25|$|In {{the second}} half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when he latched onto a defence {{splitting}} pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again {{at the heart of}} another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. With the game stretched, he picked the ball up and drove towards the edge of the Everton area. Dalglish made a run across his path into space, but Whelan used it as a dummy and clipped an exquisite ball over three Everton defenders into the path of Rush who, from the angle of the six-yard area, thumped the ball past Mimms, knocking over a camera in the process. Liverpool held on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal. However, the ban on English clubs in European competition was continued, and Rush was unable to have a <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> winning another European Cup in 1986–87.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{processes}} and reactor designs in polymer <b>cracking,</b> catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> polymer dissolved in solvent offers interesting features. In the present research, catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> low-density polyethylene (LDPE) dissolved in benzene in a fixed-bed reactor was studied. The catalysts used included three zeolites in original form and nickel (Ni) -impregnated forms. The LDPE conversions achieved were high (> 98 %) despite the short retention times. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> LDPE produced liquid in the gasoline range, gases ranged from C 1 to C 4, and hydrogen gas. The increase in catalyst acidity improved gas yield {{at the expense}} of the liquid yield. Although high catalyst acidity had less influence toward liquid product composition, it led to higher degree <b>of</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> the gaseous products.

[...] We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement.
