40|$|Abstract. A new {{ultrasonic}} {{system based on}} a 2 -D cylindrical array with capability of electronic scanning and 3 D beam-forming was developed. Such a system can operate in harsh environments for casing inspection (diameter, ovality, <b>corrosion,</b> <b>thickness,</b> cracks) and for assessment of the material behind casing. The most important challenges of such a system are: (a) operation in highly attenuative media (up to 12 dB/cm/MHz) with ambient conditions of up to 175 ºC and 1400 bar, (b) {{the large number of}} array elements (N= 800) and the volume restrictions for the array electronics (around 1000 cm 3), which requires a high level of integration. The system operates in a frequency band that corresponds to the fundamental thickness resonance of the casing (200 – 700 kHz). Using Sigma Delta modulators (SDM) for mixed signal processing facilitates integration and reduces the number of interconnections. It is well known that increasing the oversampling ratio (OSR) of SDM increases the dynamic range of the signals. The system is limited by the maximum sampling frequency that together with the input frequency of up to 1 MHz defines the OSR. In the paper we present the digital processing algorithms for casing measurements based on the response of an ideal plate, and make a theoretical analysis of the effect of several parameters of the digital processing chain on the casing measurements. We conclude that, in the presence of noise, the averaging effect of the array beamforming greatly improves the measurements, allowing the use of SDM with relatively low OSRs...|$|E

Improved high temperature monitoring tools are needed to continuously measure the local minimum wall thickness of steel pipe subject to non-uniform internal <b>corrosion.</b> <b>Thickness</b> measurements must be sufficiently accurate to calculate the maximum allowable stress permissible as to avoid failure. Thickness measurements must also be sufficiently reliable and precise to correlate the rate of wall-loss with process conditions as to improve future corrosion rate predictions. Permanently installed structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies have the potential to meet these needs and an ultrasonic sensor technology based on the sol-gel ceramic fabrication process will be presented. The sol-gel thin-film sensor fabrication process is described: aerosol printing of high-temperature piezoceramic material, heat curing, polarization, electrode deposition, and wiring. The sensors are characterized with the photoelastic visualization method by first, recording the propagating elastic waves as a sequence of images, then, processing the image frames to reconstruct a beam profile through identification of the maximum optical intensity for each pixel via normalizing, filtering, and smoothing. A sol-gel transducer is shown to be similar to a traditional manual contact transducer. The systematic and environmental factors that impact ultrasonic thickness measurement accuracy, precision, and reliability are discussed. An experiment is conducted using a flat-bottom-hole calibration pipe at ambient temperature with sol-gel transducer arrays in pulse-echo and pitch-catch configuration for various time-of-flight thickness calculation methods.

40|$|International audienceLong-term {{storage of}} {{high-level}} nuclear waste glass in France {{is expected to}} occur in an engineered barrier system (EBS) located in a subsurface Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) clay rock formation in the Paris Basin in northeastern France. Understanding the behavior of glass dissolution in the complex system is critical {{to be able to}} reliably model the performance of the glass in this complex environment. To simulate this multi-barrier repository scenario in the laboratory, several tests have been performed to measure glass dissolution rates of the simulated high-level nuclear waste glass, SON 68, in the presence of COx claystone at 90 °C. Experiments utilized a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pump to pass simulated Bure site COx pore water through a reaction cell containing SON 68 placed between two COx claystone cores for durations up to 200 days. Silicon concentrations at the outlet were similar in all experiments, even the blank experiment with only the COx claystone (∼ 4 mg/L at 25 °C and ∼ 15 mg/L at 90 °C). The steady-state pH of the effluent, measured at room temperature, was roughly 7. 1 for the blank and 7. 3 – 7. 6 for the glass-containing experiments demonstrating the pH buffering capacity of the COx claystone.

40|$|Metal dusting is a {{disintegration}} {{phenomenon of}} {{metals and alloys}} into fine, dust-like particles. Metal dusting {{can be found in}} different reforming units in the petrochemical industry. As well as in reforming units, it can be found at high-temperature fuel cells. The metal dusting corrosion phenomenon is initiated by unwanted carbon formation on the inner surface of process equipment. It occurs under a synthesis gaseous atmosphere (carbon activity >> 1) at high temperature with low oxygen/steam partial pressure. Since the gas contains carbon monoxide and hydrogen at high temperature, carbon is formed by CO reduction reaction and Boudouard reaction. Carbon formation is kinetically controlled which means it is influenced by the catalytic properties and the local conditions like temperature and partial pressure. An oxide layer formed on the surface of alloys is protecting the alloy matrix from <b>corrosion.</b> <b>Thickness</b> of this oxide layer should be moderate. If the oxide layer is too thick, the metal alloys will have problems with thermal expansion and heat transfer. If it is too thin, however, the metal alloys cannot be protected from the corrosion. To find the effects of oxidation temperature, CO exposure temperature and CO exposure time on carbon formation, oxidation treatments and CO exposure treatments were conducted. Samples were oxidized with 10 % steam-Ar gas for 6 h at 540 °C or 760 °C. Subsequently, samples were exposed to 10 % CO-Ar gas at 1 bar at 650 °C or 750 °C. Length of exposure time was different for each sample from 1 h to 20 h. After the experiments, surface of metal alloys was characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. As a result of all experiments, the effect of CO exposure time can be summarized as follows. Regardless of sample exposure conditions, all samples have more carbon when they are exposed to CO gas for longer time. The effect of pre-treatment temperature is that lower temperature forms more carbon filaments. Finally, the effect of CO exposure treatment temperature is that lower temperature (650 °C) forms more carbon filaments than higher temperature (750 °C) ...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) {{structures are}} usually subjected to various natural hazards and environmental stressors during their lifetime. Over the time, structures are continuously aging and rapidly deteriorating in their lifecycle, becoming increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic failures after natural or manmade hazards. Corrosion of steel reinforcement {{has been identified}} as one of the major causes of deterioration in reinforced concrete structures. Chloride ingress is the dominant mechanism for initiation of deterioration in coastal regions or areas with high exposure to deicing salts. The chloride-induced crack initiation stage in deterioration process, which defines the end of functional service life for corroded RC structures has been investigated in this study. Crack initiation is governed by the expansion of corrosion products. It was found that crack initiation time is significantly affected by rate of <b>corrosion,</b> <b>thickness</b> of interfacial transmission zone (ITZ), composition of corrosion products, and mechanism of corrosion. Other factors which can also influence crack initiation time are the structure’s geometrical parameters such as concrete cover depth, rebar diameter and spacing, as well as the material parameter concrete tensile strength. Different reinforced concrete structural components have been simulated using nonlinear 3 -D finite element (FE) models in order to study their lifetime performance under corrosion. The developed FE models are validated with the available experimental tests. All of the corrosion effects on structural behavior of RC structures, such as reduction of steel cross sectional area, change of steel and concrete properties, as well as deterioration of bond has been implemented into the 3 -D FE models. The structural performance of corroded RC beams is obtained through FE analysis. The results show that corrosion influences the strength and ductility of a structure at ultimate condition, and may also cause excessive cracking and deflection, which leads to serviceability failure. Moreover, a large number of RC structures that suffer from corrosion mechanisms are located in high seismic risk areas, which leads to the necessity of investigating the combined effects of corrosion and earthquake in order to provide a more reliable prediction for the lifetime performance of RC structures in both corrosive and high seismic risk areas. Therefore, a comprehensive FE framework has been developed to study the structural response of RC columns under earthquake hazards while they are constantly exposed to chloride attack. This framework is capable of including all of the degrading effects due to chloride-induced corrosion and has been validated by a previous set of experimental test results. The extent of structural degradation has been updated as a function of time. Equivalent static analysis and nonlinear time history analysis have been conducted to evaluate the seismic performance of corroded columns at multiple time periods as well as under various hazard levels. The region, type and extent of damage have been identified and damage states has also been defined. Full details of hysteretic loops, frequency changes, as well as cover crack propagation patterns have been obtained through FE analysis. Furthermore, this study has also considered multiple seismic events occurring during the lifetime of RC structures. Detailed FE models that are able to transfer residual damage from previous earthquake to the next earthquake have been proposed. The extent of damage after each earthquake has been quantified. The result of this study shows that the corrosion can dramatically reduce the strength and stiffness of the column. Under severe earthquake, extensive corrosion may result in a brittle failure of the column without the development of concrete cracks. When a critical section of the column experiences a much higher corrosion risk, the seismic performance can be greatly compromised. Such columns could perform much worse than a column undergoing a consistent corrosion rate at a much older age, thus engineers must be alerted to draw special attention to those columns to prevent catastrophic failure during seismic events. The outcome of this research will provide more reliable predictions for the lifetime performance of RC structures, thus help engineers and inspectors improve their designs, identify necessary test regions and define comprehensive inspection plans, as well as optimize rehabilitation strategies for RC structures under multi-threat areas...|$|E

In this research innovation of the invented process is described, then to confirm the method, corrosion resistance of the covered Earth rod and plate is tested. Phenomenal results indicated that even with 100 micron thickness of the new coating layer, corrosion resistance reaches the required time of resistance. Also by increasing the layer <b>thickness,</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance is increased...|$|R

Mortar samples, containing steel pill (initially polished or pre-corroded), {{have been placed in}} various conditions [relative humidities of 80, 90 and 95 %; solution simulating the clay rock underground water of the French candidate site of Bure at two temperatures (25 and 50 degrees C) and in aerated and anoxic conditions]. The passive corrosion behaviour of steel has been assessed after 6 months and after 1 year for each experiment. Gravimetric measurements (average corrosion rate evaluation), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy characterisations (identification of the passive film and corrosion product nature) as well as optical and electronic microscopy analyses (<b>corrosion</b> layer <b>thickness</b> and steel/mortar interface elementary analysis) have been performed. Such analyses have been also carried out after 15 days and 1 and 3 months in order to consider the first stages of passivity in mortars. The results show that average corrosion rates determinate for polished steels are typical of passive conditions (≤ 1 μm/year) and vary from 0. 4 to 5 μm/year for the pre-corroded pills. Moreover, iron is detected within the cementitious material, up to 5 - 50 μm from the metal, indicating the transport of iron species...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOccurrence of {{corrosion}} layers on observed glass samples {{has been}} monitored {{by means of}} cyclic tests in distilled water. Occurred corrosion layers were characterized by their thickness and refractive index. Characteristics of corrosion layers were calculated from dependence of reflectance on wavelength in visible spectrum area for particular observed glass and <b>corrosion</b> times. <b>Thickness</b> of <b>corrosion</b> layers reached tens of nanometers. Refractive index of corrosion layer for all observed glass samples was lower than refractive index of original glass. Dependence of layer thickness on time was regarded as result of leaching kinetics for observed glass. Initial layer thickness growth is stabilized {{in the course of}} time for glass samples with ZrO 2 content of 0. 00  wt.  % and 0. 41  wt.  %. There is considerable trend in layer thickness growth along with corrosion time for glass samples with ZrO 2 content of 0. 81  wt.  %, 1. 26  wt.  % and 1. 66  wt.  %. From dependence of refractive index on time we have found out that refractive index of corrosion layers occurring on particular glass samples were changed. We have found difference in values of refractive index amongst particular glass samples and we have explained it via their different porosity...|$|R
