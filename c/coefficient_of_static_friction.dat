The coefficient of friction is an empirical measurement – it has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found through calculations. Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> is usually larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.|$|E
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>static</b> <b>friction,</b> typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E

Locomotion was recorded as cows walked to receive a food reward. Cows {{on the floor with}} least friction walked rapidly (0. 85 m/s), with frequent, short steps. At the start of the supporting phase the upper limbs were more vertical. Joint arcs during this phase were reduced. Cows on 0. 5 -mm aggregate also walked rapidly (0. 84 m/s); they had the least vertical limb angles and long steps but held the hoof more vertical, probably to offset any increased slip risk. On floors with larger aggregate, cows decreased speed and step frequency but maintained long steps, keeping their upper forelimbs more vertical to reduce the supporting limb phase. It is concluded that on a low friction floor (mu < 0. 4), cows walk quickly with frequent, short steps. As increases to 0. 5, step length increases and the number of steps decreases to maintain speed at increased friction, producing an optimal <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> friction between 0. 4 and 0. 5.

Dry-basis moisture content of date fruits found to be 18. 48 % (19. 60 % for pitted dates and 8. 69 % for their pits). Other results showed that linear dimensions varied from 33. 10 to 42. 60 mm in length, 18. 20 to 25. 30 mm in width, and 17. 40 to 24. 40 mm in thickness.
