5|$|In 2009, Boom! Studios {{produced}} a Monsters Inc. comic book mini-series that ran for four issues. The storyline takes {{place after the}} movie and focuses on Sulley and Mike's daily struggles to operate Monsters Inc. on its new laughter-focused company policy. At the same time, their work is impeded by the revenge schemes of Randall and Waternoose, {{as well as a}} human child (indirectly revealed to be Sid Phillips from the Toy Story franchise) who has hijacked the company's <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> technology to commit a string of toy thefts throughout the human world.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the <b>closet</b> <b>door,</b> Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
25|$|Trompe-l'œil (“fool the eye”) {{paintings}} and classic still-life paintings {{make up a}} prominent component of the ACMAA collection. Ease (1887) by William M. Harnett (1848–1892) is a large and eloquent example of the trompe-l'œil genre and one that amply demonstrates the allure of Harnett’s trompe-l'œil illusions for his nineteenth-century patrons. John Frederick Peto (1854–1907), a William Harnett contemporary who worked in relative obscurity, is represented in the collection by two highly accomplished trompe-l'œil compositions, Lamps of Other Days (1888) and A <b>Closet</b> <b>Door</b> (1904-06). Other trompe-l'œil paintings in the ACMAA collection were created by De Scott Evans (1847–1898) and John Haberle (1853–1933).|$|E

500|$|After {{the deputies}} {{went into the}} basement, he was asked by Arnaud to come with him, who said to him, [...] "You've got {{to come and go}} with me now." [...] However, Logan adamantly refused, saying [...] "I told you, I'm not going with you anywhere". Logan then ran up the {{staircase}} and went into his former bedroom, now used as a guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder followed him to the room and stood outside the door. Arnaud tried to convince Logan {{to come out of the}} room, as Logan's parents and Magruder, who had joined the department in February 2001, stood by, watching. After Logan's parents left the scene and went to the house's master bedroom, Logan became belligerent and uncooperative. Partially hidden behind a <b>closet</b> <b>door,</b> Logan retrieved a semi-automatic 9mm-chambered handgun and fired at Arnaud, where a bullet struck him in the throat and severed his carotid artery. Logan then shot Arnaud fatally in the chest.|$|E

Cobain {{forgot about the}} song for a while, but began working on it again {{when he and his}} wife, Courtney Love, moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed the <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "He was trying to be so sneaky", said Love. [...] "I could hear that one from downstairs." [...] The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting {{sensibility}} informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance.

On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too.

The Count demands to be allowed {{into the room and}} the Countess reluctantly unlocks the door. The Count enters and hears a noise from the closet. He tries to open it, but it is locked.
