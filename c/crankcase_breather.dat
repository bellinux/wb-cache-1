5000|$|... fording: {{changes to}} the <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> reduced the {{possibility}} of water intake into the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the <b>crankcase</b> via the <b>breather.</b> The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|R
50|$|The iron {{engine block}} is cast in one unit with the crankcase. It {{has been given}} a {{crankshaft}} with nine bearings which makes the strongest contribution to the engine's smooth running, even at high speed. The overhead valves have been given double springs and the cup-and-ball joints on the rockers are fed with oil forced up to the rocker shaft. The cast-iron cylinder head may be removed without disturbing valve settings. The valve mechanism has an easily removable light aluminium cover. The <b>crankcase</b> has a <b>breather</b> on the oil filling cap. Drive to the three-bearing camshaft and the built in generator is provided by chain. Spark timing is controlled automatically. The distributor is positioned {{at the back of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in {{crankcase ventilation}} was the road draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the <b>crankcase,</b> called the <b>breather</b> and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|R

5000|$|Improvements for 1932 were: a <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> {{to prevent}} fumes {{entering}} the car, a new silencer, modified springs and shock absorbers, larger wheels. [...] and Bohnalite alloy pistons.|$|E
5000|$|Mark I, US built engines {{modified}} in Britain. Modification incorporated new carburettors {{and a new}} {{induction system}} from Solex, revision of the <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> new timing gear, and revised crankshaft end thrust. This produced 340 hp when governed to 1,500 rpm with the new carburettors.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the PCV system to sweep fumes out of the {{crankcase}}, the crankcase must have a source of fresh, clean air, called the <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather.</b> To achieve this, the crankcase air inlet is usually ducted to the engine's air cleaner. The breather is usually provided with baffles and filters to prevent oil mist and vapour from fouling the air filter.|$|E
50|$|Four {{individual}} small air breathers: Replaces stock setup with altered <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> hose re-routed into {{a single}} air cleaner (different style air cleaners were available over the years). Sprint fastback 904 venttop: Very attractive large fiberglass roof attachment, which gives the late model Corvair coupe a fastback appearance (not available for convertible or sedan). Pair of adjustable Gabriel shocks: Replaces stock rear shocks for better handling.|$|E
50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in crankcase pressures as the pistons alternately compress {{and expand the}} crankcase gases. This issue is usually addressed {{by means of a}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> as in the BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360° parallel twins. Crankcase pressure differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation has yet to be used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|Engine changes {{consisted}} of {{an increase in}} stroke by 2 mm, enlarging displacement to [...] The compression ratio was boosted from 11:1 to 12.5:1 and the cylinder head was made more compact and was given lighter titanium valves, saving 14.1 g and 11.7 g on each intake and exhaust valve, respectively. The valves were driven by a chain with a new hydraulic tensioner. The pistons were made lighter by 1.4 g and used ion-coated rings and shot peened connecting rods. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> system had reed valves added to control pressure waves in the intake airbox, a way of avoiding power loss.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{differences}} {{distinguish the}} three series: After the first series, brake discs were drilled. The first series kept the [...] "/5" [...] series kick start lever. The later 17mm diameter front axle {{was stronger than}} the first series 14mm axle. The original R90S had [...] "/5" [...] switchgear, but this was changed in 1975 to a new non-standard design that proved unpopular. The engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> was a phenolic disc-&-spring item which made a 'popping' sound as the breather operated. The modified [...] "/7" [...] breather was a reed valve design, which could be retro-fitted to [...] "/6" [...] models to replace their noisy breathers.|$|E
50|$|In many vehicles, a <b>{{crankcase}}</b> <b>breather</b> pipe feeds {{into the}} air intake to vent the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess oil mist, which is then drawn from the crankcase {{into the air}} intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this oil mist as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more oil mist to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches a point where it is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E

40|$|A unique stepped-piston {{engine was}} {{developed}} {{by a group of}} research engineers at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), from 2003 to 2005. The development work undertaken by them engulfs design, prototyping and evaluation over a predetermined period of time which was iterative and challenging in nature. The main objective of the program is to demonstrate local R&D capabilities on small engine work that is able to produce mobile powerhouse of comparable output, having low-fuel consumption and acceptable emission than its crankcase counterpart of similar displacement. A two-stroke engine work was selected as it posses a number of technological challenges, e. g. increase in its thermal efficiency and emission, which upon successful undertakings will be useful in assisting the group in future powertrain undertakings in UTM. In its carbureted version, the single-cylinder air-cooled engine incorporates a three-port transfer system and a dedicated <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather.</b> These features will enable the prototype to have high induction efficiency and to behave very much a two-stroke engine but equipped with a four-stroke crankcase lubrication system. After a series of analytical work the engine was subjected to a series of laboratory trials. It was also tested on a small watercraft platform with promising indication of its flexibility of use as a prime mover in mobile platform.
