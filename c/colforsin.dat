40|$|ObjectiveAcidosis {{produces}} a negative inotropic effect on cardiac muscle against which catecholamines and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors have limited therapeutic effects. This study evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>colforsin,</b> which directly activates adenylate cyclase without β-adrenergic receptor activation, in isolated Langendorff rat hearts in a pH- and concentration-dependent manner. DesignExperimental animal study. SettingA university laboratory. ParticipantsSprague-Dawley rats. InterventionsHearts were isolated and perfused with 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid/Tyrode solution (pH 7. 4) in the Langendorff preparation. The hearts were assigned randomly to the control (pH 7. 4), mild acidosis (pH 7. 0), or severe acidosis (pH 6. 6) group (n = 8 per group) and were perfused continuously with <b>colforsin</b> 10 − 7, 10 − 6, and 10 − 5 mol/L. Measurements and Main ResultsMaximum dP/dt was determined, and the concentration-response relation was evaluated at each pH. <b>Colforsin</b> at 10 − 6 mol/L increased the maximum dP/dt from 2, 592 ± 557 to 5, 189 ± 721 mmHg/s (p < 0. 001) and from 1, 942 ± 325 to 3, 399 ± 608 mmHg/s (p < 0. 001) in the control and mild acidosis groups, respectively; whereas <b>colforsin,</b> 10 − 5 mol/L, significantly increased the maximum dP/dt even in the severe acidosis group. No significant difference was seen in maximum dP/dt among the 3 groups after infusion with <b>colforsin</b> 10 − 5 mol/L. ConclusionsIn contrast to catecholamines and other inodilators, <b>colforsin</b> at a high concentration restores decreased cardiac contractility against severe acidosis to an extent similar to physiologic pH...|$|E
40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{stimulation}} and alpha 2 adrenergic inhibition increase lipolysis {{from fat}} cells. Twenty-eight obese women {{were placed on}} a calorie-restricted diet and one of five treatments was applied to one thigh {{three to five times}} per week for four weeks: (1) isoproterenol injections; (2) cream containing <b>colforsin</b> (forskolin), aminophylline, and yohimbine; (3) yohimbine cream; (4) <b>colforsin</b> cream; or (5) aminophylline cream. The opposite thigh was treated with a placebo (injection or cream). The treated thighs lost significantly more girth after treatment, both by injection and by cream. No adverse reactions were attributable to either the cream or the injections. It is concluded that local fat reduction from the thigh can be safely accomplished...|$|E
40|$|Helen E Ritchie, 1 Carolina Ragnerstam, 2 Elin Gustafsson, 2 Johanna M Jonsson, 2 William S Webster 2 1 Discipline of Biomedical Science, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Lidcombe, 2 Department of Anatomy and Histology, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to gain insight into whether the first {{trimester}} embryo could control its own heart rate (HR) in response to hypoxia. The gestational day 13 rat embryo is a good model for the human embryo at 5 – 6 weeks gestation, as the heart is comparable in development and, like the human embryo, has no functional autonomic nerve supply at this stage. Utilizing a whole-embryo culture technique, we examined the effects of different pharmacological agents on HR under normoxic (95 % oxygen) and hypoxic (20 % oxygen) conditions. Oxygen concentrations ≤ 60 % caused a concentration-dependent decrease in HR from normal levels of ~ 210 bpm. An adenosine agonist, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and KATP channel opener all caused bradycardia in normoxic conditions; however, putative antagonists for these systems failed to prevent or ameliorate hypoxia-induced bradycardia. This suggests that the activation of one or more of these systems is not the primary cause of the observed hypoxia-induced bradycardia. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation also decreased HR in normoxic conditions, highlighting the importance of ATP levels. The β-blocker metoprolol caused a concentration-dependent reduction in HR supporting reports that β 1 -adrenergic receptors are present in the early rat embryonic heart. The cAMP inducer <b>colforsin</b> induced a positive chronotropic effect in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Overall, the embryonic HR at this stage of development is responsive to the level of oxygenation, probably as a consequence of its influence on ATP production.
