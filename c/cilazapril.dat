40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Cilazapril</b> {{is a novel}} {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme inhibitor with antiproliferative effects in the rat model after balloon injury. METHODS AND RESULTS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of <b>cilazapril</b> in angiographic restenosis prevention after {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). Patients received <b>cilazapril</b> 2. 5 mg in the evening after successful PTCA and 5 mg b. i. d. for 6 months or matched placebo. In addition, all patients received aspirin for 6 months. Coronary angiograms before PTCA, after PTCA, and at 6 -month follow-up were quantitatively analyzed. In 94 % of 735 recruited patients, PTCA was successful and all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. For the per-protocol analysis, quantitative angiography after PTCA and at follow-up was available in 595 patients who complied with the treatment regimen (309 control, 286 <b>cilazapril).</b> The mean difference in minimal coronary lumen diameter between post-PTCA and follow-up angiogram (primary end point) was - 0. 29 +/- 0. 49 mm in the control group and - 0. 27 +/- 0. 51 mm in the <b>cilazapril</b> group. Clinical events during 6 - month follow-up, analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, were ranked according to the most serious clinical event ranging from death (control, two; <b>cilazapril,</b> three), nonfatal myocardial infarction (control, eight; <b>cilazapril,</b> 5), coronary revascularization (control, 51; <b>cilazapril,</b> 53), or recurrent angina requiring medical therapy (control, 67; <b>cilazapril,</b> 68) to none of the above (control, 224; <b>cilazapril,</b> 212).

40|$|<b>Cilazapril,</b> a moisture-sensitive compound, {{is known}} to undergo rapid {{degradation}} which could be additionally facilitated {{by the presence of}} excipients that contain or absorb moisture. Hence we investigated the stability of <b>cilazapril</b> in two commercially-available dosage forms and in binary mixtures with the selected excipients used in the studied commercial formulations i. e. : hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, maize starch and talc in order to detect any possible, stability-affecting incompatibilities. Also the impact of the blister made of oriented polyamide/aluminum/polyvinyl chloride//aluminum on cilazapril-containing tablets was researched. A validated HPLC and HPLC-MS methods were used for analysis and the isothermal stress testing conditions were applied (temperature range 318 – 343  K, relative humidity 76. 4 % for tablets and temperature 333  K, relative humidity range 50. 9 – 76. 4 % for binary mixtures). It was shown that the degradation of <b>cilazapril</b> in both, model mixtures and tablets follows the autocatalytic model kinetics and it is more rapid than that observed for pure substance, evidenced by higher degradation rate constants. The immediate packaging protects <b>cilazapril</b> in tablets from degradation only in case of the original drug while in its blistered generic counterpart a slight but statistically insignificant increase of <b>cilazapril</b> decay occurs when compared to bare tablets (p <  0. 05). The degradation product of <b>cilazapril</b> in tablets and binary mixtures was identified as cilazaprilat. It was also observed that the increase of relative humidity or the presence of hypromellose, lactose and talc significantly impairs the stability of <b>cilazapril</b> in the aforementioned order. Only maize starch exhibited a positive effect on <b>cilazapril</b> stability (10. 8 % loss of <b>cilazapril</b> in binary mixture after 360  days of stressing compared to 35 % loss of pure <b>cilazapril</b> in analogous test conditions) probably thanks to its moisture-scavenging properties.

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} whether treatment of hypertension reduces cerebral infarction after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs).

After 3 months of treatment, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded and neurological deficit was evaluated. Infarct volume was measured 3 days after occlusion using computer imaging techniques from brain slices. <b>Cilazapril</b> and hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide were equally effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in SHRSPs. One day after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, neurological deficit was decreased by both <b>cilazapril</b> and hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide compared with untreated SHRSPs, and the deficit 3 days after occlusion was decreased significantly only by <b>cilazapril.</b> Infarct volume was 178 ± 7 mm 3 (mean±SEM) in untreated SHRSPs, and it was significantly reduced to 117 + 15 mm 3 by hydralazine with hydrochlorothiazide and to 101 ± 17 mm 3 by <b>cilazapril.</b> Infarct volume in Wistar-Kyoto rats was 27 ± 16 mm 3.

Similar processes occur after coronary angioplasty and, in approximately 33 % of vessels, lead to intimal hyperplasia and vascular restenosis within 6 months after angioplasty. In a rat model of balloon catheterization, the proliferative response to balloon injury was reduced by 70 % and the area of vascular wall covered by lesion formation was decreased by 45 % in rats treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>cilazapril.</b> Other antihypertensive agents were much less active when tested for suppression of intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury: verapamil 0 %, minoxidil 4 % and hydralazine 34 %.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effects of mibefradil on survival, hemodynamic variables and cardiac remodeling in a rat model of chronic heart failure (HF) and to compare these effects {{with those of the}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>cilazapril.</b> Background. The use of calcium channel blocking agents in chronic HF has been disappointing. Most studies have shown that these drugs have either no or even detrimental effects {{due in part to the}} negative inotropic effects they induce. Mibefradil is a calcium channel blocker that selectively blocks T channels and displays moderately negative inotropic properties only at high doses. Because T channels are upregulated in the hypertrophied heart and could mediate hypertrophic signals and increase arrhythmogenicity, blockade of these channels might be beneficial in chronic HF. Methods. Rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and 9 months of treatment with mibefradil (15 mg/kg body weight per day) or <b>cilazapril</b> (10 mg/kg per day) or no treatment. Survival and systolic blood pressure were assessed over the 9 -month treatment period, after which cardiac hemodynamic variables and structure were determined. Results. Mibefradil increased survival rate to the same extent as <b>cilazapril</b> (71 % for mibefradil vs. 75 % for <b>cilazapril</b> and 44 % for no treatment). Mibefradil decreased systolic blood pressure, although to a lesser extent than <b>cilazapril.</b> Both treatments decreased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and central venous pressures, without any change in the first derivative of LV pressure over time or heart rate. Mibefradil decreased LV weight (although less than <b>cilazapril)</b> without affecting right ventricular weight. Finally, both drugs normalized LV collagen density. Conclusions. Mibefradil in a rat model improved survival to the same extent as an ACE inhibitor, without impairing LV function, and was associated with a reduction in LV weight and fibrosis. Thus, mibefradil might be beneficial in the treatment of chronic HF. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 416 – 21...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to compare the hemodynamic and {{biochemical}} effects of the renin inhibitor Ro 42 - 5892, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor <b>cilazapril,</b> and the angiotensin II receptor blocker EXP 132, the aldehyde derivative of DuP 753. The three drugs were evaluated in guinea pigs, previously treated with furosemide, using their maximal effective doses. <b>Cilazapril</b> decreased arterial blood pressure more than Ro 42 - 5892 and EXP 132. In contrast, Ro 42 - 5892 and EXP 132 had similar effects. The larger decrease of arterial pressure induced by <b>cilazapril</b> was not due to a larger decrease of angiotensin II in plasma and was not influenced by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin or by bradykinin antagonism with Hoe 140. After binephrectomy, most of the blood pressure-lowering effect of Ro 42 - 5892 disappeared. In contrast, <b>cilazapril</b> was still markedly effective, pointing to extrarenal effects. We conclude that in furosemide-treated guinea pigs, as opposed to previously published animal models, the decrease of arterial pressure induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be partly due to extrarenal effects not related to the renin-angiotensin system.

MethodsStable hypertensive patients were evaluated if their systolic BP (SBP) was > 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) was > 85 mmHg even with up to 2 antihypertensive drugs. Patients were excluded {{if they were on}} angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or a diuretic. They were then randomized to receive either preterax (perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0. 625 mg) or <b>cilazapril</b> 2. 5 mg once daily in a double-blind fashion for a period of 12 weeks after a 2 -week placebo run-in phase. Sitting BP was recorded and the safety and efficacy were evaluated at each visit every 4 weeks. Response was defined as positive if SBP was ≤ 140 mmHg and DBP was ≤ 90 mmHg at the last visit or there was > 20 mmHg reduction in SBP and/or > 10 mmHg reduction in DBP using either treatment. Plasma biochemical analysis was performed {{both before and after the}} treatment. ResultsAmong the 47 patients initially enrolled, 41 completed the study (21 in the preterax group, 20 in the <b>cilazapril</b> group). There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the 2 groups. SBP was significantly reduced by preterax (13. 43 ± 12. 48 mmHg, p 0. 05).

Therefore, TTS are particularly advantageous for the treatment of disorders requiring long-term pharmacotherapy as, e. g., cardiovascular diseases. By now, hypertension is recognized as one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is a strong discrepancy between the high incidence of hypertension and the availability of transdermally applicable antihypertensive drugs. Thus, one part of this thesis aimed at novel derivatives of the angiotensin II AT 1 receptor antagonist candesartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>cilazapril,</b> suitable for administration via a TTS. The prodrug approach was pursued to design and synthesize various ester-based candesartan and <b>cilazapril</b> prodrugs with physicochemical properties considered suitable to overcome the barrier function of the skin. The novel compounds were bioanalytically characterized with respect to solid-state stability, susceptibility for enzymatic hydrolysis, and stability against non-enzymatic hydrolysis. All candesartan and <b>cilazapril</b> prodrugs except for a simple ethyl ester of <b>cilazapril</b> were enzymatically hydrolyzed to release the active principle. Additionally, the potential candesartan prodrugs turned out to be potent angiotensin II AT 1 receptor antagonists (Kb = 0. 8 – 6. 4 nM) in a fura- 2 calcium-assay on rat glomerular mesangial cells. The three most promising candidates of each group were selected for TTS development, namely candesartan 1 -(isopropyloxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester, candesartan 1 -(2, 2 -dimethylpropanoyloxy) ethyl ester and candesartan morpholinoethyl ester as well as <b>cilazapril</b> 1 -(ethoxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester, <b>cilazapril</b> 1 -(cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester and <b>cilazapril</b> morpholinoethyl ester. These new chemical entities were found to be com¬pa¬rable or even superior to the reference compounds candesartan cilexetil and <b>cilazapril,</b> respectively, in terms of formulate-ability, TTS quality and stability in a silicone PSA matrix. Furthermore, the manufactured TTS containing the new prodrugs were superior to the respective candesartan cilexetil and <b>cilazapril</b> formulations, when investigated for trans¬dermal permeation through animal and human skin using Franz diffusion cells. The second part of this thesis addressed the adverse side of {{drug metabolism}}, namely toxic effects due to the formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates capable of cova¬lent protein binding. In our workgroup highly potent N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists, comprising either an imidazole ring or a 2 -aminothiazole group, were developed, which could serve as valuable pharmacological tools for in vitro and potential in vivo studies. There is strong evidence that cytochrome P 450 -mediated bioactivation of the 2 -aminothiazole ring results in highly reactive intermediates. Thus, the aim of this project was the detection and identification of reactive intermediates by co-incubating N(G) -acylated 3 -(2 -aminothiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines with rat liver microsomes and glutathione (GSH) to trap putative reactive molecules. By means of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and appropriate MS/MS experiments such as constant neutral loss scanning, multiple reaction monitoring and product ion scanning, GSH adducts of reactive intermediates of N(G) -acylated 3 -(2 -aminothiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines were detected. Benefitting from the selectivity of fluorescence detection, these results were corroborated by using dansylated GSH as a trapping agent. Interestingly, blocking of the 4 -position of the 2 -aminothiazole by methyl substitution seemed to prevent bioactivation of the heterocycle. Finally, unspecific toxicity of N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidines was investigated, revealing considerable hemolysis and cytotoxicity in the micromolar range, particularly when the acyl part of the compounds contained highly lipophilic moieties. In summary, the ambivalent character of drug metabolism was highlighted in this thesis. Novel synthesized prodrugs of <b>cilazapril</b> and candesartan turned out to be enzymatically convertible to the active drug and to be superior to the reference drugs in terms of stability, formulate-ability and skin permeability, thus representing promising compounds for transdermal antihypertensive therapy via TTS. By contrast, the identification of reactive intermediates of N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidines demonstrated that one should be aware of the potential risk of bioactivation residing in structural moieties such as aminothiazoles to avoid toxification...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to inhibiting {{the formation of}} angiotensin II, chronic converting enzyme inhibition may affect other blood pressure modulating factors. The influence of an 8 week treatment phase with <b>Cilazapril</b> on {{the activity of the}} renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, the pressor reactivity to infused angiotensin II or norepinephrine, the chronotropic response to isoproterenol, and body sodium and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations was assessed in 11 normal subjects and 12 patients with essential hypertension. As compared to a 4 week placebo phase, <b>Cilazapril</b> decreased arterial pressure in both study groups (from 124 / 83 ± 9 / 6 to 114 / 77 ± 9 / 5 mm Hg and from 143 / 102 ± 13 / 7 to 137 / 96 ± 10 / 10 mm Hg; Ρ <. 025); exchangeable sodium (− 158 mmol and, respectively, − 104 mmol) and upright plasma aldosterone (− 24 % and − 15 %) also tended to fall. Heart rate, the chronotropic response to posture or isoproterenol, plasma norepinephrine levels, the concentration/pressor response curve to norepinephrine, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, plasma angiotensin II and the responses of blood pressure or plasma aldosterone to angiotensin II were unchanged after 8 weeks of <b>Cilazapril.</b> Plasma renin activity increased (+ 175 % to + 650 %) These findings indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of <b>Cilazapril</b> in the stable phase of pharmacological intervention is not associated with modifications of sympathetic-dependent pressor reactivity or ^-adrenergic sensitivity. Plasma angiotensin II concentration and angiotensin II-dependent pathways including the pressor and aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II are also unchanged.

BACKGROUND: Angioplasty of chronically occluded coronary arteries {{is believed to be}} associated with a higher frequency of restenosis and reocclusion than angioplasty of subtotal stenoses. Whether this leads to adverse cardiovascular events is unknown.

40|$|Background. A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that effective blood pressure reduction may inhibit the progression of microvascular damage in patients with essential arterial hypertension. However, the potential influence of anti-hypertensive drugs on ocular circulation has not been studied sufficiently. Purpose. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of anti-hypertensive therapy on blood flow in the central retinal artery in patients with systemic arterial hypertension. Material and methods. Twenty patients with essential arterial hypertension, aged 32 – 46 years, were examined with Doppler ultrasonography (10 MHz ultrasound probe). Blood flow velocities, pulsatility, and vascular resistance were determined before and 3 hours after systemic application of either bisoprolol 5 mg or <b>cilazapril</b> 2. 5 mg. Results. Administered bisoprolol significantly decreased maximum (9. 8 ± 0. 5 cm/s versus 8. 5 ± 0. 6 cm/s; P < 0. 05) and minimum (2. 75 ± 0. 19 cm/s versus 1. 75 ± 0. 27 cm/s; P < 0. 02) velocity, increased the Pourcellot’s index (0. 71 to 0. 79; P < 0. 05) in central retinal artery. There were no statistically significant changes in central retinal artery blood flow after administration of <b>cilazapril.</b> Conclusion. Systemic application of beta-blockers may unfavourably disturb the ocular blood flow. Key words: Bisoprolol, central retinal artery, <b>cilazapril,</b> Doppler ultrasonograph...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{are effective}} {{in the treatment of}} heart failure, although their pharmacological and precise hemodynamic effects have not yet been well defined in pediatric patients. We attempted to determine an optimal dose of <b>Cilazapril</b> to clarify its cardiovascular effects. We first looked to determine the optimal dose in 20 patients. We found that a dose of 0. 04 mg/kg/day reduced ACE activity to less than 50 % of baseline measurement, which established this as the optimal dose for pediatric patients. In using the optimal dose as stated above, its short-term effects were studied by means of echocardiography on 13 children with heart failure. It was found that the end-systolic wall stress was significantly reduced, which resulted in an increase in LV pump function. Then, we studied the long-term effect of <b>Cilazapril</b> on 12 children with heart failure. At 1 to 5. 3 years after administration, LV pump function had increased and LV diastolic dimension was reduced compared to the baseline data. The cardiovascular effects seen in the short term were maintained for several years and cardiomegaly did not appear in spite of heart failure. The ACE inhibitor, <b>Cilazapril,</b> is therefore an effective medicine for children with heart failure...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>cilazapril</b> on left structure and function in essential hypertension, we evaluated 10 patients (4 females and 6 males) affected with mild-to-moderate systemic hypertension. All patients were treated with <b>cilazapril</b> 5 mg/day over a 6 -months period and underwent a 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete Doppler echocardiographic examination at study entry, after 3 and 6 -months of therapy. After therapy, mean systolic and diastolic arterial pressure decreased significantly from 153 +/- 16 / 102 +/- 8 mmHg to 135 +/- 13 / 83 +/- 6 mmHg respectively (p < 0. 005 / 0. 001 respectively). Moreover {{there was a significant}} decrease of left ventricular mass from 109 +/- 27 to 87 +/- 23 g/m 2 (p < 0. 005). Ejection phase indices did not change significantly, whereas left ventricular diastolic filling improved after therapy with a significant increase of M 1 /M 2 ratio from 0. 9 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 (p < 0. 02). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that <b>cilazapril</b> 5 mg/day is effective in reducing blood pressure in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. This normalization of blood pressure measurements is paralleled by a significant decrease of left ventricular mass index and by an improvement of left ventricular diastolic fillin...|$|E
40|$|The three {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors <b>cilazapril,</b> perindopril and CGS 14824 A were administered for 8 days to, respectively, 6, 5 and 5 normotensive healthy volunteers maintained on an unrestricted salt intake. Before starting treatment, {{as well as on}} the last day of therapy, an ambulatory blood pressure profile was obtained with a semi-automatic blood pressure recorder (Remler M 2000). An additional blood pressure recording was performed 1 month after the end of the 8 -day course of treatment with <b>cilazapril</b> and CGS 14824 A. Eight day ACE inhibition with any of the 3 drugs did not result in a consistent decrease of ambulatory blood pressure recordings.

40|$|Blocking {{angiotensin}} II ameliorates proteinuria and glomerular lesions in progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. BackgroundThe {{renin-angiotensin system}} {{is thought to}} be involved in the progression of glomerulonephritis (GN) into end-stage renal failure (ESRF) because of the observed renoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). However, ACEIs have pharmacological effects other than ACE inhibition that may help lower blood pressure and preserve glomerular structure. We previously reported a new animal model of progressive glomerulosclerosis induced by a single intravenous injection of an anti-Thy- 1 monoclonal antibody, MoAb 1 - 22 - 3, in uninephrectomized rats. Using this new model of progressive GN, we examined the hypothesis that ACEIs prevent the progression to ESRF by modulating the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the production of transforming growth factor-βbgr; (TGF-βbgr;) and extracellular matrix components. MethodsWe studied the effect of an ACEI (<b>cilazapril)</b> and an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) on the clinical features and morphological lesions in the rat model previously reported. After 10 weeks of treatment with equihypotensive doses of <b>cilazapril,</b> <b>cilazapril</b> plus Hoe 140 (a bradykinin receptor B 2 antagonist), candesartan, and hydralazine, we examined systolic blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, the glomerulosclerosis index, and the tubulointerstitial lesion index. We performed a semiquantitative evaluation of glomerular immunostaining for TGF-βbgr; and collagen types I and III by immunofluorescence study and of these cortical mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. ResultsUntreated rats developed massive proteinuria, renal dysfunction, and severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, whereas uninephrectomized control rats did not. There was a significant increase in the levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for TGF-βbgr; and collagen types I and III in untreated rats. <b>Cilazapril</b> and candesartan prevented massive proteinuria, increased creatinine clearance, and ameliorated glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury. These drugs also reduced levels of glomerular protein and cortical mRNA for TGF-βbgr; and collagen types I and III. Hoe 140 failed to blunt the renoprotective effect of <b>cilazapril.</b> Hydralazine did not exhibit a renoprotective effect. ConclusionThese results indicate that ACEIs prevent the progression to ESRF by modulating the effects of Ang II via Ang II type 1 receptor on the production of TGF-βbgr; and collagen types I and III, as well as on intrarenal hemodynamics, but not by either increasing bradykinin activity or reducing blood pressure in this rat model of mesangial proliferative GN...|$|E
40|$|In a double-blind, placebo controlled, {{crossover}} study 12 patients with essential hypertension received single doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg of <b>cilazapril,</b> a new {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) inhibitor. All doses similarly and significantly (P less than 0. 05) reduced supine and erect blood pressure without increasing heart rate. The hypotensive effect was evident within 1 h, maintained for up to 8 h, with a maximal effect at 6 h. There was no discernible effect on blood pressure at 24 h after dosing. Plasma ACE activity was markedly inhibited {{to the same extent}} after all doses, with a peak inhibition of 94 - 96 % at 2 - 3 h. At 24 h residual inhibition of ACE was 49 - 54 %. Plasma renin activity increased in a dose-dependent manner with a peak at 6 h, and returned to baseline at 24 h. No correlation was found between the reduction in blood pressure and plasma renin activity, either at baseline or following <b>cilazapril.</b> There were no significant changes in plasma noradrenaline and the responses to upright posture and to dynamic exercise were preserved. There was no evidence of impaired exercise performance. <b>Cilazapril</b> is a potent ACE inhibitor with a rapid onset and a prolonged duration of action.

In WKY rats, we observed no statistically significant changes in blood pressure, ventricular weight and hypertrophy index between the two drugs; however, there were different effects of the two drugs on the ultrastructural morphology of the myocardium.
