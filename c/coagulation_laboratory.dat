Results: From a dispatch of 220 questionnaires, 124 (56. 4 %) were returned. Of the 112 hospitals that had coagulation tests, all of them performed prothrombin time (PT), and 110 laboratories performed activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) as well. Thirty eight percent of laboratories still used 3. 8 % sodium citrate as the anticoagulant for coagulation tests. The majority of laboratories (65 %) reported normal control value with the patient results. Only 42 % of coagulation laboratories established their own reference range.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} a combined strategy of clinical assessment score followed by a local D-dimer test to exclude deep vein thrombosis. For comparison D-dimer was analysed post hoc and batchwise at a <b>coagulation</b> <b>laboratory.</b> DESIGN: Prospective multicenter management study. SETTING: Seven hospitals in southern Sweden. SUBJECTS: 357 patients with a suspected first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were prospectively recruited and pre-test probability score (Wells score) was estimated by the emergency physician. If categorized as low pre-test probability, D-dimer was analysed and if negative, DVT {{was considered to be}} ruled out. The primary outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 3 months of follow up. RESULTS: Prevalence of DVT was 23. 5 % (84 / 357). A low pre-test probability and a negative D-dimer result at inclusion was found in 31 % (110 / 357) of the patients of whom one (0. 9 %, [95 % CI 0. 02 - 4. 96]) had a VTE at follow up.

Objective: To determine the effect of varying storage times and temperatures on plasma PT and APTT. Materials and Methods: PT and APTT were run on plasma from 40 healthy adults using a semi-automated coagulometer. PT and APTT were measured at 0, 4, 6, and 24 h on samples stored at room temperature, refrigerated samples, and frozen samples. The values at 0 h were compared with the values at 4, 6, and 24 h. Results: PT and APTT values were within the reference ranges at 0 h. For refrigerated plasma, PT values at 4 h were within normal, but at 6 and 24 h, they were significantly deranged (P < 0. 05). PT was significantly different at 4, 6, and 24 h for both room temperature and frozen plasma (P < 0. 05). The APTT showed significant differences between 0 h value and values at 4, 6, and 24 h for all the varying temperature conditions.

Mortality statistics are available from {{the early part of the}} last century, and have been collected without a break since the last world war 1. They show that 50 years ago, around 40 women a year died from haemorrhage compared with 3 to 4 now, and this pattern has been established for more than 25 years. The introduction of routine ultrasound scanning and elective Caesarean section have reduced deaths from placenta praevia, but abruption and uterine atony deaths have also declined. This suggests that the factors responsible for the improvement in mortality are general in nature, and common to all causes of obstetric haemorrhage. Consequently, haemorrhage is now the 7 th most important cause of maternal death in the UK, less important than cardiac disease and suicide, and even amniotic fluid embolism 2. Pathophysiology of haemorrhage Haemorrhage is accompanied by an increasing sympathetic response, diverting circulation away from the periphery and the gut. An important contributing factor to maternal death is failure to appreciate the severity of the situation.
