5|$|During its evolution, {{the metric}} system has adopted many units of measure. The {{introduction}} of SI rationalised both {{the way in}} which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure.

5|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is {{a commonly}} used {{way of expressing}} the narcotic effect of different breathing gases. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic. Standard tables, based on relative lipid solubilities, list <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for narcotic effect of other gases. For example, hydrogen at a given pressure has a narcotic effect equivalent to nitrogen at 0.55 times that pressure, so in principle it should be usable at {{more than twice the}} depth. Argon, however, has 2.33 times the narcotic effect of nitrogen, and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving (it is used as a drysuit inflation gas, owing to its low thermal conductivity). Some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure; for example, high-pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity. Although helium is the least intoxicating of the breathing gases, at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome, a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon. Inert gas narcosis is only one factor influencing the choice of gas mixture; the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity, cost, and other factors are also important.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff, that {{the laws of physics}} are {{inherently}} dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, {{there was no way to}} relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: c, ħ, and G, in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.|$|E

In 1866 the United States Congress passed a bill making it lawful to use the metric system in the United States. The bill, which was permissive rather than mandatory in nature, defined the metric system in terms of customary units rather than {{with reference to the}} international prototype metre and kilogram. By 1893, the reference standards for customary units had become unreliable. Moreover, the United States, being a signatory of the Metre Convention was in possession of national prototype metres and kilograms that were calibrated against those in use elsewhere in the world. This led to the Mendenhall Order which redefined the customary units by referring to the national metric prototypes, but used the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> of the 1866 act. [...] In 1896 a bill that would make the metric system mandatory in the United States was presented to Congress. Of the 29 people who gave evidence before the congressional committee who were considering the bill, 23 were in favor of the bill, but six were against. Four of the six dissenters represented manufacturing interests and the other two the United States Revenue service. The grounds cited were the cost and inconvenience of the change-over. The bill was not enacted. Subsequent bills suffered a similar fate.|$|E

40|$|A global {{drive to}} source {{additional}} and sustainable biomass {{for the production}} of protein has resulted in a renewed interest in the protein content of seaweeds. However, to determine accurately the potential of seaweeds as a source of protein requires reliable quantitative methods. This article systematically analysed the literature to assess the approaches and methods of protein determination and to provide an evidence-based <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> for nitrogen to protein that is specific to seaweeds. Almost 95 % of studies on seaweeds determined protein either by direct extraction procedures (42 % of all studies) or by applying an indirect nitrogen-to-protein <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> of 6. 25 (52 % of all studies), with the latter as the most widely used method in the last 6 years. Meta-analysis of the true protein content, defined as the sum of the proteomic amino acids, demonstrated that direct extraction procedures underestimated protein content by 33 %, while the most commonly used indirect nitrogen-to-protein <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> of 6. 25 over-estimated protein content by 43 %. We therefore determined whether a single nitrogen-to-protein <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> could be used for seaweeds and evaluated how robust this would be by analysing the variation in this factor for 103 species across 44 studies that span three phyla, multiple geographic regions and a range of nitrogen contents.

2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E
