50|$|With {{very small}} {{currents}} and considering shorter time scales (thus wider bandwidths) shot noise can be significant. For instance, a microwave <b>circuit</b> <b>operates</b> on <b>time</b> scales {{of less than}} a nanosecond and {{if we were to}} have a current of 16 nanoamperes that would amount to only 100 electrons passing every nanosecond. According to Poisson statistics the actual number of electrons in any nanosecond would vary by 10 electrons rms, so that one sixth of the time less than 90 electrons would pass a point and one sixth of the time more than 110 electrons would be counted in a nanosecond. Now with this small current viewed on this time scale, the shot noise amounts to 1/10 of the DC current itself.|$|R

40|$|A new {{probabilistic}} approach to transient stability evaluation of electrical power systems is proposed. The method {{is relevant to}} planning studies, where load level is {{a major source of}} uncertainty. The probabilistic nature of both the load demand and the <b>circuit</b> breaker <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> is taken into account for the purpose of obtaining an analytical evaluation of the instability probability. The approach is based upon the analytical computation of the probability distribution function of the critical clearing time for stability in terms of the load demand distribution. It allows the expression of the instability probability as an analytical function of all the relevant system parameters. The method is illustrated with reference to a simple (one machine - infinite bus) system, and the results are compared with those obtained by means of statistical (Monte Carlo) simulation. The time requirement of the two methods is comparable, but the proposed analytical approach offers a remarkable advantage over the Monte Carlo method for a sensitivity analysis with respect to the system parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{low-power}} electronic devices is increasing rapidly in current VLSI technology. Instead of conventional CMOS <b>circuit</b> <b>operating</b> at nominal supply voltage, {{several kinds of}} circuits are brought about {{with the goal of}} reducing power consumption. This research is mainly focused on evaluating performance, power and variation tolerance of near/sub-threshold computing and adiabatic logic circuits. Arithmetic logic units (ALUs) are designed with 15 nm FinFET process technologies for these circuit styles. The evaluation is carried out by simulations on these ALU designs. The variation model considers ambient temperature variations and power supply fluctuations that emulate wireless sensor node applications.

40|$|This paper gives {{a unified}} {{treatment}} for electronic sequential circuit realizations and suitable procedures for synthesizing them. This {{is done by}} showing that every sequential <b>circuit</b> <b>operating</b> in synchronous mode can be transformed into an equivalent sequential <b>circuit</b> <b>operating</b> in fundamental mode with {{the same number of}} internal states. The basic idea is to consider, for both the major types of sequential circuits, circuits having pulse inputs -PS circuits for sequential <b>circuits</b> <b>operating</b> in synchronous mode, and PF circuits for sequential <b>circuits</b> <b>operating</b> in fundamental mode - and to investigate the relationship between them. A concurrent and a self concurrent operation is defined for PF ciruits, and it is shown that any synchronous mode sequential circuit can be transformed into an equivalent normal or self-concurrent PF circuit realization inherently free of essential hazards and critical races. Moreover, it is seen that static hazards that can influence the circuit operation can be detected and eliminated by formal methods. The circuit realizations discussed in this paper are composed by a defined number of subcircuits, and it is shown that these subcircuits can in turn be decomposed to obtain circuit realizations with flipflops or register elements. Finally, it is shown that by similar methods level-input fundamental mode sequential circuits can also be transformed into self-concurrent PF circuit realizations in order to eliminate essential hazards and critical races...|$|R
