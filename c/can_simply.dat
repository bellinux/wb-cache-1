5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E
5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> explore the city at their own pace. All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
25|$|Fisher's {{distribution}} <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> {{be defined}} as the conditional distribution of two or more independent binomial variates dependent upon their sum. A multivariate version of the Fisher's distribution is used if there are more than two colors of balls.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} to rectify our reasonings is to make them as {{tangible}} {{as those of the}} Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> say: Let us calculate , without further ado, to see who is right.|$|E

25|$|Libraries {{specified}} by the environment variable LD_PRELOAD and then those listed in /etc/ld.so.preload are loaded before the search begins. A preload can thus be used to replace some (or all) of the requested library's normal functionalities, or it <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> be used to supply a library that would otherwise not be found.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} useful in {{simplifying}} the implementation of arithmetic on computer hardware. Adding 0011(3) to 1111(1) at first seems to give the incorrect answer of 10010. However, the hardware <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> ignore the left-most bit to give the correct answer of 0010(2). Overflow checks still must exist to catch operations such as summing 0100 and 0100.|$|E
25|$|The website {{received}} a visual overhaul in 2014 that {{gave it a}} completely new look and improved performance. It also simplified {{some of the most}} common tasks, such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file, and added drag-and-drop functionality, where users <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> drag selected files to folders, for improved organization.|$|E

Hence, N <b>can</b> be <b>simply</b> denoted x’. Moreover, since the third elemental rotation occurs about Z, it {{does not change the}} orientation of Z. Hence Z coincides with z″.

25|$|The {{common opinion}} is that the nail enters inside the paronychium, but an ingrown toenail <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet , they occur most commonly with the toenails.|$|E
25|$|Retaining {{possession}} in {{this way}} may also {{be regarded as a}} longer-term way of defending, as the opposing team cannot attack when they don't have the ball. With the ball, the team applying this tactic <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> pass the ball between each other - as in the possession football style, but with little or no intention of building up an attack, thus decreasing the risk of a break.|$|E
25|$|Blocks can be whittled {{with a hand}} knife, bandsaw, or Dremel carving {{tool for}} major shaping. Decals can be bought at scout shops or hobby shops. It is also {{possible}} to use standard model decals to replicate actual racing cars such as Richard Petty's 1970 Plymouth Superbird. The original style is based on open-wheel cars; however, fender or body kits are available, or wheels <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> be placed outboard of the body.|$|E

25|$|Native Americans {{view the}} whiteshaman {{with a mix}} of humor and contempt. It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is {{upsetting}} to Native Americans, but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture (their images are shadows of the true Indian style). Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experience.|$|E
25|$|Stableford {{can have}} {{the added benefit of}} {{speeding}} up the pace of play, as once it is no longer possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole.|$|E
25|$|An {{improvement}} to the Kasiski examination, {{known as}} Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies {{to discover the}} key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, the cryptanalyst <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable when the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still {{be used to determine}} key length in that case.|$|E

25|$|Federal {{cases and}} some states follow Federal Rule 27 (a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure {{concerning}} {{the production of}} documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions. These can include the subpoena duces tecum to produce documents, {{or in some cases}} to undergo a physical or mental examination.
