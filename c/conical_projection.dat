Olaf Nikolas Olsen had been appointed {{as the director of}} publication; he proposed to publish the map on four sheets, and he probably also defined the scale of 1:480,000 and the <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> used. The map was published under Olsen's name, with the Literary Society of Iceland as the publisher, and paid by the Danish treasury. The title page was in Danish and French. Although dated 1844, it was probably not completed until 1848. In 1849, a smaller version of the map on one sheet at a scale of 1:960,000 was published.|$|E
6000|$|We {{will now}} {{consider}} the internal {{structure of the}} bladder. The whole inner surface, {{with the exception of}} the valve, is seen under a moderately high power to be covered with a serried mass of processes (fig. 21). Each of these consists of four divergent arms; whence their name of quadrifid processes. They arise from small angular cells, at the junctions of the angles of the larger cells which form the interior of the bladder. The middle part of the upper surface of these small cells projects a little, and then contracts into a very short and narrow footstalk which bears the four arms (fig. 22.). Of these, two are long, but often of not quite equal length, and project obliquely inwards and towards the posterior end of the bladder. The two others are much shorter, and project at a smaller angle, that is, are more nearly horizontal, and are directed towards the anterior end of the bladder. These arms are only moderately sharp; they are composed of ex- [page 403] tremely thin transparent membrane, so that they can be bent or doubled in any direction without being broken. They are lined with a delicate layer of protoplasm, as is likewise the short <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> from which they arise. Each arm generally (but not invariably) contains a minute, faintly brown particle, either rounded or more commonly elongated, which exhibits incessant Brownian movements. These par- ...|$|E

50|$|Pupation {{takes place}} on the same plant within a cell. The pupa is long and cylindrical, watery green in colour. It has a long <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> {{in front of the}} head. The eyes are easily seen but do not {{protrude}} out of the outline of the pupa. The pupa broadens towards the shoulders and the abdomen gradually tapers to the last segment.|$|E
5000|$|The lateral {{surface is}} {{prolonged}} obliquely downward into a strong, <b>conical</b> <b>projection,</b> the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of the brachioradialis, and by its apex to the radial collateral ligament of wrist joint.

25|$|Tangent and secant lines (standard lines) are {{represented}} undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in <b>conical</b> <b>projections,</b> {{it is called}} a standard parallel. The central meridian is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written λ) and a parallel of origin (usually written φ) are often used to define {{the origin of the}} map projection.|$|R

50|$|Astichopus multifidus is a robust, soft-bodied species {{growing to}} a maximum length of 40 cm and width of 10 cm. Both its dorsal and ventral {{surfaces}} are uniformly covered with hundreds of tube feet, those on the dorsal surface being extended into papillae, fleshy <b>conical</b> <b>projections</b> about 1 cm long with tube feet at their tips. This sea cucumber is chocolate brown or dark grey, sometimes mottled with paler patches or speckled with many small white spots.|$|R
50|$|Cormus {{composed}} of large, irregular and loosely anastomosed tubes. Water-collecting tubes converge to form <b>conical</b> <b>projections</b> with an osculum. The {{surface of the}} tubes is hispid {{because of the presence}} of diactines and trichoxea. Cells with granules have not been observed. The skeleton comprises equiangular and equiradiate triactines and very few tetractines. Actines are conical and straight, with a sharp tip. Diactines and fusiform and slightly curved. They are projected towards the exterior of the tubes. Trichoxeas are also present, perpendicular to the surface of the tubes.|$|R
50|$|In mammals, {{the crown}} of the molars and premolars are folded into {{a wide range of}} complex shapes. The basic {{elements}} of the crown are the more or less <b>conical</b> <b>projections</b> called cusps and the valleys that separate them. The cusps contain both dentine and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenullations, are the result of different enamel thickness. Cusps are occasionally joined to form ridges and expanded to form crests. Cingula are often incomplete ridges that pass {{around the base of the}} crown.|$|R
50|$|Ceratogyrus {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} African theraphosid genera by the combined presence of a retrolateral cheliceral scopula composed of plumose, stridulatory setae and the strongly procurved fovea. The fovea is typically strongly procurved and in some species surrounds a distinct protuberance. this protuberance may {{take the form of}} a simple posterior extension of the caput, a low-set plug or a prominent, discrete <b>conical</b> <b>projection.</b> All Ceratogyrus species possess a pale yellow anteriorly placed, transverse, sub-abdominal band. This feature is not distinct in other Harpatirinae except Augacephalus junodi. The absence of dense, ventral femoral fringes on the palpi and legs I and II distinguish Ceratogyrus spp. from female A. junodi.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings are fuscous, paler in the disc, the costa suffused with ferruginous brown, darkest on the edge, {{the lower edge}} with faint projections at one-third and two-thirds. The second discal stigma is indicated by a minute linear-transverse mark of several dark fuscous scales {{and there is a}} slender streak of blackish suffusion along the dorsum from one-fourth to near the tornus, as well as an indistinct <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> of dark fuscous irroration reaching from the dorsum at three-fourths half across the wing. There is also a narrow whitish-grey terminal fascia, preceded on the costa by a small black spot. The hindwings are rather dark fuscous.|$|E
50|$|Because the wenxiang diagram is {{generated}} by a <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> of a helix onto a plane, with the start (N-terminus) of the helix at the edge and the end toward the center, the location of each residue in a helix is not only defined by an angle around the diagram’s center, but is also defined by its radius {{from the center of}} the diagram in number of turns, which corresponds to its distance along the helix, in number of turns. Therefore, in principle, the wenxiang diagram can be used to represent an alpha-helix of any length. The example shown is quite long, with 7 turns and sequence NIAEAVQQLNHTIVNAAHELHETLGL; its hydrophobic side is in red and its hydrophilic side in blue.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCompton cameras {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{in order to increase}} sensitivity in conventional radiation imaging equipped with hole collimators. However, one must deal directly with three dimensional <b>conical</b> <b>projections,</b> which poses the inversion problem for integral data on cone surfaces which does not have so far an analytic solution. In an attempt to clarify this situation, we consider a new two-dimensional Compton camera in which the data are collected as integrals of the radio-tracer on broken lines, actually rotating V-lines, whose vertex is on a circular arch. In the absence of an inversion formula, we present simulation results obtained from a back-projection technique and truncated singular value decomposition...|$|R

50|$|Biomicroscopically lenticonus is {{characterized}} by a transparent, localized, sharply demarcated <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> of the lens capsule and cortex, usually axial in localization. In an early stage, retro-illumination shows an «oil droplet» configuration. Using a narrow slit, the image of a conus is observed. In a more advanced stage associated subcapsular and cortical opacities appear. Retinoscopically the oil droplet produces a pathognomonic scissors movement of the light reflex. This phenomenon is due to the different refraction in the central and the peripheral area of the lens. Ultrasonography also can illustrate the existence of a lenticonus. A-scan ultrasonography may reveal an increased lens thickness and B- scanultrasonography may show herniated lenticular material, suggestive of a lenticonus. Amblyopia, cataract, strabismus and loss of central fixation may be observed in association with lenticonus posterior. Cataract,flecked retinopathy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy and corneal arcus juvenilis may be encountered in association with lenticonus anterior that occurs {{as a part of the}} Alport syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The {{main part}} of the Medora Site is a pyramid and plaza arrangement. Mound A is a {{platform}} mound about 125 ft to 130 ft at the base and 10 ft high. The sides sloped inward toward the top, which is flat, except for a <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> 25 ft in diameter in the northeast corner of the summit that raises the gross elevation to 13 ft. It was probably surmounted by a square or rectangular temple. About 400 ft to the southeast of Mound A was a low mound about 100 ft in diameter and 5 ft high, designated Mound B. Although it has been modified by plowing and flood waters, and is now only about 2 ft high. It was flat-topped, with an irregular oval outline. Its pre-mound surface was found to have a wall-trench structure, probably a house or temple. The floor contained patches of burned clay and fragments of charcoal. At the center there was a rounded fire basin 2 ft in diameter and six inches deep, lined with burned clay. The mounds were composed of gray clay and brown silt, applied basket load at a time. Between Mounds A and B was a plaza about 400 ft long and 200 ft wide. Its west side bordered Bayou Bourbeaux.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} fluke, somehow vase-shaped and bright-pink in colour. In average it {{measures}} 5-8 mm long and 3-5 mm wide. The disc-shaped body is divisible into anterior conical and posterior discoidal regions. The anterior region is a <b>conical</b> <b>projection</b> bearing a prominent oral sucker. The posterior portion is relatively broad (up to 8 mm), discoidal and ventrally excavated. It is an amphistome worm such that the ventral sucker {{is close to the}} posterior end. The body covering, tegument is smooth in appearance but the fine structure is actually a series of concentric folds bearing numerous tightly packed tubercles. Ventral surface contains a specialised region of the tegument. Ciliated and non-ciliated papillae are arranged around the oral sucker. The incomplete alimentary canal consists of a pair of lateral pouches arising from the oral sucker and a slightly tortuous pharyngeal tube, which bifurcates into two gut caeca. The large excretory bladder is in the middle behind the ventral sucker. As a hermaphrodite, both male and female reproductive system are present which are arranged in the posterior region. The testes lie in alongside the bifurcation of the caeca, and a common genital pore is on the cone just anterior to the bifurcation. The oval-shaped ovary lies just posterior to the testes in the middle, and the loosely coiled uterus opens to the genital pore. Vitelline glands are scattered around the caeca.|$|E
50|$|The skull {{possesses}} an unusually-shaped snout, with sharply downturned premaxillae.

The mandible is considerably robust and is dotted with small sharp teeth, along with a pair of pointed <b>conical</b> <b>projections</b> towards the tip, the function of which is unknown.The strange skull suggests a highly specialized lifestyle. It has been speculated that the projections on the mandible were used to crush hard-shelled prey such as molluscs. Other paleontologists disagree with this hypothesis, arguing that the projections do not occlude against any other potential crushing surface in the jaws, instead making contact with the rostral diastema.|$|R
