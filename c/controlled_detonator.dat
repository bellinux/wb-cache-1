5000|$|Bradley {{reports that}} in an {{alternative}} version of the bombing—provided to him by Saudi opposition figures with sources among disgruntled {{members of the security}} forces and government—the police car was [...] "in fact ... a car belonging to the Saudi special security forces," [...] and that the bomb was not detonated in suicide but by remote <b>control,</b> its <b>detonators</b> escaping unharmed.

5000|$|O’Rourke {{found the}} average number of victims killed by a female suicide {{attacker}} was higher than that for male attackers for every group studied (Tamil, PKK, Lebanese, Chechen, Palestinian). Consequently, terrorist organizations recruit and motivate women to participate in suicide attacks, using traditional attitudes of honor and feminine harmlessness and vulnerability among target populations to insert attackers were they can cause a maximum of death and destruction. [...] Bombs have been disguised as a pregnant belly, avoiding invasive searches, seen as taboo. By stumbling or calling out in distress more victims may be drawn to the explosion. These women have proven to be more deadly with higher success rates with more casualties and deaths than their male counterparts. The woman bomber carriers are not permitted to hold and <b>control</b> the <b>detonator,</b> which are still held by the men in charge. [...] Until recently, attacks of women bombers were considered more newsworthy because of the [...] "unladylike" [...] behavior of their perpetrator.|$|R
