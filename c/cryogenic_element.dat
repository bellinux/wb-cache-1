40|$|This report {{describes}} the essential <b>elements</b> of the <b>cryogenic</b> system. The cryogenic distribution system {{starts at the}} level of the linac superconducting RF cavities [1] and moves out through the cryogenic piping to the liquid helium refrigeration plant that will be used to cool the RF cavities and the undulator magnets. For this report, the cryogenic distribution system and cryogenic refrigerator includes the following elements: (1) The piping within the linac cryogenic modules will influence the heat transfer through the super-fluid helium from the outer surface of the TESLA niobium cavity and the liquid to gas interface within the horizontal header pipe where the superfluid helium boils. This piping determines the final design of the linac cryogenic module. (2) The acceptable pressure drops determine the supply and return piping dimensions. (3) The helium distribution system is determined by the need to cool down and warm up the various elements in the light source. (4) The size of the cryogenic plant is determined by the heat loads and the probable margin of error on those heat loads. Since the final heat loads are determined by the acceleration gradient in the cavities, a linac with five cryogenic modules will be compared to a linac with only four cryogenic modules. The design assumes that all <b>cryogenic</b> <b>elements</b> in the facility will be cooled using a common cryogenic plant. To minimize vibration effects on the beam lines, this plant is assumed to be located some distance from the synchrotron light beam lines. All of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>elements</b> in the facility will be attached to the helium refrigeration system through cryogenic transfer lines. The largest single cryogenic load is the main linac, which consists of four or five cryogenic modules depending on the design gradient for the cavities in the linac section. The second largest heat load comes from the cryogenic modules that contain the transverse deflecting RF cavities. The injector linac is the third largest heat load. The seven superconducting undulator magnets in the hard x-ray production section are the smallest heat loads connected to the light source refrigeration plant. The linac and deflecting cavity sections require helium cooling at 1. 9 K, 5 K and 40 K. The undulator magnets require two-phase helium cooling at 4. 3 to 4. 5 K...|$|R
40|$|The design beam {{lifetime}} of 100 h for LHC imposes stringent requirements on the residual gas density in the vacuum chamber. This density can strongly increase due to ion induced gas desorption, {{as it was}} observed {{for the first time}} in the ISR. In the LHC, the ion induced gas desorption may lead to pressure runaway and, consequently, to the loss of the proton beam. The beam current that can be stored is limited, being the residual gas ionisation rate proportional to the beam current. Given the geometry and the pumping speed of the chamber, there is a critical current, above which the gas density diverges. In this paper, the gas density profile and the stability conditions are evaluated for different sections of the LHC, both for the <b>elements</b> at <b>cryogenic</b> and room temperature. For the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>elements,</b> it is found that the stability at ultimate beam current (0. 85 A) can be guaranteed if a beam screen is interposed between the proton beam and the cold bore vacuum chambers. In the warm sections, baking and discharge cleaning can ensure stability if the appropriate pumping is provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical cryocoolers {{represent}} a sigmficant enabling technology for precision space instruments by providing cryogenic temperatures for sensitive infrared, gamma-ray, and x-ray detectors. However, the vibration {{generated by the}} cryocooler's refrigeration compressor has long {{been identified as a}} critical integration issue. The key sensitivity {{is the extent to which}} the cooler's vibration harmonics excite spacecraft resonances and prevent on-board sensors from achieving their operational goals with respect to resolution and pointing accuracy. To reduce the cryocooler's vibration signature to acceptable levels, a variety of active vibration suppression technologies have been developed and imple-mented over the past 15 years. At this point, nearly all space cryocoolers have active vibration suppression systems built into their drive electronics that reduce the peak unbalanced forces to less than 1 % of their original levels. Typical systems of today individually control the vibration in each of the cryocoolers lowest drive harmonics, with some controlling as many as 16 harmonics. A second vibration issue associated with cryocoolers is surviving launch. Here the same pistons and coldfingers that generate vibration during operation are often the most critical elements in terms of surviving high input accelera-tion levels. Since electrical power is generally not available during launch, passive vibration suppression technologies have been developed. Common vibration damping techniques include electrodynamic braking via shorted motor coils and the use of particle dampers on sensitive <b>cryogenic</b> <b>elements.</b> This paper provides an overview of the vibration characteristics of typical linear-drive space cryocoolers, outlines the history of development and typical performance of the various active and passive vibration suppression systems being used...|$|R

Limitations of μ-metal magnetic characteristics at cryogenic conditions are overcome by a soft Ni 81 -Mo 5 -Fe magnetic alloy (referred to as cryogenic permalloy). An optimized geometrical design allows cores saturation due to mechanical constraints to be avoided. The effectiveness of the design is demonstrated through electromagnetic simulations exploiting measurement results from the characterization of cryogenic permalloy samples.

40|$|Future space {{submillimeter}} telescopes {{will require}} large-format (many 1000 's of elements) imaging detector arrays to perform state-of-the-art astronomical observations. A crucial issue {{related to a}} focal plane array is a readout scheme which is compatible {{with large numbers of}} <b>cryogenic</b> detectors <b>elements.</b> When the number of elements becomes of the order of thousands the electrical layout for individual readout amplifiers becomes nearly impossible. Another important concern is about the large number of wires leading to a 0. 1 - 0. 3 K platform. In the case of TES, a scheme for time-division multiplexing of SQUID read-out amplifiers has been recently demonstrated [1]. In this scheme the number of SQUIDs is as many as the number of the detectors (N) but only one SQUID is turned on at a time. The SQUIDs are connected in series in columns so the number of wires leading to the amplifiers can be reduced, but it is still of the order of N. Another approach [2] uses a frequency domain multiplexing of the bolometer array. The bolometers are biased with ac currents whose frequencies are individual for each element and are much higher than the bolometer bandwidth. The output signals are connected in series in a summing loop which is coupled to a single SQUID amplifier. The total numbe...|$|R
40|$|The {{safe and}} {{reliable}} operation of high pressure test stands for rocket engine and component testing places an increased emphasis on the performance of control valves and flow metering devices. In this paper, we will present a series of high fidelity computational analyses of systems ranging from cryogenic control valves and pressure regulator systems to cavitating venturis that are used to support rocket engine and component testing at NASA Stennis Space Center. A generalized multi-element framework with sub-models for grid adaption, grid movement and multi-phase flow dynamics has been used to carry out the simulations. Such a framework provides the flexibility of resolving the structural and functional complexities that are typically associated with valve-based high pressure feed systems and have been difficult to deal with traditional CFD methods. Our simulations revealed a rich variety of flow phenomena such as secondary flow patterns, hydrodynamic instabilities, fluctuating vapor pockets etc. In the paper, we will discuss performance losses related to cryogenic control valves, and provide insight into the physics of the dominant multi-phase fluid transport phenomena that are responsible for the choking like behavior in <b>cryogenic</b> control <b>elements.</b> Additionally, we will provide detailed analyses of the modal instability that is observed in the operation of the dome pressure regulator valve.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} new L-band (1. 4 GHz) Cryogenic Phased Array Feed (PAF) system, referred to as the GBT 2 array. Results from initial measurements made with the GBT 2 array are also presented. The PAF was developed for the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of the Focal L-band Array for the GBT (FLAG) project. During the first stage of the development work (Phase I), a prototype <b>cryogenic</b> 19 <b>element</b> dual-polarized array with "Kite" dipole elements was developed and tested on the GBT. The measured system temperature over efficiency (T_sys/η) ratio for the bore sight beam of the Kite array was 45. 5 K at 1. 55 GHz. The off-boresight T_sys/η shows an increase by 13 K at an offset equal to the half power beam width (7 ^'. 2 at 1. 7 GHz). Our measurements indicate that the off-boresight degradation and field-of-view (FoV) limitation of the Kite array is simply due to the fixed array size. To increase the FoV, a new 19 -element GBT 2 array with larger array spacing was developed during FLAG Phase II. The frequency response of the array was optimized from 1. 2 to 1. 6 GHz. A system with larger cryostat, new low noise amplifiers (LNAs), down-conversion and digitization close to the front end, unformatted digital transmission over fiber, ROACH II based polyphase filter banks (PFBs) with bandwidth 150 MHz and a data acquisition system that records voltage samples from one of the PFB channels were all developed. The data presented here is processed off-line. The receiver temperature measured with the new system is 17 K at 1. 4 GHz, an improvement > 8 K over the previous Kite array. Measurements with the GBT 2 array on the telescope are in progress. A real time 150 MHz beamformer is also being developed as part of an NSF-funded collaboration between NRAO/GBO/BYU & West Virginia University (Beamformer Project) to support science observations.

Current bonded joint concepts include internal invar plug fittings, external saddle titanium/invar fittings and composite gusset/clip joints all bonded to M 55 J/ 954 - 6 and T 300 / 954 - 6 hybrid composite tubes (75 mm square). Analytical experience and design work done on metal/composite bonded joints at temperatures below that of liquid nitrogen are limited and important analysis tools, material properties, and failure criteria for composites at cryogenic temperatures are sparse in the literature.
