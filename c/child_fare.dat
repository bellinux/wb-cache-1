2500|$|From January 1980, special flat fares were {{introduced}} for children travelling with the Railcard holder. [...] At first, {{up to four}} children (between 5 and 15 years of age inclusive) could travel per senior citizen, each paying £0.50 irrespective {{of the length of}} the journey. [...] This was increased to £1.00 on 1 February 1981. [...] From 12 March 1985, flat fares only applied in Second Class accommodation. [...] Finally, on 5 January 1992, child discounts with the Railcard were withdrawn completely; any accompanying children now had to pay the normal <b>child</b> <b>fare.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{most recent}} change {{involving}} the discount structure happened as from 29 May 2000, and involved {{the introduction of}} another new ticket stock with a changed logo, red upper band and new form number (RSP 4599/253; all previous APTIS Family Railcards had used BR 4599/19, or RSP 4599/19 after privatisation.) [...] All adult fares received a 34% discount, representing an improvement in respect of Saver and Supersaver fares; but the child discount was amended from a flat fare of £2.00 to a 60% discount on the full <b>child</b> <b>fare</b> (equivalent to an 81% discount on the full adult fare). [...] This was subject to a £1.00 minimum fare. [...] These conditions and discounts remain in place as of 2007.|$|E
2500|$|A {{larger and}} more {{controversial}} change occurred as from 2 June 2002, when the discount level was changed: a minimum adult fare of £10.00 was imposed for weekday journeys, and children now received an 81% discount on the full adult fare (equivalent to a 60% on the full <b>child</b> <b>fare,</b> and subject to a minimum fare of £1.00) instead of the former £1.00 flat fare for all journeys. [...] This meant that on a weekday, holders would receive no discount if the standard adult full fare was £10.00 or less, and a discount of less than 34% on fares between £10.05 and £15.00. [...] Longer journeys for children would also become more expensive. [...] Transport pressure group Transport 2000 and environmental organisation Friends of the Earth condemned the proposals, and Reading East MP Jane Griffiths tabled an Early Day Motion in the British Parliament opposing the changes. [...] This gained the support of 38 other MPs from all major parties. [...] Research commissioned by Transport 2000 indicated that 90% of journeys typically made in the railcard area would no longer gain any discount (as {{a result of the}} full adult fare being £10.00 or below), a further 3.5% would attract a discount of less than 34%, and only 6.5% would still be subject to the full 34% discount as before. [...] This reflects the fact that many journeys undertaken in the area are short and [...] "local" [...] in nature, and that the area as a whole is fairly small in size (as [...] shows, it does not extend a very long way from London in any direction).|$|E

40|$|The {{social policy}} defines what is social problems. There {{is no clear}} {{scientific}} explanation to why <b>children</b> <b>fare</b> badly and unity in what constitutes a bad parenthood that leads to deficiency of care (Sundell&Egelund 2000). The society's values are fickle and influences what to be defined as social problems. In the prevailing period, the discourse produces the social norm (Claezon 2004). The aim with {{this study was to}} examine which <b>children</b> that <b>fare</b> badly and attitudes about it the good and the insufficient parenthood between 1921 - 1923 and 1997 - 2007. The survey was a qualitative file study in witch we studied child welfare. Resemblances and differences have also been studied between these two periods.   This in order to get a grasp on what has been changed and what is left of the old times and still influence the modern society in child welfare. Our theoretical starting point is the power of the discourse. Children that are considered fare badly and the attitude of what defines good parenthood is shaped by the cultural values of society that is made visible in child welfare. Through this theoretical perspectives, children, young people and parents that are defined as deviant with shortcomings and imperfection that is to be corrected by the society’s measures. Fahlgren (1999) claims that discourse vary both historically and cultural in the society and its aim is to create order and truth within different areas and is also based on views about interpretation in the society. This is how norms are created of what is considered to be normal. The result of our study shows that the social welfare of children is influenced by attitudes within society. The prevailing discourse influence how society defines which <b>children</b> <b>fare</b> badly and that the conception is about good respective insufficient parenthood. This is changed over time and characterized of the society's cultural and historical contexts.   Keywords: <b>child</b> welfare, <b>children</b> <b>fare</b> badly, parenthoo...|$|R

The first change happened as from 1 October 1991, with a six-month Railcard being priced at £4.00 and giving a 34% discount on all ticket types for journeys between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh, Thurso and Wick. In September 1994, the Railcard was made available free, and a 34% discount was available on the standard <b>Child</b> <b>fare</b> for one accompanying child.
