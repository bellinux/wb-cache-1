40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to analyse the {{importance}} of longevity {{in relation to the}} welfare of production animals.

The analysis shows that the interpretation of the concept of animal welfare is important for decisions on whether or not to <b>cull</b> <b>animals,</b> but also for the measures that should be taken to prevent premature culling. This is illustrated by two examples in animal production, one example relating to dairy cattle and the other to breeding sows. These two types of farming have in common that in these practices animals are necessary to produce products, yet this production does not require– the animal itself to be killed. My proposal is to accept the view on animal welfare according to which longevity is accepted as an independent moral argument. Acceptance of this view substantiates the intuition that premature <b>culling</b> of <b>animals</b> is a moral wrong, because it shows that we have additional reasons to give the interests of animals more weight. In order to respect this view, some common practices in animal farming will become the subject of debate, as illustrated in the two cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comLivestock production has been confronted with several epidemics over the last decades. The morality of common animal disease strategies—stamping out and vaccination—is being debated and provokes controversies among farmers, authorities and the broader public. Given the complexity and controversy of choosing an appropriate control strategy, this article explores the potential of nano-enabled diagnostics in future livestock production. At first glance, these applications offer promising opportunities for better animal disease surveillance. By significantly shortening the reaction time from diagnosis to appropriate control, they could complement the current disease management strategies. Although nano-enabled diagnostics will not make livestock disease eradication strategies redundant or completely free of the <b>culling</b> of infected <b>animals,</b> these diagnostics could significantly {{reduce the number of}} <b>culled</b> <b>animals</b> and animal suffering. This article aims to demonstrate that the ethical assessment of advanced diagnostics can build on the experiences with decision making in biomedical ethics where nonmaleficence, beneficence, autonomy and justice serve as important benchmarks. Nano-enabled diagnostics may be an ethically sound solution if it can resolve the dilemma between stamping out and vaccination in favor of the latter and if it can balance the autonomy–paternalism dilemma between farmers and authorities. The technology should allow to be switched on and off by farmers, whilst simultaneously allowing for a weak paternalism on behalf of authorities in order to benefit the farmer and broader society and to protect them from harm. status: publishe...|$|R

Testes from eland (Taurotragus oryx) were collected and epididymides removed and maintained at 4 °C.

Sub-par or <b>cull</b> <b>animals</b> from other breeding goals (laboratory, exhibition/show, wool, pet) may also be used for meat (particularly in smallholder operations). However, dwarf breeds are rarely primarily used for meat production, due to the small size, slow growth, and low numbers of offspring per litter.

40|$|Abstract: Alaska's {{reindeer}} (Rangifer tarandus) {{industry has}} been faced with the competitive need to increase productivity but cautioned to avoid range degradation {{as a result of}} high stocking rates. Consumer demand for lean, healthy, high quality meat has increased throughout the world and has surpassed production. For herders to tap these new domestic and off-shore markets, there will be the need for higher herd numbers and animal productivity, consistent slaughter protocol, and a focused marketing plan. In this paper, we illustrate how record-keeping can benefit reindeer herders in husbandry and management decisions that are necessary to increase animal productivity and, eventually, product quality and profits. These biological parameters were tested in a Lotus ® spreadsheet model designed to predict herd growth and economics. Records of three reinde-er herds on the Seward Peninsula have shown that calf production for adults has ranged from 35 to 98 %. Sensitivity analysis predicted that in some herds, the model was sensitive to small changes in calf survival which could result in insufficient recruitment to maintain long-term harvest. Productivity may be ultimately related to management decisions that <b>cull</b> <b>animals</b> before productivity begins to decline. ...|$|R
