40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of an annular ring detector consisting of optical fibers terminated with photodetectors is described. The maximum width of each concentric ring {{has to be}} small enough to permit the resolution of a Ronchi ruling transform with a dot spacing of 150 microns. A minimum of 100 <b>concentric</b> rings <b>covering</b> a circular area of 2. 54 cm diameter also is necessary. A fiber-optic array consisting of approximately 89, 000 fibers of 76 microns diameter was fabricated to meet the above requirements. The fibers within a circular area of 2. 5 cm diameter were sorted into 168 adjacent rings concentric with the center fiber. The response characteristics of several photodetectors were measured, and the data used to compare their linearity of response and dynamic range. Also, coupling loss measurements were made for three different methods of terminating the optical fibers with a photodetector...|$|R

Construction of the north-western sector was started in 1613 and was finished around 1625. After 1664, building in the southern sector was started, although slowly because of an economic depression. The eastern part of the <b>concentric</b> canal plan, <b>covering</b> the area between the Amstel river and the IJ Bay, was not implemented for a long time. In the following centuries, the land went mostly for park, the Botanical garden, old age homes, theaters and other public facilities - and for waterways without much plan. Several parts of the city and of the urban area are polders, recognizable by their postfix -meer meaning 'lake', such as Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer, and Watergraafsmeer. The canals in Amsterdam are now used as a main form of transportation around the city.|$|R
40|$|Sophisticated {{models of}} {{volcanic}} scenarios are increasingly {{sensitive to the}} accuracy of their input parameters and constitutive equations for magma properties. Viscosity is certainly {{one of the most important}} magma properties, but only recently systematic investigations on silicate liquids with natural compositions have started. We investigated the Newtonian viscosity of dry and hydrous phonolitic and trachytic melts from Vesuvius and Phlegrean Fields volcanic complexes, respectively. The analysed samples come from the deposits of the AD 1631 (Vesuvius) and ca. 4400 BP Agnano Monte Spina (AMS) (Phlegrean Fields) eruptions that are commonly taken as reference events for the most hazardous scenarios in case of reactivation of the two volcanoes. Samples were hydrated via piston cylinder synthesis at P= 10 kbar and T = 1600 °C. The dry high temperature and dry or hydrous low temperature viscosities were measured by a combination of micropenetration and <b>concentric</b> cylinder techniques, <b>covering</b> a total temperature range from about 400 to 1500 °C, water content range from virtually dry to 3. 8 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a century there has been debate {{concerning}} the mechanism of accommodation-whether the lens capsule or lens material itself determines the functional relationship between ciliary muscle contractility and lens deformation during refractive adaptation. This morphological study in monkey eyes investigates the composition and distribution of several connective tissue components in the accommodative apparatus relaying muscle force to lens organization. Elastin distributes on the marginal surface of the ciliary process. A zonule is composed of fibrillin produced by epithelial cells of the process. In the progress of extension over the posterior chamber, fibrils unite into strands and possess longitudinal plasticity. By induction of the elastin network, strands extend in a <b>concentric</b> direction <b>covering</b> the equatorial region of the capsule. Upon tethering to the lens, the strand ramifies into fibrils, penetrating deeply close to the epithelial layer of the lens and binding with the collagen of the intercellular spaces. Tight linkage of the zonule with the capsule transmits precise contractility. Inside the lens, the cortical layer's elastic connective tissue network forms widely spaced lamellae of crystalline fibers. In contrast, the central nuclear lamellae are tightly opposed. The accumulation of lamellae is greater in the anterior cortex than in the posterior, yielding a more variable anterior chamber depth in the visual axis. The plasticity of the zonule and connective tissue distribution inside the lens produces an adjustable configuration. Thus, tight linkage between the dynamism of the capsule with interaction of the lenticular flexibility provides a novel understanding of accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{the context}} of a rapid {{increase}} of dengue cases in the Americas, a monitoring system based on systematic serological control (IgM) of patients consulting for suspected dengue was developed in Bolivia {{at the end of the}} 1990 s. In the most affected city of Santa Cruz, this system was complemented by an entomological surveillance program based on periodical search for immature stages of Aedes aegypti in dwelling water-holding containers. Here, we analyze these data and describe dengue patterns over 6 years (2002 - 2008), highlighting the spatial distribution of patients and vectors. Methodology/Principal Findings Data mining concerned six annual epidemic cycles (2002 - 2008), with continuous serological and clinical results and entomological data from 16 surveys, examined at the scales of 36 urban areas and four <b>concentric</b> areas <b>covering</b> the entire city. Annual incidence varied from 0. 28 % to 0. 95 %; overall incidence was higher in women and adults, and dengue dynamics followed successive periods of high (January-June) and low (July-December) transmission. Lower numbers of cases from the city center to the periphery were observed, poorly related to the more homogeneous and permanent distribution of A. aegypti. "Plant pots" were a major vector source in the city center, and "Tires" and "Odds and ends" beyond the second ring of the city. Conclusions/Significance Over the years, the increasing trend of dengue cases has been highlighted as well as its widespread distribution over the entire city, but an underestimation of the number of cases is strongly suspected. Contrary to popular belief, the city center appears more affected than the periphery, and dengue is not particularly related to waste. Interestingly, the clinical diagnosis of dengue by physicians improved over the years, whatever the gender, age and residential area of suspected cases...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{examination}} of atomic interactions is difficult. One powerful approach to visualizing atomic interactions is to study near-index-matched colloidal dispersions of microscopic plastic spheres, {{which can be}} probed by visible light. Such spheres interact through hydrodynamic and Brownian forces, but they feel no direct force before an infinite repulsion at contact. Through the microgravity flight of the Physics of Hard Spheres Experiment (PHaSE), researchers have sought a more complete understanding of the entropically driven disorder-order transition in hard-sphere colloidal dispersions. The experiment was conceived by Professors Paul M. Chaikin and William B. Russel of Princeton University. Microgravity was required because, on Earth, index-matched colloidal dispersions often cannot be density matched, resulting in significant settling over the crystallization period. This settling makes them a poor model of the equilibrium atomic system, where the effect of gravity is truly negligible. For this purpose, a customized light-scattering instrument was designed, built, and flown by the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field on the space shuttle (shuttle missions STS 83 and STS 94). This instrument performed both static and dynamic light scattering, with sample oscillation for determining rheological properties. Scattered light from a 532 - nm laser was recorded either by a 10 -bit charge-coupled discharge (CCD) camera from a <b>concentric</b> screen <b>covering</b> angles of 0 to 60 or by sensitive avalanche photodiode detectors, which convert the photons into binary data from which two correlators compute autocorrelation functions. The sample cell was driven by a direct-current servomotor to allow sinusoidal oscillation for the measurement of rheological properties. Significant microgravity research findings include the observation of beautiful dendritic crystals, the crystallization of a "glassy phase" sample in microgravity that did not crystallize for over 1 year in 1 g (Earth's gravity), {{and the emergence of}} face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystals late in the coarsening process (as small crystallites lost particles to the slow ripening of large crystallites). Significant quantitative findings from the microgravity experiments have been developed describing complex interactions among crystallites during the growth process, as concentration fields overlap in the surrounding disordered phase. Time-resolved Bragg scattering under microgravity captures one effect of these interactions quite conclusively for the sample at a volume fraction of 0. 528. From the earliest time until the sample is almost fully crystalline, the size and overall crystallinity grow monotonically, but the number of crystallites per unit volume (number density) falls. Apparently nucleation is slower than the loss of crystallites because of the transfer of particles from small to large crystals. Thus, coarsening occurs simultaneously with growth, rather than following the completion of nucleation and growth as is generally assumed. In the same sample, an interesting signature appears in the apparent number density of crystallites and the volume fraction within the crystallites shortly before full crystallinity is reached. A brief upturn in both indicates the creation of more domains {{of the size of the}} average crystallite simultaneous with the compression of the crystallites. Only the emergence of dendritic arms offers a reasonable explanation. The arms would be "seen" by the light scattering as separate domains whose smaller radii of curvature would compress the interior phase. In fiscal year 1999, numerous papers, a doctoral dissertation, and the PHaSE final report were produced. Although this flight project has been completed, plans are in place for a follow-on colloid experiment by Chaikin and Russel that employs a light microscope within Glenn's Fluids and Combustion Facility on the International Space Station. PHaSE is providing us with a deeper understanding of the nure of phase transitions. The knowledge derived has added to the understanding of condensed matter. In addition, the burgeoning study of the dynamics of colloidal self-assembly may lead to the development of a range of photonic materials that control the desirable properties of light. Thus, applications of ordered colloidal structures include not only ultrastructure ceramics, but also photonic crystals and photothermal nanosecond light-switching devices. Industries dealing with semiconductors, electro-optics, ceramics, and composites stand to benefit from such advancements...|$|R
