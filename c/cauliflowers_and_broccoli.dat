In the present work the sensory determinants of likings for vegetables were explored in adolescents of four European countries (Denmark, n =  88; France, n =  206; Italy, n =  110 and United Kingdom, n =  93). A questionnaire was designed to study cross country differences in stated liking for and familiarity with a list of vegetables popular among European markets (between-vegetable approach). A within-vegetable comparison approach with actual tasting was used to analyze differences and similarities in liking for canned pea and sweet corn samples across the countries. A close positive relationship between stated liking and familiarity was found. Irrespective of the country, one group of highly liked vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, green salad) was identified, characterized by innately liked tastes (sweet, umami), delicate flavour and bright appealing colour. A second group of highly disliked vegetables consists of <b>cauliflowers</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> characterized by disliked sensations such as bitter taste and objectionable flavour. Internal Preference Maps from actual liking scores indicate that the generally disliked tastes (bitter, sour), are clearly correlated with a negative hedonic response for both peas and sweet corn. The hedonic valence of a generally well accepted taste such as salty and texture descriptors depends on the type of vegetable. Internal preference maps from actual liking data indicate that flavour and appearance descriptors of the distinct sensory properties of each type of vegetable positively affect liking, while the intensity of unusual flavours is related to sample disliking...|$|E

40|$|In {{coastal regions}} of Mediterranean areas, summer crops are often {{irrigated}} with saline water. As a consequence, salts may accumulate in the root zone, damaging the following winter crops if the rainfall {{is insufficient to}} leach them. In 1994 and 1996 we investigated the effect of residual salts from the previous summer irrigations on plant growth, yield and mineral composition of <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> two non-irrigated winter crops. The salt treatments for the irrigated summer crops were four concentrations of commercial sea salt, corresponding to ECw of 2. 3 (S 1), 4. 4 (S 2), 8. 5 (S 3) and 15. 7 dSm− 1 (S 4), plus a non-salinized control (NSC 0. 5 dSm− 1). An increase of the electrical conductivity of the saturated-soil extract (ECe) from 2. 0 dSm− 1 (NSC) to 6. 0 dSm− 1 (S 4) caused {{a decrease in the}} marketable yield from 26. 9 to 9. 6 t ha− 1 and from 15. 8 to 4. 9 t ha− 1 in <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. A 55 and 57 % salt induced leaf area reduction was observed in <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Leaf dry matter concentration and specific leaf weight were positively correlated with ECe. In contrast, head weight and diameter were negatively correlated with ECe. Based on the Maas and Hoffman bi-linear model we ranked <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> as moderately tolerant crops. The ECe thresholds were 1. 52 and 1. 28 dSm− 1 and the relative yield reductions per unit increase in ECe above the threshold were 14. 4 and 15. 8 % for <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Assessment of the relative yield as a function of soil pH revealed an 80 and 119 % yield reduction per pH unit increase above a 7. 2 and 7. 12 threshold for <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Head concentration of Na, Cl, S and Fe increased with soil ECe whereas N, P and K decreased.

A loss-of-functionmutation in RDR 1, RDR 2 or RDR 6 did not significantly reduce the amount of cRNA synthesis.

The cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae crucivora Boisduval, is a serious pest to Brassicaca species such as cabbage, <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> <b>and</b> its larvae damage the host plant leaves when feeding. In this study, to develop a botanical insecticide against P. rapae larvae, we assessed the effect of 7 kinds of herb (rosemary, spearmint, eucalyptus, sage, chili pepper, chives and tansy) extracts as feeding repellents against P. rapae larvae. Feeding repellent tests were conducted by placing two cabbage leaf disks on filter paper treated with herb extract or diethyl ether in a box; then a larva was placed between the disks and its preference was observed.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the epidemiological data concerning the cancer-preventive effect of brassica vegetables, including cabbage, kale, <b>broccoli,</b> Brussels sprouts, <b>and</b> <b>cauliflower.</b> The protective effect of brassicas against cancer may be due to their relatively high content of glucosinolates. Certain hydrolysis products of glucosinolates have shown anticarcinogenic properties. The results of 7 cohort studies and 87 case control studies on the association between brassica consumption and cancer risk are summarized. The cohort studies showed inverse associations between the consumption of cabbage, <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> risk of lung cancer; between the consumption of brassicas and risk of stomach cancer; between <b>broccoli</b> consumption <b>and</b> risk of all cancers taken together; and between brassica consumption and the occurrence of second primary cancers. Of the case-control studies, 67 % showed an inverse association between consumption of total brassira vegetables and risk of cancer at various sites. For cabbage, <b>broccoli,</b> <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>and</b> Brussels sprouts, these percentages were 70, 56, 67, and 29 %, respectively. Although the measured effects might have been distorted by various types of bias, it is concluded that a high consumption of brassica vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of cancer. This association appears to be most consistent for lung, stomach, colon, and rectal cancer and least consistent for prostatic, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. It is not yet possible to resolve whether associations are to be attributed to brassica vegetables per se or to vegetables in general. Further epidemiological research should separate the anticarcinogenic effect of brassica vegetables from the effect of vegetables in general...|$|R
40|$|Brassicaceae family {{comprises}} {{plant species}} that are very important as vegetable crops, such as the species complex Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa. Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae {{are among the most}} important pathogens of Brassicaceae causing Alternaria leaf spot disease. The occurrence and prevalence of Alternaria species causing leaf spots in brassica crops in Pernambuco was acessed, as well as the existence of a possible preference by vegetable host for these pathogens. Twenty-eight fields were surveyed in the Agreste region of Pernambuco state, in the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons. In each year, 10 Chinese cabbage, six cabbage, six <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> six <b>broccoli</b> fields were visited. In each field, 50 leaves showing at least five lesions were randomly collected. Species identification was performed taking into account morphology of the conidia that was compared with literature data. Among the two Alternaria species found, A. brassicae was found in all Chinese cabbage fields while A. brassicicola was found in all fields of cabbage, <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli.</b> Overall, A. brassicicola was more prevalent than A. brassicae. In Chinese cabbage there was predominance of A. brassicae, with mean prevalence of 91. 0 % and 96. 5 % in 2005 and 2006. On the other hand, in <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cabbage there was high predominance of A. brassicicola, with mean prevalence between 95. 1 % and 99. 8 %. In cauliflower, although the prevalence has been of A. brassicicola, high frequency of A. brassicae was noted. The frequency of co-occurrence of both Alternaria species was very low. The results of this study reinforce the hypothesis of existence of host preference within species of Alternaria that cause leaf spots in brassica crops, especially when Chinese cabbage, <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cabbage are considered.

The 86 QTL may reflect allelic variation in as few as 67 different genetic loci and 54 ancestral genes. Although the locations of QTL affecting a trait occasionally corresponded between different populations or between different homeologous Brassica chromosomes, our data supported other molecular and morphological data in suggesting that the Brassica genus is rapidly evolving. Comparative data enabled us to identify a number of candidate genes from Arabidopsis that warrant further investigation to determine if some of them might account for Brassica QTL.

To determine whether this arrest is maintained by altered expression of the genes that specify these steps in Arabidopsis, the expression of each copy of their homologues (MADS-box genes BoAP 1 -a, BoAP 1 -c, BoCAL, BoFUL-a, BoFUL-b, BoFUL-c, and BoFUL-d; and non-MADS-box genes BoLFY, AP 2, UFO, and BoTFL 1) <b>and</b> the <b>cauliflower</b> curd-specific genes CCE 1 and BoREM 1 were measured simultaneously in heads that were arrested at different developmental stages by varying temperature, but had a common genotype. Transcript abundance of BoFUL paralogues and BoLFY was highest at the cauliflower stage of arrest, consistent with these genes initiating inflorescence meristems. The expression of other genes was the same regardless of the developmental stage of arrest. The expected models can therefore be excluded, wherein maintenance of arrest at the inflorescence meristem {{is a consequence of}} suppression of BoCAL, BoAP 1 -a, or BoLFY, or failure to suppress BoTFL 1.

However, unlike many plant species, N. benthamiana is susceptible to a variety of begomoviruses and can be used to compare them in a common host. In this study, we compare the disease properties of three begomoviruses whose natural hosts include cabbage and cassava, which represent two families – the Brassicaceae and Euphorbiaceae. These studies examine Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), African cassava mosaic virus-Cameroon (ACMV-Cam) and East African cassava mosaic virus-Uganda (EACMV-UG 3).

40|$|Local {{dispersal}} of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella [L. ]) was studied using the mark-recapture technique in commercial <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> crops {{in the northern}} Adelaide plains. Moths were marked with fluorescent powder and released at one or more points within the experimental fields. Recaptures of the marked moths were made with pheromone traps and yellow sticky buckets, the latter being used to study the {{dispersal of}} both males and females. Four indices of dispersal ranges were estimated from the recapture data, the average dispersal distance and the distances from the release point within which 95, 99, and 99. 9 % of the released moths were expected to remain. Separate estimates were obtained for recapture data of males from the pheromone traps, recapture data of males from the yellow sticky buckets, and recapture data of females from the yellow sticky buckets. Overall, the estimated average dispersal distance ranged 14 to 35 m and the 95, 99, and 99. 9 % distances ranged 40 to 106 m, 63 to 177 m, and 113 to 300 m, respectively. Longer dispersal distances {{were obtained from the}} pheromone traps than from the yellow sticky buckets. Data from the yellow sticky buckets revealed similar dispersal ranges of the males and the females. The positions of recapture centers of the two sexes were also largely similar. While the distance ranges of recaptures increased gradually during the experiments, the recapture centers stayed within close vicinity of the release points. Temperature and wind did not appear to influence the dispersal ranges or directions. Implications of the results in the management of diamondback moth are discussed.

40|$|The use of modules for {{propagation}} {{together with}} growing aids such as plastic covers after transplanting has brought forward significantly {{the start of}} the harvest season and improved yield and quality of several important brassicas including swede, <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cabbage. These container grown plants (modules) enables crops to be grown for part of the life cycle under protection in early spring and transplanted outside in March/April when conditions become favourable.

25|$|Vitamin K1 {{is found}} chiefly in leafy green {{vegetables}} such as spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>broccoli,</b> <b>and</b> brussels sprouts) {{and often the}} absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils. Some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the recommended amounts.|$|R
