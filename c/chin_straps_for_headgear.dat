50|$|The American pressed fiber sun helmet {{is known}} for the {{simplicity}} of its design, allowing for easy mass production. An important feature in the original conception of the helmet was to be shaped and contoured from one singular piece. This greatly assisted in making the helmet waterproof. The fiber material kept the helmet light and the soldier unencumbered by headgear. The major drawback in the design was heat. Despite being designed {{with a series of}} ventilation holes, the interior of the helmet would eventually become hot in the sun. The <b>chin</b> <b>straps</b> <b>for</b> the World War II model were made by General Fibre Company and Hawley Products Company, the same fiber liner used in the original M1 helmets. The design of the International Hat and Hawley Product versions of the helmet are almost identical. However, the defining difference in identification is that the Hawley Product model has four folds with a wider space between them in the faux puggaree. A puggaree is a type of Indian turban, namely a thin muslin scarf tied around a sun helmet. The International Hat has five thin folds in its faux puggaree.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States Marine Corps, these caps {{are also}} worn, in two forms. For all ranks, {{the device is}} the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor device. In addition, {{officers}} wear a lace cross on the top, called the quatrefoil, a traditional mark of distinction from the Marine Corps' foundation enabling sharpshooters aboard ships to identify friendly officers from foes. For blue dress uniforms, the cap is white with a gold device for enlisted, while the gold and silver device is for officers. Only the visor is black, and the <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> is black <b>for</b> enlisted Marines; it is gold and scarlet for officers. For the service uniforms, an olive drab combination cap is available; the device is black, and the <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> is black <b>for</b> all ranks. In both cases, field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels and colonels) have gold oak leaf motifs on the visor, similar to those worn by navy commanders and captains, while general officers' caps have a different, larger oak leaf motif on the visor. Additionally the blue dress cap of the Commandant of the Marine Corps (as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff if {{it is also a}} Marine) adds an additional gold oak leaf motif {{to the front of the}} band. In the Marine Corps, the combination cap is referred to as the [...] "barracks cover." [...] Also referred as the dress cap or service cap in Marine Corps Orders.|$|R

50|$|For Other Ranks, the SD uniform {{originally}} comprised khaki wool (serge) trousers, a khaki wool tunic, with stand-and-fall (or Prussian) collar, four pockets on the front, each buttoned {{closed by}} a flap {{with a straight}} (horizontal) edge, large, serge reinforcement patches over each shoulder, shoulder straps {{and a pair of}} brass wire hangers on the back, over the kidneys, to support the belt. The front of the jacket was closed by five buttons, usually of a regimental pattern, arranged vertically. A peaked cap was provided, covered in the same khaki serge (including the stiff peak), with a leather <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> (brown, <b>for</b> most regiments) held at either side by brass or horn buttons. This uniform was worn with ankle Ammunition boots; in the field, Puttees would be wound up (or down) the length of the shins, covering the top of the boots. The carrying equipment worn by infantry with this uniform was normally the 1908 Pattern Webbing, made of fabric and also khaki (though a lighter shade than the uniform). Cavalry and gunners of the Royal Regiment of Artillery did not wear webbing equipment, but instead used the leather 1903_Bandolier Equipment, worn over one shoulder. Originally derived from the bandoliers carried by the Boer commandos during the Second Boer War, it had been found to be unsuitable for infantry use but remained in service with mounted troops.|$|R
