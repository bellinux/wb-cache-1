40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a membrane-bound MalE β-galactosidase hybrid protein, when induced by growth of Escherichia coli on maltose, leads to inhibition of cell division and eventually a <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of mass increase. In addition, the relative rate of {{synthesis of}} outer membrane proteins, {{but not that}} of inner membrane proteins, was reduced by about 50 %. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that this reduction coincided with the period of maximum synthesis of the hybrid protein (and another maltose-inducible protein, LamB). The accumulation of this abnormal protein in the envelope therefore appeared specifically to inhibit the synthesis, the assembly of outer membrane proteins, or both, indicating that the hybrid protein blocks some export site or causes the sequestration of some limiting factor(s) involved in the export process. Since the MalE protein is normally located in the periplasm, the results also suggest that the synthesis of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins may involve some steps in <b>common.</b> The <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of synthesis of outer membrane proteins was also accompanied by the accumulation in the envelope {{of at least one}} outer membrane protein and at least two inner membrane proteins as higher-molecular-weight forms, indicating that processing (removal of the N-terminal signal sequence) was also disrupted by the presence of the hybrid protein. These results may indicate that the assembly of these membrane proteins is blocked at a relatively late step rather than at the level of primary recognition of some site by the signal sequence. In addition, the results suggest that some step common to the biogenesis of quite different kinds of envelope protein is blocked by the presence of the hybrid protein...|$|R
40|$|Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common hematologic malignancies worldwide. The incidence of NHL has been rising for several decades; however, in the last 20 years, it reached a plateau. NHL incidence among males is significantly higher than in females. In addition to gender itself, gravidity has a protective role against NHL occurrence. Gender also matters in terms of NHL clinical characteristics. For example, female predominance was found in three extra-nodal sites (the breast, thyroid, and the respiratory system) occasionally involved in NHL. The diagnosis of NHL during pregnancy is associated with a unique clinical behavior. It is usually diagnosed in the second or third trimester and in advanced stage. Furthermore, the histological subtype is highly aggressive, and reproductive organ involvement is <b>common.</b> The <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of NHL among females may be explained by direct effects of estrogens on lymphoma cell proliferation or by its effect on anti-tumor immune response. Gender has an important role in responsiveness to standard B cell NHL treatment. Among older adults, women benefited more from the addition of the anti-CD 20 antibody rituximab to standard chemotherapy regimens. This phenomenon can be explained by the difference in clearance rate of rituximab that was found to be significantly lower among older females than older males. In mantle cell lymphoma, women receiving lenalidomide have higher rates of response. An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for gender-associated NHL differences will ultimately improve the clinical approach, allowing for a more accurate assessment of prognosis and patient-tailored treatment...|$|R

Herbicides (at recommended rates) including fluroxypyr+MCPA at 450 g a. i. ha- 1, carfentrazone-ethyl at 20 g a. i. ha- 1, bromoxynil+MCPA at 450 g a. i. ha- 1, thifensulfuron-methyl at 75 g a. i. ha- 1 and tribenuronmethyl at 75 g a. i. ha- 1 alone and tank mixed at <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> with adjuvants, namely, alkyl ether sulphate sodium salt at 625 mL ha- 1 or fatty alcohol ethoxylate at 375 mL ha- 1.

40|$|The {{value-added}} tax makes a significant {{part of our}} tax system and is a key revenue of the state budget. The VAT is paid to state since January 1, 1993, when it replaced the sales tax. The taxpayer is anyone who buys certain product or service. Since 2015 the basic rate of VAT is 21 %, the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> is 15 %. A novelty in 2015 in the Czech republic has become a reduction of the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> to 10 % for some products, for example baby food, medicaments, books and more. As the payer and the taxpayer of VAT {{are not the same}} subjects, we classify this tax together with excise duties among indirect taxes. The other part of our tax system form direct taxes, which are devided into income and property taxes. The statistical calculations show that an increase of the basic <b>rate</b> of VAT <b>reduces</b> state budget revenues, therefore there is an inverse relationship. Conversely, an increase of the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of VAT will increase state budget revenues, since the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> applies to goods necessary for survival...|$|R
