5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
25|$|The non-template (sense) {{strand of}} DNA {{is called the}} <b>coding</b> <b>strand,</b> because its {{sequence}} {{is the same as}} the newly created RNA transcript (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine).

30|$|The {{issues with}} the need to store a large number of words becomes even more {{problematic}} when the size of the alphabet increases. This is clearly the case when we consider compiled code or source <b>code.</b> <b>Strand</b> addresses this problem by utilizing a form of lossy compression called Minhashing [23] which still supports sequence comparison, but with a much reduced memory footprint.|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} use of a new {{statistical}} segmentation method on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome sequence. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation of a hidden Markov model, based on the expectation-maximization algorithm, enables one to segment the DNA sequence according to its local composition. This approach is not based on sliding windows; it enables different compositional classes to be separated without prior knowledge of their content, size and localization. We compared these compositional classes, obtained from the sequence, with the annotated DNA physical map, sequence homologies and repeat regions. The first heterogeneity revealed discriminates between the two <b>coding</b> <b>strands</b> and the non-coding regions. Other main heterogeneities arise; some are related to horizontal gene transfer, some to t-enriched composition of hydrophobic protein <b>coding</b> <b>strands,</b> and others to the codon usage fitness of highly expressed genes. Concerning potential and established gene transfers, we found 9 of the 10 known prophages, plus 14 new regions of atypical composition. Some of them are surrounded by repeats, most of their genes have unknown function or possess homology to genes involved in secondary catabolism, metal and antibiotic resistance. Surprisingly, we notice that all of these detected regions are a + t-richer than the host genome, raising the question of their remote sources...|$|R

While memory consumption increased slightly, there was no large degradation in training or classification performance.|$|R
25|$|An {{antisense}} oligonucleotide drug, oblimersen (G3139), {{was developed by}} Genta Incorporated to target Bcl-2. An antisense DNA or RNA strand is non-coding and complementary to the <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> (which is the template for producing respectively RNA or protein). An antisense drug is a short sequence of RNA that hybridises with and inactivates mRNA, preventing the protein from being formed.|$|E
2500|$|One {{strand of}} the DNA, the {{template}} strand (or noncoding strand), {{is used as}} a template for RNA synthesis. [...] As transcription proceeds, RNA polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the DNA template to create an RNA copy. [...] Although RNA polymerase traverses the template strand from 3' → 5', the coding (non-template) strand and newly formed RNA can also be used as reference points, so transcription can be described as occurring 5' → 3'. [...] This produces an RNA molecule from 5' → 3', an exact copy of the <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> (except that thymines are replaced with uracils, and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose (5-carbon) sugar where DNA has deoxyribose (one fewer oxygen atom) in its sugar-phosphate backbone).|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of the RNA copy of the DNA is called transcription, and is performed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase, which adds one RNA nucleotide {{at a time to}} a growing RNA strand as per the complementarity law of the bases. This RNA is complementary to the template 3' → 5' DNA strand, which is itself complementary to the coding 5' → 3' DNA strand. Therefore, the resulting 5' → 3' RNA strand is identical to the <b>coding</b> DNA <b>strand</b> with the exception that thymines (T) are replaced with uracils (U) in the RNA. A <b>coding</b> DNA <b>strand</b> reading [...] "ATG" [...] is indirectly transcribed through the non-coding strand as [...] "AUG" [...] in RNA.|$|R
50|$|Age related macular {{degeneration}} is a prominent cause of blindness in developed countries. Dicer's {{role in this}} disease became apparent after {{it was discovered that}} affected patients showed decreased levels of Dicer in their retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mice with Dicer knocked out, lacking Dicer only in their RPE, exhibited similar symptoms. However, other mice lacking important RNAi pathway proteins like Drosha and Pasha, did not have symptoms of {{macular degeneration}} as Dicer-knockout mice. This observation suggested a Dicer specific role in retinal health that was independent of the RNAi pathway and thus not a function of si/miRNA generation. A form of RNA called Alu RNA (the RNA transcripts of alu elements)) was found to be elevated in patients with insufficient Dicer levels. These non <b>coding</b> <b>strands</b> of RNA can loop forming dsRNA structures that would be degraded by Dicer in a healthy retina. However, with insufficient Dicer levels, the accumulation of alu RNA leads to the degeneration of RPE as a result of inflammation.|$|R
40|$|Transcription in Archaea is {{initiated}} by association of a TATA box binding protein (TBP) with a TATA box. This interaction is stabilized by the binding of the transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) orthologue TFB. We show {{here that the}} RNA polymerase of the archaeon Methanococcus, in contrast to polymerase II, does not require hydrolysis of the β-γ bond of ATP for initiation of transcription and open complex formation on linearized DNA. Permanganate probing revealed that the archaeal open complex spanned at least the DNA region from − 11 to − 1 at a tRNAVal promoter. The Methanococcus TBP-TFB promoter complex protected the DNA region from − 40 to − 14 on the noncoding DNA strand and the DNA segment from − 36 to − 17 on the <b>coding</b> DNA <b>strand</b> from DNase I digestion. This DNase I footprint was extended only to the downstream end {{by the addition of}} the RNA polymerase to position + 17 on the noncoding strand and to position + 13 on the <b>coding</b> DNA <b>strand...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{transcription}} bubble is {{a molecular}} structure that occurs during the transcription of DNA when a limited {{portion of the}} DNA double strand is unwound and is about 11bp of DNA. [...] RNA polymerase may then bind to the exposed DNA and begin synthesizing a new strand of RNA. As RNA polymerase progresses down the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction (the DNA <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> in the 5' to 3' direction), more of the double stranded DNA is unwound downstream of the polymerase (towards the 5' end of the template strand or 3' end of the <b>coding</b> <b>strand)</b> while DNA upstream of the polymerase (towards the 3' end of the template strand or 5' end of the <b>coding</b> <b>strand)</b> re-anneals. Moving of the transcription bubble in the process may be seen with specialized staining techniques, spectroscopy or microscopy.|$|E

40|$|The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is a {{well-known}} eukaryotic surveillance mechanism that eliminates aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon (PTC). The UP-Frameshift (UPF) proteins, UPF 1, UPF 2, and UPF 3, are essential for normal NMD function. Several NMD substrates have been identified, but detailed information on NMD substrates is lacking. Here, we noticed that, in Arabidopsis, most of the mRNA-like nonprotein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have the features of an NMD substrate. We examined the expression profiles of 2 Arabidopsis mutants, upf 1 - 1 and upf 3 - 1, using a whole-genome tiling array. The results showed that expression of not only protein-coding transcripts but also many mRNA-like ncRNAs (mlncRNAs), including natural antisense transcript RNAs (nat-RNAs) transcribed from the opposite <b>strands</b> of the <b>coding</b> <b>strands,</b> were up-regulated in both mutants. The percentage of the up-regulated mlncRNAs to all expressed mlncRNAs was much {{higher than that of}} the up-regulated protein-coding transcripts to all expressed protein- coding transcripts.

40|$|The {{complete}} genome of the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae {{was analyzed}} {{for the presence}} of polypurine/polypyrimidine (poly[pu/py]) repeats and their occurrences were classified {{on the basis of their}} location within and outside open reading frames (ORFs). The analysis reveals that such sequence motifs are present abundantly both in coding as well as noncoding regions. Clear positional preferences are seen when these tracts occur in noncoding regions. These motifs appear to occur predominantly at a unit nucleosomal length both upstream and downstream of ORFs. Moreover, there is a biased distribution of polypurines in the <b>coding</b> <b>strands</b> when these motifs occur within open reading frames. The significance of the biased distribution is discussed with reference to the occurrence of these motifs in other known mRNA sequences and expressed sequence tags. A model for cis regulation of gene expression is proposed based on the ability of these motifs to form an intermolecular triple helix structure when present within the coding region and/or to modulate nucleosome positioning via enhanced histone affinity when present outside coding regions...|$|R
25|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are therefore anti-parallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases).

40|$|The bisegmented genome of a {{double-stranded}} (ds) RNA {{virus from}} the fungus Rhizoctonia solani isolate Rhs 717 was characterized. The larger segment, dsRNA 1, is 2363 bases long whereas the smaller segment, dsRNA 2, has 2206 bases. The 5 « {{ends of the}} <b>coding</b> <b>strands</b> of dsRNA 1 and dsRNA 2 are highly conserved (100 % identity over 47 bases), and contain inverted repeats capable of forming stable stem–loop structures. Analysis of the coding potential {{of each of the}} two segments showed that dsRNAs 1 and 2 could code for polypeptides of 730 aa (bases 86 – 2275; molecular mass 86 kDa) and 683 aa (bases 79 – 2130; molecular mass 76 kDa), respectively. The 86 kDa polypeptide has all the motifs of dsRNA RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRP), and has significant homology with putative RDRPs of partitiviruses from Fusarium poae and Atkinsonella hypoxylon. The 76 kDa protein shows homology with the putative capsid proteins (CP) of the same viruses.

40|$|International audienceThe protozoans Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (Tritryps), are {{evolutionarily}} ancient eukaryotes {{which cause}} worldwide human parasitosis. They present unique biological features. Indeed, canonical DNA/RNA cis-acting elements remain mostly elusive. Repetitive sequences, originally considered as selfish DNA, have been lately recognized as potentially important functional sequence elements in cell biology. In particular, the dinucleotide patterns have {{been related to}} genome compartmentalization, gene evolution and gene expression regulation. Thus, we perform a comparative analysis of the occurrence, length and location of dinucleotide repeats (DRs) in the Tritryp genomes and their putative associations with known biological processes. We observe that most types of DRs are more abundant than would be expected by chance. Complementary DRs usually display asymmetrical strand distribution, favoring TT and GT repeats in the <b>coding</b> <b>strands.</b> In addition, we find that GT repeats are among the longest DRs in the three genomes. We also show that specific DRs are non-uniformly distributed along the polycistronic unit, decreasing toward its boundaries. Distinctive non-uniform density patterns were {{also found in the}} intergenic regions, with predominance at the vicinity of the ORFs. These findings further support that DRs may control genome structure and gene expression...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA {{encoding}} a novel {{member of}} the thyroid/steroid hormone receptor superfamily, called Rev-ErbA alpha, has been isolated from a rat GH 3 cell library. Rev-ErbA alpha is an approximately 56 -kilodalton protein most similar in structure to the thyroid hormone receptor (c-erbA) and the retinoic acid receptor, {{but it does not}} bind either thyroid hormone or retinoic acid. The mRNA encoding Rev-ErbA alpha is present in many tissues and is particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and brown fat. A genomic DNA fragment containing the entire Rev-ErbA alpha cDNA sequence was isolated and characterized. Remarkably, this DNA fragment also contained a portion of the c-erbA alpha gene. r-erbA alpha- 1 and r-erbA alpha- 2 are alternative splice products of the c-erbA alpha gene and are members of the receptor superfamily. The genes encoding Rev-ErbA alpha and r-erbA alpha- 2 overlap, with their <b>coding</b> <b>strands</b> oriented opposite one another. A 269 -base-pair segment of the bidirectionally transcribed region is exonic in both the Rev-ErbA alpha and r-erbA alpha- 2 genes, resulting in complementary mRNAs. Thus, through alternative splicing and opposite-strand transcription, a single genomic locus codes for three different members of the thyroid/steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Potential implications of this unusual genomic arrangement are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{first one}} {{describes}} a bias and an asymmetric mutational pressure on each DNA strand during replication and transcription. Due to the asymmetric {{nature of the}} replication process, an unequal mutational frequency and DNA repair efficiency during the replication process can introduce more mutations in one strand {{as compared to the}} other. Furthermore, the time used for replication between the two strands varies and may lead to asymmetric mutational pressure between leading and lagging strand. In addition to mutations during DNA replication, transcriptional mutations can create strand specific nucleotide composition skew. Deamination of cytosine and ultimately mutation of cytosine to thymine in one DNA strand can increase the relative number of guanine and thymine to cytosine and adenine. In most bacteria majority of the genes are encoded in the leading strand. For instance, the leading strand in Bacillus subtilis encodes 75% of the genes. In addition an excess of deamination and conversion of cytosine to thymine in the <b>coding</b> <b>strand</b> compared to the non-coding strand has been reported. One possible explanation is that the non-transcribed strand (<b>coding</b> <b>strand)</b> is single stranded during the transcription process; therefore, it is more vulnerable to deamination compared to the transcribed strand (non-coding strand). Another explanation is that the deamination repair activity during transcription does not occur on the <b>coding</b> <b>strand.</b> Only the transcribed strand benefits from these deamination repair events.|$|E
