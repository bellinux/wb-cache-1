5000|$|Cotation Assistée en <b>Continu</b> (CAC) was <b>an</b> {{electronic}} trading system {{used at the}} Paris Bourse, the French stock exchange, in the 1980s and 1990s.

The acronym {{is also used to}} refer to the CAC 40, a stock index provided by the Paris Bourse. Curiously, the acronym also fits the name of the early Parisian stockbrokers' association, the [...] "Compagnie des Agents de Change". The CAC system was a version of an earlier system developed by the Toronto Stock Exchange in the mid-1970s: CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System). In the early 1990s the Paris Bourse developed an upgraded technology known as NSC (Nouveau Système de Cotation), which served as a technological platform for the Euronext initiative. The Paris Bourse became Euronext Paris in 2000.|$|R

Several parsing algorithms have been proposed for this formalism, most of them based on tabular techniques, ranging from simple bottom-up algorithms (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) to sophisticated extensions of the Earley's algorithm (Schabes and Joshi, 1988; Schabes, 1994; Nederhof, 1997). However, it is difficult to inter-relate different parsing algorithms. In this paper we study several tabular algorithms for TAG parsing, showing their common characteristics and how one algorithm can be derived from another in turn, creating <b>a</b> <b>continu</b> [...] ...|$|R

There are many ways other than periodic sampling for obtaining such a sequence. The requirements for such representations and some ex-amples are discussed within the framework of simulating linear time-invariant systems. The representation of digital sequences by other digital sequences is also discussed, with particular emphasis on the use of such representations to implement a nonlinear warping of the digital frequency axis. Some applications and hardware imple-mentation of this digital-frequency warping are described. I.

40|$|In {{this paper}} jump {{transitions}} for the fluid model part in second order fluid stochastic Petri nets (FSPNs) are introduced. The extended formalism is defined, {{and the underlying}} partial differential equations are derived. With a jump {{a certain amount of}} fluid is added to a fluid place or taken out at once. This amount, the jump height, is sampled from a probability distribution. The dynamics of a model are described by second order partial differential equations that include integrals. As examples the virtual waiting time (or unfinished work) in a queueing system and a performability model of a multi-processor system are modelled. 1. Introduction Stochastic Petri nets are a modelling formalism that is well suited for performance and reliability evaluation of complex computer and communication systems.

Results concerning stability {{and performance of}} the resulting hybrid system are derived. One of the main advantages {{of this type of}} controller is that the stability analysis can be made using fairly straightforward arguments. The methodology used is generalizable to a larger class of control problems related to nonholonomic systems. Keywords.

Metformin mildly inhibits complex I of the electron transport system and may impact aerobic capacity in people exercising while tak ing metformin. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of metformin on maximal aerobic capacity in healthy individuals without mitochondrial dysfunction. Seventeen healthy, normal-weight men (n = 11) and women (n = 6) partici pated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Peak aerobic capacity was measured twice using <b>a</b> <b>continu</b> ous, incrementally graded protocol; once after 7 – 9 d of metformin (final dose = 2000 mg/d) and once with placebo, with 1 week between tests. The order of the conditions was counterbalanced. Peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and test duration were compared across conditions using paired t tests with the R statistical program. VO 2 peak (– 2. 7 %), peak heart rate (– 2. 0 %), peak ven tilation (– 6. 2 %), peak RER (– 3. 0 %), and exercise duration (– 4. 1 %) were all reduced slightly, but significantly, with metformin (all p < 0. 05). There was no effect of metformin on RPE or ventilatory breakpoint. Correlations between the decrement in VO 2 peak and any of the other outcome variables were weak (r 2 < 0. 20) and not significant. Short-term treatment with metformin has statistically significant, but physiologically subtle, effects that reduce key outcomes related to maximal exercise capacity. Whether this small but consistent effect is manifested in people with insulin re sistance or diabetes who already have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be determined.
