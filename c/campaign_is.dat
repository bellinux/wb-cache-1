5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal <b>Campaign,</b> <b>is</b> widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E

Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.|$|E
5|$|Outside Taiwan, POJ {{is rarely}} used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak Mandarin <b>Campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{underway}} to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties {{in favour of}} switching to Mandarin instead.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign of William Wallace {{acts as a}} {{tutorial}} campaign, {{much like}} the original Age of Empires game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this <b>Campaign</b> <b>is</b> presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.|$|E
50|$|The Star Wraith <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{normally}} randomly {{generated by}} default.

5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there is a contradiction.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, after Daniel Ortega {{began his}} second term as President of Nicaragua, under the Carlos Fonseca Amador Popular Education Association, a new {{literacy}} <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> announced and later launched in March 2007. The new literacy <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> based on the [...] "Yo, sí puedo" [...] (Yes, I can) Cuban method. Estimates say over 350,000-500,000 Nicaraguans would be taught to read and write. The literacy <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> coordinated by Orlando Pineda and received finance and support from Cuba, Spain and Venezuela. The goal of the literacy <b>campaigns</b> <b>is</b> to declare Nicaragua free of illiteracy by 2009.|$|R
40|$|The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) {{provides}} the organizational framework for sponsoring periodic international measurement campaigns {{of the space}} debris environment. The IADC has conducted two types of campaigns: high altitude campaigns designed to measure the debris environment at near-geostationary altitudes using mostly optical telescopes, and low altitude campaigns using primarily radars. One {{of the goals of}} the low altitude <b>campaigns</b> <b>is</b> to collect data for 24 contiguous hours. This way, all orbit planes can be sampled. Multiple sensors are used, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, to provide a more complete understanding of the environment. Comparing results between sensors also provides {{a better understanding of the}} potential biases resulting from any one sensor. Conducting the campaigns at roughly regular intervals over a long period also allows researchers to examine trends and growth of the environment over time. For this reason, low altitude <b>campaigns</b> <b>are</b> anticipated at two-year intervals. This is the eighth IADC low altitude campaign conducted. The first <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> conducted in 1996 and two <b>campaigns</b> <b>were</b> conducted in 1999. The 2002 <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> delayed until January 2003 because of scheduling conflicts, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh <b>campaigns</b> <b>were</b> conducted in 2004, 2008, and 2013 respectively. The eighth <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> conducted on 8 December 2015...|$|R

5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|Age of Mythology shared many {{elements}} of gameplay {{with the main}} series, and was considered {{a part of the}} series, despite its different focus. The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with Poseidon. Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002, and its expansion, The Titans, on October 21, 2003. The Titans featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization. Its <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the titans and frees them from Tartarus. Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. The Titans failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> very successful, but {{was also}} criticised. In fact no {{rainforest}} was acquired by WWF or Krombacher. Rather, existing nature reserve were supported. Accordingly, a German court decided the <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> partly anticompetitive.|$|R

5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal <b>Campaign</b> <b>is</b> also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, {{the invasion of}} Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival {{in the spring of}} 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> poorly documented, but {{the western part of the}} region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
50|$|The Positive Action <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{a series}} of {{political}} protests and strikes in pre-independence Ghana; a political activism <b>campaign.</b> The <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> launched by Kwame Nkrumah before his election by popular vote as the ruler of Gold Coast and then Prime Minister of Ghana after the independence. The Positive Action <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> launched to fight imperialism through nonviolence and education of the people. However, when Nkrumah launched the campaign, riots erupted throughout the capital, Accra.|$|R

5|$|Even {{though this}} <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> overshadowed by other {{battles of the}} revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been {{defeated}} this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned any ideas of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.|$|E
5|$|Following Suleiman's {{unsuccessful}} Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand {{launched a}} counter-attack in 1530 {{to regain the}} initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. This <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> usually considered as {{the start of the}} Little War, the period of a series conflicts between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. An assault of Buda was driven off by John Zápolya, the vassal King of Hungary, but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere, capturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.|$|E
