25|$|Following {{from this}} kind of thought Munch thus {{considered}} a territorial defence of Denmark impossible, and illusions about this downright dangerous. All Denmark <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> would be to maintain {{good relations with the}} great powers, Germany first and foremost among them, and to avoid confrontation at all cost. These ideas stayed with him throughout his political career, and he would manage to stamp them quite firmly on Danish Foreign Policy.|$|E
25|$|The Carranza {{government}} was recognized de jure by the United States on 31 August 1917 {{as a direct}} consequence of the Zimmermann telegram, since recognition was necessary to ensure Mexican neutrality in World War I. After the military invasion of Veracruz in 1914, Mexico would not participate in any military excursions with the United States in World War I, thus ensuring Mexican neutrality was the best outcome that the United States <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for,</b> even if Mexican neutrality would allow German companies to keep their operations in Mexico open.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} sixth test at the Oval, all England <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> was to salvage some {{pride in the}} form of at least a solitary test win. However the hosts had looked {{unlikely}} to challenge the tourists for all but a few sessions during the whole series. England made two more changes, the introduction of debutants Alan Igglesden and John Stephenson, but the picks seemed more likely to have come from the chance to expose them to the top level rather than hope that they might prove competitive against a clearly superior Australian side. Australia remained unchanged since the second test.|$|E

25|$|Within the dharmashastric {{tradition}} espousing sati as a justified, {{and even}} recommended, option to ascetic widowhood, there remained a curious conception worth noting the achieved status {{for a woman}} committing sati. Burning herself on the pyre would give her, and her husband, automatic, but not eternal, reception into heaven (svarga), whereas only the wholly chaste widow living out her natural life span <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> final liberation (moksha) and breaking the cycle of rebirth. Thus, acknowledging that performing sati only achieved an inferior otherworldy status than successful widowhood could achieve, sati became recommended when coupled with a dismissal of the effective possibility for a widow to remain truly chaste.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt {{is an element of}} faith and {{that it is impossible to}} gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, Botswana {{were given}} hosting rights {{again for the}} ICC World Cricket League Division 7 in their second attempt {{in trying to get}} {{promoted}} out of Division 7 after halting the relegation slide in the last edition. Beating Ghana in the first match, Botswana lost their second match in a competitive encounter against Vanuatu by 23 runs. Botswana then lost third next match heavily to eventual WCL Div 7 winners and arch rivals Nigeria. Botswana tried in vain to get back into contention for promotion but after a tied match against Germany, all hopes were dashed and the best they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> was a third-place finish. This was achieved by beating Fiji in the last group match and then beating them again in the third-place playoff earning Botswana a third place, finishing behind Vanuatu and Nigeria who were both promoted to Division 6 of the WCL. With the ICC's decision to eliminate the ICC World Cricket League Divisions 7 and 8, Botswana will now have to qualify through regional tournaments to make it into the ICC World Cricket League Division 6, which will now be the entry point for the World Cricket League.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Perfect Dark Zero was divided but generally positive, garnering a Metacritic aggregated review score of 81 out of 100 respectively. Writing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin felt that Perfect Dark Zero [...] "champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, {{as well as}} its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action." [...] He concluded that the game [...] "delivers just about everything you <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> from a first-person shooter." [...] Charles Onyett of IGN praised the game's replay value, but also criticised single-player aspects such as the weak artificial intelligence of enemies, commenting that [...] "they never display any advanced assault tactics." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, like Mark Kinkead-Weekes and Margaret Doody, {{like the}} novel and emphasise the {{importance}} of the moral themes that Richardson takes up. In a 1987 article, Kinkead-Weekes admits that the [...] "novel fails at the [...] crisis" [...] and [...] "it must be doubtful whether it <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> much life in the concluding volumes". However, those like Jean Hagstrum believe that [...] "Richardson's last novel is considerably better than can be easily imagined by those who have only heard about it. But admittedly it represents a falling off after Clarissa". Morris Golden simply claims that the novel is a book for old men.|$|E
500|$|... "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] {{received}} highly positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators praising the repairing of Ron and Tammy, Nick Offerman's performance and, in particular, {{the line in}} which Ron explains how part of his mustache became shaved off: [...] "It rubbed off... from friction." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she feared Megan Mullally could {{not live up to}} her performance in [...] "Ron and Tammy", but she said the follow-up episode [...] "gave Parks and Rec fans everything they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> and more". Busis also praised the pairing of the enthusiastic Chris and the apathetic April. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix enjoyed that the script did not simply rehash the original [...] "Ron and Tammy" [...] story, but instead played it well off the Tom, Wendy and Ron love triangle. Sepinwall also praised the Chris/April pairing and the fact that Adam Scott got to do more than play his usual straight man role. He added that he hoped each season would have a Ron and Tammy-centric episode, but limit it to once a year in the style of Cheers Bar Wars episodes.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{opted not}} to hire A-list celebrities to voice the film's main characters. Afterwards, the {{directors}} continued to audition hundreds of young actresses {{in the hopes of}} finding Rapunzel's voice, among them Broadway performer Idina Menzel, but none sounded quite right until they finally discovered singer and actress Mandy Moore. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney character as [...] "the ultimate fantasy", Moore was a long-time fan of Disney films. Initially, knowledge that the role was being heavily sought after at the time deterred her from auditioning in favor of avoiding disappointment. Once she made up her mind to audition, Moore [...] "chased after" [...] the role, auditioning for it twice. Because the film is a musical requiring its cast to provide both their characters' speaking and singing voices, all candidates were asked to perform one song of their choice in the style of a singer-songwriter; Moore, a professional singer herself, auditioned with Joni Mitchell's [...] "Help Me". Child actress Delaney Rose Stein was eventually cast as a young version Rapunzel. According to co-director Byron Howard, Moore [...] "has this great soul to her voice" [...] as well as [...] "this down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that makes her everything you <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> in a Disney heroine." ...|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E

[...] Gore's attorneys therefore {{understood that they}} could fight on, and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law.

2500|$|In 1950, {{living with}} his mother and sisters on Vlad Județul Street, Bucharest, Buzdugan began writing to the {{literary}} critic Perpessicius. The latter arranged for Buzdugan to heal a fractured right arm with help from the poet-doctor Virgiliu Moscovici-Monda. The next year, commissioned by Perpessicius to translate Eugene Onegin, he also announced that he was working on his own epic poem, retelling the death of Miron Costin—the latter, if it exists, was never published. In April 1953, he wrote again to announce his [...] "hurried departure" [...] to Bazna, Transylvania, where his sister ran a summer camp. According to some sources, Buzdugan was in fact escaping renewed threats of arrest: for a while, he was in Blaj, protected by the Greek-Catholic Church; when the latter was dissolved, he hid in private homes. With the onset of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union, Romanian literati <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> a more tolerant regime. In this climate, Buzdugan began frequenting a literary circle in the Bucharest home of Ion Larian and Paraschiva Postolache, where he met young writers such as Eugen Barbu and C. D. Zeletin. Other senior guests included Virgil Carianopol, N. Crevedia, and Radu D. Rosetti.|$|E
2500|$|Dentistry was an {{important}} field, as an independent profession it dated from the early 3rd millennium BC, although it may never have been prominent. The Egyptian diet was high in abrasives from sand left over from grinding grain and bits of rocks in which the way bread was prepared, and so the condition of their teeth was poor. Archaeologists have noted a steady decrease in severity and incidence of worn teeth throughout 4000 BC to 1000 AD, probably due to improved grain grinding techniques. [...] All Egyptian remains have sets of teeth in quite poor states. Dental disease could even be fatal, such as for Djedmaatesankh, a musician from Thebes, who died around the age of thirty five from extensive dental disease and a large infected cyst. If an individual's teeth escaped being worn down, cavities were rare, due to the rarity of sweeteners. Dental treatment was ineffective and the best sufferers <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> was the quick loss of an infected tooth. The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq contains the maxim [...] "There is no tooth that rots yet stays in place". No records document the hastening of this process and no tools suited for the extraction of teeth have been found, though some remains show sign of forced tooth removal. [...] Replacement teeth have been found, {{although it is not}} clear whether they are just post-mortem cosmetics. Extreme pain might have been medicated with opium.|$|E
