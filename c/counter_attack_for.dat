On {{the morning}} of 1 September 1914 the German 4th Cavalry Division {{attacked}} 1st Cavalry Brigade and L Battery, who had been camped {{in the village of}} Néry. In the action that followed, L Battery, less for one gun, was all but destroyed. The 13-pounder gun manned by Captain Bradbury, WO2 Dorrell, Sergeant Nelson, and Gunners Osbourne and Darbyshire, managed to keep the single gun in action against the three German Batteries located a thousand yards away. The Artillery fire put down by this gun allowed the 1st Cavalry Brigade to deliver a successful <b>Counter</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>For</b> this action Captain Bradbury, WO2 Dorrell, Sergeant Nelson, were all awarded the Victoria Cross ...|$|E

In {{his bid to}} retake Masaka and stabilise the frontline, before launching an offensive to drive the Tanzanian's backwards into their own country, the area between Buganga and Lukaya was declared a concentration and assembly point for his forces, {{so that they could}} regroup and gather their strength before <b>counter</b> <b>attacking.</b> Unfortunately <b>for</b> the Ugandan Army, this location was easily in range of Tanzanian artillery. TPDF deployed a brigade of infantry in reserve to defend the town, and had the other TPDF brigades taking position at different points in the surrounding countryside to prepare <b>for</b> an <b>attack</b> that could be launched from multiple directions.|$|R
40|$|VoIP {{services}} {{are becoming increasingly}} a big competition to existing telephony services (POTS / ISDN). The increas-ing number of customers using VoIP makes VoIP services a valuable target for attackers that want {{to bring down the}} service, take it over or simply abuse it to distribute their own content, like SPAM. Hence, the need arises to protect VoIP services from all kinds of attacks that target network band-width, server capacity or server architectural constrains. In this article we present VoIP Defender, a generic security architecture, called VoIP-Defender, to monitor, detect, an-alyze and <b>counter</b> <b>attacks</b> relevant <b>for</b> a SIP-based VoIP in-frastructure. The VoIP-Defender is highly scalable and can be easily extended with new detection algorithms. Analy-sis and traffic control can be performed from the SIP layer down to the transport-, network- and MAC layer. VoIP De-fender is designed to work fully transparent to clients and SIP servers, and can analyze and filter traffic in real time, which we demonstrate with measurements with our imple-mentation. 1...|$|R

60|$|Now {{the grades}} of warfare {{that have been}} {{developed}} since the present war began, may be regarded as a series of elaborations and counter elaborations of the problem which begins as a line of trenches behind wire, containing infantry with rifles and machine guns. Against this an infantry attack with bayonet, after shrapnel fails. This we will call Grade A. To this the offensive replies with improved artillery, and particularly with high explosive shell instead of shrapnel. By this the wire is blown away, the trench wrecked and the defender held down as the attack charges up. This is Grade B. But now appear the dug-out elaborating the trench and the defensive battery behind the trench. The defenders, under the preliminary bombardment, get into the dug-outs with their rifles and machine guns, and emerge as fresh as paint as the attack comes up. Obviously there is much scope for invention and contrivance in the dug-out as the reservoir of <b>counter</b> <b>attacks.</b> Its possibilities have been very ably exploited by the Germans. Also the defensive batteries behind, which have of course the exact range of the captured trench, concentrate on it and destroy the attack at the moment of victory. The trench falls back to its former holders under this fire and a <b>counter</b> <b>attack.</b> Check again <b>for</b> the offensive. Even if it can take, it cannot hold a position under these conditions. This we will call Grade A2; a revised and improved A. What is the retort from the opposite side? Obviously to enhance and extend the range of the preliminary bombardment behind the actual trench line, to destroy or block, if it can, the dug-outs and destroy or silence the counter offensive artillery. If it can do that, it can go on; otherwise Bloch wins.|$|R
