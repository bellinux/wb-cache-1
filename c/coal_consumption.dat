However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E
5|$|Maine {{served in}} the Atlantic for the {{entirety}} of her career with the North Atlantic Fleet, which later became the Atlantic Fleet; {{during the early years}} of her service, she was the fleet flagship, until she was replaced in 1907. Later that year, she joined the cruise of the Great White Fleet, though her heavy <b>coal</b> <b>consumption</b> prevented her from continuing with the fleet past San Francisco. After returning to the U.S., she served as the 3rd Squadron flagship. During America's participation in World War I from April 1917 to November 1918, Maine was used as a training ship. She remained in active service until May 1920, when she was decommissioned. The ship was ultimately sold for scrap in January 1922 and broken up for scrap under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty signed that year.|$|E

By comparing simulation results under different wind penetrations and risk constraints, <b>coal</b> <b>consumptions</b> will not always decrease with wind penetration and risk constraint but for most times.

5|$|Shinwell {{acted to}} reduce {{consumption}} of coal by cutting the electricity supply to industry completely {{and reducing the}} domestic supply to 19 hours per day across the country. In consequence factories across the country were forced to shut and up to four million people claimed unemployment benefits. Although {{so many people were}} made redundant there was little unrest and no major public disorders. Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published, and newspapers were cut in size to four pages or one sheet. Food rations, still in use from the Second World War, were cut to levels lower than in the war years. These measures made little difference to the rate of <b>coal</b> <b>consumption</b> but served to reduce public morale.|$|E

In this paper, we build a Chinese inter-regional CGE model and simulate 13 policies and their combinations. By analyzing the energy <b>consumptions,</b> <b>coal</b> <b>consumptions,</b> relating emissions and their impacts on GDP, we found that with the structure adjustment policy, the proportion of coal in primary fossil fuels in 2030 will decrease from 53 % to 48 % and CO 2 emissions will decrease by 11. 3 %– 22. 8 % compared to the baseline scenario. With the energy intensity reduction policy, CO 2 emissions will decrease by 33. 3 % in 2030 and 47. 8 % in 2050 than baseline scenario. Other pollutants will also be controlled as synergetic effects. In this study we also find that although the earlier the peaking time the better for emission amounts control, the economic costs can not be ignored. The GDP will decrease by 2. 96 %– 8. 23 % under different scenarios. Therefore, integrated policy solutions are needed for realizing the peaks package and more targeted measures are required to achieve the peaks of other pollutants earlier...|$|R

Compared with gasoline vehicle (GV), electric vehicle (EV) is expected {{to play an important}} role in the mitigation of CO 2 and other pollution emissions, and urban air quality improvement, for its zero emission during use and higher energy efficiency. This paper aims to estimate the energy saving efficiency of EV, especially under different EV penetration and road traffic conditions. First, based on the emission and electricity consumption data collected by a light-duty EV and a light duty GV, a set of electricity consumption rate models and gasoline consumption rate models are established. Then, according to the conversion formula of coal equivalent, these models are transformed into <b>coal</b> equivalent <b>consumption</b> models, which make gasoline consumption and electricity consumption comparable. Finally, the relationship between the EV penetration and the reduction of energy consumption is explored based on the simulation undertaken on the North Second Ring Road in Beijing. The results show that the <b>coal</b> equivalent <b>consumption</b> will decrease by about 5 % with the increases of EV penetration by 10 % and the maximum energy-saving effect can be achieved when the traffic volume is about 4000 pcu/h...|$|R
