50|$|Bateson also viewed {{that all}} three systems of the individual, society and {{ecosystem}} were all together a part of one supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> that controls everything instead of just interacting systems. This supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> is beyond the self {{of the individual and}} could be equated to what many people refer to as God, though Bateson referred to it as Mind. While Mind is a <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system,</b> it can only be distinguished as a whole and not parts. Bateson felt Mind was immanent in the messages and pathways of the supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system.</b> He saw the root of system collapses as a result of Occidental or Western epistemology. According to Bateson, consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual, society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> or Mind. Bateson thought that consciousness as developed through Occidental epistemology was at direct odds with Mind.|$|E

50|$|Bateson {{argues for}} a {{position}} of humility and acceptance of the natural <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> instead of scientific arrogance as a solution. He believes that humility can come about by abandoning the view of operating through consciousness alone. Consciousness {{is only one way}} in which to obtain knowledge and without complete knowledge of the entire <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> disaster is inevitable. The limited conscious must be combined with the unconscious in complete synthesis. Only when thought and emotion are combined in whole is man able to obtain complete knowledge. He believed that religion and art are some of the few areas in which a man is acting as a whole individual in complete consciousness. By acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> as a whole man can change his relationship to Mind from one of schism, in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition, to one of complementarity. Bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bateson {{presents}} Occidental epistemology as {{a method}} of thinking that leads to a mindset in which man exerts an autocratic rule over all cybernetic systems. In exerting his autocratic rule man changes the environment to suit him and in doing so he unbalances the natural <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> of controlled competition and mutual dependency. The purpose-driven accumulation of knowledge ignores the supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> and leads to the eventual breakdown of the entire system. Bateson claims that man {{will never be able to}} control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system, he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics. Lastly, man's technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system,</b> instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self-correct.|$|E

5000|$|Cybernetics {{has been}} applied to many fields, such as anthropology, sociology, systems theory, psychology, biology, {{computer}} science and engineering. The defining characteristic of a <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> is its relationship between endogenous goals and the external environment. In the 1970s, cybernetics was applied in healthcare as a means of setting positive outcome goals for patients who were not satisfied with their plastic surgeries. The emergence of [...] "new cybernetics" [...] or [...] "second-order cybernetics" [...] further expanded this concept to include the interactions between cybernetic systems and the people interacting with them, as well as to society as a whole.|$|E

5000|$|Gregory Bateson was {{the first}} to draw such analogies in his project of an Ecology of Mind (Bateson 1973), which was based on general {{principles}} of complex dynamic life processes, e.g. the concept of feedback loops, which he saw as operating both between the mind and the world and within the mind itself. Bateson thinks of the mind neither as an autonomous metaphysical force nor as a mere neurological function of the brain, but as a [...] "dehierarchized concept of a mutual dependency between the (human) organism and its (natural) environment, subject and object, culture and nature", and thus as [...] "a synonym for a <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> of information circuits that are relevant for the survival of the species."

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1950s, Vallée wrote his first publications on what he named [...] "opérateur d'observation" [...] (which means in English [...] "operator of observation"). The latter, in the simplest case, allows a <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> to observe the state of its environment and itself. Thereafter, {{on the basis of these}} results, a decisional operator will be able to indicate the action to be taken. The two stages of perception and decision are distinguished by [...] "intellectual convenience", but it is interesting to gather them in a unique operator, known as [...] "pragmatic". A decision is influenced by the observation of events, but also by past perceptions. That means that, in the observation made at a given moment, traces of past observations are also present. Eventually, these processes follow one another in a loop. Vallée defined the study of this situation with the term [...] "epistemo-praxeology", underlining the existing link between knowledge (episteme), resulting from observation, and action (praxis). Regarding the observation problem, Vallée was also interested in information theory.|$|E
5000|$|Questions of subjectivity, agency, actors, and {{structures}} {{have always been}} of interest in social and cultural anthropology. In cyborg anthropology {{the question of what}} type of <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture (Silicon Valley), government sanctions (net neutrality), specific innovative humans (Steve Jobs), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. Actor-network theory (ANT), proposed by Bruno Latour, is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another. ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of Parsons' approach to Sociology in stating that cultural objects form an autonomous type. This {{is one of the}} reasons why Parsons established a careful division between cultural and social system, a point which he highlighted in a short statement that he wrote together with Alfred Kroeber. and which is expressed on his AGIL paradigm. For Parsons, adaptation, goal attainment, integration and latency form the basic characteristics of social action, and could be understood as a fourfold function of a <b>cybernetic</b> <b>system</b> where the hierarchical order is L-I-G-A. The most metaphysical questions in his theory laid embedded in the concept of [...] "Constitutive Symbolization", which represented the pattern maintenance of the cultural system and was the cultural systemic equivalent of latent pattern maintenance through institutions like school and family (or, simply put, [...] "L"). Later the metaphysical questions became more specified in the Paradigm of the Human Condition, which Parsons developed in the years before his death as an extension of the original AGIL theory.|$|E
