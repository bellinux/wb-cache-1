5|$|The Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn {{also served}} its own Lynn depot (a {{block away from}} the Eastern Railroad station) at Market Street near Broad Street, as well its own West Lynn station {{adjacent}} to the Eastern Railroad station just east of <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street.</b> Neither station is still extant.|$|E
5|$|After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY179 {{continues}} eastward as Mile Strip Road, {{entering a}} large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit56), which connects via trumpet interchange. After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane <b>commercial</b> <b>street,</b> passing {{north and south}} of several strip malls until an intersection with County Route204 (CR204; McKinley Parkway). After CR204, NY179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard past several residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part of a village project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street</b> and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{construction}} of thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> {{has been on}} the hotspot with the rapid development of cities. In order to improve the image and competitiveness of cities, many cities are building or rebuilding thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> However, many contradictions and problems have emerged during this process. Therefore, it is significant, for both the practice and the research, to analyze the development of thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> and provide some useful suggestions. Through the deep research and comparative study of the eight typical thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> in Harbin, this paper summarize the current situations, laws and influencing factors of the development of these streets, and then put forward some suggestions about the plan, constructions and developments of the thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> Keywords—Thematic <b>commercial</b> <b>streets,</b> laws of the development, influence factors, the constructions and developments, degrees of aggregation.

5|$|McNary's father helped on {{the family}} farm, then taught school {{for a few years}} before {{returning}} to farming near Salem. When McNary's mother died in 1878, his father moved the family to Salem where he bought a general merchandise store after being unable to run the family farm because of declining health. Charles, known as Tot, began his education at a one-room school in Keizer and later attended Central School in Salem, living on North <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street.</b> Hugh McNary died in 1883, making Charlie an orphan at the age of nine.|$|E
5|$|The once {{popular music}} {{halls of the}} East End have mostly met the same fate as the theatres. Prominent {{examples}} included the London Music Hall (1856–1935), 95-99 Shoreditch High Street, and the Royal Cambridge Music Hall (1864–1936), 136 <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street.</b> An example of a 'giant pub hall', Wilton's Music Hall (1858), remains in Grace's Alley, off Cable Street and the early 'saloon style' Hoxton Hall (1863) survives in Hoxton Street, Hoxton. Many popular music hall stars came from the East End, including Marie Lloyd.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the hamlet}} of Newfane, NY78 winds {{northwest}} along Eighteenmile Creek, intersecting with CR137 (Ewings Road). NY78 through Newfane is a two-lane <b>commercial</b> <b>street,</b> marking {{the center of}} the hamlet. The route intersects with the eastern terminus of CR91 (East Street). Paralleling Eighteenmile Creek out of Newfane, the route intersects with CR104 (Ide Road)'s eastern terminus. Now running alongside the creek, NY78 continues north through the town of Newfane, passing west of a public golf course, remaining a two-lane residential road through town.|$|E
40|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>streets</b> play an {{important}} role in cities. They are not only a means of access and platforms for intrapersonal communication throughout a city but are also areas of economic and social expression. They create a host of economic exchanges while generating pedestrian and vehicular fluxes. Contributing to the public realm, they are considered places of social and professional activity, while also posing a series of safety, aesthetic, environmental and developmental challenges. Doha is one of the leading developing cities in the Middle East. It aspires to develop a sustainable built environment of international standard, while responding to local culture and customs. Vibrant urban <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> play a major role in Doha, and they are affected by the country’s fast growth and rapid urban development. The design and rehabilitation of future and existing <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> are of utmost importance to the livability and sustainability of the city. Consequently, deep research is required to investigate the concept of vibrancy in Doha’s <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> The research aims to explore the principles that define and contribute to street vibrancy. In order to achieve this systematically, physical and social assessment methods of investigation are formulated. Criteria and a scores index are explored by firstly inductively considering the research questions. These tools are fundamental elements to build towards the second objective, which is to identify and verify in a deductive way the parameters that contribute to the vibrancy of the <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> Mixed method for collecting and analyzing data from active street users has been used in the research, including personal interviews and on-site surveys. The research establishes a link between planning and design and the streets’ vibrancy, of which results a framework for future investigations and principles for the revitalization of existing streets, or the design of new <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> As these principles aim to guarantee the vibrancy of <b>commercial</b> <b>streets,</b> the research concludes that their implementation and development may positively contribute to the city’s economic and social fabric...|$|R

5|$|In Brownville, {{the route}} intersects with the {{northern}} terminus of Bridge Street (unsigned NY971H), a short north–south connector leading to NY12F on the south bank of the Black River. At this point, the CR190 co-designation ends and maintenance of the route becomes {{the responsibility of the}} state. Through Brownville, NY12E remains a two-lane residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>street,</b> intersecting with the southern terminus of CR54 (Brown Boulevard) near the Brownville Hotel, a National Register of Historic Places-listed (NRHP) property. At {{the western edge of the}} village, NY12E passes Brownville Cemetery before leaving for the surrounding town of Brownville and losing the Main Street name. The highway parallels a former railroad right-of-way as it heads through the town of Brownville, becoming a two-lane rural highway and gradually bending northeastward away from the riverbank.|$|E
5|$|Lynn {{has also}} been home to eight other {{stations}} on different sites - none of which lasted into the MBTA era - plus a ninth that opened in 1965. Besides its downtown stops, the Eastern Railroad also served East Lynn from 1880 until Marblehead Branch service ended in June 1959. Stairways from the Chatham Street to the station site still exist, although no station building remains. The 1896 depot was disassembled in 1912 {{in preparation for the}} downtown grade separation. It was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, where it now serves as the University of New Hampshire Dairy Bar and a station stop on Amtrak's Downeaster service. A West Lynn station was located at <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street</b> at the junction with the Saugus Branch Railroad, and Green Street was briefly located just east of Central Square. Neither the West Lynn nor Green Street buildings survive.|$|E
5|$|NY128 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 (ArmonkBedford Road), an arterial boulevard, in the hamlet of Armonk (within {{the town of}} North Castle). NY128 proceeds north on Main Street, a two-lane <b>commercial</b> <b>street,</b> intersecting with an old alignment of NY22, entering the town center for North Castle, where it maintains the commercial backdrop through town. Passing west of Wampus Brook Park, NY128 intersects with Old Mount Kisco Road, an old alignment as it leaves the town center. NY128 soon parallels the park and Wampus Brook on its way north, maintaining the Main Street moniker until an intersection with Old Mount Kisco Road. At that junction, the route becomes ArmonkMount Kisco Road, making a large bend westward near Al Ehrmann Park.|$|E

At the junction with Grand Street, NY129 continues northeast on Grand Street, which is a two-lane residential street. The route continues northeast through the village, crossing an intersection with Quaker Bridge Road before becoming a wooded lane in the town of Cortlandt. In Cortlandt, NY129 continues north as Grand Street, paralleling a local creek and entering Croton Dam Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Alexandria, the son of French {{citizens}} Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Russian origin. His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street,</b> {{and worked as a}} deliverer in the East End, then an impoverished ghetto where Yiddish was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the Aliens Act in 1905.|$|E
5|$|The current Woodstock Library {{building}} {{is at the}} intersection of one <b>commercial</b> <b>street</b> (SE Woodstock Boulevard) and one tree-lined residential street (SE 49th), which links to the Woodstock School and Woodstock Park.

40|$|The {{social life}} of cities {{is a key}} concept related to social cohesion, {{which has been the}} subject of {{extensive}} studies in several disciplines including sociology, psychology and the built environment. Social life studies conducted in the built environment discipline have mostly focused on city centres; while the significance of neighbourhoods as integral elements have been sometimes overlooked. As a result, this research will specifically explore <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> in residential suburbs. Suburbs are frequently perceived to be lacking in vitality and street life. The method of inquiry in this research investigates how the physical characteristics of <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> can either promote, affect or mitigate the social life of neighbourhoods and generate a sociable environment. Therefore, this study captures the social behaviour of three <b>commercial</b> <b>streets</b> in Geelong, Australia. This paper utilizes a qualitative approach to the study of the social life of <b>commercial</b> <b>streets.</b> The primary methodology used in this research is recording, documenting and mapping users&# 039; activities through behavioural observation. The observations have been conducted in four days (on two weekdays and two weekends). The case study has been divided into eight sections that are similar in length. Short movies of 30 seconds have been recorded from each section, every two hours from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm. Afterwards, the movies have been transmitted into street mappings, documenting the type of activities, placement of activities, gender and approximate age by exploiting suitable pictograms...|$|R
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street</b> was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on <b>Commercial</b> <b>Street</b> turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; {{and a handful of}} the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest <b>commercial</b> <b>street</b> in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
