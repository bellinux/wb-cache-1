25|$|The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was {{delivered}} from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. The Mk II soon followed, the main differences being {{a slightly more}} powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson mixture <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> and a partly automatic boost control carburettor, driving a Fairey fixed-pitch three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) {{in place of the}} Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Unlike earlier systems, {{none of the}} AN/ARC-5 <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> have audio jacks for the microphone, headphone, or key. A {{separate}} {{jack box}} is used instead. AN/ARC-5 transmitter <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> contain no Morse key.|$|E

5000|$|The Cobalt Flux dance {{platform}} itself {{connects to}} a [...] "control box", which contains {{the start and}} select buttons for the dance controller. The connection to the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> uses a 15-pin serial connector which hangs {{out of the top}} of the pad as a dongle. This <b>control</b> <b>box</b> also handles the wiring needed for different gaming console connectors, which lead off of the <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is removable.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>control</b> <b>box</b> shipped with Cobalt Flux pads {{was designed}} to work only with the PlayStation 2; many home players {{wanted to use the}} pad with an Xbox or PC, but running this <b>control</b> <b>box</b> through converters for standard PS2 controllers usually caused an unacceptable amount of latency during play. Cobalt Flux has since released a new <b>control</b> <b>box</b> with built-in connectivity for PS2, Xbox, and the PC.|$|R
50|$|It is possible, with {{knowledge}} of the dance platform's pinout, to build your own <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> This is especially popular for the Xbox, as a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> built with the electronics from a soft dance pad will be properly recognized as a dance pad, not a controller.|$|R

50|$|The missile {{is carried}} in a {{rectangular}} launcher box, which is connected to a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> by a 20-meter cable, allowing for a degree of separation from the operator. The missile {{can be set up}} in around 30 seconds by a single man. The transporter/launcher box is pointed toward the expected direction of the enemy and the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is attached to it using the cable. The manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) <b>control</b> <b>box</b> consists of an optical sighting device and a joystick, which transmits commands to the missile via two thin cables that are trailed behind the missile.|$|R

5000|$|The {{last two}} known {{original}} [...] "Sensurround Model-1" [...] <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> {{are owned by}} Dolby Laboratories. They are loaned on occasion for revival screenings of films using the process. At least one replica system exists, as it was custom built for a 2004 London revival screening of Earthquake. Sensurround Mod-II and Mod-III boxes are common and relatively easy to find from old theater equipment dealers and can be bought for $50 or so. The Mod-II and Mod-III boxes were mostly just modifications of the original <b>control</b> <b>boxes,</b> but the changes are not easily undone to make them capable of running Earthquake because MCA did all the modifications themselves and never released any documentation about the changes made to each circuit card in the unit.|$|E

50|$|The {{screw-on}} cables {{used the}} same wire as the connecting wire between the pickup and volume control which commonly dried out, became brittle, cracked and fell apart or became completely stiff, rigid and useless. This caused many pickups themselves {{to be connected to}} the <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> using other wire types or usable original vintage wire.|$|E
50|$|Blasting caps are ignited {{utilizing}} hand-held {{intrinsically safe}} <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> which employ {{a series of}} safety interlocks and switches which require a strict radio sessioning handshake protocol between the unit which ignites the cap and the unit used by the Master Blaster controlling the shot, ensuring that the emplaced Tovex, detonation cord, and caps cannot ignite prematurely.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s with {{survival}} so {{reliant on}} Government contracts, C&N Electrical Ltd was headed by electrician Roy Taylor to supply <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> for minesweepers.

50|$|Western Electric {{developed}} the AN/ARR-2, an all-in-one homing receiver that replaced the broadcast band receiver and external homing adapter and had other enhancements as well. The R-4A/ARR-2 {{uses the same}} dynamotor as the AN/ARC-5 sets, fits in the same racks, and can be controlled by special AN/ARC-5 <b>control</b> <b>boxes.</b> The AN/ARR-2 replaced the earlier R-24/ARC-5 and R-1/ARR-1 combo in AN/ARC-5 installations.|$|E
