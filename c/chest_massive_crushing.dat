40|$|Objective: {{to improve}} the results of victims with <b>massive</b> <b>crushes</b> of soft tissues in severe {{concomitant}} injury (SCI), by applying extracorporeal detoxification techniques as soon as possible. Subjects and methods. The results of examination and treatment were studied in 41 victims with SCI treated at the N. N. Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital in 2006 to 2008. In the early posttraumatic period (on days 1 — 3), all the victims (n= 41) were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 victims (n= 19) underwent hemodiafiltration (HDF) with replacement at 35 ml/kg/hr; Group 2 (n= 22) had plasmapheresis. Results. Early HDF applied to Group 1 victims could achieve 32, 44, and 37 % reductions in the elevated levels creatine phosphokinase, myoglobin, and middle-sized molecules, respectively. In Group 2, plasmapheresis showed a lower effect (19, 25, and 26 % reductions). Furthermore, there was a decrease in total protein in Group 1, which was absent in Group 2. Conclusion. The timely use of extracorporeal detoxification techniques in victims with <b>massive</b> <b>crushes</b> of soft tissues in the early posttraumatic period prevents the development of fatal complications of SCI, {{at the same time}} HDF is more effective and safe than plasmapheresis.

50|$|The {{claims were}} brought by Alcock {{and several other}} claimants after the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989, where 95 Liverpool fans died in a <b>massive</b> <b>crush</b> during the FA Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. According to the Taylor Report (as well as the later report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel), the accident {{was caused by the}} police negligently allowing too many supporters to crowd {{in one part of the}} stadium. Many alleged to have seen their friends and relatives die in the crush and suffered psychiatric harm or nervous shock after the incident.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also not}} clear to what degree dromornithids were carnivores. The <b>massive,</b> <b>crushing</b> beaks of some species suggest {{that at least some}} members of the family were a {{combination}} of carnivorous predators and scavengers (much like today's hyenas) or omnivores. Other features, such as the [...] "hoof-like" [...] feet, stomach structure, and eye structure that resulted in a wide field of vision but likely also created a centre blind spot of about forty degrees (which would hinder hunting significantly) suggest a more herbivorous, migratory lifestyle. The general consensus is that they were indeed herbivores.|$|R

This relationship is more prominent in the second movie.|$|R
50|$|The AIB also {{examined}} passenger and crew survivability during the accident. Post-mortem examinations on the passengers showed {{that those in}} the very front of the fuselage {{had been killed by}} rapid deceleration injuries, but those further aft had suffered <b>massive</b> <b>crushing</b> injuries to their lower legs that stopped them from escaping the burning wreckage. Investigators found that the bracing bars meant to keep the rows of seats separate were too weak to stop the rows from collapsing together like a concertina, and determined that had the bars been adequately strong, most of the passengers {{would have been able to}} escape the aircraft.|$|R

Much of the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis has been clarified by careful observations in exertional and metabolic rhabdomyolysis and has been extensively reviewed [3, 4].

5000|$|Prodiplocynodon was not {{included}} in a phylogenetic study until 1996. In that study, Prodiplocynodon was excluded from the Alligatorinae because it lacked all seven of the unequivocal synapomorphies that were proposed for the clade. According to the 1996 study, characters that exclude Prodiplocynodon from Alligatorinae include the presence of a distinct lateral constriction between the premaxilla and maxilla, a contact between the nasal and lacrimal, and the lack of posterior <b>massive</b> <b>crushing</b> teeth. The 1996 analysis considered Prodiplocynodon to be the sister taxon to the Alligatorinae rather than the Crocodylinae because in Prodiplocynodon, the jugal-lacrimal suture is much shorter than the ventral border of the orbit. However, the authors of the study mentioned that this character is also seen in some derived crocodylines, and is lost in some ingroups of Alligatorinae.|$|R

They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president Barney Dreyfuss, club secretary Harry Pulliam, and outfielder-manager Fred Clarke to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built – 5-feet-11, 200 pounds, with a barrel <b>chest,</b> <b>massive</b> shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke {{to take a chance on}} him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19, and hit [...]338 in 61 games.|$|R

50|$|The Middlesboro Daily News ran {{an article}} by Owen Lattimore which {{reported}} on Japan's planned offensive into a Hui Muslim region of China in 1938, which predicted that the Japanese would suffer a <b>massive</b> <b>crushing</b> defeat {{at the hands of}} the Muslims. In 1940, the Japanese were crushed and routed by the Muslims at the Battle of West Suiyuan. The Japanese planned to invade Ningxia from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui Muslim puppet state. The following year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by the Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Hongbin, who caused the plan to collapse. Ma Hongbin's Hui Muslim troops launched further attacks against Japan in the Battle of West Suiyuan. In Suiyuan 300 Mongol collaborators serving the Japanese were fought off by a single Muslim who held the rank of Major at the Battle of Wulan Obo in 1939 April.|$|R

5000|$|Haruko, {{recognizing}} Sakuragi's athleticism, introduces {{him to the}} Shohoku basketball team. Sakuragi {{is reluctant}} to join the team at first, as he has no prior experience in sports and thinks that basketball is a game for losers (in addition {{to the fact that}} the fiftieth girl rejected him in favor of a basketball player). Sakuragi, despite his extreme immaturity and fiery temper, proves to be a natural athlete and joins the team, mainly in the hopes of impressing and getting closer to Haruko. Later on, Sakuragi realizes that he has come to actually love the sport, despite having previously played primarily because of his crush on Haruko. Kaede Rukawa — Sakuragi's bitter rival (both in basketball and because Haruko has a <b>massive</b> <b>crush,</b> albeit one-sided, on Rukawa), the star rookie and a [...] "girl magnet" [...] — joins the team at the same time.
