Resolution of constipation was defined as greater than eight bowel motions during a two week intervention. Thirteen children (18 to 144 months) participated in Trial 1 (6 boys, 7 girls). Nine participants who completed the soy epoch all experienced resolution (p < 0. 05). Thirty-nine children (21 to 144 months) participated in Trial 2 (25 boys, 14 girls).

40|$|Introduction. Camel's milk {{proteins}} {{have very little}} homology with <b>cow's</b> <b>Milk</b> proteins, and, in addition, beta-lactoglobulin, the major allergenic protein in <b>cow's</b> <b>milk,</b> is completely absent in camel's milk. Such structural differences may result in different antigenic responses induced by these two milks. In the present work we studied the immunoreactivity of camel's {{milk proteins}} using sera from children with confirmed allergy to <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins. Methods. We used milk caseins and whey proteins from Targui camels from Southern Algeria and sera from 10 patients allergic to <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins confirmed by their clinical history and by skin tests. The immunoreactivity of camel's and <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins was studied by indirect Elisa using these sera. Results. All the 10 sera showed reactivity with <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> caseins whereas only 4 of them reacted with camel's milk caseins, and these responses were significantly lower (16 to 92 %) compared to the responses to <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins. In contrast, all of the whey proteins reacted with the patients' sera, but these responses were lower than those with bovine whey proteins (36 to 85 % lower). Discussion. Camel's milk proteins {{appear to have a}} very weak antigenic potential in comparison to <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, as has been reported in other studies (Restani et al., 2002; Vereda, 2006; El-Agamy et al., 2007; Fiocchi et al., 2010). Conclusion. The use of camel's milk as a substitute for <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> carries a certain risk due to its residual immunoreactivity. Nevertheless, due to its low allergenic potential, it could be considered {{to be used as a}} substitute for <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> for children at risk of developing <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the frequent ingestion of baked hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> accelerates the resolution of hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergy. This practice is being introduced into clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence {{to determine whether the}} introduction of baked hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> into the diet of children with hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergies respectively leads to a larger proportion of children outgrowing these allergies than expected. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in Medline, Embase and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized control trials, case-control or cohort studies; children aged 0 - 18 years with hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergy; baked hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> intervention with or without a comparator; and resolution of the hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergy as determined by food challenge as the outcome. Studies were critically appraised using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. PROSPERO reference CRD 42015026029. RESULTS: We identified 851 and 2816 hen's egg and <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> articles respectively. Only three hen's egg and three <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> studies fulfilled our pre-specified inclusion criteria. The studies concluded that baked products either increased the likelihood of the resolution of allergy or accelerated resolution. However, when critiqued, all studies were classified as weak because they were observational, lacking an appropriate control group; this brings into doubt the study's conclusions. There were a number of examples of severe reactions to baked products. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence to address the hypothesis that the ingestion of baked hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> results in more patients outgrowing their hen's egg or <b>cow's</b> <b>milk</b> allergy respectively. Data are required from a trial comparing the resolution rates of baked-tolerant participants who are randomized to ingest or avoid baked products to assess the accuracy of this hypothesis...|$|R
