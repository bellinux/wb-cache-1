5|$|The {{returning}} Chinook, {{carrying the}} remainder of the A <b>Company</b> <b>group</b> including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined {{the first half of the}} <b>company</b> <b>group</b> on the ground. As the <b>company</b> <b>group</b> moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.|$|E

5|$|The third Chinook carried {{half of the}} {{enhanced}} A <b>Company</b> <b>group</b> from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but {{had been unable to}} determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the <b>company</b> <b>group</b> and return to insert them at the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|As {{planning}} for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed, it became clear that, {{given the number of}} West Side Boys and their separation between two locations (Gberi Bana as well as the village of Magbeni; see below), the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone. Thus, the headquarters of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) was ordered to assemble an enhanced <b>company</b> <b>group,</b> which would support special forces if such an operation was launched. The battalion's commanding officer selected A Company, led by Major Matthew Lowe, which had been on exercise in Jamaica {{at the time of the}} initial British deployment to Sierra Leone. Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior. Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company, but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the <b>company</b> <b>group</b> up to the required strength, including a signals group, snipers, heavy machine gun sections, and a mortar section. The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners, given that the West Side Boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties.|$|E
5|$|At {{a cost of}} £330m, the {{construction}} of the Doughnut was funded by a private finance initiative (PFI) put forward by a collective that included British facilities management and construction company Carillion, the Danish security <b>company</b> <b>Group</b> 4/Falck (now G4S), and the British telecommunications company BT Group. The consortium are scheduled to be paid £800m to maintain the Doughnut for 30 years. The creation of the Doughnut was the largest PFI project to date for the British government. The building was designed by the British architect Chris Johnson for the American architectural firm Gensler, and constructed and built by Carillion.|$|E

5|$|Later, in May 2006 a {{commando}} <b>company</b> <b>group</b> was {{deployed to}} Timor Leste {{as part of}} Operation Astute, after relations between the East Timorese government and military forces broke down. The commandos operated alongside the SASR {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow-on forces, focusing on Dili Airport. In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn {{at the request of the}} East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando <b>company</b> <b>group,</b> elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E
5|$|An SASR troop was {{deployed}} to Timor Leste in May 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando <b>Company</b> <b>Group</b> {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorist groups, but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji between the military and the government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens. On 29 November 2006, a Black Hawk helicopter from the 171st Aviation Squadron carrying four crew and six soldiers from the SASR crashed while attempting to land on HMAS Kanimbla and sank in international waters off Fiji. The helicopter's pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.|$|E

5|$|The mission, codenamed Operation Barras, was {{undertaken}} by D Squadron of 22 Special Air Service Regiment, who assaulted {{the village of}} Gberi Bana to extract the soldiers, while a <b>company</b> <b>group</b> formed around A Company, 1 PARA, assaulted Magbeni, {{on the opposite side}} of Rokel Creek. The operation was successful and all the British captives were extracted, along with their SLA liaison and 22 Sierra Leonean civilians, while the WSB were defeated as a military force. A British soldier and at least 25 West Side Boys were killed in the operation. Many other West Side Boys fled and later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight. Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army, and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme at Benguema. Following Operation Barras, two SLA battalions—graduates of the British short-term training programme—swept the area surrounding the West Side Boys' camp to clear it of any remaining gang members.|$|E
25|$|The Army's main force {{suited to}} {{overseas}} deployments was the Operational Deployment Force (ODF), which was centred on the 3rd Brigade, based at Townsville.

40|$|<b>Company</b> <b>groups</b> are an {{important}} factor in transition economies. For some, the origins {{can be traced to the}} socialist period. Others are a product of the transition process. This paper discusses the likely impact of <b>company</b> <b>groups</b> on transition economies both in the short and in the long term. It suggests that while in the short term <b>company</b> <b>groups</b> may well be transaction enabling, in the long term they could create substantial costs by impeding competition and undermining the adaptability of companies to changing economic conditions. Regulatory intervention should balance the short-term benefits of <b>company</b> <b>groups</b> with their potential long-term costs. In the short term, the primary goal of regulatory intervention should be to prevent the development of structures that may be difficult to reverse and to ensure minimum protection of shareholder and creditor rights primarily through disclosure requirements and exit options. The regulation of intra-group relations based on complex legal doctrines that rely heavily on judicial evaluations as currently suggested for the European Union do not seem appropriate for transition economies, given the weakness of legal institutions in these countries...|$|R

Once at Norfolk Island, the <b>company</b> <b>group</b> had to repack its equipment into smaller containers, as those originally used could not be carried by the Navy's Wessex helicopters. These helicopters transferred the Army force onto Tobruk during the night, which was dangerous as they were not equipped for night flying. The soldiers were not familiar with the ship, and the process of unpacking and storing their equipment was also slow.|$|E
