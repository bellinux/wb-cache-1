50|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the commutator segments.|$|E

50|$|Modern devices using <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> {{usually have}} a {{maintenance-free}} design that requires no adjustment throughout {{the life of the}} device, using a fixed-position brush holder slot and a combined brush-spring-cable assembly that fits into the slot. The worn brush is pulled out and a new brush inserted.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{rotating}} {{machines with}} commutators almost exclusively use <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes,</b> {{which may have}} copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes {{can be found in}} toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive starter motors.|$|R
50|$|The {{softness}} of carbon brushes permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without {{damage to the}} segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial-contact brushes. In {{the case of a}} reaction-type <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> holder, carbon brushes may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.|$|E
50|$|Like {{his successors}} after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk {{endeavored}} {{to expand and}} shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> holder factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of sintered bearings was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company.|$|E
50|$|The high {{resistance}} or <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> is made {{large enough}} that it is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans (and on large machines may often span two insulating segments). The result {{of this is that}} as the commutator segment passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> using {{electrically}} conductive carbon graphite {{have been used}} for shaft-grounding and current-conduction purposes for a long time.

These brushes have ultralow friction and negligible wear and are very robust toward contamination, when compared with conventional carbon-based brushes. In addition, they are particularly suitable for use with high-frequency currents and voltages, as they also allow current-conduction based on electric field emission. we develop the design criteria for such brushes, both for prevention of voltage buildup and current conduction of several tens of amperes with frequencies in the megahertz range. We support the theoretical results with measurement results taken at different rotor shaft speed. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> {{are one of}} {{the least}} costly parts in an {{electric}} motor. On the other hand, they usually are the key part which delivers the durability (“life-time”) and performance to the motor they are used in. Their production requires very high attention to quality control and production process control throughout all steps of the production process.|$|R
50|$|Wireless {{slip rings}} do {{not rely on}} the typical {{friction}} based metal and <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> contact methods that have been employed by slip rings since their invention, such as those explored above. Instead, they transfer both power and data wirelessly via an electromagnetic field, which is created by the coils that are placed in the rotating receiver, and the stationary transmitter. Wireless slip rings are considered an upgrade from - or alternative to - traditional slip rings, as their lack of standard mechanical rotating parts means they're typically more resilient in harsh operating environments, and require less maintenance and upkeep. However, the amount of power that can be transmitted between coils is limited; typically a traditional contact-type slip ring can transmit orders of magnitude more power in the same volume.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distributor}} {{consists of}} a rotating arm or [...] inside the distributor cap, {{on top of the}} distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> {{on the underside of the}} distributor cap. The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{attached}} {{to the top of the}} distributor shaft which is driven by the engine's camshaft and thus synchronized to it. Synchronization to the camshaft is required as the rotor must turn at exactly half the speed of the main crankshaft in the 4-stroke cycle. Often, the rotor and distributor are attached directly to the end of the one of (or the only) camshaft, at the opposite end to the timing drive belt. This rotor is pressed against a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> on the center terminal of the distributor cap which connects to the ignition coil. The rotor is constructed such that the center tab is electrically connected to its outer edge so the current coming in to the center post travels through the carbon point to the outer edge of the rotor. As the camshaft rotates, the rotor spins and its outer edge passes each of the internal plug terminals to fire each spark plug in sequence.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturing of <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> {{requires}} an in-depth knowledge {{of materials and}} experience in mixture compositions. Very small changes in brush contents by just a few percent of components by weight can significantly change the properties of brushes on their applications.

50|$|Electrolytic in-process {{dressing}} (ELID) grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} accurate grinding methods. In this ultra precision grinding technology the grinding wheel is dressed electrochemically and in-process to maintain the accuracy of the grinding. An ELID cell consists of a metal bonded grinding wheel, a cathode electrode, a pulsed DC power supply and electrolyte. The wheel is connected to the positive terminal of the DC power supply through a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> whereas the electrode is connected to the negative pole of the power supply. Usually alkaline liquids are used as both electrolytes and coolant for grinding. A nozzle is used to inject the electrolyte into the gap between wheel and electrode. The gap is usually maintained to be approximately 0.1mm to 0.3 mm. During the grinding operation one side of the wheel takes part in the grinding operation whereas the other side of the wheel is being dressed by electrochemical reaction. The dissolution of the metallic bond material is caused by the dressing which in turns results continuous protrusion of new sharp grits.|$|E
