5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre,</b> corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre</b> and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

The number of cloud condensation nuclei in the air can be measured and ranges between around 100 to 1000 per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre.</b> The total mass of CCNs injected into the atmosphere has been estimated at 2x1012kg over a year's time.|$|E

500|$|Although white dwarfs {{are known}} with {{estimated}} masses {{as low as}} 0.17 [...] and as high as 1.33 , the mass distribution is strongly peaked at 0.6 , and the majority lie between 0.5 and 0.7 [...] The estimated radii of observed white dwarfs are typically 0.8–2 % the radius of the Sun; this {{is comparable to the}} Earth's radius of approximately 0.9% solar radius. A white dwarf, then, packs mass comparable to the Sun's into a volume that is typically a million times smaller than the Sun's; the average density of matter in a white dwarf must therefore be, very roughly, 1,000,000 times greater than the average density of the Sun, or approximately 106g/cm3, or 1 tonne per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre.</b> A typical white dwarf has a density of between 104 and 107 g/cm3.

2500|$|The {{story of}} Cody Caves began 600 {{million years ago}} when the {{limestone}} in which the caves later formed was laid down at the bottom of an ancient sea. Then, around 170 million years ago, the limestone beds were thrust upwards. This exposed the rock to the elements, water and carbonic acid, which eventually formed Cody Caves. Approximately [...] of the Cody Caves passageways are explorable. The caves have several types of calcite formations, such as stalagmites, stalactites, soda straws and flowstone. The boxwork is considered to be {{among the best in the}} world, protruding up to 20.3cm, whereas 2.5 to 5cm is average.

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of astronomical spectroscopy, {{scientists}} were puzzled by the spectrum of gaseous nebulae. In 1864 William Huggins noticed that many nebulae showed only emission lines rather than a full spectrum like stars. From the work of Kirchhoff, he concluded that nebulae must contain [...] "enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour." [...] However, there were several emission lines that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9nm and 500.7nm. These lines were attributed to a new element, nebulium, until Ira Bowen determined in 1927 that the emission lines were from highly ionised oxygen (O+2). These emission lines could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are forbidden lines; the low density of a nebula (one atom per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre)</b> allows for metastable ions to decay via forbidden line emission rather than collisions with other atoms.|$|E

2500|$|In 1937, Turner's {{director}} Robert H. Turner wrote: [...] "All {{asbestos fibre}} dust {{is a danger}} to lungs. If we can produce evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, {{we may be able}} to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk." [...] Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre</b> - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed [...] "the snow trees" [...] due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.|$|E

This curious fact, as I have said, had just been added to the treasury of modern science. It had long been noted as a strange thing that while Benares is often afflicted with the cholera she does not spread it beyond her borders. This could not be accounted for. Mr. Henkin, the scientist in the employ of the government of Agra, concluded to examine the water. He went to Benares and made his tests. He got water at the mouths of the sewers where they empty into the river at the bathing ghats; a <b>cubic</b> <b>centimetre</b> of it contained millions of germs; at the end of six hours they were all dead. He caught a floating corpse, towed it to the shore, and from beside it he dipped up water that was swarming with cholera germs; at the end of six hours they were all dead. He added swarm after swarm of cholera germs to this water; within the six hours they always died, to the last sample. Repeatedly, he took pure well water which was barren of animal life, and put into it a few cholera germs; they always began to propagate at once, and always within six hours they swarmed--and were numberable by millions upon millions.|$|E
