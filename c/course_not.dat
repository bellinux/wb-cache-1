5|$|Outside the Canandaigua city limits, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} NY21 becomes rural once again; however, the surrounding terrain is more level {{than it was}} south of the city. The route heads northeast through farmland to Chapin, a small hamlet {{in the town of}} Hopewell, where it intersects the south end of NY488 and turns to take on a more northerly <b>course.</b> <b>Not</b> far to the north are the adjacent villages of Shortsville and Manchester, roughly separated by the Ontario Central Railroad. Here, NY21 passes under the railroad and intersects both NY96 and the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit43 just north of the Manchester village center. Past the Thruway, NY21 becomes rural in nature once more as it runs across rolling terrain to the Wayne County line.|$|E
25|$|Paraconsistent logic has {{significant}} overlap with many-valued logic; however, not all paraconsistent logics are many-valued (and, of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> all many-valued logics are paraconsistent). Dialetheic logics, {{which are also}} many-valued, are paraconsistent, but the converse does not hold.|$|E
25|$|Sandford's {{death on}} March 4, 1948 {{was quiet and}} peaceful. His funeral and interment, however, were hasty and secretive. The news of his death was not {{released}} to the press for six weeks.

25|$|In some Tagalog regions, {{the norm}} of giving patronyms, {{or in some cases}} matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of <b>course</b> <b>not</b> official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited.

25|$|Although the gamma {{function}} can {{be calculated}} virtually as easily as any mathematically simpler function with a modern computer—even with a programmable pocket calculator—this was of <b>course</b> <b>not</b> always the case. Until the mid-20th century, mathematicians relied on hand-made tables; {{in the case of}} the gamma function, notably a table computed by Gauss in 1813 and one computed by Legendre in 1825.|$|E

Of <b>course</b> <b>not.</b> Was he more likely to return to his former batting form, his early club and Shield batting form, if he were diplomatically relieved of the responsibility of leadership? Of course, yes. All the more likely if he were undiplomatically removed, because he would be nursing a grudge, burning to stage reprisals...|$|E
25|$|Community members {{believed}} the restructuring {{by the government}} was targeted specifically at the City of Lethbridge, a move made to force the province to build an additional Lethbridge high school. Such a project had been anticipated {{for at least a}} decade. As expected, the announcement for the new school came in 2005. Enrollment at LCI exceeded 1,600 students. In an effort to reduce numbers, students living on the City's north side who attend LCI must be enrolled in a <b>course</b> <b>not</b> offered at Winston Churchill High School.|$|E

25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. They came from the North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> {{so much as a}} reed hut, indeed, they feared the very idea of venturing under a roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{yellow and}} white flag of Vatican City also {{makes use of}} this emblem on the right hand side in the white half of the flag. The yellow and white colours were first adopted in 1808 as {{the flag of the}} {{personal}} guard of Pius VII, when the other forces of what had been the Papal States were brought under Napoleon's control. The previous flag was red and gold, the traditional colours of the city of Rome. The 1808 flag was of <b>course</b> <b>not</b> that of Vatican City, which did not come into existence until 1929.|$|E
25|$|Of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> {{all of the}} {{possible}} states of a multi-state molecule or complex will necessarily be populated. Indeed, in systems where the number of possible states is far {{greater than that of}} molecules in the compartment (e.g. the cell), they cannot be. In some cases, empirical information can be used to rule out certain states if, for instance, some combinations of features are incompatible. In the absence of such information, however, all possible states need to be considered a priori. In such cases, computational modeling can be used to uncover to what extent the different states are populated.|$|E

25|$|First {{dates are}} {{designed}} to produce a number of relationship outcomes. (e.g., sexual partner, friendship, short-term romantic relationship, or life partnership.) However, as Mongeau says “the desired relationship outcome (if any) is, of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> directly observable.” Mongeau quotes Theiss and Solomon, who have done many scholarly articles on dating, stating that first dates are very important because partners are both {{getting to know each}} other and attempting to establish a relationship definition as well. The three most common goals that people have on first dates are to reduce uncertainty, achieve relational escalation, and to have fun.|$|E
25|$|The Old Course {{had a large}} lefthand bend in {{the last}} quarter-mile. This benefited the crew on the Berkshire side of the <b>course</b> <b>not</b> only because they raced a shorter {{distance}} {{but also because they}} avoided the worst of the river’s current. Between 1866 and 1885, 57.7% all races were won by the crew on the Berkshire station, with the Buckinghamshire and Centre crews sharing 42.3%. The course was not boomed or piled, although between 1871 and 1873, poles were roped across the bay on the Berkshire side upstream of Poplar Point, in an attempt to minimise the advantage given to the crew on the Berkshire station.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a Tennessee court granted {{guardianship}} of a {{child to}} her grandmother and step-grandfather after the child's mother April Divilbiss and partners outed themselves as polyamorous on MTV. After contesting the decision for two years, Divilbiss eventually agreed to relinquish her daughter, acknowledging that {{she was unable to}} adequately care for her child and that this, rather than her polyamory, had been the grandparents' real motivation in seeking custody. The Tennessee case is not necessarily normative for the entirety of the United States, since family law varies significantly from state to state. U.S. state law is, of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> normative for laws of other countries.|$|E

25|$|He later {{joined the}} group named Kreisauer Kreis, led by his Silesian fellow-countryman Helmuth James Graf von Moltke. After 1939 it became {{particular}} difficult to feed the hidden persons, because food was only available on official ration stamps, of <b>course</b> <b>not</b> issued to hiding persons. Moltke provided Poelchau with food from his Silesian manor estate in Kreisau, which he embezzled from the requisitions imposed by the authorities. Poelchau stored them in his basement in Afrikanische Straße # 140b and handed them out. Helping Poelchau's group Urner hid submarines in his official residence in the Paul Gerhardt Stift. In 1944 Poelchau joined a further group named Onkel Emil, promoting the fast capitulation of Germany by public graffiti on walls.|$|E
25|$|When {{biologists}} {{interested in}} evolution theory first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, {{such as how}} the birth of sterile castes, like in bees, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like squirrels, an individual would risk its own life to save {{the rest of the}} group. These behaviours may be examples of altruism. Of <b>course,</b> <b>not</b> all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in Homo sapiens. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful including chimpanzees, as well as anecdotal reports of vengeful camels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of <b>course</b> <b>not</b> the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
