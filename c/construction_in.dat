40|$|In {{the present}} work we have {{described}} and classified agentless <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> English with side views to similar <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Spanish, Russian and German. Since reflexives {{account for the}} major part of agentless <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> these languages, we have considered them in detail. In the practical part we have studied, which English verbs are used most often <b>in</b> agentless <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> literary works. We have also looked at their translations into Spanish: whether the translations are agentless constructions and if yes, whether the semantic or / and syntactical properties of the verbs are retained in the translations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to assimilate head movement {{as far as}} possible to phrasal movement. In particular, I argue that if we assume that the computational system of natural languages does not discriminate head movement from phrasal movement in terms of locality and the possible mode of operation, a distributional difference between these two types of movement {{can be explained by the}} interaction between a locality constraint and an anti-locality constraint to which syntactic movement operations are subject, and crosslinguistic variations in the possibility of what I will call headless XP-movement and headless XP-ellipsis can be reduced to parameters that are responsible for the possible number of specifiers. For this purpose, this dissertation discusses a number of syntactic phenomena: nominative object <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Japanese, long head movement <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Slavic and Romance languages, multiple topicalization in Germanic languages, predicate cleft <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Hebrew, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Yiddish, remnant VP-fronting <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Polish, a difference between VP-ellipsis and pseudo-gapping in English, null object <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Hebrew, Tagalog, Russian, European Portuguese, Japanese, Bantu languages, Persian, and Serbo-Croatian, and yes/no reply <b>constructions</b> <b>in</b> Irish and Finnish...|$|R

The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> Riverside County, California. The California Valley Solar Ranch (CVSR) is a 250megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power plant, which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain, northeast of California Valley. The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is under <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert, and due {{to be completed in}} 2013. The Mesquite Solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in Arlington, Maricopa County, Arizona, owned by Sempra Generation.

5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas.

5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for <b>construction</b> <b>in</b> the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E
