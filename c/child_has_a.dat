5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E

25|$|Sickle-cell {{conditions}} have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance from parents.

25|$|In general, idic(15) occurs de novo but {{the parents}} must be karyotyped {{to make sure}} it is not inherited, mostly because this will affect the course of genetic {{counseling}} given to the family. If the abnormality is found prenatally and one of the parents harbour the marker, the <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies.

25|$|Some {{types of}} {{albinism}} affect only {{the skin and}} hair, while other types affect the skin, hair and eyes, and in rare cases only the eyes.

Each <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 25% chance of being albino and a 75% chance of having normally pigmented skin. One common type of albinism is oculocutaneous albinism or OCA, which has many subtypes caused by different genetic mutations.|$|E

500|$|Exceptions {{are made}} for {{children}} and a person [...] "in the exercise of his calling" [...] (a professional person or somebody exercising a trade or skill). With children, occupiers must [...] "be prepared for children to be less careful than adults"; a warning notice, for example, would normally {{be good enough to}} alert adults to a potential danger, but not to alert children. This is another extension of a common law principle; in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor [...] 1 AC 44, a seven-year-old child died after eating poisonous berries from a bush in a park. The berries, which looked like cherries or blackcurrants, were found by the House of Lords to constitute an [...] "allurement" [...] to the child, who found Glasgow Corporation, which owned the park, liable.

500|$|Psychoanalytic {{concepts}} influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, {{the observations}} by Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham {{of young children}} separated from familiar caregivers during World War II. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including [...] "drive theory" [...] in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the [...] "cupboard-love" [...] theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond {{in its own right}} rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality. Based on ideas of primary attachment and Neo-Darwinism, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear phases with regression to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing <b>child</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.|$|E
