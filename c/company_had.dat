5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The <b>company</b> <b>had</b> reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E
