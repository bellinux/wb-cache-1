The goal of the initiative petition that placed the measure on the ballot was to broaden the scope of beverage types requiring a deposit in order to be more responsive to consumer preferences as well as establishing a mechanism for stabilizing the recycling industry by tying the handling fees paid to redemption centers to the Consumer Price Index. Opponents argued that the change would increase costs and red tape for the beverage industry.|$|R
30|$|Each cement {{specimen}} {{was fully}} immersed in 5 ml {{phosphate buffered saline}} (PBS) at room temperature in a <b>covered</b> <b>container.</b> At the designated sampling intervals, each specimen {{was removed from the}} container, rinsed with 10 ml normal saline and placed in a fresh 5 -ml bath in a fresh container. A container from each of the cement specimen at each of the time intervals 1, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h was stored at − 20 ° C until they were analyzed. Cefazolin concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [23], with the following modification to the original protocol. For sample preparation, Sep Pack Alumina B cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) were used. The liquid chromatograph was equipped with a 50 μl sample loop and a Spherisorb-ods 1 column (Deeside Ind. Est., Queensferry, UK). The mobile phase used was 0.277 % Na 2 PO 4 + 0.186 % citric acid:acetonitryl (90 : 10). SMAD Data System for Apple Macintosh Computers (SMADChrom v 2.2, Morgan Kennedy Research, TX, USA) was used to record the data. The concentration of cefazolin in each PBS sample was determined from a calibration curve. The total amount of antibiotic eluted from each specimen was calculated by summing up data from all time points.|$|E
40|$|Many {{traditional}} methods of holding and handling fish in small boats persist throughout Newfoundland today. Not only are these methods inefficient from the materials handling point of view but the resulting poor quality causes great waste of the dwindling resource and contributes to consumer non-acceptance of fish as a regular source of protein food. [...] A number of experiments on filleting cod, the principal inshore species are described. These experiments demonstrate the clean economic advantage of processing good quality raw material, and an incidental advantage, to the processor, of filleting dressed cod as compared with round (gut-in) cod. Further, the experiments show, as expected, the more rapid deterioration of quality in round cod compared with dressed cod. [...] The experimental results together with statistical reports of Environment Canada on annual cod landings and production are extrapolated to estimate annual losses resulting from processing and marketing poor quality fish of all species. A system of handling, discharging and transporting fish from inshore boats {{based on the principle}} of containerization is proposed as a solution to many of the problems of this fishery. [...] Flexible containers of net or plastic covered cloth for use in open boats and rigid containers for use in decked boats would be hoisted by a suitable shore-based facility, discharged into an elevated hopper and, after any necessary processing, culling or grading, placed in an insulated, <b>covered</b> <b>container</b> with ice for transportation to a processing plant. [...] A province-wide network of some 200 such systems would handle most inshore and near-offshore landings, at reasonable cost and with a much higher average level of product quality.

40|$|How do I safely {{handle a}} turkey prior to cooking? Safe, minimal {{handling}} and thorough cooking {{will help to}} ensure turkey is safe to eat. After purchasing a turkey, refrigerate (at 4 °C / 40 °F or less) or freeze it (at or below – 18 °C / 0 °F) immediately (Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2003). Plan to use a fresh turkey within 2 days of purchase (Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency, 2002). Remove the giblets (heart, liver and gizzard) and store the turkey in a <b>covered</b> <b>container</b> in the refrigerator until ready to use. Whole turkeys can be frozen for one year. Complete thawing prior to cooking is a critical step in turkey safety no matter which thawing method is chosen (Lacroix, Li & Powell, 2003). Thawing the turkey in the refrigerator ensures the temperature at {{the surface of the}} bird does not rise above 4 °C while the center thaws. Leaving the plastic wrap on the turkey, place it on a large enough tray or container to catch any raw juice drippings. Place the turkey in the refrigerator. Make sure the raw juices will not contaminate other foods in the refrigerator, especially raw vegetables stored in the crisper under the bottom shelf. Allow 10 hours per kilogram (5 hours per pound) to thaw completely (Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 2002). When thawing the turkey at room temperature (23 - 27 ºC), leave the turkey covered in the plastic wrap or place in a leak proof food grade plastic, or remove the plastic wrap and thaw directly in the roasting pan. A safe way to thaw a turkey at room temperature is to over wrap the plastic with a number of layers of newspaper (approximately 8) (Lee, 1993). This provides an insulating blanket for more even thawing. Make sure that the raw juices do not run on the counter. Do not leave smaller turkeys (4. 7 kg; 10 lb) thawing at room temperature for more than 12 hours or larger turkeys (11. 9 kg; 26 lb) for more than 18 hours (Lee, 1993). Cook immediately. Turkey can also be thawed in the microwave. Cook immediately after defrosting and do not refreeze thawed turkey until it is cooked. It is not necessary to rinse the thawed turkey with water prior to cooking. Although washing the turkey can remove surface bacteria, the recommended roasting temperature easily destroys any bacteria present on th...|$|E

5000|$|The Massachusetts Bottle Bill (Mass. Bills H.2943/S.1588) is a container-deposit {{legislation}} {{dealing with}} recycling in the United States that originally {{passed in the}} U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1982 as the Beverage Container Recovery Law. Implemented in 1983, the law requires containers of carbonated beverages to be returnable with a minimum return value of $0.05. The bottle bill does not <b>cover</b> <b>containers</b> of non-carbonated beverages like water, tea, or sports drinks. The law also establishes the handling fee paid by distributors to redemption centers, $0.0325 per unit as of July 5, 2013, and to retailers $0.0225 per unit.

40|$|Safe {{drinking}} {{water is a}} human birthright as much a birthright as clean air. However, much of the world's population does {{not have access to}} safe {{drinking water}}. As Water and Sanitation is the neglected sector in Pakistan so, most of the households in Pakistan {{do not have access to}} safe drinking water and lack toilets and adequate sanitation systems. This study was aimed at determining the drinking water quality influencing factors and their health outcome. It was conducted in three districts; Rawalpindi, Multan, and Toba tek singh of Punjab province and a sample of 600 married females of age group 20 - 60 were interviewed keeping in view that in most cultures, women are primarily responsible for the use and management of water resources, sanitation and health at the household level. Additionally, focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted to explore detailed information. Univariate analysis provides simple descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) on a large number of questions (indicators) asked in the survey. The main findings at bi-variate analysis depicted a significant relationship between all drinking water influencing factors (i. e. household income, family type, female's education,type of house, number of domestic water sources, nature of drinking water source, main storage system at home, separate water storage container for drinking and cooking purposes, use of measures to improve the drinking water quality, number and structure of toilet at home, and practice of washing hands after using toilet) and health outcome. Multi-variate analysis showed the most important and contributing factors, in explaining the health outcome of households, which were the source of drinking water, family type, separate drinking water container, household income, and mother's education. Multi-variate analysis results showed that the people having low family income had worse health outcomes than people having high family income. Additionally, mother's years of educations were found to be positively co-related with improved family health. The results showed that the increase in number of households having separate water storage container resulted in increase in households getting suffered because of the unhygienic way of water handling. From the focus groups discussions, it was concluded that most of the participants were using two sources (WASA/Municipal, GW) for domestic water at home in addition to this there were other sources used by the participants including water filter plants, tube wells etc. for drinking purpose. Most of the participants were not satisfied with the taste of the water as they have groused of brackish taste of ground water. Only one fourth of the participants were using measures to improve the drinking water quality. Almost every participant had separate storage <b>covered</b> <b>container</b> for drinking and cooking purposes but without faucet as a result their way of handling was unhygienic in view of the fact they dip utensil into the container for usage. Majority of the households were using single toilet. More than half of the participants were used to wash their hands every time after using toilet but in rural areas some of the participants did not take into account hand washing practice regularly as they did not put the soap in their toilet. Keeping in view the above findings it is recommended that Govt. should work on emergent basis in the battle of drinking water shortage and NGO'S should come forward alongwith the govt. in order to make the people aware of adopting measures before drinking water usage to improve its quality. Policy measures aimed at managing anaemia should seek to address all these factors...|$|E
