25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive at the light source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to know a little about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E

60|$|I {{am able to}} go {{one step}} with these last. An affirmative {{assertion}} and its negative are not two independent assertions, connected with each other only as mutually incompatible. That if the negative be true, the affirmative must be false, really is a mere identical proposition; for the negative proposition asserts nothing but the falsity of the affirmative, and has no other sense or meaning whatever. The Principium Contradictionis should therefore put off the ambitious phraseology which gives it {{the air of a}} fundamental antithesis pervading nature, and should be enunciated in the simpler form, that the same proposition can not at the same time be false and true. But I can go no further with the Nominalists; for I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> upon this last as a merely verbal proposition. I consider it to be, like other axioms, one of our first and most familiar generalizations from experience. The original foundation of it I take to be, that Belief and Disbelief are two different mental states, excluding one another. This we know by the simplest observation of our own minds. And if we carry our observation outward, we also find that light and darkness, sound and silence, motion and quiescence, equality and inequality, preceding and following, succession and simultaneousness, any positive phenomenon whatever and its negative, are distinct phenomena, pointedly contrasted, and the one always absent where the other is present. I consider the maxim in question to be a generalization from all these facts.|$|E
6000|$|They can not, however, but {{allow that}} {{the truth of the}} axiom, Two {{straight}} lines can not inclose a space, even if evident independently of experience, is also evident from experience. Whether the axiom needs confirmation or not, it receives confirmation in almost every instant of our lives; since we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at any two straight lines which intersect one another, without seeing that from that point they continue to diverge more and more. Experimental proof crowds in upon us in such endless profusion, and without one instance in which there can be even a suspicion of an exception to the rule, that we should soon have stronger ground for believing the axiom, even as an experimental truth, than we have for almost any of the general truths which we confessedly learn from the evidence of our senses. Independently of a priori evidence, we should certainly believe it with an intensity of conviction far greater than we accord to any ordinary physical truth: and this too at a time of life much earlier than that from which we date almost any part of our acquired knowledge, and much too early to admit of our retaining any recollection of the history of our intellectual operations at that period. Where then is the necessity for assuming that our recognition of these truths has a different origin from the rest of our knowledge, when its existence is perfectly accounted for by supposing its origin to be the same? when the causes which produce belief in all other instances, exist in this instance, and in a degree of strength as much superior to what exists in other cases, as the intensity of the belief itself is superior? The burden of proof lies on the advocates of the contrary opinion: it is for them to point out some fact, inconsistent with the supposition that this part of our knowledge of nature is derived from the same sources as every other part.(71) ...|$|E

When looking at risk-indexes, it is normally the case that company-wide factors initially come to the fore. The Peren-Clement index also starts from this point, but orientates the factors towards a core statement that is relevant in practice.

We consider vision systems which <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>look</b> out of the vehicle to detect and track roads, avoid hitting obstacles or pedestrian, but simultaneously look inside the vehicle to monitor the attentiveness of the driver and even predict her intentions. In this paper, a systems-oriented framework for developing computer vision technology for safer automobiles is presented. We will consider three main components of the system, driver, vehicle, and vehicle surround. We will discuss various issues and ideas for developing models for these main components as well as activities associated with the complex task of safe driving. The paper includes discussion of novel sensory systems and algorithms for capturing not only the dynamic surround information of the vehicle but also the state, intent and activity patterns of drivers...|$|R

60|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis of}} a luminiferous ether, {{in other respects}} not without analogy to that of Descartes, is not in its own nature entirely {{cut off from the}} possibility of direct evidence in its favor. It is well known that the difference between the calculated and the observed times of the periodical return of Encke’s comet, has led to a conjecture that a medium capable of opposing resistance to motion is diffused through space. If this surmise should be confirmed, in the course of ages, by the gradual accumulation of a similar variance {{in the case of the}} other bodies of the solar system, the luminiferous ether would have made a considerable advance toward the character of a vera causa, since the existence would have been ascertained of a great cosmical agent, possessing some of the attributes which the hypothesis assumes; though there would still remain many difficulties, and the identification of the ether with the resisting medium would even, I imagine, give rise to new ones. At present, however, this supposition <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>looked</b> upon as more than a conjecture; the existence of the ether still rests on the possibility of deducing from its assumed laws a considerable number of actual phenomena; and this evidence I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> regard as conclusive, because we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> have, in the case of such an hypothesis, the assurance that if the hypothesis be false it must lead to results at variance with the true facts.|$|R
