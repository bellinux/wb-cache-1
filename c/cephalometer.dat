They published a paper in 1931 called A new X-ray Technique and Its Application to Orthodontia which introduced a technique. This longitudinal study which consisted of cephalometric measurements had 3500 school children aging from birth to adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Cephalometric {{analysis}} {{depends on}} cephalometric radiography to study relationships between bony and soft tissue landmarks {{and can be}} used to diagnose facial growth abnormalities prior to treatment, in the middle of treatment to evaluate progress or at the conclusion of treatment to ascertain that the goals of treatment have been met. A Cephalometric radiograph is a radiograph of the head taken in a <b>Cephalometer</b> (Cephalostat) that is a head-holding device introduced in 1931 by Holly Broadbent Sr. in USA. The <b>Cephalometer</b> is used to obtain standardized and comparable craniofacial images on radiographic films.|$|E
5000|$|Le Bon became {{interested}} in the emerging field of anthropology in the 1870s and travelled throughout Europe, Asia and North Africa. Influenced by Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer and Ernst Haeckel, Le Bon supported biological determinism and a hierarchical view of the races and sexes; after extensive field research, he posited a correlation between cranial capacity and intelligence in Recherches anatomiques et mathématiques sur les variations de volume du cerveau et sur leurs relations avec l'intelligence (1879), which earned him the Godard Prize from the French Academy of Sciences. During his research, he invented a portable <b>cephalometer</b> to aid with measuring the physical characteristics of remote peoples, and in 1881 published a paper, [...] "The Pocket <b>Cephalometer,</b> or Compass of Coordinates", detailing his invention and its application.|$|E

5000|$|A {{native of}} Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Bon {{qualified}} {{as a doctor}} {{of medicine at the}} University of Paris in 1866. He opted against the formal practice of medicine as a physician, instead beginning his writing career the same year of his graduation. He published a number of medical articles and books before joining the French Army after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Defeat in the war coupled with being a first-hand witness to the Paris Commune of 1871 strongly shaped Le Bon's worldview. He then travelled widely, touring Europe, Asia and North Africa. He analysed the peoples and the civilisations he encountered under the umbrella of the nascent field of anthropology, developing an essentialist view of humanity, and invented a portable <b>cephalometer</b> (instrument for measuring the human head) during his travels.|$|E
50|$|Interest in phrenology {{declined}} in Edinburgh in the 1840s. Some of the phrenologists' concerns drifted into the related fields of anthropometry, psychiatry and criminology, and also into degeneration theory as set out by Bénédict Morel, Arthur de Gobineau and Cesare Lombroso. In the 1870s, the eminent social psychologist Gustav Le Bon (1841-1931) invented a <b>cephalometer</b> which allowed {{the measurement of}} cranial capacity and variation. In 1885, the German medical scientist Rudolf Virchow launched a large scale craniometric investigation of the supposed racial stereotypes with decisively negative results for the proponents of racial science. Worldwide, interest in phrenology remained high throughout the nineteenth century, with George Combe's The Constitution of Man being much in demand. Combe devoted his later years to international travel, lecturing on phrenology. He was preparing the ninth edition of The Constitution of Man when he died while receiving hydrotherapy treatment at Moor Park, Farnham.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cephalometer,</b> a {{clinical}} and research instrument {{employed by the}} orthodontic profession to record standardized x-rays of the human skull, has been modified for research work in remote areas where the usual laboratory facilities are not available. This <b>cephalometer</b> was specifically designed to record cephalograms (head radiographs) on the living Nubian population and their extensive skeletal record. The <b>cephalometer</b> consists of a light, portable tripod stand and an aluminum beam to which is attached at one end a Wehmer cephalostat (head holder), {{and on the other}} end an isotope radiation source. Hence, the radiation source and the cephalostat were held in the standard relationship of five feet from source to the mid-saggittal plane of the cranium. Ytterbium- 169, with a half life of 32. 5 days, was used to expose the film. The isotope {{and the use of the}} new Experimental Polaroid X-ray Film permitted the x-ray examination of Nubian skulls with no conventional power source or darkroom facilities...|$|E
40|$|James Willocks (1928 - 2004), a Glasgow obstetrician, was an {{important}} pioneer of obstetric ultrasound and the originator of the first clinically useful technique of fetal cephalometry. He collaborated with Tom Duggan, an engineer, who designed and built an electronic <b>cephalometer</b> {{to be used in}} conjunction with a Kelvin Hughes industrial flaw detector. Working in the Royal Maternity Hospital, Willocks was able to measure the biparietal diameter to an accuracy of better than 2 mm. This major innovation enabled fetal growth in the third trimester to be accurately charted and thus greatly improved the detection of placental insufficiency, as well as the management of antepartum haemorrhage, hypertension and other complications of late pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Craniofacial {{characteristics}} {{are used to}} identify {{similarities and differences between}} human populations or within a single population. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide data on the differences/similarities between two groups of subjects, left-handed and right-handed children, based on the parameters that determine the phenotypic characteristics of the head and face: head dimensions, face dimensions, hair color, eye color and earlobe shape. The study participants included 1354 students aged 7 to 15 years from regular schools of southeastern Serbia. The instruments used include: the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire for handedness determination, the <b>cephalometer,</b> and the questionnaire. 135 students (9. 97 %) were identified as left-handed, and the differences in the observed parameters were recorded between left-handed and right-handed girls in relation to the cephalic index, nasal index, head breadth, face breadth, and eye color...|$|E
40|$|Body mass index, as {{proposed}} by World Health Organisation, is a measure which is widely used, particulary {{in the assessment of}} obesity, but it is also used in evaluation of body development. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to determing whether there are differences in head diameters between underweight, normalweight and overweight fi fth grade primary schoolchildren in Nis. The sample of examinees consisted of 150 pupils (76 underweight, 61 normalweight and 13 overweight) 10 to 11 years of age. The anthropometric status was estimated according to set of 11 variables – one variable for the evaluation of degree of obesity (body mass index) and 10 head dimensions variables (head circumference, neck circumference, head width, morphological face height, face width, nose length, nose width, mandibula width, ear length and mouth width). The anthropometric measurements were accomplished by author himself according to International Biological Programme, and used measurement tools were anthropometer, decimal scale, tape-measure and <b>cephalometer.</b> The differences between examinees were established according to t-test on univariate level, and according to canonical discriminative analysis on multivariate level. The results of the research have shown that there are statistically signifi cant differences between fi fth grade underweight, normalweight and overweight pupils...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The present cephalometric study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the antero-posterior dia-meters of the pharyngeal airway {{in a sample of}} 50 male obstructive sleep apnoea (GSA) patients and a reference sample of 103 male students, and {{to examine the relationship between}} these diameters and the posture of the head and the cervical column. Subjects were recorded in the <b>cephalometer</b> standing with the head in its natural position (mirror position). Pharyngeal airway diameters were measured at seven levels ranging from the maxillary tuberosity to the vallecula of the epiglottis. The largest difference was observed at the level behind the soft palate where the diameter was 50 per cent narrower in the GSA sample than in the reference sample. Extension of the cranio-cervical angle and forward inclination of the cervical column were correlated with an increase in the three most caudal airway diameters in the GSA sample: at the uvula, the root of the tongue, and the epiglottis, but only to increase in the lowest diameter in the reference sample. The findings were considered to reflect a compensatory physiological postural mechanism that serves to maintain airway adequacy in GSA patients in the awake erect posture, most efficiently so at the lowest levels of the oropharyngeal airway...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Cephalometery, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} section of anthropometry examines the facial and cephalic indeces. Since the measurements are affected by geographical factors, gender, age, and race, the obtained results are based on the community under study. Regarding lack of investigations on cephalometry in Birjand, the present study aimed at determining cephalic indexes and standard classification of neurocranium in 15 - 17 year old female students in the city in 2013. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 437 healthy female 15 - 17 year old students in Birjand during 2013, who were selected through cluster sampling. Then, cephalic indices of the subjects were determined using standard Martin Scale <b>Cephalometer,</b> according to Gray's Anatomy Cephalometric Method. The obtained data were collected according were analyzed using SPSS soft ware (V: 13). Results: Mean maximum head length and breadth in the subjects were found to be 177. 6 ± 7. 54 mm and 141. 6 ± 5. 84 mm, respectively. Total neurocranium index was determined 79. 88 ± 4. 64 mm. The head shape of 43 % of the individuals was mesocephalic, % 33 / 4 brachycephalic, % 12 / 12 hyperbrachycephalic and % 11 / 44 dolichocephalic. Conclusion: The present study on cephalometry revealed that adult female students in Birjand city mostly have a mesocephalic phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Displacement of the {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) disc {{causes a}} lateral {{shift of the}} mandible and less-developed and/or distally located mandible unilaterally and bilaterally, respectively, if occurred in growing individuals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate mandibular condylar growth in growing rats after TMJ discectomy and to explore a certain significant role of articular disc in the TMJ in mandibular or cartilaginous growth. Eighteen 4 -week-old Wistar strain male rats were divided into two groups with nine in each group, i. e., rats with TMJ discectomy (discectomy group) and only sham operation (control group). Four weeks after initiating the experiment, morphometric analyses of the mandible were performed using a rat and mouse <b>cephalometer</b> and micro-computed tomography. Then, the mandibular condyles were subjected to histomorphometric analyses. Condylar and mandibular growth was reduced significantly in the discectomy group than in the control group. In the discectomy group, the condyle also became flatter and smaller. In addition, the 4 -layer structure of condylar cartilage was unclear with thicker fibrous and thinner lower hypertrophic layers in the discectomy group when compared to the controls. It is shown that resection of the articular disc substantially affects condylar and mandibular growth in terms of the cartilaginous growth, suggesting that TMJ disc is indispensable for maintaining normal growth of the condyle and mandible, leading to optimal development of the TMJ and the entire mandible...|$|E
