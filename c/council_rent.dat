50|$|Lambeth Council {{claim that}} the plan to {{demolish}} council houses is to enable more council dwellings to be built. They say that 'London is faced with the greatest housing crisis since the Second World War', They also {{say that they are}} paying for 1,800 families to live in temporary accommodation, they have on their books 1,300 families living in severely overcrowded conditions, and 20,000, families on their waiting list. Lambeth Council say that inaction is not an option, and that in contribution to solving the housing crisis they are committed to proving a thousand new dwellings at <b>council</b> <b>rent</b> levels over the next four years. The council say they could achieve this objective through a process of estate regeneration (sic). It is not clear if the proposed 1,000 new dwellings will provide a net increase in dwellings available in Lambeth at <b>council</b> <b>rent</b> levels.|$|E

50|$|In 1919 the Royal Air Force {{built the}} first airport in Vryburg. It was located {{to the north of}} the town and west of the Gert Lubbe Sports Grounds.

The QBI <b>Council</b> <b>rented</b> the property from Mr Addison. The college was able to accommodate 30-40 students at the new site.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} era of Thatcher-Blair consensus, before the deregulation, {{there were no}} market rents, and fair rents in private sector and <b>council</b> <b>rents</b> were both about the same at, in real in terms £(2014) £40pw, or £(2014)170pcm. [...] By the 2000s rents had {{increased}} substantially. There were no longer any fair rents, and the market rent was £(2014) 150pw or £(2014)650pcm. A nearly fourfold increase (See the graph above History of Rents in England by Tenure).|$|R
5|$|In 1995 the Council {{moved into}} the Justus Lipsius building, {{across the road from}} Charlemagne. However, its staff was still increasing, so it {{continued}} to rent the Frère Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions. Staff continued to increase and the <b>Council</b> <b>rented,</b> in addition to owning Justus Lipsius, the Kortenberg, Froissart, Espace Rolin, and Woluwe Heights buildings. Since acquiring the Lex building in 2008, the three aforementioned buildings are no longer in use by the Council services.|$|R
50|$|Nottingham City Council {{had built}} these {{high-rise}} and deck access developments using major contractors, notably Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow, who built in off-the-peg schemes. The flats were accessed along 31 high level walkways. There were defects in these estates and legislative and economic changes were also afflicting disproportionately the communities which lived in <b>council</b> <b>rented</b> accommodation. There was {{dissatisfaction with the}} council as landlord in this period and its repair schedules. By 1981, <b>renting</b> a <b>council</b> house was less than aspirational.|$|R
50|$|He won {{election}} in 1950 as Whitehorse's first mayor. When {{he was first}} elected mayor, Whitehorse was still a small frontier town with little municipal infrastructure and no city hall; the <b>council</b> <b>rented</b> meeting rooms from various commercial companies until taking over a vacated Canadian Army building. Initially challenged by the city's almost complete lack of any significant tax base to fund municipal services, Armstrong soon oversaw a rapid influx of federal government funding after Whitehorse was named the new capital city of Yukon in 1951.|$|R
50|$|The District Council of Stepney was proclaimed on 25 July 1867, {{separating}} {{from the}} original District Council of Payneham. It was divided into five wards: Hackney, Stepney, Payneham, Marden and Stepney North. On 27 February 1868, the original Payneham council was renamed the District Council of Campbelltown, and when {{the western part of}} the Stepney council was severed to form the Corporate Town of St Peters on 30 August 1883, the remainder of the Stepney council assumed the District Council of Payneham name. The <b>council</b> <b>rented</b> offices at the Payneham Institute, and met at the Masonic Lodge Hall.|$|R
50|$|The Kaiwarra toll gate, then {{within the}} {{jurisdiction}} of Hutt County Council, imposed a tax on all traffic entering Wellington. The gate was on part of the proposed new borough's district and if the proposal was approved {{there could be no}} more tolls collected there by Hutt County. This was a major incentive {{in the formation of the}} new borough. Hutt County did erect new toll gates in the Ngauranga Gorge and on the Hutt Road but these placements did not affect local Onslow and Wellington traffic to the same extent. The new <b>council</b> <b>rented</b> out the old toll-collector's house.|$|R
50|$|In {{the era of}} the Thatcher-Blair {{consensus}} {{the rates}} were abolished, and in the UK there is now no property tax based on ownership, a situation almost unique in the OECD. Further, councils lost the power to set rents. Instead, rents for housing associations and council houses are now set by central government, and far from being subsidized they are used to provide a revenue stream for social housing. This has had the consequence that, in real terms, <b>council</b> <b>rents</b> have doubled, from under £(2014)40pw in 1980, to £(2012) 80pw in 2012, or £(2012)173pcm to £(2012)346pcm.|$|R

Shortly after Latvia regained independence 1991, market director Leonīds Lapoško showed that the market was in dire condition, especially underground. On January 3, 1995, the city council established stock company Riga Central Market (a/s Rīgas Centrāltirgus). In the next half year it merged with Riga Market Company (Rīgas tirgus) to form a combined location between the central market's pavilions and outside street bazaar. In August 1998 Riga City <b>Council</b> <b>rented</b> the outside market territory until 2045.|$|R

50|$|A large house-building {{programme}} {{was carried}} out {{with the intention of}} providing millions of people with high-quality homes. A housing bill passed in 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in England and Wales. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down <b>council</b> <b>rents.</b> Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee Government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over 1,000,000 new homes were built between 1945-51 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.|$|R
50|$|It was {{established}} by the District Councils Act 1887, which took effect from 5 January 1888. The creation of the council followed resident advocacy {{for the creation of}} a local government in Terowie in 1887. The council comprised the cadastral Hundreds of Ketchowla, Terowie and Wonna at its creation. The <b>council</b> <b>rented</b> offices in the Terowie Institute building from 1888 to 1890 before purchasing an Anglican church which the congregation had outgrown; the former church was used as council chambers for the remainder of the council's existence. It gained a portion of the Hundred of Whyte in 1899, resulting in an increase from three to four numbered wards. The council's public works included roadworks throughout the district and kerbing, footpaths, stormwater drainage and tree planting in Terowie township, with more limited works in Yarcowie.|$|R
50|$|The {{village had}} a total {{resident}} population of 282 in 129 households {{at the time of}} the 2001 census.

50|$|As only a {{third of}} the seats were being elected the Labour party was {{guaranteed}} to keep its majority on the council.

25|$|Security {{changes in}} Washington, D.C., after the September 11, 2001, {{terrorist}} attacks significantly affected Old Ebbitt Grill for a while. The restaurant {{was forced to}} close for two days when streets near the White House were closed. Over the next two weeks, the restaurant lost half its business (normally 2,000 customers a day, most of them politicians and businesspeople). After First Lady Laura Bush began patronizing the restaurant, business soon returned to normal. The Beltway sniper attacks of fall 2002 did not affect business, which continued to hold steady through February 2003, a time of high alert and anxiety. Due to security restrictions in 2004, Old Ebbitt Grill was nearly prevented from its traditional practice of selling coffee and hot chocolate to spectators watching the inaugural parade, in this case for the landmark election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. That year the Democratic Leadership <b>Council</b> <b>rented</b> the entire restaurant for a private party on Inauguration Day.|$|R
