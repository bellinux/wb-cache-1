Moreover, the step-wise loading scheme required low capacity individual evaporators and higher plant capacity of the gas-handling unit (N- 2 generator and CO 2 scrubber), as compared to the batch-wise product loading.

50|$|In 1939, under Eaves' direction, {{the first}} <b>CA</b> <b>storage</b> {{facility}} in the Western Hemisphere was constructed in Port Williams. Following the Second World War, Eaves returned to Kentville to continue his innovative work in atmospheric storage. By the 1950s, common practice had apples stored in refrigerated rooms lined with gas-impermeable aluminum foil sealed with Vaseline. Recommended storage conditions were 3.5 degrees Celsius, 7% carbon dioxide and 14% oxygen in which apples could be kept in good condition for 6 months. Since regular atmosphere is about 21% oxygen and <1% carbon dioxide and the respiration of the fruit adds 1 mole of carbon dioxide for every mole of oxygen produced, the combined value of oxygen and carbon dioxide will equal 21% in a sealed storage room of fruit, if only respiration is allowed to alter the room atmosphere. Once carbon dioxide increased above 7%, the benefits began to disappear as carbon dioxide toxicity began to occur. However, controlling carbon dioxide levels meant flushing with outside air or using expensive caustic soda, a skin and eye irritant.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that changes in cytosolic free Ca 2 + {{play a role in}} a number of neutrophil responses such as cell shape change and oxidase activation. The release of intracellular stored Ca 2 + occurs with stimuli that either act by occupancy of seven membrane-spanning domain receptors or those which act by receptor cross-linking. Here, two distinct <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> and release sites have been identified in neutrophils. Using chlortetracycline fluorescence as an indicator of <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage,</b> two separate <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> sites have been identified. One site was located peripherally under the plasma membrane and the other was in the juxtanuclear space. Confocal imaging of Fluo 3 -loaded neutrophils demonstrated that the central <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> site released <b>Ca</b> 2 + in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, whereas engagement and clustering of CD 11 b/CD 18 integrins causes Ca 2 + release from the peripheral stores. The release sites also correlated with organelles that stained with DiOC 6 (3). Localized phototoxicity generated by DiOC 6 (3) excitation resulted in inhibition of the release of stored Ca 2 +, which was selective for the stimulus used.

The model {{consists of three}} interacting sub-models for the prediction of the transient behavior of the processes in the three units, namely, the cool room, the refrigeration system and the gas-handling unit. Several modules representing each of the components in these units were developed based on energy and mass balances.

The modules were implemented in an object-oriented computational environment, (EcosimPro) which can handle both continuous and discrete events.

In this doctoral research, we investigated the physiological and metabolic responses of ‘Jonagold’ apples during initiation of CA, long term <b>CA</b> <b>storage</b> and shelf life afterwards. The main objective was to unravel the adaptation mechanism of apples to CA stress by profiling the metabolic changes in primary metabolism. The result showed apples adapt to <b>CA</b> <b>storage</b> by changing their primary metabolism in an ethylene dependent manner. The adaptation mechanism was linked to metabolites in the TCA cycle and amino acids associated with it. Suppression of ethylene action also affected this adaptation mechanism to some extent.

Here, we used calreticulin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts {{to examine the}} function of calreticulin as a regulator of Ca 2 + homeostasis. In cells without calreticulin, the ER has a lower capacity for <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage,</b> although the free ER luminal Ca 2 + concentration is unchanged. Calreticulin-deficient cells show inhibited Ca 2 + release in response to bradykinin, yet they release Ca 2 + upon direct activation with the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3). These cells fail to produce a measurable level of InsP 3 upon stimulation with bradykinin, likely because the binding of bradykinin to its cell surface receptor is impaired. Bradykinin binding and bradykinin-induced Ca 2 + release are both restored by expression of full-length calreticulin and the N + P domain of the protein. Expression of the P + C domain of calreticulin does not affect bradykinin-induced Ca 2 + release but restores the ER <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> capacity. Our results indicate that calreticulin {{may play a role}} in folding of the bradykinin receptor, which affects its ability to initiate InsP 3 -dependent Ca 2 + release in calreticulin-deficient cells.

Production of hexyl acetate and butyl acetate after <b>CA</b> <b>storage</b> decreased significantly compared to apples stored in RA, along with perceived intensities. 2 -Methylbutyl acetate only decreased in apples stored 20 weeks in CA. Other esters with an apple odor were butyl 2 -methylbutyrate and hexyl 2 -methylbutyrate. Methyl 2 -methylbutyrate, ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate and propyl 2 -methylbutyrate had sweet, fruity, and berry-like odors. Ester production after <b>CA</b> <b>storage</b> decreased at different rates.

Ascorbic acid maps show a strong asymmetrical distribution and illustrate that most brown tissue was located in the contour line of 0. 4 mg 100 g(- 1) FW, which supports the 0. 37 mg 100 g- 1 FW threshold value.

40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondria are dynamic organelles {{that move}} along actin filaments, {{and serve as}} calcium stores in plant cells. The {{positioning}} and dynamics of mitochondria depend on membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, {{but it is not}} clear whether microfilament cytoskeleton has a direct effect on mitochondrial function and <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage.</b> Therefore, we designed a series of experiments to clarify the effects of actin filaments on mitochondrial <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage,</b> cytoplasmic <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +] c), and the interaction between mitochondrial Ca 2 + and cytoplasmic Ca 2 + in Arabidopsis root hairs. Results In this study, we found that treatments with latrunculin B (Lat-B) and jasplakinolide (Jas), which depolymerize and polymerize actin filaments respectively, decreased membrane potential and Ca 2 + stores in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis root hairs. Simultaneously, these treatments induced an instantaneous increase of cytoplasmic Ca 2 +, followed by a continuous decrease. All of these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with cyclosporin A (Cs A), a representative blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Moreover, we found there was a Ca 2 + concentration gradient in mitochondria from the tip to the base of the root hair, and this gradient could be disrupted by actin-acting drugs. Conclusions Based on these results, we concluded that the disruption of actin filaments caused by Lat-B or Jas promoted irreversible opening of the mPTP, resulting in mitochondrial Ca 2 + release into the cytoplasm, and consequent changes in [Ca 2 +] c. We suggest that normal polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments are essential for mitochondrial <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> in root hairs. </p...|$|R

In this study we examined the effects of junctate over-expression by generating a transgenic mouse model which over-expresses junctate in skeletal muscle.

There is, however, a residual ATP-dependent Ca uptake that is insensitive to the aforementioned poisons; this (nonmitochondrial) Ca uptake is blocked by tetracaine, mersalyl and A- 23187. Moreover, A- 23187 rapidly releases previously accumulated Ca from these (nonmitochondrial) storage sites, whereas the Ca chelator, EGTA, does not. The proteolytic enzyme, trypsin, spares the mitochondria but inactivates the nonmitochondrial Ca uptake mechanism.

40|$|AbstractThe {{endoplasmic}} reticulum {{is a major}} organelle in all eukaryotic cells which performs multiple functions including protein and lipid synthesis and sorting, drug metabolism, and <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> and release. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}}, and its specialized muscle counterpart the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is {{the largest and most}} extensive of <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> organelle in eukaryotic cells, often occupying in excess of 10 % of the cell volume. There are three major components of <b>Ca</b> 2 + <b>storage</b> organelles which mediate their major functions: Ca 2 + uptake, mediated by pumps and exchangers; storage enhanced by luminal Ca 2 + binding proteins, and Ca 2 + mobilization mediated by specific ion channels. Ca 2 + mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum plays a central role in Ca 2 + signaling. Through Ca 2 + release channels in its membrane, the pervading and plastic structure of the endoplasmic reticulum allows Ca 2 + release to be rapidly targeted to specific cytoplasmic sites across the whole cell. That several endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release channels are also activated by Ca 2 + itself, contributes to endoplasmic reticulum membrane excitability which is the principal basis for generating spatio-temporal complex cellular Ca 2 + signals, allowing specific processes to be regulated by this universal messenger. In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum forms discrete junctions with the plasma membrane and membranes of organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes, forming nanodomains at their interfaces that play critical roles in Ca 2 + signaling during key cellular processes such as cellular bioenergetics, apoptosis and autophagy. At these junctions key Ca 2 + transport and regulatory processes come into play, and a recurring theme in this review is the often tortuous paths in identifying these mechanisms unequivocally.

40|$|Optimizing the {{physiological}} state of harvested fruit (cultivar-specific harvesting indices) and optimizing <b>storage</b> conditions (cultivar-specific <b>CA</b> and ULO <b>storage</b> procedures) were investigated {{in a set}} of four apple cultivars. Analyses of various fruit ripening parameters showed that starch hydrolysis point and Streif index (firmness/(starch hydrolysis point * soluble solid concentration)) were correlated with internal ethylene concentration (IEC) at harvest. Thus, the optimal harvesting time can be deduced from the starch index in two cultivars (Rubinola and Santana) while the Streif index is more accurate for the other two cultivars (Ingrid Marie and Karin Schneider). By contrast, firmness, soluble solids concentration and skin color are not useful due to their sensitivity to weather conditions and light intensity. Optimization of <b>CA</b> and ULO <b>storage</b> conditions maintained fruit quality and reduced amount of fungal decay. Storage of these four cultivars {{in a wide range of}} pCO 2 achieved slight additional improvement in all cultivars except Ingrid Marie. ULO conditions (1. 0 kPa O 2 and 2. 0 kPa CO 2) can be recommended for Karin Schneider and Santana and ULO conditions (1. 0 kPa O 2 and 3. 0 kPa CO 2) can be recommended for Rubinola...|$|R
