25|$|A sample {{containing}} {{inorganic cyanide}} is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt {{absorbed in the}} basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that {{is proportional to the}} cyanide concentration. This <b>colorimetric</b> <b>method</b> following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, {{have been found to be}} prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a <b>colorimetric</b> <b>method</b> used in clinical chemistry to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and picric acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the Al concentration in soil solution is an important diagnostic tool in studies of Al toxicity in acid soils. Where organic residues have been applied as améliorants of Al toxicity, {{it is necessary to}} measure both the total soluble and monomeric Al concentrations in order to estimate the degree of Al complexation. Determination by ICPAES provides a measure of total Al without discrimination between chemical forms, and thus may include solid-phase Al present as micro-particulates that have passed through a 0. 22 pm filter. <b>Colorimetric</b> <b>methods,</b> which do not include an acidification step, discriminate against micro-particulates, but do not measure all Al present as soluble organic forms and thus underestimate total soluble Al. Acidification of soil solutions to decomplex organically bound Al, and thus permit its measurement by <b>colorimetric</b> <b>methods,</b> results in dissolution of micro-particulates and overestimation of total soluble Al. Filtering to 0. 025 pm eliminated microparticulates, thereby removing a source of error. However, this process is time consuming and thus unsuitable for routine use...|$|R

50|$|Silica {{analysis}} in UPW typically includes determination of reactive and total silica. Due {{to the complexity}} of silica chemistry, the form of silica measured is defined by the photometric (<b>colorimetric)</b> <b>method</b> as molybdate-reactive silica. Those forms of silica that are molybdate-reactive include dissolved simple silicates, monomeric silica and silicic acid, and an undetermined fraction of polymeric silica. Total silica determination in water employs high resolution ICPMS, GFAA (graphite furnace atomic absorption), and the photometric method combined with silica digestion. For many natural waters, a measurement of molybdate-reactive silica by this test method provides a close approximation of total silica, and, in practice, the <b>colorimetric</b> <b>method</b> is frequently substituted for other more time-consuming techniques. However, total silica analysis becomes more critical in UPW, where the presence of colloidal silica is expected due to silica polymerization in the ion exchange columns. Colloidal silica is considered more critical than dissolved in the electronic industry due to the bigger impact of nano-particles in water on the semiconductor manufacturing process. Sub-ppb (parts per billion) levels of silica make it equally complex for both reactive and total silica analysis, making the choice of total silica test often preferred.|$|E
