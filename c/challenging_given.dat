The 96th Street cut-and-cover station was about [...] deep, {{making it one of}} the shallowest stations being built on the line; the shallowness was so that the new line could align with the preexisting piece of subway tunnel built in the 1970s between 99th and 105th Streets. Stations at the two mined stations are between [...] deep in rock. The construction method that was used was supposed to ease concerns for buildings above the station sites, because only two shafts were required for excavation.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Mantle portrayed Tommy Cooper in the {{successful}} stage entertainment show Jus' Like That! A Night Out With Tommy Cooper, which {{appeared at the}} Edinburgh Festival. To train for the role, Mantle mastered many of Cooper's magic tricks, studying under Geoffrey Durham for several months. Mantle was thrilled {{to take on the}} role as Cooper is his ultimate comic hero, saying [...] "It's such a big privilege playing Tommy – I genuinely love the man. He is one of the funniest comedians this country has ever produced. So this whole tour for me is just an immense thrill." [...] Mantle considered the role highly <b>challenging,</b> <b>given</b> that he had to combine several aspects of skill, from the magic tricks to the joke-telling, the physical comedy, and emulating the distinctive voice. Some people initially questioned the suitability of Mantle for the character, given that he was well known for playing a solemn doctor in Casualty, but he and the play were warmly received by critics. South Wales Echo called it a [...] "compelling, funny and moving play" [...] and said [...] "Clive, best known for his role as Dr Mike Barratt in Casualty, has had to get used to wearing a fez and conjuring up some magic for his title role of Jus' Like That! A Night Out With Tommy Cooper." ...|$|E

Measurement in education is inherently <b>challenging</b> <b>given</b> the complexity of constructs, diversity of populations, and the potential within- and between-population differences of the constructs that we attempt to measure.

5000|$|This project {{stems from}} the {{recognition}} that outdoor sculpture is by nature particularly prone to damage but that {{research in this area}} was lacking. Conservation of outdoor painted sculpture works is especially <b>challenging,</b> <b>given</b> the uncontrolled, and often harsh, environments to which works are constantly exposed. Collaborators on the project took a step back and looked at current interests, needs, and practices in the conservation of modern and contemporary outdoor painted sculpture.|$|E
50|$|Although the Ceredigion Coast Path is {{a long-distance}} path, it {{can easily be}} split into smaller {{sections}}. Some of the sections are <b>challenging,</b> <b>given</b> the undulating nature of the path, {{but some of the}} flatter sections are quite suitable for walkers of lesser or limited ability. Recently, for instance, work completed between Aberporth and Tresaith has re-routed the path to avoid steps.

50|$|The 2007-8 Financial Crisis has had {{a serious}} impact on the {{compliance}} field, highlighting the need for radical reforms to ensure the solvency and transparency of firms in times of economic fluctuations as the implementation of globally agreed principles and standards remains highly <b>challenging,</b> <b>given</b> there are no legal powers to enforce or settle disputes between jurisdictions at the global level. The financial crisis in that respect created an opportunity for financial professionals to provide much needed context and clarity to investors.|$|E
50|$|Armed non-state actors operate without {{state control}} and are {{involved}} in internal and trans-border conflicts. The activity of such groups in armed conflicts adds layers of complexity to traditional conflict management and resolution. These conflicts are often fought not only between non-state actors and states, but also between multiple NSA groups. Interventions in such conflicts is particularly <b>challenging</b> <b>given</b> the fact that international law and norms governing {{the use of force}} for intervention or peacekeeping purposes was primarily written {{in the context of the}} nation-state.|$|E
50|$|The EU {{implemented}} regulations specifically governing co-existence and traceability. Traceability {{has become}} commonplace {{in the food}} and feed supply chains of most countries, but GMO traceability is more <b>challenging</b> <b>given</b> strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing. Since 2001, conventional and organic food and feedstuffs can contain up to 0.9% of authorised modified material without carrying a GMO label.

5000|$|A lightly built cursorial animal, its phylogenetic {{position}} has been debated; as different analyses have {{found it to be}} either the basal-most ornithodiran, the sister-taxon to Pterosauria, or a basal member of Avemetatarsalia that lies outside of Ornithodira. In the phylogenetic analyses conducted by Nesbitt et al. (2017) Scleromochlus was recovered either as a basal member of Dinosauromorpha or as a non-aphanosaurian, non-pterosaur early avemetatarsalian. However, the authors stressed that scoring Scleromochlus was <b>challenging</b> <b>given</b> the small size and poor preservation of the fossils, and stated that it could not be scored for many of the important characters that optimize near the base of Avemetatarsalia.|$|E

50|$|Tali Karng is {{difficult}} to access, with the quickest route a hard five-hour walk, from MacFarlanes Saddle via the Wellington Plains track. This involves an 800 m descent, either via the Gillios Track or the Riggalls Spur track. Riggalls Spur has the only view of the lake from Echo Point, but is a little overgrown. An alternative access to the lake is the 15 km walk up the Wellington River. This involves 15 river crossings, and can be quite dangerous, particularly under high river conditions. The final passage through the Valley of destruction can be particularly <b>challenging,</b> <b>given</b> the small boulders which must be traversed. This is a difficult area for camping with limited space for all but small tents.|$|E
