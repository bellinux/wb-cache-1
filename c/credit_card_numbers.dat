25|$|The {{company had}} a data breach in September 2014. One {{major reason for}} the data breach was the {{practice}} of entering <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> directly into computers at the service-desk and pro-desk, and in specialty departments including flooring, kitchen cabinets, appliances, and millwork, rather than using POS credit card terminals directly. The practice was stopped, and Home Depot offered a year of free credit monitoring through AllClearID for any customers who requested it. There were also reports of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> being stolen when used to make purchases on Homedepot.com.|$|E
25|$|As {{worldwide}} {{sales of}} smartphones began exceeding those of feature phones, the NSA {{decided to take}} advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone combines a myriad of data that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behavior, interests, location, photos and <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> and passwords.|$|E
25|$|In fact, many sellers {{could not}} qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a {{commercial}} credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.|$|E
5000|$|A {{controlled}} payment {{number is}} an alias for a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> {{with a limited}} number of transactions, and an expiration date between two and twelve months from the issue date. This [...] "alias" [...] number is indistinguishable from an ordinary <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> and the user's actual <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number</b> is never revealed to the merchant.|$|R

5000|$|For example, when {{testing a}} program that takes a user's {{personal}} details and verifies their <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of [...] "***" [...] as a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number</b> would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card was valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter [...] "***" [...] as a placeholder <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number</b> while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.|$|R
25|$|WikiLeaks {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia, and for criticising the Panama Papers' exposé of businesses and individuals with offshore bank accounts. WikiLeaks {{has also been}} criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> details of suicide attempts, and other sensitive personal information.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 2008, President George W. Bush {{signed the}} Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act (H.R. 4008) into law. The {{bipartisan}} bill, which Bachmann cosponsored with Congressman Tim Mahoney (D-Fla.), removes statutory damages {{for violations of}} a 2003 federal law prohibiting merchants from printing consumers' <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> and expiration dates on sales receipts, in order to end class-action lawsuits aimed at businesses that violated the law.|$|E
25|$|Arrest and {{indictment}} of Max Ray Butler, {{co-founder of the}} Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked over the Internet into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers and sold {{the tens of thousands of}} <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> that he acquired in the process.|$|E

25|$|E-waste {{presents}} a potential security threat {{to individuals and}} exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. <b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> private financial data, account information, and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams. Electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security {{institutions such as the}} Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Transportation Security Administration, and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.|$|E
25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{which can be}} recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
25|$|Operation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspects—located across eight U.S. {{states and}} six countries—were arrested {{on charges of}} {{identity}} theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was {{in the hundreds of}} millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cyber-criminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.|$|E

50|$|Adding {{encryption}} to such applications {{might be}} challenging if data models {{are to be}} changed, as it usually involves changing field length limits or data types. For example, output from a typical block cipher would turn <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number</b> into a hexadecimal (e.g., 34 bytes, hexadecimal digits) or Base64 value (e.g. , 24 bytes, alphanumeric and special characters), which will break any existing applications expecting the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>number</b> to be a 16-digit number.|$|R

25|$|In July 2009, a {{confidential}} cable originating from the United States Department of State, and under United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's name, ordered US diplomats {{to spy on}} Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other top UN officials. The intelligence information the diplomats were ordered to gather included biometric information (which apparently included DNA, fingerprints, and iris scans), passwords, and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It also included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> frequent flyer account numbers, and work schedules. The targeted human intelligence was requested in {{a process known as}} the National Humint Collection Directive, and was aimed at foreign diplomats of US allies as well.|$|E
25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E

2500|$|Agent-assisted {{automation}} {{refers to}} automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. There {{are two basic}} types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming {{that makes it easier}} for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it {{did not have to be}} entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> or CVV codes ...|$|E
2500|$|The cost to {{providers}} of search engines is not insignificant: [...] "The secondary consequence of spamming is that search engine indexes are inundated with useless pages, increasing {{the cost of}} each processed query". The methods of spammers are likewise costly. Because spamming contravenes {{the vast majority of}} ISPs' acceptable-use policies, most spammers have for many years gone to some trouble to conceal the origins of their spam. Email, Usenet, and instant-message spam are often sent through insecure proxy servers belonging to unwilling third parties. Spammers frequently use false names, addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information to set up [...] "disposable" [...] accounts at various Internet service providers. In some cases, they have used falsified or stolen <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> to pay for these accounts. This allows them to quickly move from one account to the next as each one is discovered and shut down by the host ISPs.|$|E
2500|$|Tor {{has been}} {{described}} by The Economist, in relation to Bitcoin and Silk Road, as being [...] "a dark corner of the web". It has been targeted by the American National Security Agency and the British GCHQ signals intelligence agencies, albeit with marginal success, and more successfully by the British National Crime Agency in its Operation Notarise. At the same time, GCHQ has been using a tool named [...] "Shadowcat" [...] for [...] "end-to-end encrypted access to VPS over SSH using the TOR network". Tor can be used for anonymous defamation, unauthorized news leaks of sensitive information, copyright infringement, distribution of illegal sexual content, selling controlled substances, weapons, and stolen <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> money laundering, bank fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft and the exchange of counterfeit currency; the black market utilizes the Tor infrastructure, at least in part, in conjunction with Bitcoin. It has also been used to brick IoT devices.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2014, {{the online}} {{publication}} The Verge {{reported that a}} secret Uber project, called [...] "Operation SLOG" [...] – which recruits members {{with the assistance of}} TargetCW, a San Diego, California-based employment agency – appeared to be an extension of the company's activities in relation to Lyft. As reported, on July 9, 2014, following Lyft's expansion into New York City, Uber sent an email offering what it called a [...] "huge commission opportunity" [...] to several contractors based on the [...] "personal hustle" [...] of the participants. Those who responded met with Uber marketing managers who attempted, according to one of the contractors, to create a [...] "street team" [...] to gather intelligence about Lyft's launch plans and recruit their drivers to Uber. Recruits were given two Uber-branded iPhones (one a backup, in case the person was identified by Lyft) and a series of valid <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> to create dummy Lyft accounts. After being contacted for comment, Target CW warned its contractors against talking to the media, stating that it represented a violation of a non-disclosure agreement they signed.|$|E

Home Depot offered their affected customers free one-year credit monitoring service from AllClear ID. Also in their press release, they made sure to emphasize {{that there was no}} evidence to suggest that online customers were affected by the breach. On September 18, 2014, Home Depot released a statement saying that the hackers obtained a total of [...] {{as a result of the}} breach. Since the breach, Home Depot has rolled out new encryption technology for their cash registers and self-checkout systems to protect customers.

2500|$|On April 20, 2011, Sony {{shut down}} the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a {{prolonged}} interval, revealing on April 23 that {{this was due to}} [...] "an external intrusion on our system". Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs. It also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained. Additionally, the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number {{from the back of the}} credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a [...] "Welcome Back" [...] program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.|$|E
