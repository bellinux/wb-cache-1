With <b>construction</b> costs increasing due to more detailed design work, <b>construction</b> inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional £7.2million in March 2016, raising {{the total cost of}} the project to £44.2million. <b>Construction</b> was delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{stochastic}} seismic {{response and}} time-history seismic response analysis， Dynamic response {{laws of the}} high slope <b>constructions</b> by three real seismic waves and a synthetic seismic wave were studied using finite- element method, discussing the differentiation and relation between the high slope <b>constructions</b> and ground <b>constructions.</b> The {{results show that the}} dynamic response on high slope <b>constructions</b> are less intensive than ground <b>constructions</b> due to delaying effect of high slope soil acts on the structure, but its internal force stronger than ground <b>constructions</b> as the pile in high slope <b>constructions</b> are anti-sliding and bearing. Results are conducive to the seismic design of high slope <b>constructions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} three-participant &# 8216;give&# 8217; <b>constructions</b> in ten Papuan {{languages of}} the Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) family. Generally lacking {{a class of}} simple ditransitive root verbs, TAP languages express &# 8216;give&# 8217; events by means of biclausal <b>constructions</b> (&# 8216;take X then give Y&# 8217;), serial verb <b>constructions</b> (&# 8216;take X give Y&# 8217;), or particle-verb <b>constructions</b> originating in serial verb <b>constructions.</b> In this paper, {{we focus on the}} syntactic treatment of the gift (T), since it, unlike the other participants in &# 8216;give&# 8217; <b>constructions,</b> displays considerable diversity across the TAP languages. Through the study of the synchronic variation in TAP &# 8216;give&# 8217; <b>constructions,</b> we reconstruct the syntactic <b>constructions</b> from which the various modern <b>constructions</b> have developed, and sketch the grammaticalization paths that have led to them...|$|R
50|$|A popular idea, {{introduced}} in Anderson (1976), {{is that some}} <b>constructions</b> universally favor accusative alignment while others are more flexible. In general, behavioral <b>constructions</b> (control, raising, relativization) are claimed to favor nominative-accusative alignment while coding <b>constructions</b> (especially case <b>constructions)</b> do not show any alignment preferences. This idea underlies early notions of ‘deep’ vs. ‘surface’ (or ‘syntactic’ vs. ‘morphological’) ergativity (e.g. Comrie 1978; Dixon 1994): many languages have surface ergativity only (ergative alignments only in their coding <b>constructions,</b> like case or agreement) but not in their behavioral <b>constructions</b> {{or at least not}} in all of them. Languages with deep ergativity (with ergative alignment in behavioral <b>constructions)</b> appear to be less common.|$|R
5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began <b>construction</b> planning in 1993. <b>Construction</b> of the lake in 1995 with <b>construction</b> of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment <b>construction,</b> the <b>construction</b> of the dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. <b>Construction</b> of the lake was the largest <b>construction</b> project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two types}} of resultative <b>constructions,</b> i. e., weak and strong resultative <b>constructions.</b> It has been {{observed}} that some languages lack strong resultative <b>constructions,</b> while others have both types. In this paper, I demonstrate that the crosslinguistic difference in the existence of strong resultative <b>constructions</b> can be captured in terms of the syntactic category of the result phrase: the result phrase must be realized as a PP in a language if and only if the language lacks strong resultative <b>constructions.</b> Based on this observation, I propose that weak and strong resultative <b>constructions</b> have different syntactic structures: both APs and PPs are licensed as the result phrases in weak resultative <b>constructions,</b> while only APs are licensed in strong resultative <b>constructions.</b> I also argue that Germanic languages allow PPs to be the result phrases even in strong resultative <b>constructions,</b> due to the special status of Germanic prepositions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we unify and extend {{many of the}} known results on the {{dimensions}} of deterministic and random Cantor-like sets in R n using their symbolic representation.

We consider Markov <b>constructions,</b> general symbolic <b>constructions,</b> nonstationary <b>constructions,</b> random <b>constructions</b> (determined by a very general distribution), and combinations of the above.
