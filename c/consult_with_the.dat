5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet {{was one of the}} bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king ordered him to leave the kingdom, with the support of most of the bishops and nobility.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to co-operate on hill {{design and}} event organisation, the venues at Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica formed the KOP working group in 1962 (KOP being an {{abbreviation}} of Kulm/Oberstdorf/Planica).

In 1953, Kulm hosted the first International Ski Flying Week, which would be the premier event in ski flying until 1972.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E

The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, {{there are indications that}} the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|With legal appeals, {{petitions}} from {{subjects and}} judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were careful to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From {{the reign of}} Augustus (27BC–AD14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship {{gave rise to the}} earliest law school system of the Western world, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Governor of Massachusetts, Endicott Peabody, {{appointed}} McCormack as Chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In October 1965, he {{was appointed}} chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), with a $125,000 salary. To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director.|$|E

5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
5|$|Saving Mr. Banks depicts several {{events that}} differ from {{recorded}} accounts. The premise of the script—that Walt Disney had to convince P.L. Travers {{to hand over the}} film rights, including the scene when he finally persuades her—is fictionalized, as Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when Travers arrived to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Disney staff. Disney, in fact, left Burbank to vacation in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. Therefore, many of the dialogue scenes between Travers and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although Travers was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditions of}} a sejmik {{can be traced}} to the {{institution}} of the wiec that actually predates the Polish state. They originated from gatherings of nobility, formed for military and consultative purposes. Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks, with some proposed dates being 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce) and 1454 (the Nieszawa Statutes). Geographically, sejmiks first arose in central Poland (Greater Poland province). Over the next century or so, they spread to other provinces of Poland, and finally, by the 16th century, to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, in a privilege granted to the szlachta (Polish nobility) by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, when the king agreed to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nobility concerning certain decisions. Casimir's recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the magnates, and counteract it with the middle nobility.|$|E

5|$|There {{are seven}} {{committees}} of the National Assembly. Committee membership {{is determined by}} the National Assembly. They are responsible for the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. The committees provide the National Assembly and its Standing Committee with their opinions on the legislative programme. The committees supervise and conduct investigations within their respective competency and exercise powers which are stipulated by law. The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy. The Chairman of the Ethnic Council has to attend meetings of the Government which concern ethnic policy. The powers of the Ethnic Council are comparable to those of the committees.|$|E
5|$|They {{considered}} {{creating an}} Allied plan {{to counter the}} danger, but Whiteley {{said that he would}} have to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British command before this could be approved. Colonel G. S. Eyster from G-3 was then ordered to prepare an American plan, under the codename Operation Peppermint. Further briefings were given to Admiral Harold Stark, and Lieutenant Generals Carl Spaatz and John C. H. Lee, and Eisenhower also wrote to Lieutenant General Hastings Ismay, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill to inform the British Chiefs of Staff, but no British or American commanders actually participating in Operation Overlord were informed. The British subsequently adopted a similar plan to Operation Peppermint, and SHAEF assumed responsibility for coordinating the British and American efforts. Scientific assistance was provided by the Cavendish Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred (died 24 March 832) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Nothing {{is known of}} his life prior to 803, when he {{attended}} a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings– Coenwulf and Ceolwulf– over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> papacy and was deposed from office {{for a number of}} years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were somewhat better with the new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck.|$|E
