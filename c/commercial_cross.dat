40|$|A {{multifunctional}} electrodialytic generator (EDG) for capillary {{ion chromatography}} (CIC) is described. The same device can generate acidic, basic or saline eluents. Two oppositely charged ion exchange beads {{are used to}} fabricate the EDG; the dual ion exchanger configuration ensures the production of gas-free eluent, obviating the need of a gas removal device used with single ion exchanger EDG's. The ability of the same EDG to produce different eluents is governed solely by {{the choice of the}} respective feed solutions; this is presently demonstrated by generation of diverse eluents such as Na(2) CO(3) /NaHCO(3). CH(3) SO(3) H, and KNO(3). The EDG is implemented simply in a <b>commercial</b> <b>cross</b> fitting and has been tested up pressures to 2000 psi. Under typical operating conditions, the zero current concentration (open circuit penetration, OCP) is negligible. The generated eluent concentration linearly increases with applied current with a slope that is essentially Faradaic. The device permits both isocratic and gradient operation with good reproducibility, as demonstrated by the analysis of anions using HCO(3) -/CO(3) (2 -) EDG. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The genetic {{variability}} {{and genetic}} {{relationship of the}} fifteen sheep breeds were studied. The genotypes of 14 indigenous Chinese sheep breeds and one crossbreed of wild sheep were investigated using 13 microsatellite DNA markers recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Society of Animal Genetics (ISAG) through PCR. The allele frequency, heterozygosity and Genetic Differentiation Index (F st) were computed to estimate the genetic variation of each population. To determine the genetic relationships among the breeds, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on Nei’s genetic distance using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean and neighbor-joining method. A total of 15 breeds were clustered into three groups. The first group included Altay sheep and Duolang sheep, the second group was very large and complicated, the third group was a Kazark sheep. The thirteen microsatellite loci were effective markers {{for the analysis of}} genetic relationship among sheep breeds. In addition, genetic distance among groups is not according with their geographic distribution and groups or breeds with low production performance can easily impacted by breeds with better production performance. As for the results, it may be result from applying on artificial insemination and extension of <b>commercial</b> <b>cross</b> breeding technique in sheep production system recent years in China...|$|E
30|$|All {{the manure}} gels {{for the three}} {{different}} cross-linking agents had a signal observed at 3418.38  cm− 1, but at different intensities, this could either be due to OH groups from cellulose or NH stretching of urea units or both (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). A weak band at 2933.3  cm− 1 {{was found in the}} glycerol and chicken dung-modified materials only and could be assigned to C–H stretch (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). This is a confirmation modification, as urea does not have C–H bonds The absorption at 1643.17  cm− 1 is attributed to the system (C–O–C), skeletal mode vibration of α- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkage, the band at 1650.0  cm− 1 is due to water in the amorphous region, and the C–O–C ether bond shows stretching at 1042.4  cm− 1 (Peppas et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). The band at 1427.0  cm− 1 in all spectra indicated that all samples contained a mixture of crystallized cellulose and amorphous cellulose. The bands at 1369.0, 1315.0, and 1157.0  cm− 1 are assigned to CH stretching, CH 2 wagging, and C–O stretching in cellulose (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). These results shows that the cow-dung molecules were cross-linked effectively by all the three cross-linking agents and that the chicken dung gels compared well with the <b>commercial</b> <b>cross</b> linkers.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{construction}} of sex-specific linkage maps for the white shrimp Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei (Penaeidae; Crustacea). Linkage information was generated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (ATLP) markers in a mapping panel consisting of 42 individuals derived from a <b>commercial</b> <b>cross.</b> We used 103 primer combinations that produced 741 segregating bands. From them, 477 segregated in a 1 : 1 model, 181 in a 3 : 1 model. 62 fitted both models and 21 fitted neither model. A total of 394 loci with a 1 : 1 segregation ratio were mapped to unique positions in {{the male and female}} maps using a pseudotestcross strategy. A total of 51 and 47 linkage groups were detected for the male and female maps respectively, in comparison to 44 haploid groups expected from the karyotype. The female map covered 2771 Kosambi units (cM) and was 24 % longer than the male map (2116 cM long). The distribution of the mark-m showed that both maps had low saturation and clustering at short linkage distances. Markers with a distorted segregation were observed as previously reported in other shrimp species. The estimated genomic length indicates that the P. vannamei genome has higher recombination rates than closely related species. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing molecular techniques at low cost without the need of specialized equipment in a species that is at the initial stages of domestication.

40|$|International {{audience}} 373 thirteen-week-old chicks {{issued from}} a <b>commercial</b> <b>cross</b> and 312 chickens from the L 2 line were intravenously inoculated with 10 ^ 6 Salmonella enteritidis {{and the numbers}} of Salmonella in the spleen, liver and genital organs were assessed 3 days later.

The difference between the two experiments could result from sampling variations and from differences in the genetic structure of the two populations possibly including both heterosis and additive effects as well as their interaction in the first experiment. Genetic correlations between the number of bacteria in the genital organs and liver (0. 56 ± 0. 58 and 0. 76 ± 0. 32 in the first and second experiments, respectively) and spleen (0. 37 ± 0. 24 and 0. 79 ± 0. 23) were positive. Moreover a significant within-sire effect of VIL 1, a marker gene for NRAMP 1, was observed in 117 progeny resulting from 25 informative matings. These results indicate that there are genetic differences in the resistance to visceral infection by S.  enteritidis in these commercial egg-laying flocks, and suggest that these differences are at least partly due to genetic polymorphism in the NRAMP 1 region...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} are costly to the swine industry; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) {{is the most}} devastating. In earlier work, a quantitative trait locus associated with resistance/susceptibility to PRRS virus was identified on Sus scrofa chromosome 4 using approximately 560 experimentally infected animals from a <b>commercial</b> <b>cross.</b> The favorable genotype was associated with decreased virus load and increased weight gain (WG). The objective here was to validate and further characterize the association of the chromosome 4 region with PRRS resistance using data from two unrelated commercial crossbred populations. The validation populations consisted of two trials each of approximately 200 pigs sourced from different breeding companies that were infected with PRRS virus and followed for 42 days post-infection. Across all five trials, heritability estimates were 0. 39 and 0. 34 for viral load (VL; area under the curve of log-transformed viremia from 0 to 21 days post-infection) and WG to 42 days post-infection respectively. Effect estimates of SNP WUR 10000125 in the chromosome 4 region {{were in the same}} directions and of similar magnitudes in the two new trials as had been observed in the first three trials. Across all five trials, the 1 -Mb region on chromosome 4 explained 15 percent of genetic variance for VL and 11 percent for WG. The effect of the favorable minor allele at SNP WUR 10000125 was dominant. Ordered genotypes for SNP WUR 10000125 showed that the effect was present irrespective of whether the favorable allele was paternally or maternally inherited. These results demonstrate that selection for host response to PRRS virus infection could reduce the economic impact of PRRS...|$|E

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a subclinical inflammation on the pubertal development of boars and hence on fat androstenone. Contrasted hygiene conditions were applied during rearing to increase the variability of the inflammatory status. Boars from a <b>commercial</b> <b>cross</b> line were allocated at 139 ± 0. 9 days of age (Day 0) and 81. 3 ± 5. 9 kg of live weight either to Good (n= 61) or Poor (n= 54) hygiene conditions until slaughter at 172. 9 ± 4. 8 days of age and 116. 7 ± 4. 5 kg live weight. Inflammatory status, growth and pubertal development were evaluated on Day 0, Day 27 and at slaughter by analysing the blood formula, plasma inflammatory proteins; testosterone and oestradiol, salivary cortisol, rectal temperature, live weight, back fat thickness, weight of reproductive organs and clinical scores of organs (lungs, stomach, snout). Fat was collected on Day 27 by biopsy and at slaughter to measure androstenone concentration. A principal component analysis including inflammatory indicators followed by a clustering procedure was performed to identify pigs with a high (Infl+, n= 50) or a low (Infl−, n= 65) inflammatory status. Infl+ pigs had more granulocytes/ml, higher concentrations of haptoglobin, C-reative protein and cortisol (P< 0. 05), lower growth rate and higher lung pneumonia score. However, regardless of stage, the inflammatory status had no significant effect on plasma testosterone or oestradiol, fat androstenone or sexual organ development.

Treating the mulberry leaves with the aqueous solution of Aloe herbal formulation and feeding the fifth instar larvae, in general, elicited better response of the growth and the cocoon characteristics of this silkworm. Specifically, the Aloe vera L. at 2. 0 % concentration resulted higher larval growth and increased the weight of cocoon. The mean larval weight, relative growth rate, effective rearing rate, larval consumption index of the final instar larvae of silk worm, Bombyx mori L. increased with the supplementation of Aloe vera tonic. The average pupal weight and mother moth weight also increased {{as a result of}} this supplementation. Maximum shell weight and shell ratio were noted in the group of larvae fed with Aloe treated mulberry leaves. The fibroin content of the cocoon shell produced by this silkworm in response to the dietary supplementation of Aloe vera tonic treatment also showed significant increase over control. The overall performance of Bombyx mori in response to the Aloe vera herbal treatment observed in the present study and the evaluation index values worked out showed that the growth and the cocoon parameters could be improved with the supplementation of A. vera herbal formulation.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine genetic variation and to analyze population structure of 6 Italian local chicken breeds involved in a conservation program. Twenty microsatellite markers were investigated in 337 birds belonging to 6 breeds: Ermellinata di Rovigo, Robusta Maculata, Robusta Lionata, Pépoi, Padovana, and Polverara; a commercial layer cross was used as reference. One hundred twelve alleles were detected in the overall population, with a mean number of 5. 6 ± 2. 1 alleles per locus. For the local breeds, the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from a minimum of 0. 240 to a maximum of 0. 413 and from 0. 243 to 0. 463 for the Pépoi and Polverara breeds, respectively. Deviation from Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium was observed in 5 breeds and in the <b>commercial</b> <b>cross.</b> The overall population heterozygote deficiency was 0. 427, the average inbreeding coefficient was 0. 097, and the heterozygote deficiency due to breed subdivisions was 0. 437.

The estimated molecular kinship within a breed ranged from 0. 559 to 0. 769, evidencing high coancestry. Structure analysis was performed to detect the presence of population substructures. Inferred clusters corresponded to the different breeds, without presence of admixture. The exception was the Polverara breed, for which a more complex genetic structure was found.
