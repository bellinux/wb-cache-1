25|$|The Klan {{continued}} to solidify its stronghold on the state, {{taking over the}} Indiana Republican Party and using its new political might to establish a Klan-backed slate of candidates which swept state elections in 1924. The elections allowed the Klan to seize control of the Indiana General Assembly and place the corrupt Governor Edward L. Jackson in office. By then, more than 40% of the native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. Klan-backed candidates took over the City Council, the Board of School Commissioners, and the Board of County Commissioners. Through the Klan, Stephenson ruled over the State of Indiana, leading a powerful national movement set on gaining control of the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.

500|$|Although Daniels {{had claimed}} to be {{reluctant}} to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, The Weekly Standard, Forbes, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist, and The Indianapolis Star began to speculate that Daniels may intend to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in The Wall Street Journal to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House in August 2010. The speculation has included Daniels' record of reforming government, reducing taxes, balancing the budget, and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a [...] "truce" [...] on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issues. His [...] "willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit" [...] has been another source of contention.|$|E

[...] By May 2011, a [...] "Biden panel" [...] with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan. [...] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next couple of months, but it was again Biden's relationship with McConnell that proved to be a key factor in breaking a deadlock and finally bringing about a bipartisan deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day that an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed. [...] Biden had spent the most time bargaining with Congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration, and one Republican staffer said, [...] "Biden's the only guy with real negotiating authority, and [...] knows that his word is good.

2500|$|One of Congress's {{foremost}} non-legislative functions is {{the power}} to investigate and oversee the executive branch. Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress's subpoena power. Some critics have charged that Congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government. In the Plame affair, critics including Representative Henry A. Waxman charged that Congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case. There have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping, although others respond that Congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions. Political scientists Ornstein and Mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of Congress win reelection. Congress also has the exclusive power of removal, allowing impeachment and removal of the president, federal judges and other federal officers. There have been charges that presidents acting under {{the doctrine of the}} unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to Congress. So-called signing statements are one way in which a president can [...] "tip the balance of power between <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House a little more in favor of the executive branch," [...] according to one account. Past presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it, and commentators including the American Bar Association have described this practice as against the spirit of the Constitution. There have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of Congress. In 2008, George F. Will called the Capitol building a [...] "tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters." ...|$|E
