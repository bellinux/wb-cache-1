In the 2004-2005 vintage, total European Union wine production was around 184 million hectoliters (4.8 billion gallons) which accounted for nearly 70% of total worldwide production. Of that total, nearly 55% was classified as table wine with 4% used in the production of grape-based distilled spirits such as Armagnac and Cognac.|$|E

5000|$|The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) defines [...] "real" [...] cider as {{a product}} {{containing}} at least 90% fresh apple juice, with no added flavourings or colourings. Their definition prohibits the use of apple and pear concentrates, and prohibits substantial <b>chaptalisation</b> of the juice (adding sugar prior to fermentation) except in years when the level of natural sugar in the fruit is low. They allow the addition of sweetener for taste after fermentation, and allow limited dilution after fermentation. CAMRA states {{that the practice of}} adding a substantial amount of sugar at the fermentation stage to produce a high-alcohol (12-14% abv) beverage that is then diluted with water down to 8.5% abv or less does not conform to their definition of real cider. Some traditional cider enthusiasts consider this requirement is insufficiently strict and prefer ciders made wholly from apple juice, using apple peel as the source of yeasts.|$|E
40|$|The European Council of ministers for Agriculture {{reached a}} {{political}} {{agreement on the}} 17 th December 2007 on the reform of the Common organisation of the markets of wine. This important political agreement brings to an end the wave of sectoral reforms which had begun in 2003 with arable crops, bovine meat, ovine meat, followed by olive oil, cotton and tobacco in 2004, sugar in 2005 and fruit and vegetables in June 2007. This article deals first of all with the diagnosis, widely shared, of the European wine market and presents the main features of the reform, as much in terms of planting rights as on picking, while looking at <b>chaptalisation</b> amongst other things. It is about a further step towards the liberalisation of the markets - today it is wine like it was sugar yesterday and will be milk tomorrow. Indeed, the Commission will have to present {{a report on the}} application of this reform no later than the end of 2012. In 2012 we will have {{reached the end of the}} debate on new financial perspective and the common agricultural policy of the next decade, two occasions which already seem to be strengthening an orientation towards the reform of markets that appears to he becoming more irreversible each day.

40|$|A uva Isabel da Serra Gaúcha geralmente não alcança teor de açúcar suficiente para produzir vinho equilibrado e, em determinados casos, para atingir 10 % v/v de álcool, concentração mínima para vinho de mesa estabelecida pela legislação brasileira. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de diferentes produtos utilizados para correção do mosto na composição química do vinho Isabel. O experimento constou de seis tratamentos: testemunha (sem correção), sacarose, açúcar mascavo, mosto concentrado, álcool vínico e glicose de milho. Os vinhos foram elaborados em microvinificações, com seis repetições. As amostras foram avaliadas através das análises clássicas, efetuadas por métodos físico-químicos, e dos elementos minerais por absorção atômica. A sacarose foi o produto mais adequado para a correção do mosto, pois não incorporou componentes estranhos, não alterou a relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido e apresentou elevado rendimento alcoólico. O álcool vínico pode ser utilizado desde que seja um produto genuíno de procedência garantida, preferencialmente obtido de vinho branco. The cv. Isabel {{grown in}} the Serra Gaúcha region in general does not produce a {{balanced}} wine, because it sometimes does not reach, the minimum stablished by Brazilian legislation 10 % v/v of alcohol. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different products used in the must sugar correction on the chemical composition of the Isabel wine. The experiment had six treatments - control (without correction) and correction with saccharose, brown sugar, concentrated must, wine alcohol and mayz glucose; there were six replications. The wine was elaborated by microvinification. The samples were evaluated through classical analysis made by physico-chemical methods and the mineral elements determined by atomic absorption. Results showed that saccharose was the most adequate product for <b>chaptalisation</b> {{because it did not}} introduce foreign substances, and neither changed the alcohol in weight/reduced dry extract ratio and showed to be a high alcohol producer. The wine alcohol may be used when it is from a guarantee origin, especially if it is made from white wine...|$|E
