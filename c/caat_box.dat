5000|$|In an {{experiment}} done with core binding factors (CBF) and DNA complexes, researchers {{were able to}} determine the preferential sequences of the promoter in a region over and immediately adjacent to the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box,</b> and two regions {{on either side of}} the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box.</b> By using PCR-mediated random binding selection process, researchers were able to show that the sequence [...] "3' - (T/C)G ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G) - 5'" [...] immediately flanking the ATTGG region (CCAAT in the complementary strand) was preferentially selected on the coding strand (opposite of the template strand). [...] This was shown using an oligonucleotide sequence (R1) which contained 27 random nucleotides, flanked by a defined 20 nucleotide sequence on each side. While no single nucleotide was selected in every clone {{on either side of the}} ATTGG motif (CCAAT in the complementary strand), there were several nucleotides in positions selected with high frequency. Most notably from the sequence above was the G residue towards the 5' end of the ATTGG. The other residues also listed were notable, but there is a split between two residues. This same experiment also yielded the same sequence as shown above when using a different oligonucleotide (R2) that contained an ATTGG core and flanked by 12 5' random nucleotides and 10 3' random nucleotides. Both these sequences are very similar and confirmed in multiple experiments. It should also be noted that for sequences that flanked the ATTGG motif with two adenine residues (AA) on its 5' end and G(A/G) on its 3' end, seems to have inhibited formation of the CBF-DNA complex and subsequently occurred in only 1% of the promoter sequences. [...] In another experiment performed with the major late promoter (MLP) of adenoviruses from a variety of host species, it was shown that the mutation of the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> and CCAAT sequence, which is thought to play a pivotal role in the (MLP) of subgroup C human adenoviruses, in species with a deficient CAAT sequence. The transcription initiation at mutant MLP species was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type or species in which there was a CAAT mutant. The failure to restore the normally functional adenoviruses, exhibited by a <b>CAAT</b> <b>box,</b> is consistent with the idea that the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> plays a vital role in the adenovirus MLP and is preferred over other transcriptional elements.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPromoter {{activity}} in the rat c-Ha-ras promoter region was assessed in NIH 3 T 3 cells using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Promoter activity was orientation dependent. Deletion of the GC box closest to the transcriptional start site, or the upstream GC box and the two <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes,</b> greatly diminished promoter activity. The GC boxes in the SV 40 early promoter could not functionally replace the downstream c-Ha-ras GC box, but specifically competed for expression of rat c-Ha-ras promoter activity.

50|$|The <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> is {{a crucial}} element of the 5' {{flanking}} region of eukaryotic genomes. A specific transcription factor called CAAT-binding protein binds to this region and aids in transcription in eukaryotes. It is typically 10 nucleotides long, and is present -80 to -70 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site, in the proximal promoter region.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>CAAT</b> <b>Box</b> is what {{is known}} as a core {{promoter}}, also known as the basal promoter or simply the promoter, is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. This region, in particular for the <b>CAAT</b> <b>Box,</b> is located about 60-100 bases upstream (towards the 5' end), however no less than 27 base pairs away, from the initial transcription site or a eukaryote gene in which a complex of general transcription factors bind with RNA Polymerase II prior to the initiation of transcription. [...] It is essential to the transcription that these core binding factors (also referred to as nuclear factor Y or NF-Y) are able to bind to the CCAAT motif. Experiments in many laboratories have shown that mutations to the CCAAT motif that cause a loss of CBF binding also decreases transcriptional activity in these promoters, suggesting that CBF-CCAAT complexes are essential for optimum transcriptional activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a CCAAT box (also sometimes abbreviated a <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> or CAT box) is {{a distinct}} pattern of nucleotides with GGCCAATCT consensus sequence that occur upstream by 60-100 bases to the initial transcription site. The <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> signals the binding site for the RNA transcription factor, and is typically accompanied by a conserved consensus sequence. It is an invariant DNA sequence at about minus 70 base pairs from the origin of transcription in many eukaryotic promoters. Genes that have this element seem to require it for the gene to be transcribed in sufficient quantities. It is frequently absent from genes that encode proteins used in virtually all cells. This box along with the GC box is known for binding general transcription factors. Both of these consensus sequences belong to the regulatory promoter. Full gene expression occurs when transcription activator proteins bind to each module within the regulatory promoter. Protein specific binding {{is required for the}} CCAAT box activation. These proteins are known as CCAAT box binding proteins/CCAAT box binding factors.|$|E
40|$|The {{gene for}} the light-harvesting {{chlorophyll}} a/b binding protein from rice was cloned and se-quenced. The clone contains a 798 -bp coding sequence, which {{is identical to}} that of a cDNA for type I LHCPII (Matsuoka 1990), and its 5 - and 3 -flanking regions. The coding region of this gene is not interrupted by intervening sequences, as reported for type I genes from other plants. In the 5 '-flanking region, typical TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes</b> are located 30 and 92 bp upstream from the capping site (positions — 30 and — 92), respectively. A putative phytochrome-responsive ele-ment (AAGATAAGG) is located at position- 6 5 between the TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes.</b> Com-parison of sequences in the 5 '-flanking regions between this gene and genes for LHCPII from other gramineous plants indicates that the rice sequence has no apparent homology to that of wheat. However, the rice sequence is highly homologous to the maize sequence, not only around the TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes</b> but also in regions further upstream. To investigate the promoter activity of the 5 -flanking region of the gene, a chimeric gene was constructed by fusing the 5 -flanking region to the coding sequence for ^-glucuronidase (GUS), and this chimeric gene was introduced into tobacco. The highest activity of GUS was observed in leaf tissue, indicating that the 5 '-flanking region of the gene can act as a promoter in an organ...|$|R

The Acadl 5' regulatory region, like other members of the Acad family, lacks a TATA or <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> and is GC rich.

50|$|The {{promoter}} {{region of}} PRR12 was predicted using ElDorado at Genomatix. The region starts at position 50094408 and ends at 50095013 of chromosome 19. This promoter set is conserved in the macaque, mouse, rat, horse, cow, pig, dog and zebrafish. No recognizable TATA box, B recognition element (BRE), or <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> was found upstream of the predicted transcription start region. Because no clear TATA box was found, {{it is possible}} that PRR12 is regulated by a TATA-less promoter containing a downstream promoter element (DPE). However, the predicted DPE is only 15bp downstream of the transcription start region instead of the typical +25 to +32 base pairs. More research will be required to expand the 5’ UTR of the PRR12 transcript in order to confirm where the correct promoter region is located.|$|E

40|$|Pyruvate {{carboxylase}} (EC 6. 4. 1. 1) is a biotin-containing {{enzyme that}} {{plays an important}} role in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Here we report the structural organization of the rat pyruvate carboxylase gene, which spans over 40 kilobases and is composed of 19 coding exons and 4 5 '-untranslated region exons. From this data, it is clear that alternative splicing of the primary transcripts from two promoters is responsible for the occurrence of the multiple mRNA species previously reported (Jitrapakdee, S., Walker, M. E., and Wallace, J. C. (1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 223, 695 - 700). The proximal promoter, which is active in gluconeogenic and lipogenic tissues, contains no TATA or <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes</b> but includes a sequence that is typical of a housekeeping initiator protein 1 box while the distal promoter contains three <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes</b> and multiple Sp 1 binding sites. Several potential transcription factor binding sites are found in both promoters. A series of 5 '-nested deletion constructs of both promoters were fused to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently expressed in COS- 1 cells. The results show that the 153 and 187 base pairs, preceding the transcription start sites of the proximal and distal promoters, respectively, are required for basal transcription. Insulin selectively inhibits the expression of the proximal promoter-luciferase reporter gene by 50 % but not the distal promoter in COS- 1 cells, suggesting the presence of an insulin-responsive element in the proximal promoter.

The splice sites for donor and acceptor were {{in agreement with the}} canonical GT/AG rule. Functional regions of beta ARK are described with respect to their location within the exon-intron organization of the gene. Primer extension and RNase protection assays suggest a major transcription start site approximately 246 bases upstream of the start ATG. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking/promoter region reveals many features characteristic of mammalian housekeeping genes, i.e. the lack of a TATA box, an absent or nonstandard positioned <b>CAAT</b> <b>box,</b> high GC content, and the presence of Sp1-binding sites. The extraordinarily high GC content of the 5'-flanking region (> 80%) helps define this region as a CpG island that may be a principal regulator of beta ARK expression.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons among {{sequences}} {{predicted to}} encode the major late promoter (MLP) of adenoviruses {{from a wide}} variety of host species show that an inverted <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> is among the most highly conserved transcription elements found in the putative MLPs. The high degree of conservation suggests that the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> plays an important role in the function of the MLP in vivo, an idea supported by a previous mutational analysis of the core CCAAT sequence. To address the importance of the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box,</b> in terms both of quantitative levels of transcription and of specificity, a further set of mutations was created and examined in the context of the viral genome. One mutation, CAAT 5, contains individual changes at five positions, four of which correspond to invariant residues in a <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> consensus derived either by computer analysis or empirically. The CAAT 5 mutation had no discernible phenotype by itself but when coupled with the previously described USF 0 mutation, which disrupts binding of the upstream stimulating factor (USF) but is otherwise phenotypically silent, gave rise to virus with a severe replication deficiency. Nuclear run-on assays showed that transcription initiation at the mutant MLP was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type or the virus containing CAAT 5 alone. Replication of the double mutant was lower than that of the previously described USF 0 ::CCCAT virus, suggesting that the additional mutations in the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> had further lowered the binding of transcription factor CP 1 (also called CBF, NF-Y). Replacement of the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> by an ATF binding site or an OCT 1 binding site had no phenotypic effect in an otherwise wild-type background, but replacement in a USF 0 ::CCCAT background led to only partial restoration of the wild-type phenotype.

This upstream element has often been considered necessary and sufficient for maximal transcription of the MLP. A duplex oligonucleotide containing the mutant sequence was not capable of binding specific proteins in a band shift assay, nor was it capable of inhibiting such binding by the wild-type sequence. In an in vitro assay, the mutant sequence was incapable of inhibiting transcription from a duplex sequence containing the MLP, whereas the wild-type sequence could. These two pieces of evidence suggest that the sequence is functionally impaired. Surprisingly, a virus containing the mutant MLP had a normal replication phenotype. On more detailed examination however, we show that the mutant viral MLP was deficient in transcription at 9 h postinfection but {{that the rate of}} transcription was close to normal by 20 h postinfection. An inverted <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> located immediately upstream of the USF-binding element was not previously thought to be of importance to the functioning of the MLP.

This result suggests that the MLP may exhibit functional redundancy in which either the USF-binding site or the <b>CAAT</b> <b>box</b> can serve as an upstream promoter element.

A series of reporter gene constructions derived from the 2 kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site defined a minimal promoter sequence from nucleotides - 132 to - 41. This PADI 2 region is GC-rich and lacks canonical TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>boxes.</b> Investigation of cis-acting elements in the region, further deletion analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific antibodies revealed four Sp 1 -binding sites and identified Sp 1 and Sp 3 as binding factors important for the promoter activity. These results suggest that Sp 1 /Sp 3 cooperation may provide a mechanism to control the transcription of PADI 2...|$|R
