5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
25|$|When Tefolaha {{arrived on}} Nanumea he found two women named Pai and Vau. Tefolaha {{ordered them to}} leave as he claimed the island. Pai and Vau replied that he should leave unless he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> their names. This is a defence that appears in other mythologies of the Pacific that {{possibly}} reflects the belief that to know a person’s name is to have some power over that person. Tefolaha knew their names so they departed. As they left, sand spilled out of their baskets creating the smaller islets of Nanumea.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, the Tar Heel {{noted that}} the Hedgepeth case {{remained}} open, along {{with the death of}} David Shannon, a UNCCH freshman whose body had been found on the grounds of a Carrboro cement plant the previous October 27 (while he had died from a fall, the autopsy found he was severely intoxicated, and the Carrboro police suspected hazing and believed there might be other students who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> more about the circumstances of Shannon's death). In Hedgepeth's case, there had been no new information about a possible suspect since January. Yet the case records remained under court-ordered seal.|$|E

60|$|They didn't leave 'im alone {{till they}} knew {{as much about}} it as he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> and they both of 'em told 'im that if he took a reward of thirty pounds for it, instead of selling it for a 'undred, he was a bigger fool than he looked.|$|R
60|$|Thers. Good, good, by Pluto! their fool's mad, to {{lose his}} harlot; and our fool's mad, that t'other fool had her first. If I sought peace now, I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> there's punk enough to satisfy 'em both: whore sufficient! but let 'em worry one another, the foolish curs; they think they never can have enough of carrion.|$|R
500|$|... 20th Century Fox, the {{original}} financiers of the film, demanded that Harrison Ford play {{a leading role}} and that significant changes to the screenplay be made. Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios, but it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter—Traffic {{is more of a}} political film than most Hollywood productions. USA Films, however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox. Soderbergh operated the camera himself and adopted a distinctive color grade for each story so that audiences <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart.|$|E
2500|$|As to the {{solicitor}} he {{was told}} they could not send one in while {{he still had the}} gun, as this appeared to be what John wanted. [...] However they could get one on the phone to advise him if he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> who to get in touch with.|$|E
2500|$|At dawn on May 27, {{the main}} Qing army reached {{the gates of}} Shanhai Pass, where Dorgon {{received}} Wu Sangui's formal surrender. Wu Sangui asked his men to attach pieces of white cloth to their back so that the Qing forces <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart from the Shun rebels. Wu Sangui's forces were deployed in the vanguard and were ordered to charge the Shun army, but despite disorder in the Shun ranks, their defense line did not yield. Unable to break the rebels' line, Wu's troops suffered heavy casualties. Historian Frederic Wakeman claims that by the late afternoon, Wu Sangui's army {{was on the verge}} of defeat when a [...] "violent sandstorm" [...] started blowing on the battlefield.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{foolish and}} angry. I tried and found I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> what I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> {{the monks}} {{that it was}} not a miracle he had seen; he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> that he had lost faith again.... And then his {{thoughts}} wandering to the future,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He said he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> then, and, besides, {{they would}} have {{as much as they}} could do to put in stones for one day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly {{alike in}} all, their schoolmasters never <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart; at dancing parties they {{constantly}} changed partners without discovery; their close resemblance is scarcely diminished by age." ...|$|E
60|$|This was all {{the hotel}} man <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them,</b> {{and a few minutes}} later the Rover boys were in their {{automobile}} once more and headed back for the scene of the accident.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, at {{the gate}} she shared her wrath with Jenny's mother. What call had they to {{want to make the}} poor {{children}} to be like parsons at church? Jem shouldn't be there no more, she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told them}} you'd gone away to work," [...] she sobbed, laying {{her head on}} her arms on the table. [...] "What else <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>them?</b> I couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> the vile truth about their father. I couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>THEM</b> how evil you are." [...] She sobbed and moaned.|$|R
60|$|After a short time, {{they came}} to a smooth and {{pleasant}} road, with trees and farm-houses on each side; and as the horse was trotting along quietly, Rollo asked his mother if she <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> a story.|$|R
60|$|Brother Bellows {{was on his}} way to {{make his}} bow to the bosom, and <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> in passing that he had heard it stated, with great {{appearance}} of truth, as being worth, from first to last, half-a-million of money.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Mount coughed a {{peculiar}} cough that her mistresses well knew to signify that she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> something {{they would not}} like to hear, if they chose to ask her, and it was the younger who put the question--- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] said she, [...] "you {{had better}} {{go down to}} the village after dark; and I can go with you, and then I am sure you could never be suspected; and even if you were, I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> it was {{altogether}} a mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but it may}} be {{that you}} have lever heard that Mr. Codrington has a sister ship, the White Rose, which lies even now in the harbour, and which is so like the pirate, that, {{if it were not for}} a white paint line, none <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had seen}} it {{but a few days}} before, and <b>could</b> not help <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> of the fancy I had about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean this}} way: We {{could go to}} Crumville and you could watch your chance, and when the coast was clear you could git a rig and drive over to the Basswood house and go in quite excited like and <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> that this Mr. Wadsworth was a-want-in' to see them miniatures right away,--that a very celebrated art critic had called on him, but couldn't stay long. Wanted to ketch a train and all that. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> that Mr. Wadsworth had sent you to git the miniatures, {{and that he had}} said that he would return 'em jest as soon as the critic had looked 'em over.

6000|$|... "So {{you have}} been talking of my faults," [...] said Florida, {{breathing}} quickly. [...] "Perhaps you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me of <b>them</b> to my face." ...|$|R
60|$|But Jacob Smith and Bolle {{remained}} {{questioning the}} man closely upon many matters, and, having learned all he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them,</b> sent him away under guard {{and sat there}} till midnight consulting and making up their plans with the farmers and yeomen whom they called to them from time to time.|$|E
6000|$|He made {{room for}} Bertie to lie down, {{and held the}} torch for him. [...] "I think you are right, Harry.

60|$|So the imaum {{left the}} court, and {{returned}} presently carrying two small boxes of sandalwood tied with silk and sealed, so {{like each other}} that none <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart, which boxes he passed continually from his right hand to his left and from his left hand to his right, then gave them to Saladin.|$|E
60|$|During {{this time}} I saw Steele twice, at night {{out in our}} rendezvous. He had little to communicate, but was eager to hear when I had seen Jim Hoden, Morton, Wright, Sampson, and all I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> about <b>them,</b> and the {{significance}} of things in town.|$|R
6000|$|... "That boy <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> much, {{even if he}} got there," [...] {{the other}} said; [...] "and from this {{distance}} it would need a sharp eye and some military knowledge to make out anything {{of what is going}} on. Where does your mother live, boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>could</b> Jim Leonard <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> that a {{man would}} give up his {{watermelon}} patch, and how could they believe such a lie, poor, foolish boys?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Haredale entered, {{followed}} by the locksmith. Turning {{with a look of}} great astonishment to the old woman who had opened the door, he inquired for Mrs Rudge--for Barnaby. They were both gone, she replied, wagging her ancient head, for good. There was a gentleman in the parlour, who perhaps <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> more. That was all SHE knew.|$|E
60|$|Aloysius. [Taking {{up some of}} the osiers and {{beginning}} to twist them.] That might {{be a good way to}} come at them; they could work through the day, and at evening we <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> how to repeat the words till the light comes inside their heads. But would Paul think well of it? He is more for pulling down than building up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay," [...] said Ambrose. [...] "I {{have much}} to learn and {{understand}} ere I think of a wife--if ever. Nay! But when they had heard all I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them,</b> they looked at one another, and the Dean said, 'The maid is no doubt of high blood in her own land--scarce a mate for a London butcher or currier." ...|$|E
50|$|September 2008 saw {{the premiere}} of the musical Whisper the Wind in New Zealand, a tribute {{presentation}} covering highlights of Denver's life and career, with the younger Denver played by 21-year-old Dunedin musician Bevan Gardiner, whose vocal impersonation of the late singer was considered so accurate that Denver's business manager Harold Thau <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> apart.|$|R
60|$|They <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> at once, for {{the second}} act had begun when March and the general came back; and after the opera was over and they got out into the crowded street there was no chance, for the general was obliged to offer his arm to Mrs. March, while her husband {{followed}} with his daughter.|$|R
