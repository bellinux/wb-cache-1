5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. <b>Cysteamine</b> and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E

50|$|Umbellulone is a {{monoterpene}} ketone that {{is found}} in the leaves of the Umbellularia californica. The formula of umbellulone is C10H14O, containing a cyclopropane and cyclopentane ring. There is only one isomer of umbellulone known. Umbellulone is a lipophilic, it's a liquid (oil) at room temperature. The boiling point of umbellulone is 220 °C and the vapor pressure is 0.159 mm/Hg. Due to this extremely low vapor pressure, umbellulone fumes are easily created. This makes the substance easily inhaled. Umbellulone has a high-affinity binding for thiols. The molecule is reactive with most of the thiols, but not with all. The reaction between the thiol <b>cysteamine</b> and umbellulone, is given in figure 3. A European registered medicine called Cystagon® or Procysbi® contains <b>cysteamine,</b> which can interact with umbellulone.|$|E

50|$|Condensed tannins can undergo acid-catalyzed {{cleavage}} in {{the presence}} of (or an excess of) a nucleophile like phloroglucinol (reaction called phloroglucinolysis), benzyl mercaptan (reaction called thiolysis), thioglycolic acid (reaction called thioglycolysis) or <b>cysteamine.</b> Flavan-3-ol compounds used with methanol produce short-chain procyanidin dimers, trimers, or tetramers which are more absorbable.|$|E
50|$|Pantetheine is the <b>cysteamine</b> amide analog of {{pantothenic}} acid (vitamin B5). The dimer of this compound, pantethine is more commonly known, {{and is considered}} to be a more potent form of vitamin B5 than {{pantothenic acid}}.

5000|$|Monomers of proanthocyanidins can be {{characterized}} by analysis with HPLC and mass spectrometry.

50|$|Two {{mechanisms}} of action are proposed for pantethine. In the first, pantethine {{serves as the}} precursor for synthesis of coenzyme A. CoA {{is involved in the}} transfer of acetyl groups, in some instances to attach to proteins closely associated with activating and deactivating genes. By this theory, either the genes responsible for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis are suppressed or the genes governing the catabolism of compounds are turned on. In the second theory, pantethine is converted to two pantetheine molecules which are in turn metabolized to form two pantethenic acid and two <b>cysteamine</b> molecules. <b>Cysteamine</b> is theorized to bind to and thus inactivate sulfur-containing amino acids in liver enzymes involved in the production of cholesterol and triglycerides. What is known is that high doses of the related vitamin - pantothenic acid - has no effect on lipids.|$|E
50|$|Cystinosis is {{normally}} treated with <b>cysteamine,</b> {{which is available}} in capsules and in eye drops. People with cystinosis are also often given sodium citrate to treat the blood acidosis, as well as potassium and phosphorus supplements. If the kidneys become significantly impaired or fail, then treatment must be begun to ensure continued survival, {{up to and including}} renal transplantation.|$|E
50|$|While {{hydroquinone}} remains widely {{prescribed for}} treatment of hyperpigmentation, questions raised about its safety profile by regulatory agencies in the EU, Japan, and USA encourage the search for other agents with comparable efficacy. Several such agents are already available or under research, including azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, <b>cysteamine,</b> topical steroids, glycolic acid, and other substances.|$|E
50|$|Lentigines by {{themselves}} are benign, however one might desire the removal or treatment {{of some of}} them for cosmetic purposes. In this case they can be removed surgically, or lightened {{with the use of}} topical depigmentation agents. Some common depigmentation agents such as azelaic acid and kojic acid seem to be inefficient in this case, however other agents might work well (4% hydroquinone, 5% topical <b>cysteamine,</b> 10% topical ascorbic acid).|$|E
