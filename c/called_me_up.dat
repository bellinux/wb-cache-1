When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> personally [...] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

500|$|Wentz {{referred}} to [...] "I Don't Care" [...] as a [...] "narcissist's anthem" [...] {{that addresses the}} current generation's short attention span. Wentz further explored the subjects of narcissism and apathy in [...] "(Coffee's for Closers)", as Stump explained, [...] "The past decade has been totally about 'me.' It's totally about 'Oh, I'm sad. I want this. I know somebody who knows this person. Me me me me me,' so that's what that song is about." [...] Additionally, [...] "America's Suitehearts" [...] discusses society's fixation with celebrities {{and the desire to}} let them do no wrong. [...] "27" [...] explores the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll music. The title is a reference to the 27 Club, a group of influential musicians, including Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Jim Morrison, who all {{died at the age of}} 27. Wentz felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle, and was [...] "stoked" [...] to make it to his 28th birthday. Stump added [...] "There was a countdown clock and everything. I remember, our manager <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12" [...] vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, I sat in my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

I went down there and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. I love her background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley. The [...] "remix" [...] version uses the same instrumentation as the original single, but has a more reggae-infused rendition and an added verse sung by Marley; the [...] "" [...] version features the song's original beat mixed with the remix version.|$|E

2500|$|James was the DJ for WWDC, a {{radio station}} in Washington, DC. Eventually he decided to pursue Albert's {{suggestion}} to him and asked the station's promotion director to get British Overseas Airways Corporation to ship in a copy of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] from Britain. Albert related what happened next: [...] "Carroll James <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> the day he got the record and said 'If you can get down here by 5 o'clock, we'll let you introduce it.'" [...] Albert managed {{to get to the}} station in time, and introduced the record with: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, {{for the first time on}} the air in the United States, here are the Beatles singing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, Kojima {{designed}} and released [...] for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous {{games in the}} series, {{which took place in}} the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Soviet jungle {{during the height of the}} Cold War in 1964, and features wilderness survival, camouflage, and James Bond styled espionage. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. Kojima has said that his mother played it, [...] "It took her an entire year to complete Metal Gear Solid 3. She would get her friends to help her.

I went up to the cockpit, and he says, 'We have two passengers by the name of Diop and Gueye.' He says, 'Go down and try to find them in the manifest, because I would like to have a word with them.' ... So Captain Priddy sat them down at these two seats over here. He gave them a pretty good pat. They had a Styrofoam container in their groin area where they carried the grenade, and the 25-mm pistols. But this we found out much later." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The way I {{originally}} {{heard about}} (the reunion) was {{from one of}} the guys at Earache (Records), who <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to ask me about it. I knew nothing about it so I called Martin to ask him about it. The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left. If you left your employee, you couldn't go and start that business somewhere else under the same name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hole formed after Eric Erlandson {{responded to}} an {{advertisement}} placed by Courtney Love in Recycler {{in the summer}} of 1989.

Oh, no, What am I getting myself into?" [...] She grabbed me and started talking, and she's like [...] "I know you're the right one", and I hadn't even opened my mouth yet." [...] In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson [...] "had a Thurston [...] quality about him" [...] and was an [...] "intensely weird, good guitarist."

Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. [...] "The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown," [...] said Jemison.

2500|$|His {{attitude}} {{changed after}} producer Martin Poll and screenwriter Larry Cohen {{filed a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox, alleging that the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled Cast of Characters. According to Moore, [...] "They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> and persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny." [...] Moore testified in a deposition, a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he [...] "molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin". Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt. In 2012, Moore claimed that he had sold the rights to these two works simply for the money; he did not expect the films ever to be made. He was simply [...] "getting money for old rope". Moore {{said in an interview in}} 2012 that he had seen neither film.|$|E
