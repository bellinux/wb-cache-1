After Kasim's death is announced publicly, Alibaba is declared the new king of Baghdad and everyone rejoices. Meanwhile, the dacoits return to their cave and find that Kasim's corpse is missing. Realising that someone else has entered their cave, they start searching for the mystery person.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one <b>code</b> <b>word</b> into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E

25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the <b>code</b> <b>word</b> 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.|$|E
25|$|Y-Gerät an {{automatic}} beam-tracking {{system and the}} most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to precisely be measured. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> from the ground controller or {{at the conclusion of}} the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of Y-Gerät was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to encode data when transmitting over a noisy channel in order for errors to be detected and corrected. List decoding algorithms provide all <b>code</b> <b>words</b> within a specified distance of a received word {{in order to be}} sufficiently robust for cases when two or more <b>code</b> <b>words</b> are equidistant from a received word. This paper details a probabilistic method to obtain multiple close <b>code</b> <b>words,</b> motivated by list decoding methods, for linear codes over fields of two or three elements. It employs a variation on the LLL-Algorithm for lattice reduction that allows the LLL-Algorithm to determine small elements in a vector space. Although it fails to return all <b>code</b> <b>words</b> within a specified distance of a received word, the method is sufficiently robust to provide some information if a received word is equidistant to multiple <b>code</b> <b>words...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{self-checking}} systems, checkers {{usually do}} not receive all <b>code</b> <b>words</b> during normal operation. Missing <b>code</b> <b>words</b> may prevent a checker from achieving the totally self-checking property. The paper presents a novel approach {{to the design of}} embedded parity and two-rail checkers that allows a checker to receive all <b>code</b> <b>words</b> irrespective of the set of <b>code</b> <b>words</b> that is provided by the functional circuit. A checker gets all <b>code</b> <b>words</b> by an LFSR {{while at the same time}} it monitors the output of the functional circuit. Additionally, the LFSR is able to capture the error patterns of noncode words. Captured error patterns will be modified since they will cycle through the LFSR. Thus, noncode words that are not detected due to undetected checker faults can be detected in later instances of time. The proposed method can be extended to the design of checkers for linear codes...|$|R

25|$|As the war progressed, {{additional}} code words were added on and incorporated program-wide.

These representatives in turn trained other code talkers who could not attend the meeting.

40|$|To {{be able to}} {{transmit}} television pictures in a digital form through a medium having a limited bandwidth, the pictures are subjected to picture transform and to variable-length coding. The picture to be transmitted is converted in this manner into a bit stream comprising <b>code</b> <b>words</b> of variable length. This bit stream is converted into a channel bit stream which is less sensitive to transmission errors. To this end the most significant <b>code</b> <b>words</b> (representing the average luminance and the coarse picture details) of sub-pictures of 8 * 8 pixels are accommodated at fixed bit positions of the channel bit stream. These <b>code</b> <b>words</b> can be retrieved by simple count-down of the bit positions. The other <b>code</b> <b>words</b> are distributed over the other bit positions. The decoder is relatively simple because the length of each block comprising significant <b>code</b> <b>words</b> is also transmitted.

500|$|The {{film was}} given the {{production}} code number 191 and had a <b>code</b> <b>word</b> of [...] "Mum". A catalog listed the film's length at 995 feet. The film's expected run-time was fifteen minutes and was billed by the Thanhouser Company as having many novelties and being of a comedic nature. It was released on March 7, 1911 and listed as a drama by the Moving Picture World. It was distributed by the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company. The production came {{during a time of}} renewed interest in Egyptology in which Pathé and Urban Films would release their own films titled The Mummy.
