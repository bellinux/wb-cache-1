40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for the automated recognition-identification of musical recordings that {{have suffered from}} {{a high degree of}} playing speed and frequency band distortion. The procedure of recognition is essentially based on the comparison between an unknown <b>musical</b> <b>recording</b> and a set of model ones, according to some predefined specific characteristics of the signals. In order to extract these characteristics from a <b>musical</b> <b>recording,</b> novel feature extraction algorithms are employed. This procedure is applied to the whole set of model musical recordings, thus creating a model characteristic database. Each time we want an unknown <b>musical</b> <b>recording</b> to be identified, the same procedure is applied to it, and subsequently, the derived characteristics are compared with the database contents via an introduced set of criteria. The proposed methodology {{led to the development of}} a system whose performance was extensively tested with various types of broadcasted musical recordings. The system performed successful recognition for the 94 % of the tested recordings. It should be noted that the presented system is parallelizable and can operate in real time.
