In Kessinger et al.’s study, conducted in patients with minor degenerative spondylolisthesis, 60 % of patients sustained at least 80 % pain relief lasting at least 12  months; 80 % sustained at least 60 % relief [83]. Several controlled studies confirmed this trend [69, 84 – 87], with a mean decrease of 2 – 3 points on a visual analogue scale vs control groups. RF complications are uncommon (1 % incidence), of limited duration and minor in nature [88]. Potential side effects include painful <b>cutaneous</b> dysesthesias or <b>hyperesthesia</b> increased pain due to neuritis, neuroma formation, and deafferentation pain. Unintentional damage to a spinal nerve causing a motor deficit, is also a complication [89]. Sensory and motor stimulation during the procedure may help to avoid this complication [75].|$|R
