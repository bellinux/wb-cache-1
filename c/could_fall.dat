5|$|Godwin's book {{follows a}} venerable {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends {{the excitement of}} journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is cited as a forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} an {{eruption}} would destroy much wildlife about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> into the ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E

5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> under the new law.|$|E
5|$|In 1807 Agamemnon {{was part}} of Admiral James Gambier's fleet sent {{to take control of}} the Danish fleet before it <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> into French hands. She participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen, and as in the first in 1801, ran aground. After she had come free, Agamemnon landed guns and shot in Kjörge Bay to form part of a battery being {{established}} there to command the city. Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1500, Cabral was {{appointed}} Capitão-mor (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It {{was then the}} custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. This {{was the case for}} the captains of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.|$|E

5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was bombed}} twice during the Second World War, but {{remained}} mostly unharmed. One of the bombs, in around 1940, {{was reported to}} have killed a giraffe. Nevertheless, Edinburgh was, like all zoos in Britain, affected by the war. Since bombs <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> at any time, it was not considered safe to keep dangerous animals that might escape if their enclosures were damaged. In 1941 the recently born wolves had therefore to be euthanized, along with a collection of dangerous snakes, to guard against any possible danger to the public. Despite the war the zoo continued to grow, with land to the east being purchased in 1942 and construction of a lake beginning soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix <b>could</b> <b>fall.</b> The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Russia peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, {{just before the}} breakup of the Soviet Union. Low birth rates and abnormally high death rates caused Russia's population to decline at a 0.5% annual rate, or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per year from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The UN warned in 2005 that Russia's then {{population of}} about 143 million <b>could</b> <b>fall</b> by a third by 2050, if trends did not improve.|$|E

25|$|Post-war {{tunnelling}} {{took place}} in less urgent circumstances and new, less damaging, tunnelling methods were used. Explosives were employed again but this time in smaller quantities, placed in drill holes bored {{into the face of}} the excavation. They were fired electrically in a sequence which began in the centre of the face and spread outwards, so that the centre would create a void into which the peripheral rock <b>could</b> <b>fall.</b> The downside of this method was that it created tunnels with jagged sides, as it fractured the limestone around the periphery of the excavation.|$|E
