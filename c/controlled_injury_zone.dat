40|$|People {{have been}} {{becoming}} serious of {{more and more}} accidents of toxic-gas-vessel leakage and dispersion (TLD) recently. This paper describes a TLD model derived from Gaussian instantaneous leakage model, and then simulates the process of TLD with GIS. When a high-pressure container or vessel breaks, toxic gas (including gasification of high-pressure liquid gas and low-temperature liquid) will leak, and then the gas cloud will disperse in atmosphere. We can calculate the leakage speed of toxic gas, and decide {{the primary source of}} dispersion consequently. Assumed that there are N independent equivalent air masses created during the period of leakage, and every air mass subjects to Gausses instantaneous leakage model. Therefore, the effect of TLD is equivalent to the superposition of the N air masses. Thus, the concentration of toxic gas at certain time, location and weather condition can be calculated. After that, concentration isoline can be traced out. We {{pay more attention to the}} concentration isolines at half lethal dose, badly injury dose, middle injury dose, and low injury dose. The relevant areas are called death <b>zone,</b> badly <b>injury</b> <b>zone,</b> middle <b>injury</b> <b>zone,</b> and low <b>injury</b> <b>zone</b> respectively. The dispersion trend and affection range can be predicted by illustrating these zones at different time, wind direction and speed. A decision support system of emergency treatment during TLD can be made together with the data of population distribution, traffic, economy, etc. Besides, it provides an analyze tool to forecast or evaluate casualty in TLD. 1...|$|R

40|$|Some {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} erythropoietin (EPO) increases resistance to apoptosis and facilitates neuronal survival following cerebral ischemia. However, results from in vivo studies are rarely reported. Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been applied successfully to distinguish acute cerebral ischemic necrosis and penumbra in living animals; therefore, we hypothesized that PWI and DWI {{could be used to}} provide imaging evidence in vivo for the conclusion that EPO could reduce apoptosis in brain areas injured by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. To validate this hypothesis, we established a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and treated with intra-cerebroventricular injection of EPO (5, 000 U/kg) 20 minutes before injury. Brain tissue in the ischemic <b>injury</b> <b>zone</b> was sampled using MRI-guided localization. The relative area of abnormal tissue, changes in PWI and DWI in the ischemic <b>injury</b> <b>zone,</b> and the number of apoptotic cells based on TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) were assessed. Our findings demonstrate that EPO reduces the relative area of abnormally high signal in PWI and DWI, increases cerebral blood volume, and decreases the number of apoptotic cells positive for TUNEL in the area injured by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The experiment provides imaging evidence in vivo for EPO treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of records. The cases were grouped according to the Ocular Trauma Classification Group classification system. Results: Out of 188 MLCs, 164 (87. 2 %) were male. Mean age (±standard deviation) was 31. 6 (± 12. 7) years. Age ranged from 7 to 75 years. Twenty-six (13. 8 %) patients had bilateral involvement. The fist was the most common mode of injury, which was seen in 109 (58 %) cases. A total of 27 (14. 3 %) patients had associated extraocular injury. No evidence of ocular or orbital trauma (malingering) could be found in 13 (7 %) patients. Mechanical trauma was present in 169 (90 %) patients with injury to globe in 129 (69 %) patients and injury to lid or orbit without damage to the globe in 40 (21 %) patients. Chemical injury was observed in 6 (3 %) patients. Closed globe injury (CGI) was seen in 116 eyes and open globe injury (OGI) was noted in 29 eyes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the effects of {{low-level}} laser therapy (LLLT) on the regeneration of the sciatic nerve in rats following a complete nerve resection. Male Wistar rats were divided into a <b>control</b> <b>injury</b> group, injury groups irradiated with a 660 -nm laser at 10 or 50 J/cm(2), and injury groups irradiated with an 808 -nm laser at 10 or 50 J/cm(2). Treatment began 24 h following nerve resection and continued for 15 days. Using the sciatic functional index (SFI), we show that the injured animals treated with 660 nm at 10 and 50 J/cm(2) had better SFI values compared with the <b>control</b> <b>injury</b> and the 808 -nm groups. Animals irradiated with the 808 -nm laser at 50 J/cm(2) show higher values for fiber density than do control animals. in addition, axon and fiber diameters were larger in animals irradiated with 660 nm at 50 J/cm(2) compared to the control group. These findings indicate that 660 -nm LLLT is able to provide functional gait recovery and leads to increases in fiber diameter following sciatic nerve resection.

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of gene therapy via adenovirus gene transfer of KGFR on the treatment of ALI. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: normal <b>controls,</b> <b>injury</b> <b>controls,</b> normal adenovirus transduced group and injury adenovirus transduced group. The ALI model was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Recombinant adenovirus (AdEasy-KGFR) was injected via the tail vein. Expression of the sodium (Na+) channel in rat alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells was determined by PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy of rat lung tissues. Results: Gene expression of the Na+ channel and KGFR in ATII cells was higher in the normal adenovirus transduced group than the three other groups; expression of these two genes in the injury adenovirus transduced group was higher than the <b>injury</b> <b>control</b> group.
