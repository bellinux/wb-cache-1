5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857â€“1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further <b>clinical</b> <b>training</b> at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E

In Sri Lanka, until recently there were few companion animals; veterinary education focused on herd health, with little attention to clinical skills. In Ethiopia few schools have <b>clinical</b> <b>training</b> facilities, {{and the government has}} prioritized opening more schools over improving existing colleges. There is concern in the United States that <b>clinical</b> <b>training</b> may suffer because many veterinary teaching hospitals are in financial trouble.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{students}} used to receive {{four years of}} preclinical training, followed by two years of <b>clinical</b> <b>training</b> (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen for short) in hospitals. However, {{for a number of}} medical schools this has recently changed to three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of <b>clinical</b> <b>training.</b> At least one medical faculty, that of the Utrecht University, <b>clinical</b> <b>training</b> already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as basisartsen (comparable to Doctors of Medicine). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands now receive a bachelor's degree after three years in medical school and a master's degree upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} base patient care on {{scientific}} evidence depends {{in part on}} the results of translational and applied research. The shortage of <b>trained</b> <b>clinical</b> researchers identified by several sources limits the availability of clinical research studies upon which to base evidence-based therapeutics. This premise suggests that the dental profession needs to <b>train</b> more <b>clinical</b> researchers and faculty to conduct clinical research and to teach its applications to practice. Increasing opportunities for <b>clinical</b> research <b>training</b> {{in a variety of settings}} should eventually increase the numbers of clinical researchers, raise faculty involvement in clinical research, and promote science transfer. This paper reports on the current status of clinical research in dental schools, specifies the diverse groups involved in the clinical research enterprise, and identifies underutilized opportunities and partnerships for <b>clinical</b> research <b>training.</b> Data on federal and nonfederal funding of <b>clinical</b> research and <b>training</b> programs are presented.

25|$|Veterinary school {{curricula}} are not standardized, with programs lasting {{from three to}} six years.

For the first three years, students learn anatomy, physiology, histology, neuroanatomy, pharmacology, immunology, bacteriology, virology, pathology, parasitology, toxicology, herd health (also called population health), nutrition, radiography, and epidemiology. During the third year, students learn anesthesiology, diagnostics, surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dentistry. For the fourth year, often 12 months long instead of nine, students care {{for a wide range}} of animals. Clinical education is a focus of most veterinary {{school curricula}} worldwide.
