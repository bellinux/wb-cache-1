5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E

30|$|The {{value of}} traded goods {{directly}} affects {{the most competitive}} number of warehouses since <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> for stock in warehouses arise from stock level and stock value. Total stock level in the network results {{from the number of}} warehouses. Thus, high-value goods favor networks with fewer warehouses, in order to avoid <b>capital</b> <b>costs,</b> without respect on the oil price level as <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> are oil price–independent. The same effect can be assumed for a change of the interest rate on stock of currently 8 % in the model. Any rise of interests would increase the <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> and render a centralized distribution network more competitive compared to a decentralized. Vice versa, network decentralization becomes more cost efficient in times of low interests.|$|R

25|$|The {{potential}} benefit of retrofitting has so far, not offset {{the cost of}} IGCC with carbon capture technology. A 2013 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration demonstrates that the overnight cost of IGCC with CCS has increased 19% since 2010. Amongst the three power plant types, pulverized coal with CCS has an overnight <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of $5,227 (2012 dollars)/kW, IGCC with CCS has an overnight <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of $6,599 (2012 dollars)/kW, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS has an overnight <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of $2,095 (2012 dollars)/kW. Pulverized coal and NGCC costs did not change significantly since 2010. The report further relates that the 19% increase in IGCC cost is due to recent information from IGCC projects that have gone over budget and cost more than expected.|$|E

40|$|Low-carbon {{electricity}} generation, i. e. renewable energy, {{nuclear power}} and carbon capture and storage, is more capital intensive than electricity generation through carbon emitting fossil fuel power stations. High <b>capital</b> <b>costs,</b> expressed as high weighted average <b>cost</b> of <b>capital</b> (WACC), thus tend {{to encourage the}} use of fossil fuels. To achieve the same degree of decarbonization, countries with high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> therefore need to impose a higher price on carbon emissions than countries with low <b>capital</b> <b>costs.</b> This is particularly relevant for developing and emerging economies, where <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> tend to be higher than in rich countries. In this paper we quantitatively evaluate how high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> impact the transformation of the energy system under climate policy, applying a numerical techno-economic model of the power system. We find that high <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> can significantly reduce the effectiveness of carbon prices: if carbon emissions are priced at USD 50 per ton and the WACC is 3 %, the cost-optimal electricity mix comprises 40 % renewable energy. At the same carbon price and a WACC of 15 %, the cost-optimal mix comprises almost no renewable energy. At 15 % WACC, there is no significant emission mitigation with carbon pricing up to USD 50 per ton, but at 3 % WACC and the same carbon price, emissions are reduced by almost half. These results have implications for climate policy; carbon pricing might need to be combined with policies to reduce <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> of low-carbon options in order to decarbonize power systems...|$|R

25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high <b>capital</b> <b>cost,</b> which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC {{comes from the}} ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized cost of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh.
