Different polar siloxane copolymers have been synthesized via an anionic copolymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, [3 -(methacryloxy) propyl]pentamethylcyclotrisiloxane and pentamethylcyclotrisiloxanes with a pendant polar group, e. g. ester, ether, amide, keto or cyan group. Well-structured monomodal molecular weight polymers were obtained with molecular weight distributions from 1. 3 to 1. 7.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) is {{demonstrated}} to be a multifunctional structure-directing {{agent for the}} synthesis of aluminophosphate-based molecular sieves. Four types of molecular sieves, including SAPO- 34, - 35, AlPO- 9 and - 22, are {{for the first time}} acquired with MDEA as a novel template. The phase selectivity of the present synthesis is found to be condition-dependent. SAPO- 34 (CHA) crystallizes from a conventional hydrothermal system with a higher MDEA concentration. When using MDEA as both the template and solvent, pure SAPO- 35 (LEV) is obtained from the synthetic gel with a high P 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 ratio of (2 - 3), in which the concentration of MDEA could be varied in a wide range. AlPO- 9 and AlPO- 22 (AWW) are synthesized under the similar conditions to SAPO- 35, except without the addition of Si source. The physicochemical properties of the obtained samples are investigated by XRD, XRF, SEM, N- 2 physisorption. TG-DSC, and various NMR spectra (C- 13, Si- 29, Al- 22 and P- 31). Both SAPO- 34 and SAPO- 35 show good thermal stability, large surface area, and high pore volume. The catalytic performance of SAPO- 34 is evaluated by the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction and a <b>good</b> (<b>C</b> <b>2</b> H 4 + C 3 H 6) selectivity of 82. 7 % has been achieved.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{to testing}} object-oriented programs (OOPs) {{have been proposed}} for the past decade. However, most of these researches have centered only around the class-level testing instead of the whole profiles of OOP development. This paper presents a framework to test OOPs from em formal specification to em test data generation. The formal specification of object-oriented program is specified in Z notation which is a mathematically rigorous specification language. A state transition diagram (STD) derived from Z specification provides a complementary representation of the dynamic behavior of a given OOP. In addition, the STD {{can be used to}} generate a test data which consists of anticipated operation sequences of OOPs. Moreover, a testing algorithm modeled by em finite state machine is proposed to run against test data. Two important testing criteria, consistency and <b>completeness</b> (<b>C</b> & C), are used to evaluate testing result. The final test result shows that the testing framework is executable and pragmatic. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general space-efficient method for error reduction for unitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation with <b>completeness</b> <b>c</b> and soundness s, either {{with or without}} a witness (corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into a new computation with error at most 2 ^{-p}, the most space-efficient method known requires extra workspace of O(p*log(1 /(c-s))) qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper shows an errorreduction method for unitary quantum computations (i. e., computations without intermediate measurements) that requires extra workspace of just O(log(p/(c-s))) qubits. This in particular gives the first method of strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong amplification for matchgate computations...|$|R
