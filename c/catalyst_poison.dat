40|$|Although iron-based {{permeable}} reactive {{barriers are}} gaining {{importance in the}} treatment of groundwater contaminants, there have been field observations indicating that sulphide may affect the degradation rates of certain chlorinated ethenes. Previous observations suggest that sulphide has little effect on TCE degradation rates but can cause a significant decline in the rate of degradation of cis-DCE. This study was conducted to systematically test the effects of S 2 - on TCE, cis-DCE, trans-DCE, 1, 1 -DCE and VC. Two different concentrations of sulphide (5 and 50 mg/L) were used in the column experiments. The results showed that the rate of TCE degradation was only slightly reduce in the presence of sulphide, while there was substantial reduction in the rates of degradation of cis-DCE, 1, 1 -DCE and VC. Trans-DCE was affected by sulphide, however, not as severely as cis-DCE, 1, 1 -DCE and VC. Raman Spectra showed the presence of a small amount of sulphide precipitates, and corrosion potential measurements showed that sulphide shifted the corrosion potential of the iron to less negative values by approximately 70 mV, suggesting that the change in corrosion potential was not responsible for the preferential degradation of TCE relative cis-DCE and VC. The dominant pathway for TCE degradation is β-elimination, while that for cis-DCE and VC is generally considered to be hydrogenolysis, though there is also evidence in the literature indicating that cis-DCE and VC can also degrade by catalytic hydrogenation. The results indicate that sulphide does not inhibit β-elimination but severely limits the hydrogenolysis/catalytic hydrogenation pathway. The fact that sulphide inhibited the conversion of ethene to ethane, a known catalytic reaction, indicated that sulphide is acting as a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison.</b> It is therefore concluded that the primary mechanism for the transformation of cis-DCE to VC and for VC to ethene is catalytic hydrogenation, and that sulphide inhibits these transformations through its role as a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison...</b>|$|E

40|$|Synthesis gas {{generated}} by the gasification of nitrogen-containing hydrocarbons will contain ammonia. This is a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison</b> and elevated levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX) will be produced if the synthesis gas is combusted. This paper presents {{a study of the}} selective oxidation of ammonia in reducing environments. The concept is the same as in traditional selective catalytic reduction, where NOX are removed from flue gas by reaction with injected ammonia over a catalyst. Here, a new concept for the removal of ammonia is demonstrated by reaction with injected NOX over a catalyst. The experiments were carried out in a model synthesis gas consisting of CO, CO 2, H- 2, N- 2 and NH 3 /NOX. The performance of two catalysts, V 2 O 5 /WO 3 /TiO 2 and H-mordenite, were evaluated. On-site generation of NOX by nitric acid decomposition was also investigated and tested. The results show good conversion of ammonia under the conditions studied for both catalysts, and with on-site generated NOX. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Coating {{a carbon}} {{electrode}} surface, specifically highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with an ultrathin film of poly-(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, provides a support {{on which a}} high density of uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) can readily be formed by electrodeposition. The NPs tend to be much smaller, have a higher surface coverage, better dispersion and show a much lower tendency to aggregate, than Pt NPs produced under identical electrochemical conditions on HOPG alone. The electrocatalytic activity of the NPs was investigated for methanol (MeOH) and formic acid (HCOOH) oxidation. Significantly, for similarly prepared particles, Pt NP-PEDOT arrays exhibited higher catalytic activity (in terms of current density, based on the Pt area), towards MeOH oxidation, by an order of magnitude, and towards HCOOH oxidation at high potentials, than Pt NPs supported on native HOPG. These findings can be rationalised {{in terms of the}} enhanced oxidation of adsorbed CO, a key reaction intermediate and a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison.</b> This research provides strong evidence that employing conducting polymers, such as PEDOT, as a support substrate, can greatly improve particular catalytic reactions, allowing for better catalyst utilisation in fuel cell technology...|$|E

The effect on activity and selectivity of different cobalt oxide morphologies (cubes, sheets and belts) in Co 3 O 4 /SiO 2 model catalysts was studied against conventional near-spherical nanoparticles. With a combination of offline and specialized in situ characterisation techniques the stability and catalytic performance of the model catalysts was monitored. With TEM and XRD, the prepared nanosheets and nanobelts were identified as superstructures constituted by small crystallites with similar catalytic activity to conventional nanoparticles. The nanocubes however, consisting of single crystals or at least large crystalline domains, display a superior surface specific CO oxidation activity which is attributed to the preferential exposure of { 001 } planes.

The catalytic conversion was optimal at moderate metal loadings, stoichiometric excess of hydrogen, and relatively mild temperatures. The activity depended strongly on reactant feed composition but showed no dependence on total flow rate, indicating a diffusion-limited process. To investigate the effects of intra-particle diffusion limitations, internal diffusion coefficients for propylene in the MOF catalysts were measured with pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) and were incorporated into the kinetics analysis. Using these coefficients to compute effectiveness factors for heterogeneous catalytic reactions, diffusion-limited artifacts were accounted for to obtain intrinsic rate constants and activation energies from apparent kinetics data. The average intrinsic activation energy was found to be 51 (6) kJ/mol. The MOF catalyst was also found to be reversible under carbon monoxide poisoning, suggesting a weak binding mechanism...|$|E

Executive Summary Executive Summary The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) established in 2000 new far reaching emission standards beginning in 2007 for heavy-duty diesel vehicles and the fuel used in them. These standards were premised on the introduction of new catalyst based emission controls for diesel engines and the removal of a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison,</b> sulfur, from diesel fuel. The scale of the changes and the long-term benefit for society have only one parallel in the thirty plus year history of mobile source emission control: the introduction of unleaded gasoline and catalysts on cars in the 1970 s. The monetized benefits of this program exceed its cost by more than 16 to one. Given the scope of these new regulations and their importance for public health, it is only prudent that the Agency carefully follow the progress of industry in implementing this rule.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work on {{the ring}} opening polymerisation of some lightly fluorinated and chlorinated polycyclic monomers. The thesis {{is divided into three}} chapters. The first chapter reviews the utility of the metathesis reaction in organic chemistry in general and polymer chemistry in particular. Present understanding of the value and limitations of the reaction is discussed along with related mechanistic and theoretical background. The second charter is concerned with the synthesis, characterization and polymerization of some new fluorinated monomers. The way in which the choice of catalyst can influence the details of polymer chain microstructure is discussed for the particular case of polymers prepared from 2, 3 -bis(trifluoromethyl) bicyclo[2. 2. l]hepta- 2, 5 -diene using tungsten and molybdenum based catalysts. Catalyst selectivity in the polymerization of endo/exo mixtures of isomeric monomers is also examined. The third chapter describes work directed towards the synthesis of polyarylenevinylenes. The main part of this chapter is concerned with the synthesis, characterization and examination for polymerizability by metathesis ring opening, of a range of chlorinated bicyclo[3. 2. l]octa- 2, 6 -dienes.

40|$|The {{generation}} of {{large volumes of}} nitrate-containing wastewater is {{a major issue in}} the industrial production of solid catalysts such as Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 employed in methanol synthesis. Extensive washing with water is needed to remove nitrate (and sodium) residues in the as-precipitated metal hydroxy-carbonate catalyst precursors. Residual nitrate species promote severe metal agglomeration during the subsequent calcination stage, while Na can act as a <b>catalyst</b> <b>poison.</b> The use of (NH 4) HCO 3 rather than Na 2 CO 3 as precipitating agent results in Na-free metal hydroxy-carbonate precursors. Here we show that the calcination conditions applied for the Na-free, unwashed hydroxy-carbonate precursors can be adjusted to prevent metal agglomeration. Conventional calcination of unwashed precipitates in stagnant air results in poor Cu dispersions and catalytic activities. In contrast, efficient removal of the nitrate decomposition products by decomposing the unwashed precursors in a gas stream prevents metal agglomeration. Decomposition of the precipitate in a gas flow, particularly in O 2 -free gases, leads to catalysts as active as those obtained by conventional calcination after removal of the nitrate species by extensive washing of the precipitates. Hence, rational adjustment of the calcination conditions can significantly reduce the production of nitrate-containing wastewater during catalyst manufacture...|$|E
