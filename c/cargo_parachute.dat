The course provides training on inspecting, packing, rigging, recovering, storing, and maintaining air item equipment. It {{is divided into three}} phases. Air Drop Phase - Includes instruction in <b>cargo</b> <b>parachute</b> packing, rigging supplies and equipment for airdrop, types and limitations of aircraft. Students become proficient {{in the use of the}} various technical manuals for rigging airdrop loads. At the conclusion of the instruction, the students participate in an airdrop exercise. They pack the cargo parachutes, rig the loads to be dropped and place the loads in the aircraft. [...] After the airdrop, the students recover the loads and equipment. Aerial Equipment Repair Phase - Trains fundamentals and procedures of inspection, classification, and repair of maintenance of personnel, cargo, extraction parachutes and airdrop equipment to include the service of High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Automatic Ripcord Release (ARR). Parachute Pack Phase - Is designed to equip students with the working knowledge of inspection and packing procedures relative to personnel, light cargo and extraction parachutes. The student receives concentrated instruction on the troop back parachute. The student is required to jump the parachute he/she packed during the examination. Throughout the course, the student is constantly reminded of the fact that all parachutes must be packed with meticulous care to insure proper functioning. Any malfunction could result in death or in equipment loss.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{continuation}} of a previous work concerning the Affordable Guided Airdrop System (AGAS), a parachute structure that integrates low-cost guidance and control into fielded cargo air delivery systems. This thesis sought to integrate the previous studies and algorithms into developmental prototypes for test and evaluation (DTandE). Several objectives and tasks were completed {{in the course of this}} research and development. A RealSimR executable on an Integrated Systems, Incorporated (ISI) AC- 104 real-time controller integrated actual VertigoR, pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) into the MATRIX-XE environment simulation model used in the previous work to validate, analyze and improve the simulation model. A ground station utilizing the modelƦs control algorithms, a downlink of platform position and attitude data, and a FutabaR Pulse Code Modulated uplink demonstrated controlled guidance of a round <b>cargo</b> <b>parachute</b> (G- 12). This system evolved as an RS- 232 serial control RF modem uplink replaced the PCM signal. After evaluating, validating, and improving the algorithms from ground station control the model was written in C-code for incorporation into an autonomous system. The results from the drops were then analyzed again in the MATRIX_XR model to improve the model and further qualitatively evaluate optional control strategies.

Some of the areas {{that must be addressed}} include: a) system must be low in cost, b) system often has to be operated on ranges that have limited telemetry or other range instrumentation and support (i. e. commercial skydiving centers), c) system is often rigged and operated by parachute support personnel and test jumpers rather than instrumentation engineers, and d) system must be able to be reconfigured in the field to support a variety of test card requirements during a typical test day, e) data must be available for review and the system be prepared for the next test within a few minutes of parachute recovery, and f) system must withstand ground impact velocities as high as 50 ft/sec (15. 24 m/sec) without damage.

40|$|The Affordable Guided Airdrop System (AGAS) {{is being}} {{evaluated}} as a low-cost alternative {{for meeting the}} military’s requirements for precision airdrop. Designed {{to bridge the gap}} between relatively expensive high-glide ratio parafoil systems and uncontrolled ballistic parachutes, the AGAS concept offers the bene ts of high-altitude parachute releases as well as the potential for highly accurate point-of-use delivery of material. The design goal of the AGAS development is to provide a guidance, navigation, and control system that can be placed in line with <b>cargo</b> <b>parachute</b> systems, for example the G- 12 at-circular parachute, and standard delivery containers (A- 22) without modifying these elded systems. The AGAS is required to provide an accuracy of 328 ft (100 m), circular error probable (CEP), with a desired goal of 164 ft (50 m) CEP. The feasibility of this concept was investigated through modeling and simulation. A three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) point mass ight dynamics model, sensor models of a commercial global positioning system (GPS) receiver and magnetic compass, and a model of the control and actuator system were incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation tool. A bang-bang controller was implemented with trajectory tracking algorithms using position and heading information. Flight testing, using a radio-controlled scaled prototype, provided parachute dynamic and control response data to support themodeling efforts. The study demonstrated that this concept has the potential to provide control of previously unguided round parachutes to accuracies of approximately 210 ft (64 m) CEP.

40|$|The Air Launch System Enabling Technology (ALSET) {{project is}} a Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) funded project whose purpose is to study air launch orbital payload {{delivery}} systems and related technologies. The {{project is a}} first step toward an operational commercial air launch system that will use a multistage solid rocket to deliver small payloads on the order of 100 to 200 kilograms into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). An air drop type launch approach to space transportation provides high reliability, flexibility, and responsiveness to meet the future needs of small satellite operators. ALSET culminates in a series of drop tests of an inert launch vehicle (a mass simulator) to demonstrate the technologies necessary for the operational system. The baseline system design uses a carriage extraction system method whereby the rocket is extracted from a C- 130 aircraft on a TYPE-V platform. Two 28 -foot extraction parachutes are used to pull the platform from the aircraft. Three 100 -foot <b>cargo</b> <b>parachutes</b> are then deployed for deceleration prior to release of the rocket from the platform for launch. The baseline test site selected for the drop test is the Yuma Test Center (YTC) in Arizona, USA. The large drop zones available at the YTC are ideal for ALSET testing. Additionally, the YTC’s considerable experience with similar test activities, including the NASA Ares Jumbo Drop Test Vehicle drop tests, minimizes technical risks. The authors’ efforts to date completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the ALSET Drop Test in February and March 2015. The ALSET program is now ready for manufacturing for the ALSET Drop Test. As the prospective applications of ALSET to C 4 ISR missions, two case studies were conducted. The studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the air launch system.

40|$|During {{the first}} few seconds of an airdrop the payload interacts with the flow field behind the aircraft.

The major advantage of this approach, apart {{from the fact that}} it does not rely on simplified aerodynamic models, is its multi-body functionality. Thus, the relative motion of bodies, for example between payload and parachute, can easily be examined as kinematic constraints are considered.
