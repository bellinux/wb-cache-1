50|$|By the 1920s, {{about half}} of the Company's {{drilling}} was outside the continental United States. Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the chain of family ownership and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed Boart Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named Boart International. The new company developed the first mechanically-set diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits,</b> which were less expensive than the hand-set <b>core</b> <b>bits</b> that used more expensive Brazilian diamonds (carbonados).|$|E

5000|$|Diamond core {{drilling}} (exploration diamond drilling) utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated drill bit {{attached to the}} end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to make diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits</b> are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations [...] The diamonds are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions — lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Impregnated diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits</b> {{are often}} used in core {{drilling}} for geological surveys. A tri-state theory is proposed to describe the three states in drilling processes for a diamond particle or a bit. These states are contacting state, cutting state, and ploughing state. Furthermore, the relations among thrust and other mechanical parameters are also summarized. The optimal value of the specific energy is in the cutting state. Several experiment results verified the proposed model. This mechanism is useful for selecting operation parameters in core drilling using impregnated diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits...</b>|$|E

40|$|High-frequency/low-frequency {{drilling}} is {{an attractive}} technology for planetary exploration tools, and one which has seen considerable innovation in the techniques used to ensure rotation of the front-end cutting bit. This rotation is essential to prevent tooth imprintation in hard materials, and extracting the rotation from the high-frequency or ultrasonic system has obvious benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness. However, extracting the rotation from an ultrasonic horn raises the possibility of bit-walk if {{it is used to}} operate a coring device and the authors therefore propose an ultrasonic horn which uses an excitation applied to a single input surface to yield torsional and longitudinal vibration on two physically separated output surfaces. By engaging with the two output surfaces, longitudinal vibration can be extracted to achieve initial percussive drilling, even where a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is applied, and the torsional output can subsequently be added to prevent tooth imprintation once the <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> has settled into the site in question. In this manner, the horn provides a mechanism whereby high-frequency/low-frequency drilling technique can be applied to coring operations without the need for an exceptionally robust drill structure capable of resisting bit-walk forces...|$|R

The testing procedure for tension tests {{that enables the}} analysis of the influence of {{installation conditions}} on bond strength of anchors, and was therefore used in the experimental part of the research, is described in detail in this chapter as well. It has been frequently observed that the contractors of various construction works often use diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits</b> to drill holes necessary for the installation of bonded anchors. This drilling technique is often not tested and as such, it is not mentioned in the ETA approvals as appropriate for many types of bonded anchors. The obtained experimental results show that the drilling technique significantly influences the results of the tests. These results are of extreme importance to everybody who is involved in work with bonded anchors (i. e. design and consulting engineers, supervisors, clients, contractors and subcontractors, owners) since this data was so far lacking.

All of three tested products show significant bonded strength decrease when the anchors are installed in diamond drilled holes, compared to the values measured on anchors installed in hammer drilled holes. It can be expected that, based on the obtained results, all project stakeholders will have a higher level of awareness regarding the influence of the selection of drilling technique, if the anchors are not approved for this kind of installation.

40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density.
