The {{catalytic activity}} <b>of</b> metal <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> different types of Schiff base was analyzed and presented in this review. The manganese(III) Schiff base complexes exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes both in homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Similarly, the Schiff base <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> iron(III), cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) ions {{have been used as}} catalysts in the epoxidation of cyclohexene and oxidation of phenol. Polymer-supported iron(III) Schiff base complexes have demonstrated higher activity than unsupported and polymer-supported Schiff base <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> other metal ions. Similarly, the polymer-supported salen <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> ruthenium(Ill), iron(Ill) and Schiff base <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> molybdenum carbonyls have been used successfully as catalysts in the oxidation of cyclo-octene. The oxidation of styrene, limonene, stilbene. benzene and its alkyl derivatives, adamantane, benzyl alcohol, etc. was catalyzed significantly by polymer-supported Schiff base <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> different metal ions. The recyclability of polymer-supported Schiff base complexes has also been evaluated and presented in this review. The thermal and moisture stability of polymer-supported Schiff base complexes is responsible for their high activities in reactions involving high temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
