The current national fire safety standards {{do not give}} clear requirements on fire protection design. Fire safety design departments have difficulties in controlling the design, so there are many problems in the fire protection design to be solved. Based on structure characteristics and application status of large-scale commercial buildings, focusing on various existing difficulties in the indoor <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> fire protection design process, this thesis defines indoor <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> fire design ideas, and puts forward fire safety measures that should be taken in the interior <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> in the layout, fire separation, fire facilities, etc...|$|R

A review of Scandinavian studies [19] showed noise- and air-pollution improvements after the implementation of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets.</b> On the other hand, the implementation of environmental streets has not resulted in conclusive results. Furthermore, the environmental effects (e.g., noise) of environmental <b>streets</b> and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> on surrounding streets were negative.|$|R

40|$|Since 2000, Transport Department {{has been}} {{implementing}} pedestrian schemes in Hong Kong {{to provide a}} comfortable environment for pedestrians. Many {{studies have indicated that}} the retail environment in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> would be enhanced. This study was conducted to understand the theoretical concepts about the effects of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> to retailing. The distribution of different types of retailers in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> and the nearby streets was investigated and the reasons and possible effects of the above findings were also examined. Field survey on business inventory in Mong Kok, Causweay Bay and Sheung Shui was conducted. Descriptive statistics was then used to explain the results and chi-square test was devoted to examining whether types of retailers depend on street types. This study showed that types of retailers depend on street types and provided evidence to support pervious researches that specific retailers including chain stores, merchandise retailing or clothing, jewellery and watches shops tended to located in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> while some businesses including independent shops or shops selling low-end products were not. The impacts of implementing pedestrian schemes on the types of retailers were discussed. Since more visitors are willing to shop in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> due to pleasant environment, retail turnover would usually increase and some investors may want to open shops in the streets to make profits. As a result, property owners would feel more confident to increase the rent of shop to gain more money as the demand of the limited rental street space increases. Those privileged businesses, which can afford higher rent, can open shops in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> so the portion of underprivileged businesses in these streets is lower due to unaffordable rent. The study also indicated few more reasons to explain the distribution of retailers’ types. Accessibility is one the factors that affect the attractiveness of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets,</b> which also impact the retailers’ types. National economic trend and local factors would increase the portion of specific shops while market economy policy from the Government encourage distributing of retailers’ types using market principle. For the economic implications, privileged businesses would dominate <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> and affect economic diversity and businesses in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> would be affected by economic trend. Moreover, property owners can make more money as rents go up. For social implications, products available in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> become tourists-oriented and may not meet the local needs and local identity would gradually disappear. Finally, the study suggested the Government could provide space for independent retailers to continue their businesses and encourage underprivileged businesses to enhance their competiveness. Besides, in the policy point of view, the Government should assess the impacts on the distribution of retailers before implementing pedestrian schemes. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R
