5|$|Due {{to budget}} {{decreases}} and increased {{demands on the}} university, the UCF Board of Trustees, {{with the approval of}} the Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year. For the 2016-17 academic year, undergraduate tuition <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students, and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Graduate tuition <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students, and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Tuition for the medical school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students. Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $17,295 for Florida residents, and $33,392 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students, and $38,878 for out-of-state students. About 8% of tuition fees are allocated to support the university's athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Henry Holt {{abandoned}} the litigation, as the ongoing legal <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> becoming unsupportable. The print run of Bare-faced Messiah in the U.S. was ended after only 14,000 copies were printed.

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Germany was the toy making capitol of the world, but high {{importation}} costs made German toys relatively expensive in America.

50|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> {{that change}} in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also <b>be</b> considered normal <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct <b>costs,</b> however, <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> variable <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R
5000|$|Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> whereby {{materials}} and labor may be allocated based on past experience. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> a classification of costs by time.

5|$|After the {{enormous}} response to Myst, work quickly {{began on the}} next Myst game. Cyan moved from their cramped garage to a new office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year.

50|$|Indirect <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> not {{directly}} accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product).

The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone.

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, {{the company}} {{informed}} shareholders {{that it had}} failed to meet expectations, that company founder Shaun (Seán) McCarthy was being replaced as CEO, and that operating <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> nearly €1 million per year.

5000|$|Resource Costs: Resources {{consist of}} labor, {{equipment}}, materials, subcontractors, trucking, {{and any other}} cost detail items. Labor and equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> internal crew <b>costs,</b> whereas all other resource <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. Equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{average cost}} curve {{will have a}} U-shape, because fixed <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> all {{incurred}} before any production takes place and marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this [...] "typical" [...] case, for low levels of production marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> below average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal cost curve will intersect a U-shaped average cost curve at its minimum, after which point the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> above average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> increasing as quantity increases. An example of this typical case would be a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period: below a certain production level, average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> higher due to under-utilized equipment, while above that level, production bottlenecks increase the average cost.|$|R

5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%.
