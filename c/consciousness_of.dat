One {{of the most}} pronounced research domains in the recent times is study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> what we have chosen as our area of research. This field of research conglomerates both philosophy and phenomenology. Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> helped to derive the scientific interpretation of it, and phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> helped us to derive the computational aspect <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Scientific study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> is historically being the most challenging and has a history which is prolonged to origin of human civilisation. In all age, saints, philosophers, mathematicians and scientists have expressed their depiction about consciousness as the peak of their scientific arena. In recent times, one new dimension of scientific study <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> has emerged i. e., phenomenal view <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> which is proposed to develop computational aspect of it. The present paper is the resultant of my Phd research work on computational consciousness where we have started with philosophical interpretation <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in context with Vedic philosophy and derived few noble scientific definition and logical explanations <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Then, we have used the phenomenal aspects <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to design a computational model <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> architecture.

He thinks the <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E

Fury escapes to Rogers' apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a flash drive containing data from the ship. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive.

5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> {{a variety of}} different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E

The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter.
