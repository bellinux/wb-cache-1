40|$|Introduction: <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease from gastrointestinal tract. The increase in incidence and heterogeneity of this pathology, with different presentations and prognostics {{leads to a}} constant concern in developing and improving its classification and treatment. Objectives: To establish recommendations (based on level of evidence and recommendation grades) to 5 questions considered as the clinical challenges of the therapeutic approach in <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods: The methodology adopted by the working group DC 2 (Desafios Clínicos na Doença de Crohn) {{was based on the}} selection of 5 questions, by voting, and establishing recommendations to each question proposed to each subgroup. Discussion and approval of reflexions and final recommendations was carried out in a consensus meeting. Conclusion: It has been possible to base conclusions about the questions under study on evidence, being recommended: 1) having <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> under 40 years old, structuring phenotype disease and anal disease are predictive factors of bad prognostic; 2) it is possible to consider suspension of biologics in patients with endoscopic remission and normal biomarkers; 3) patients with biochemical markers of disease activity (CRP and calprotectina) have more probability of relapse; 4) in failure of biologics it is essential to assure that treatment with the first drug was optimized: with infliximab it s demonstrated that either reduction of the administration range or increasing the dose allows to recover the response in the majority of patients; as for adalimumab, patients should change from bimonthly to weekly administrations; 5) in case of <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> with intestinal surgery, use of therapeutic to reduce postoperative recurrence is indicated, particularly immunosupressors and biologics...|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) {{consists}} of two distinct clinical forms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (CD), with unknown aetiology, which nevertheless are considered to share almost identical pathophysiological backgrounds. Up to date, a full coherent mechanistic explanation for IBD is still lacking, but people start {{to realize that the}} pathogenesis of IBD involves four fundamental components: the environment, gut microbiota, the immune system and the genome. As a consequence, IBD development might be due to an altered immune response and a disrupted mechanism of host tolerance to the non-pathogenic resident microbiota, leading to an elevated inflammatory response. Considering the available data arising from the scientific literature, here reviewed, in CD, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven; in UC, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven, even if E. coli Nissle 1917 seems promising in maintaining remission and it could be considered an alternative in patients intolerant or resistant to 5 -ASA preparations; in pouchitis, small controlled trials suggest a benefit from VSL no. 3 in the primary and secondary prevention of pouchitis; in IBD-associated conditions, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven. However, well-designed randomized control clinical trials are necessary to understand the undoubted role of these agents in the management of gut physiology in health and diseas...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sarcoidosis, Blau {{syndrome}} and <b>Crohn</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> are complex disorders, characterised by granulomatous inflammation affecting {{a variety of}} organs. Mutations of the CARD 15 gene, on chromosome 16, {{have been shown to}} contribute significantly to <b>Crohn</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and to cause Blau syndrome. These factors prompted the current authors to study CARD 15 mutations in sarcoidosis. A total of 138 families were genotyped, including 302 patients with sarcoidosis and 127 patients without a family history of sarcoidosis (together with their parents), for four main coding CARD 15 polymorphisms associated with increased risk of <b>Crohn</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, the gene segment that harbours Blau syndrome mutations was sequenced in 39 selected patients from 39 families with affected siblings identical for one or two parental chromosomes 16 s and in eight patients from multi-case families. None of the reported Blau syndrome mutations and no new sequence alterations were found. There was an increased frequency of transmission of the rare allele of the polymorphic sites 802 CwT (SNP 5) and 2722 GwC (SNP 12) in {{at least one of the}} two study groups...|$|R
40|$|Background CARD 15 {{mutations}} alter bowel immunity {{and increase}} susceptibility to <b>Crohn</b> 0 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (CD). How-ever, {{the relation between}} these mutations and <b>Crohn</b> 0 <b>s</b> perianal fistulas has not been fully clarified. Aims To assess whether CARD 15 mutations are associ-ated with risk of developing Crohn’s perianal fistulas and whether these mutations are predictors of the response of perianal fistulas to antibiotics. Methods CARD 15 mutations were investigated in 203 consecutive CD patients. Presence/absence of history of perianal fistula was recorded. Patients with history of per-ianal fistula {{were divided into two}} groups (with/without CARD 15 mutations), and response to antibiotics was evaluated in both groups. Results Of the 203 patients, 60 (29. 6 %) showed at least one CARD 15 mutation and 55 (27. 1 %) had history of perianal fistula. History of perianal fistula was identified in 13 (21. 7 %) patients with mutations and in 42 (29. 4 %) patients without mutations (P = 0. 260). Mean age at diagnosis of first perianal fistula was similar in patients with/without CARD 15 mutations (28. 7 ± 9. 8 versus 29. 7 ± 10. 1 years, P = 0. 758). Average time between disease onset and diagnosis of first perianal fistula was also similar in the two groups (4. 6 ± 5. 1 versus 5. 0 ± 5. 9 years, P = 0. 816). Response of perianal fistulas to antibiotics (met-ronidazole alone or combined with ciprofloxacin) was significantly higher in patients without CARD 15 mutations (7. 7 % versus 40. 5 %, P = 0. 041). Conclusions In CD, CARD 15 mutations are not associ-ated with risk of developing perianal fistulas or with time of their outbreak. Nevertheless, patients with perianal fis-tulas and CARD 15 mutations showed worse response to antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|The term {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases (IBD) {{refers to}} two distinct clinical entities: <b>Crohn.</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and ulcerative cholitis, two chronic and non-specific disorders of unknown origin. Although quite uncommon and usually not life-threatening, IBDs {{have a strong}} economical impact, as they tend to affect patients in high productivity ages and require long and demanding therapies, medical and sometimes surgical. The pharmacological approaches to IBD treatment include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Aminosalicylic acids are {{the most widely used}} agents for maintaining remission and for the cure of mild-tomoderate forms of IBDs. This paper outlines the main pharmacological and clinical properties of one of these drugs, mesalamine (mesalazine). Mesalamine is the active moiety of sulfasalazine, an effective but not always tolerated agent. Mesalamine is available in several pharmaceutical forms, to be administered either by the oral or by the rectal route. As the therapeutic action of aminosalicylates is ascribed to their topical action on the inflamed intestine, while the adverse effects are believed to be caused by the systemically adsorbed (mainly in the first tract of the small bowel) fraction, slow-release formulations are usually preferred. From an economical point of view, mesalamine appears to have a moderate acquisition cost, widely offset by the savings induced on direct sanitary and, most importantly, indirect costs of IBDs. In particular, the availability of a generic drug with advanced colon-delivery technology provides the physician with the opportunity to treat patients with the best available technology at a reasonable price...|$|E
40|$|Objectives, Comparative {{outcomes}} {{of patients with}} ulcerative colitis, UC, and <b>Crohn,</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> CD, prescribed a biologic therapy are inconclusive. The aim {{of this research was}} to characterize the degree of unmet medical need in patients with UC or CD and to identify the potential role for new therapies. Methods, A systematic literature review was undertaken of studies reporting outcomes {{associated with the use of}} existing biologic therapies in patients with UC or CD, focusing on the nature and rate of treatment failure. To complement the systematic review, contemporaneous data were obtained from a survey of practising gastroenterologists in the UK and France. Data were qualitatively combined in a narrative framework to evaluate the degree of unmet medical need among patients with UC or CD. Results, Studies identified in the systematic review, n, were heterogeneous, particularly with respect to the definitions of treatment failure, estimates of treatment failure were high but uncertain. On the basis of standardized definitions, estimates of treatment failure provided by clinicians, n, were high, and they were higher for second-line treatment failure, primary, secondary, compared with first-line treatment failure, primary, secondary,. The majority of the systematic review and survey data were reflective of outcomes with infliximab and adalimumab. Conclusion, High treatment failure rates associated with existing biologics, identified by the review and clinician surveys, indicate a need for other biologic treatment options to improve the management and outcomes for people with UC and CD. Outcomes associated with existing and new biologic treatments should be investigated in head-to-head randomized trials in the context of their likely uses in clinical practice.

It is unknown whether patients with Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> can utilise an attentional strategy, and what effect this strategy {{would have on the}} premovement cortical activity. Movement-related potentials were recorded from 12 Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients and controls performing externally cued finger tapping movement, allowing an examination of cortical activity related to movement performance and bradykinesia in this disease. All subjects were tested in two conditions, which differed only by {{the presence or absence of}} the cognitive strategy. The Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> group, unlike controls, did not produce a rising premovement potential in the absence of the strategy. The Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> group did produce a rising premovement potential for the strategy condition, but the early slope of the potential was significantly reduced compared with the control group 2 ̆ 7 s early slope.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease that is characterised by symmetric polyarthritis leading to progressive joint destruction. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to contribute to better knowledge of the etiology of RA by investigating {{the importance of the}} inflammatory reflex, childhood infections and early life exposures as risk factors for RA, based on four epidemiological studies. In the first study we explored the importance of birth characteristics and infections {{during the first year of}} life on the risk of later RA and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Using data from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, the Swedish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Register and the Swedish Medical Birth Register, we conducted two parallel case-control studies on 333 cases of early adult onset RA and 3334 cases of JIA, and four matched controls per case. We noted an increased risk for JIA and rheumatoid factor (RF) negative RA following hospitalisation for infection during the first year of life. A somewhat reduced risk for RA was suggested for low birth weight, being small for gestational age and preterm birth. In the second study we aimed to confirm, in a larger study population, the role of infections during early childhood on the risk of developing RA and to extend the assessment of infections to encompass infections throughout childhood. We performed a case-control study using 3038 RA cases, born 1949 or later, identified in the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Register, and five matched population based controls per case. Exposure information was retrieved from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. Overall, hospitalisation for any infection before 16 years of age was associated with anincreased risk of developing RA. No overall difference was noted between RF positive and RF negative RA although RF negative RA was associated with infections during the first year of life and RF positive RA was associated with infections at 8 to 15 years. In the third study we aimed at exploring the role of the inflammatory reflex on the risk of RA. In two parallel case-control studies of 63 092 prevalent and 2548 incident RA cases identified in the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Swedish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Register respectively, and matched population based controls, we assessed the association between surgical vagotomy and subsequent risk of developing RA. Vagotomy had no effect on the risk of developing RA. In the fourth study we searched to investigate the role of the inflammatory reflex in humans indirectly, through the effect of nicotine. Using a design where we compared disease risks associated with smoking and with use of moist snuff, we aimed to disentangle the role of nicotine from the effect of other inhaled components of tobacco smoke on the development of chronic inflammation. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on the risk of RA, ulcerative colitis, <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> sarcoidosis and multiple sclerosis associated with smoking and use of moist snuff, using a uniquely large cohort of 277 777 Swedish construction workers, who provided prospectively collected information on tobacco using habits between 1978 and 1993. Cross-linkage to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register provided information on occurrence of disease outcome. Our results confirm and extend previous observations that smoking is a risk factor for (RF positive) rheumatoid arthritis, <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and multiple sclerosis, that quitting smoking reduces these risks, that smoking cessation increases the risk of ulcerative colitis and that smoking reduces the risk of sarcoidosis. In sharp contrast, we noted no evidence of any association between use of moist snuff and the risk of either of these chronic inflammatory diseases, with the exception of a borderline increased risk for MS, together indicating no major effect of the inflammatory reflex in the etiology of chronic inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|The pouch-related fistulas {{range in}} {{literature}} from 2 % to 16 % {{and they can}} be cause of failure of the intervention of restorative proctocolectomy. Aim {{of this study was to}} examine factors associated with theirs development and to identify theirs possible etiology and pathogenesis. Retrospective study focusing on 100 consecutive patients who underwent restorative proctocolectomy with pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Patients with fistula and patients without fistula have been identified and the fistula type, the time from surgery and the site relative to IPAA have been recorded. Patients' demographics, co-morbidity or related medical history, clinical indication for treatment, surgical method, histological diagnosis, length of follow-up, early and late postoperative complications have been reviewed, and data collected have been compared among the two groups through univariate analysis. The overall incidence of fistulas was of 10 % (10 cases); 8 cases had pouch-vaginal fistulas, involving the distal tract of the vagina, and associated with pouch-perineal fistulas in 2 cases; 1 case had pouch-vulval fistula; 1 case had a complex pouch-perineal fistula. Three fistulas were precocious, all associated with an IPAA leak; 2 of these cases also had pelvic sepsis while the third had delayed diagnosis of <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Seven fistulas had a late development. Four fistulas occurred at the level of the IPAA; 5 fistulas were located below the IPAA, and 1 fistula originated above and below the IPAA. When the two groups of patients were compared we found that there was an higher percentage of perineal or anal disease (40. 0 % vs 2. 2 %; p < 0. 001), of extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (40. 0 % vs 3. 3 %, p < 0. 001), and of leak of the IPAA (40. 0 % vs 11. 1 %; p < 0. 05) in the group with fistula vs the group without fistula. A direct link with the leak of the IPAA appears in all the early fistulas, while the cryptoglandular infection was suggested as a possible cause of the late fistulas located below the IPAA; the association with the extraintestinal manifestations of IBD could show a correlation between the fistulas and an higher specific activity of the underlying chronic inflammatory disease...|$|E
40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammation}} of the colon which together with the related <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (CD) represent the major forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is believed to arise in a dysfunctional intestinal barrier which allows the normal gut flora to trigger an unwanted chronic immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. The cause of these illnesses is unknown, and treatment today is solely to alleviate the symptoms. In order to identify biomarkers that could help us to further {{our understanding of the}} pathophysiology of UC, we applied the subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) method to identify UC-differentially regulated genes in colonic mucosal biopsy specimens (Paper I). The 331 differentially expressed genes were grouped into functional categories and when analyzed revealed a gene expression pattern consistent with UC as an inflammatory disorder with altered epithelial homeostasis. Interestingly, 21 genes were found to be involved in membrane trafficking. Moreover, 37 of the 331 genes were unknown genes with no predicted function. Based on the sequence homology to the WASP-protein (connected to the immunodeficiency disorder Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) one unknown gene was selected for further investigation. We named the gene WAFL. While the initial characterization of WAFL revealed a broad tissue expression, qPCR analysis indicated that WAFL was upregulated in inflamed tissue of UC compared to inflamed tissue from CD patients (i. e. consistent with the SSH data). To learn about the function of this protein we initiated a detailed investigation. One approach was to obtain the structure of the protein. In Paper II, the expression of regions of WAFL in E. coli, and in insect cells via a baculoviral system, is described. These peptides were purified and were found to be folded correctly. They have subsequently been used for functional tests of WAFL. The major finding in my thesis, Paper III, links WAFL to regulation of early endosomes. WAFL interacts with actin and WASP-interacting protein (WIP), which implies a role in actin-based transport of the endosomes. Moreover, cells depleted of WAFL by RNAi exhibited a disturbed transport of endocytic cargo towards lysosomes. Protein mapping experiments showed that the endosome localization is mediated by WAFL s central coiled-coil domain. This domain of WAFL binds to the integral membrane components monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, in particular PtdIns(3) P which is found on early endosomes. Interestingly, WAFL appears also on the phagosome of invasive bacteria such as Salmonella, Yersinia, and Shigella indicating that WAFL may be involved in the phagocytosis process. The observation that induced expression is observed in macrophages support this possibility. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel gene, WAFL, from UC bioptic material. This interesting gene is upregulated in inflamed tissue of UC patients and has potential functions in the correct processing of phagosomes and early endosomes...|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) {{comprising}} <b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and {{ulcerative colitis}} {{is a disease}} that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in northern countries such as Sweden, and is characterised by chronic uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It is the general belief that multiple factors such as genetic and environmental aspects are involved in disease pathogenesis. Alterations in T cell subsets, an important cell type in cell-mediated immune responses in the adaptive immune system, are certainly one element contributing to disease development. The present work was aimed at elucidating {{the role of the}} T cells in the pathogenesis of a mouse model for inflammatory bowel disease, Galphai 2 -deficient (Galphai 2 -/-) mice. These mice spontaneously develop a lethal colitis strikingly similar to ulcerative colitis in humans. This study demonstrates that one or several secondary genetic factor(s) in addition to the Galphai 2 deficiency, possibly involving regulation of IL- 12 p 40 production, has to be fulfilled for colitis to develop. Galphai 2 -deficient mice were shown to have a seriously impaired T cell development associated with accelerated thymic involution, decreased recruitment of T cell precursors to the thymus due to diminished responsiveness to CXCL 12, reduced frequency of apoptotic CD 4 +CD 8 - and CD 4 -CD 8 + thymocytes suggesting impaired negative selection, and insufficient down regulation of CD 69 on mature CD 4 + T cells, indicating impaired thymic egression. The impaired T cell ontogeny in Galphai 2 -/- mice was demonstrated to have great implications on the ability of the peripheral T cell repertoire to regulate the normal state of "physiologic inflammation" in the intestinal mucosa: Splenic, but not mesenteric lymph node Galphai 2 -/- T cells, were shown to be highly colitogenic when adoptively transferred into immunodeficient hosts. The effector function of peripheral as well as mucosal T cells from Galphai 2 -/- mice were shown to be T helper 1 (Th 1) dominated following stimulation with superantigens, bacterial products or dietary proteins. Th 1 associated and pro-inflammatory mediators such as IFN-gamma and IL- 12 are likely to instigate the immune response initiating what will result in established chronic colitis in Galphai 2 -/- mice. Furthermore, we show that the lifespan of Galphai 2 -/- mice could be substantially prolonged following reconstitution with wild type bone marrow cells. Finally and surprisingly, by inhibiting the recruitment of T cells to the inflamed tissue by administration of antibodies specific for integrin alpha 4, the colonic inflammation was aggravated. The aggravated colitis was accompanied by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and was believed to be, at least in part, explained by in situ proliferation of activated mucosal resident T cells. Collectively these results conclude that T cells are highly important for disease development in Galphai 2 -/- mice...|$|E
40|$|<b>Crohn</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown aetiology and characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation. Disabling bowel symptoms, untoward effects of treatments and interventions, {{the risk of}} developing colorectal cancer in longstanding UC, ignorance of the disease, disappointment in conventional medicine, all these features may influence the patient s health related quality of life (HRQOL) in various ways. The aims of this study were to assess the attitudes to and the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with IBD, and to evaluate interventions such as a group based educational programme, colonoscopic surveillance, treatment with leukocyte apheresis and its effect on HRQOL, functional health status, general state of health as well as anxiety and coping ability in patients with IBD. Two hundred and eighty-nine IBD patients in four different countries answered a self-administered questionnaire concerning the use of and attitudes to CAM. Fifty-one percent used some form of alternative therapy. The usage was higher in North America than in Europe. The six most commonly used therapies were: exercise (28 %), prayer (18 %), counselling (13 %), massage (11 %), chiropractic (11 %) and relaxation (10 %). Only 7 % used acupuncture or homeopathy and 5 % used herbal medicine. Forty-one patients with longstanding, extensive/total UC in remission undergoing colonoscopic colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance were compared with two groups of UC patients not undergoing surveillance. Four self-administered questionnaires were used: Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Health Index (HI), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Sense of Coherence (SOC). No significant differences between the groups studied were found using any of the questionnaires nor before or after the colonoscopy. Thirty-four UC patients underwent weekly one hour apheresis sessions with a selective leukocyte adsorptive device for five consecutive weeks. HRQOL was measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) before, at week 3, and after treatment. The mean IBDQ increased from 138 (range 97 - 208) at start to 154 (95 - 214) at week 3 (p= 0. 001) and 163 (117 - 216) after treatment (p= 0. 0006). When analysed separately, the IBDQ bowel, systemic and emotional dimensions improved significantly during the study. Forty-four IBD patients in remission or with low disease activity were randomized to a group-based medical and psychological/psychosocial intervention or to a control group. The intervention comprised nine weekly sessions with lectures and psychological/psychosocial group treatment. HRQOL was measured by the IBDQ and coping by the SOC before, at 6 and 12 months. The control patients received conventional medical and psychosocial treatment. No significant change was observed for IBDQ before (173. 9) and after the intervention at month 6 (175. 7), or at month 12 (171. 8) or when comparing intervention (171. 8) and controls (173. 7) at month 12. Similarly, no significant differences in SOC scores were observed. However, the mean values from a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the results from a content analysis showed a positive trend. There is an increased interest in CAM among IBD patients, and this may reflect the patients disappointment of conventional medicine. Complicated and invasive interventions such as colonoscopic surveillance (for detecting CRC), and selective leukocyte apheresis do not seem to impair HRQOL in UC patients.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.
