3000|$|The {{learning}} curve for GRS {{shows that the}} experts continue to improve their score until the seventh repetition, which might be a later plateau phase than one expects. A possible explanation {{could be that the}} white plastic HYSTT model does not resemble the uterus in a very <b>close</b> <b>matter,</b> as indicated by the expert opinion. The anatomical terms were considered confusing for several uterine locations. For example, [...] "cornua" [...] implies the region where a fallopian tube enters the uterine cavity. The HYSTT model contains specific spots for both [...] "cornua" [...] and [...] "tubal ostium", which are located very close to each other and without any further clues concerning the differentiation between these anatomical terms. These locations were frequently mixed up by several experts throughout the repetitions, which led to lower GRS scores. Also, in the HYSTT model, the cervical canal is absent and therefore the hysteroscope can slip out of the uterus without visual warning.|$|E

This report addresses the activities the Division undertook from fiscal years 2001 through 2007 to implement its enforcement responsibilities through four of its sections (1) Employment Litigation, (2) Housing and Civil Enforcement, (3) Voting, and (4) Special Litigation. To conduct our review, GAO analyzed data on cases filed in court and matters (e. g., a referral or allegation of discrimination) investigated. To supplement this analysis, GAO also reviewed a sample of <b>closed</b> <b>matter</b> files (about 210 of 5, 400). GAO randomly selected matters investigated under different statutes for each section and considered the government role (e. g., plaintiff or defendant) and type of issues investigated (e. g., the nature of the alleged discrimination or violation) to ensure that the sample reflected the breadth of the work and practices of each section.

However, questions pertaining to Russian arms trade have subsequently become common knowledge. As in the case of soccer, everyoneâwith the possible exception of small childrenâhas begun taking an interest. This has resulted in numerous, frequently superficial and one-sided assessments that, unfortunately, have had serious negative consequences for Russia's national interests. For example, by selling arms, Russia is promoting their proliferation throughout the world and the perpetuation of tension in various regions of the globe. Moreover, it is said that Russia bears principal responsibility for the continuing proliferation of arms in the world. In addition, it is said that arms exports, which are the driving force behind arms production, impede the conversion of the Russian defense complex and its transition to the market. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} methodological dilemmas on {{the qualitative}} scientific writing process arising from anonymization practices, over {{a tendency to}} assume it as an easy and quick preliminary procedure to be performed when analyzing data. Ethical issues are pervasive along both social science practices and paradigms. Sociologists’ commitment to ethical principles is taught and gradually learned during academic training, later accepted through professional institutional membership and derived codes of ethical and professional conduct. Despite commonly associated with research procedures, the issues of security, anonymity and privacy of research subjects are not <b>closed</b> <b>matters</b> when finishing fieldwork, data gathering or obtaining advanced informed consent. Writing often brings out the anonymity versus visibility dilemma, on the one hand, forcing the researcher to decide between respecting subjects’ rights, needs, values, and desires; science, scientific and researcher’s aims, on the other. In this paper, {{we turn to the}} analysis of a case taken from the conduction of a sociological qualitative study based on interviews. While revealing the pitfalls behind a seemingly easy operation as the assignment of pseudonyms, empirical illustration also stresses out how ethical issues are pervasive to data analysis and writing and, in that sense, a never-ending process...|$|R
