40|$|Abstract only availableWith {{the rising}} concern of {{terrorist}} activity {{around the globe}} today, blast resistant design is becoming a necessity. Stay-in-place formed concrete is becoming a popular building technique, as this technology has exhibited outstanding results in blast resistant applications, containing the fragmented concrete and preventing it from entering a building and endangering those within. A test {{has been designed to}} determine the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>joints</b> in walls of this type, as there will undoubtedly be interruptions of a pour. A solution commonly used in the field to alleviate the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>joints</b> in structural concrete involves applying a bonding agent between the hardened concrete and the fresh. The test was developed using ASTM standards C 78 and C 1042 as guides, to accurately predict the behavior of wall sections containing <b>cold</b> <b>joints</b> when exposed to pure moment. The basic test design is to submit a sample to bending to determine its moment capacity and maximum deflection, inducing an equal moment within the loading span. While the test is in progress, mid-span deflection will be recorded at incremental loadings, noting the maximum deflection and load as the section fails. <b>Cold</b> <b>joints</b> within samples will be located center span, in the region where uniform moment will be induced. This should force the break to the center, to the joint in question. The results from samples with the bonding agent should shed some light on the overall applicability of a bonding agent. In this sort of application, the strength of the wall derives more from the mass of concrete within, rather than the strength of such, so samples with <b>cold</b> <b>joints</b> are expected to have comparable ultimate behavior.

And then the general discomforts of his position had been too great to admit of relief from delicate dishes. There was the tea-pot on the table, and the solitary cup, and the bread and butter, and the nearly naked bone of a <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> of mutton.

60|$|It was the queerest of rooms, fitted and {{furnished}} {{more like}} a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg. There were two wooden settles by the fire, one {{on either side of}} it, with a corresponding table before each. On one of these tables, the eight volumes were ranged flat, in a row, like a galvanic battery; on the other, certain squat case-bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange glances with Mr Wegg over a front row of tumblers and a basin of white sugar. On the hob, a kettle steamed; on the hearth, a cat reposed. Facing the fire between the settles, a sofa, a footstool, and a little table, formed a centrepiece devoted to Mrs Boffin. They were garish in taste and colour, but were expensive articles of drawing-room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling. There was a flowery carpet on the floor; but, instead of reaching to the fireside, its glowing vegetation stopped short at Mrs Boffin's footstool, and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust. Mr Wegg also noticed, with admiring eyes, that, while the flowery land displayed such hollow ornamentation as stuffed birds and waxen fruits under glass-shades, there were, in the territory where vegetation ceased, compensatory shelves on which the best part of a large pie and likewise of a <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> were plainly discernible among other solids. The room itself was large, though low; and the heavy frames of its old-fashioned windows, and the heavy beams in its crooked ceiling, seemed to indicate that it had once been a house of some mark standing alone in the country.|$|E

60|$|There {{was nothing}} about the supper party on that {{particular}} Sunday evening in November at Daisy Villa, Green Street, Streatham, which seemed to indicate {{in any way that}} one of the most interesting careers connected with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to the disaster which befell that little gathering. The villa was the residence and also--to his credit--the unmortgaged property of Mr. David Barnes, a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent character, some means, and Methodist proclivities. His habit of sitting without his coat when carving, although deprecated by his wife and daughter on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter, was a not unusual one in the neighbourhood; and coupled with the proximity of a <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> of beef, his seat at the head of the table, and a carving knife and fork grasped in his hands, established clearly the fact of his position in the household, which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led the casual observer to doubt. Opposite him, at the other end of the table, sat his wife, Mrs. Barnes, a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour, a black satin frock, and many ornaments. On her left the son of the house, eighteen years old, of moderate stature, somewhat pimply, with the fashion of the moment reflected in his pink tie with white spots, drawn through a gold ring, and curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling waistcoat. A white tube-rose in his buttonhole might have been intended as a sort of compliment to the occasion, or an indication of his intention to take a walk after supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood. Facing him sat his sister--a fluffy-haired, blue-eyed young lady, pretty in her way, but chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of self-consciousness blended with self-satisfaction, and possessed only at a certain period in their lives by young ladies of her age. It was almost the air of the cat in whose interior reposes the missing canary, except that in this instance the canary obviously existed in the person of the young man who sat at her side, introduced formally to the household for the first time. That young man's name was--at the moment--Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald.|$|E

5000|$|While {{heat flux}} {{sensors can be}} made {{according}} to various designs, the sensor of a Gardon gauge consists of a foil connected to the sensor body at its external radius, and connected to a thin wire at the center, named after its originator Robert Gardon. The foil center and side are the hot- and <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> of a thermocouple respectively. When radiation hits the sensor this generates a signal. It is typically water-cooled and does not require any power to operate.A so-called Schmidt-Boelter Gauge has the same outward appearance as a Gardon Gauge, but employs different sensor technology. The Schmidt-Boelter has a plated constantan wire wrapped around an insulating chip. Both are heat flux sensors. The only difference is practical; Gardon gauges can be manufactured {{in such a way}} that they withstand extremely high flux levels. The range for Schmidt-Boelter technology is more limited. On the other hand the Schmidt-Boelter technology can reach higher sensitivities at a lower response time.Please note: Images on this page are of a Schmidt-Boelter gauge.

As experimental factors of this mockup test, concrete placing time was set 0. 5 and 1. 5 hours, and the intervals of concrete placing time was set at 1, 2 and 3 hours.

MethodsThe data were obtained from a randomized clinical trial. One hundred ninety-four RA patients were treated with the biomedical therapy (diclofenec, methotrexate and sulfasalazine). ACR 20 response in 24 weeks was used for the efficacy evaluation. Eighteen symptoms (including 13 extraarticular symptoms) that TCM practitioners focus on were collected for exploration on the association between the symptoms and the efficacy of the biomedical therapy with association rules method. ResultsAfter 24 weeks, a total of 135 patients receiving biomedicine had achieved an ACR 20 response. The association rules analysis on each symptom showed that soreness in the waist was more associated with ACR 20 response, but with lower support (selected sample size based, 20. 10 % and 14. 95 % respectively); cold intolerance and <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> were found to be associated with ACR 20 response with higher support (48. 97 % and 53. 61 % respectively), and the confidences (predicted effective rate) were 73. 08 % and 71. 23 % respectively. The associations between combination of symptoms (among them, there was at least one extraarticular symptom) and ACR 20 response indicated that cold intolerance or <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> with higher confidence and support were the most important extraarticular symptoms.

40|$|The {{buildings}} made of monolithic {{reinforced concrete}} currently enjoy great popularity. Along {{with a great}} number of advantages of monolithic building, which are repeatedly listed in the works of many authors, there are many unexplored issues which require detailed consideration. The technological concrete joints are among them. The joints are inevitable in the process of construction of almost any monolithic building and their quality affects the reliability of buildings and structures. Despite regular use of the concept of <b>cold</b> <b>joint</b> and clear instructions in building standards on the technology of joint production, most organizations do not follow the correct technology of concreting the elements. As a result, the strength and stiffness characteristics of the construction deteriorate, because the linkage value of new concrete with the old one is significantly lower than in monolith. In order to conduct experimental studies the reinforced concrete beams of rectangular section were produced. As a result of testing, it was determined that the presence of a concrete joint significantly reduces the stiffness and carrying capacity of the structures. It is confirmed {{by the fact that the}} received deflections of solid beams without joint are significantly lower than the deflections of beams with <b>cold</b> <b>joint.</b> It also noted that the deflections of the beams manufactured following the normative technology are lower, than the deflections of the beams, manufactured with violation of the rules. Basing on the obtained results, it was concluded, that more detailed study of the work of a construction with cold joints in concrete is required. The reason for it is in the changing for the worse of the strength and stiffness characteristics of structural element, which is made produced with a joint, while in the process of real designing, the monolith buildings are calculated as solid monolithic, without joints...|$|E
