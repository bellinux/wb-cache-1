25|$|When in port, the ensign {{should always}} be flown from {{the staff at the}} stern. This is traditional, because in former times the gaff was then lowered along with the mizzen sail. The only ensign ever flown from the {{starboard}} spreader or yardarm is that of a nation being visited. This is known as a courtesy hoisting of a <b>courtesy</b> <b>Flag.</b>|$|E
25|$|Motor boats without masts {{should always}} fly the ensign from an ensign {{staff at the}} stern. Conventionally, <b>courtesy</b> <b>flags</b> are flown from the jackstaff at the bow. This seems to some landsmen as being a {{reversal}} of priorities. However, a boat is steered by the stern and this gives it pride of place.|$|R

25|$|The Red Ensign undefaced {{is for the}} use of {{all other}} British {{merchant}} navy ships and private craft. The Red Ensign is the correct flag to be worn as <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag</b> by foreign private vessels in United Kingdom waters. Merchant vessels from British overseas territories and Crown dependencies are entitled to red ensigns defaced with the badge of their territory.|$|E
25|$|Nautical {{etiquette}} {{requires that}} merchant vessels dip their ensigns in salute to passing warships, which acknowledge the salute by dipping their ensigns in return. Contrary {{to popular belief}} the United States Navy does dip the Stars and Stripes in acknowledgement of salutes rendered to it. Merchant vessels traditionally fly the ensign of the nation in whose territorial waters they are sailing at the starboard yard-arm. This {{is known as a}} <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag,</b> as for yachts.|$|E
25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they {{can mean the difference}} between life and death, and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag).</b> To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E

500|$|Use of the Saltire at sea as a Jack or <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag</b> {{has been}} observed, {{including}} as a Jack on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) Jura. [...] The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a Jack on vessels {{which have a}} bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating {{in and around the}} Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a jack or <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag,</b> may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, [...] "MIKE", which is used to indicate [...] "My vessel is stopped; making no way." [...] Obviously mariners who understand this signal code also understand that the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>{{courtesy}}</b> <b>flag</b> (or courtesy ensign) is {{flown by}} a visiting ship in foreign waters as {{a token of}} respect. It is often a small (that is, smaller than the ship's own national ensign) national maritime flag of the host country, although there are countries (such as Malta) where the national, rather than the maritime flag is correct. [...] The flag is customarily worn at the foremasthead of multi-masted vessels, the dockside yardarm or crosstree of the mast of single-masted vessels, while the house flag would be outboard. [...] It may be flown from the jackstaff of vessels without masts.|$|E

50|$|In some {{countries}} yacht ensigns {{are different from}} merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying cargo that requires a customs declaration. Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be smuggling in many jurisdictions. There is a system of international maritime signal flags for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well, semaphore flags {{can be used to}} communicate on an ad hoc basis from ship to ship over short distances.Traditionally, a vessel flying under the <b>courtesy</b> <b>flag</b> of a specific nation, regardless of the vessel's country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her 'host' nation.|$|E
