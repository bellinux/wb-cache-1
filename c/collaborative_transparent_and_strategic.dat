Giving citizens, companies, and non-governmental organizations the chance to participate in government does not necessarily mean they will do it. Consequently, open government communities face a participation challenge. Current research shows that the design of the community plays a critical role in participation. Some design patterns foster participation while other patterns discourage it.

40|$|There is {{a driving}} {{societal}} and legislative shift from citizens having limited tokenistic consultation on matters that affect them, towards directly influencing decision-making processes. Flood risk management is no exception. This research first explores {{both domestic and}} international flood risk management processes in a view to identify deficiencies in current practice. It is argued that public participation and evaluation requirements although mandated in many jurisdictions, are not adequately addressed in current processes. In response, a new flood risk management cycle bridging these deficiencies is presented as an alternative. Secondly, this research presents a new engagement-focused decision support model, which in turn predicates the development of engagement decisions support systems as mechanisms to enhance and assist flood risk management processes and their outcomes. These systems as documented in the thesis combine heuristic, engineering and scientific knowledge with multi criteria, decision support and public participation theory through an online or standalone computer system, to empower the public (i. e everyone including the community, elected representatives, planners, engineers etc.) to derive informed preferred solutions and make collective considered decisions about complex engineering alternatives. Application of the model through an online engagement decision support system for flood risk management options was undertaken for three trial New South Wales catchments {{on the east coast}} of Australia to support and validate the thesis. It is argued that this model can be applied to all jurisdictions due to the flexibility in its framework, allowing organisational and/or legislative requirements to be achieved. It was shown that individuals utilising this model were able to overcome narrow uninformed preferences, selecting robust solutions that better reflect preference choices of learned flood managers. Thirdly, it is argued the engagement-focused decision support model has broader application to other engineering and non-engineering fields that involve social, safety, economic, environmental, political, technological etc. tradeoffs. It is foreseen this model can lead to significant advancement in traditional decision making, as engagement decision support systems could provide a mechanism to enable a truly <b>collaborative,</b> <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> inclusive participatory process that rightfully empowers the community to make informed decisions about engineering choices that affect them...|$|R

In these tough financial times, sustainability is a tool to help us achieve our mission with fewer resources and fewer dollars. CDC is dedicated to promoting the health and wellness of the American people, and we can do more of that by being better stewards of our funds and our material resources. To this end, CDC continues to participate, support and engage with the Departmental HHS Sustainability Taskforce.

The article deals with the research problem of modelling intelligent levers for monitoring collaborative activities of the virtual teams. The conceptual model of the balanced scores was suggested and evaluated by empirical investigation. The experimental study has been conducted by organizing international teamwork, and using virtual collaboration environment for devel-opment of e-commerce projects. The statistical and qualitative methods were used to derive indicators for evaluation of the project teamwork, which could be most effective while implemented in the virtual envi-ronment as the automated monitoring tools. The performance indicators were researched for scoring ef-fectiveness of the virtual teamwork, indicating drawbacks, forecasting the outcomes of the project, and evaluating input of the individual performance of the team members.

40|$|Medicine can {{not only}} be read with a poetic imagination, but also {{configured}} as a poetic practice, moving beyond the instrumental. The poet Wallace Stevens made a distinction between ‘Force’ and ‘Presence’—the former {{can be read as}} combative, the latter as pacific. Modern medicine has been shaped historically by the combative metaphor of a ‘war against disease’, turning medicine into a quasi-militaristic culture fond of hierarchy. This is supplemented by the metaphor of the ‘body as machine’, reducing the complex and unpredictable body to a linear, if complicated, apparatus. The two metaphors align medicine with the modern industrial–military complex that is masculine, heroic, and controlling in character. In an era in which medicine is feminising and expected to be patient-centred, <b>collaborative</b> (inter-professional) <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> to the public as a democratic gesture, the industrial–military metaphor complex should no longer be shaping medicine—yet its influence is still keenly felt, especially in surgery. This continuing dominance of Force over Presence matters because it is a style running counter to the collaborative, team-based medicine needed for high levels of patient safety. Medicine will authentically democratise only as new, pacific shaping metaphors emerge: those of ‘Presence’, such as ‘hospitality’. Hospitals can once again become places of hospitality...|$|R
40|$|Allocating {{money for}} species {{conservation}} {{on the basis}} of threatened species listings is not the most cost-effective way of promoting recovery or minimizing extinction rates. Using ecological and social factors in addition to threat categories, we designed a decision-support process to assist policy makers in their allocation of resources for the management of native wildlife and to clarify the considerations leading to a priority listing. Each species is scored on three criteria at the scale of the relevant jurisdiction: (1) threat category, (2) consequences of extinction, and (3) potential for successful recovery. This approach provides opportunity for independent input by policy makers and other stakeholders (who weight the relative importance of the criteria) and scientists (who score the species against the criteria). Thus the process explicitly separates societal values from the technical aspects of the decision-making process while acknowledging the legitimacy of both inputs. We applied our technique to two Australian case studies at different spatial scales: the frogs of Queensland (1, 728, 000 square km; 116 species) and the mammals of the Wet Tropics bioregion (18, 500 km 2; 96 species). We identified 7 frog and 10 mammal species as priorities for conservation. The frogs included 1 of the 9 species classified as endangered under Queensland legislation, 3 of the 10 species classified as vulnerable, 2 of the 22 species classified as rare, and 1 of the 75 species classified as least concern. The mammals identified included 3 of the 6 species classified as endangered, 1 of the 4 species classified as vulnerable, 5 of the 11 species classified as rare, and 1 of the 75 species classified as least concern. The methods we used to identify species were robust to comparisons across the two taxonomic groups. We concluded that (1) our process facilitates comparisons of data required to make <b>transparent,</b> cost-effective, <b>and</b> <b>strategic</b> management decisions across taxonomic groups and (2) the process should be used to short-list species for further discussion rather than for allocating resources per se...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} wicked intelligence to public relations. This idea associates practice in the field with progressive strategic thinking, social responsibility and democracy. Wicked intelligence is itself positioned in the paper {{as an example of}} counterintelligence linked to a process of radical unlearning in the PR discipline. This call for cognitive decommissioning is based on the notion that learning is a recurring theme in conceptualisations of intelligence and positioned as a desirable aspect of individual and collective development. Nevertheless, discourse around learning often underpins a managerial paradigm which is preoccupied with the promotion of organisational competitiveness rather than the resolution of societal problems (Shih-wei Hsu, 2013). The idea of wicked intelligence confronts this issue and focuses particularly on the key competencies required to tackle wicked problems. These are intractable issues that cannot be resolved through traditional problem solving techniques because they defy neat definition, linear analysis and are unable to be solved in sequential steps (Conklin, 2006). These types of challenges are embedded at every level of social life and include climate change, childhood obesity, as well as many aspects of organisational leadership. It is argued this landscape is fertile ground for PR and can help the field to address its own image problem through a focus on participatory problem solving. Indeed, wicked intelligence generates <b>collaborative</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> strategies in which relevant stakeholders are engaged to find the best proposal for all stakeholders. This leads to the formulation of a common, agreed approach in which those people who are affected also become participants (Roberts, 2000). In this context stakeholders are not merely consulted but actively involved in the planning process. This further complements an emerging theoretical perspective in PR that conceptualises stakeholder relationships as a social commons characterised by consensus, equity, moral legitimacy and transparency (Willis, 2012) ...|$|R
