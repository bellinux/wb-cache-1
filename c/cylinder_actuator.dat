Alternative actuation methods are being researched, but have not yet found wide application. In this paper, a thin-walled pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuator</b> is implemented to move a single-DOF prosthetic hand. Its performance is compared to that of a commercially available DC motor. Both systems are evaluated on speed, responsiveness, and energy capacity. Other properties such as size and mass are also taken into account. While the pneumatic cylinder is capable of high speeds and forces while remaining lightweight, quiet and small, it can prove difficult to control. Improvements to the cylinder design and valve system are recommended, in order to develop the potential of pneumatic cylinder actuators in modern multifunctional hand prostheses...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a wavelet-based {{iterative}} {{learning control}} (WILC) scheme with Fuzzy PD feedback is presented for a pneumatic control system with nonsmooth nonlinearities and uncertain parameters. The wavelet transform is employed {{to extract the}} learnable dynamics from measured output signal {{before it can be}} used to update the control profile. The wavelet transform is adopted to decompose the original signal into many low-resolution signals that contain the learnable and unlearnable parts. The desired control profile is then compared with the learnable part of the transformed signal. Thus, the effects from unlearnable dynamics on the controlled system can be attenuated by a Fuzzy PD feedback controller. As for the rules of Fuzzy PD controller in the feedback loop, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the inference rules of optimization. A proportional-valve controlled pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuator</b> system is used as the control target for simulation.

40|$|Bond graph {{modelling}} of hydraulic six-degree-of-freedom {{motion simulator}} Qiang Zhao 1 and Fang Gao 2, 3 Stewart-type six-degree-of-freedom motion simulator is a multidisciplinary system containing multiple mechanical, hydraulic and electric components. This article proposed a unified bond graph representation for the simulator. First, dynamics equations {{of the upper}} platform are developed using Newton–Euler method and its bond graph model is established. Each hydraulic actuator is then modelled according to the three basic equations of valve-controlled cylinder. An equivalent approach is further employed to treat the inertial effects of each cylinder. This approach projects the forces caused by the cylinder inertia equivalently onto the joint point of the upper platform, which relatively simplifies the modelling of the piston and the tube. The whole simulator takes independent close-loop position feedback control on each valve-controlled <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuator.</b> A proportional controller with dynamic pressure feedback and feed-forward compensation is proposed. The bond graph model of the overall simulator is finally completed with 20 -Sim software, and further simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the model.

40|$|A {{new device}} and {{automated}} measurement technology known as OroSTIFF is described to characterize non-participatory perioral stiffness in healthy adults for eventual application {{to patients with}} orofacial movement disorders associated with neuromotor disease, traumatic injury, or congenital clefts of the upper lip. Previous studies of perioral biomechanics required head stabilization for {{extended periods of time}} during measurement which precluded sampling patients with involuntary body/head movements (dyskinesias), or pediatric subjects. The OroSTIFF device is face-referenced and avoids the complications associated with head-restraint. Supporting data of non-participatory perioral tissue stiffness using OroSTIFF are included from 10 male and 10 female healthy subjects. The OroSTIFF device incorporates a pneumatic glass air <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuator</b> instrumented for pressure, and an integrated subminiature displacement sensor to encode lip aperture. Perioral electromyograms were simultaneously sampled to confirm passive muscle state for the superior and inferior divisions of the orbicularis oris muscles. Perioral stiffness, derived as a quotient from resultant force (ΔF) and interangle span (ΔX), was modeled with multilevel regression techniques. Real-time calculation of the perioral stiffness function demonstrated a significant quadratic relation between imposed interangle stretch and resultant force. This stiffness growth function also differed significantly between males and females. This study demonstrates the OroSTIFF ‘proof-of-concept’ for cost-effective non-invasive stimulus generation and derivation of perioral stiffness in a group of healthy unrestrained adults, and a case study to illustrate the dosedependent effects of Levodopa on perioral stiffness in an individual with advanced Parkinson’s disease who exhibited marked dyskinesia and rigidity...|$|E

Pneumatic actuator, {{which is one of}} the elements in pneumatic system, has been recognized for its flexibility to do various types of work and its capability in diversity of applications. Commonly known controller to control the pneumatic system movements is Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). However, the cost of PLC is expensive for small automation system and it size basis can be consider large as a controller. To overcome this problem, there is a new thought to use Programmable Interface Controller (PIC) which is smaller and cheaper to replace PLC. Main purpose of this project is to make the idea alive. This project will mainly concerned on controlling the sequence of the three linear double-acting <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuator</b> movements by using microcontroller PIC 18 F 452 coupled with pneumatic solenoid valve.

40|$|<b>Actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{theory is}} an {{effective}} approach for analyzing the aerodynamic performance of vertical axis wind turbines at a conceptual design level. Existing <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> theory can analyze single turbines, but analysis of multiple turbines is often desirable because turbines may operate in near proximity within a wind farm. For vertical axis wind turbines, which tend to operate in closer proximity than do horizontal axis turbines, aerodynamic interactions may not be strictly confined to wake interactions. We modified <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> theory to permit the simultaneous solution of aerodynamic loading {{for any number of}} turbines. We also extended the theory to handle thrust coefficients outside of the momentum region and explicitly defined the additional terms needed for curved or swept blades. While the focus of this paper is a derivation of an extended methodology, an application of this theory was explored involving two turbines operating in close proximity. Comparisons were made against two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) simulations, across a full 360 ° of inflow, with excellent agreement. The counter-rotating turbines produced a 5 – 10  % increase in power across a wide range of inflow conditions. A second comparison was made to a three-dimensional RANS simulation with a different turbine under different conditions. While only one data point was available, the agreement was reasonable, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predicting a 12  % power loss, as compared to a 15  % power loss for the <b>actuator</b> <b>cylinder</b> method. This extended theory appears promising for conceptual design studies of closely spaced vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), but further development and validation is needed...|$|R

40|$|Earth moving {{equipment}} are typically equipped with hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuators</b> {{to perform the}} designated tasks. Multibody modelling of such systems results in models with kinematic loops that couples the motion variables of the loop bodies. Iterative solutions {{will be needed to}} satisfy the loop constraints and the applied constraints, which require evaluation of the constraint Jacobean matrix. The size of the Jacobean matrix and the associated projections depends on the number of motion variables in each kinematic loop. Consequently, the computational cost significantly increases as the number of variables in the kinematic loop increases. Real-time control and hybrid hardware-in-the-loop systems both require efficient and fast computational algorithms. Eliminating the kinematic loops can improve the computational efficiency and effectiveness of the control algorithms. This paper presents an efficient approach to eliminate the coupling due to the cylinder-rod connections and consequently the kinematic loops in the multibody models leading to efficient simulation.

The PZT elements are bonded at the position of several mm from the bar end. In this structure, both bar ends vibrate resonantly in a bending mode, and high vibration displacement amplitude can be obtained along the bars. The length between the PZT element and the bar end determines the optimum driving frequency. The slider simply consists of three metal plates, which sandwich the bending bars, and the preload can be controlled by springs. The conditions in which the traveling wave can be generated along the bars were investigated. When the bars vibrate in a symmetric mode and traveling waves are generated, the slider moves in the direction to the opposite of traveling wave. Traveling wave could be generated by controlling the driving phase difference between the two PZT elements.

Furthermore, it is difficult for small residual stumps to provide sufficient impact absorption for safe manipulation in daily living, as intact arms do. Therefore, substitution of upper limb function in transhumeral amputees requires a sufficient range of motion and sufficient viscoelasticity for shoulder prostheses under critical weight and dimension constraints. We propose the use of two different types of actuators, ie, pneumatic elastic actuators (PEAs) and servo motors. PEAs offer high power-to-weight performance and have intrinsic viscoelasticity in comparison with motors or standard industrial pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>actuators.</b> However, the usefulness of PEAs in large working spaces is limited because of their short strokes. Servo motors, in contrast, can be used to achieve large ranges of motion. In this study, the relationship between the force and stroke of PEAs was investigated. The impact absorption of both types of actuators was measured using a single degree-of-freedom prototype to evaluate actuator compliance for safety purposes. Based on the fundamental properties of the actuators identified, a four degree-of-freedom robotic arm is proposed for prosthetic use. The configuration of the actuators and functional parts was designed to achieve a specified range of motion and torque calculated from the results of a simulation of typical movements performed in usual activities of daily living.
