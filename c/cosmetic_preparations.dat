Formulation one the control formulation in which no apple juice extract (Flavonoids) was incorporated while second one was the active formulation in which the apple juice extract (3 %) containing flavonoids was incorporated into water in oil emulsion using Abil EM 90 as an emulsifier. Stable formulations (control and Active) were applied on human cheeks (n = 12) for a study period of 10 weeks. Result of each volunteer of skin hydration and TEWL was measured by corneometer and TEWA meter.

The antimicrobial activity of litsea (Litsea cubeba), rosewood (Aniba rosaeadora) and clove bud (Syzigum aromaticum) EOs was identified using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method 3 and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a broth microdilution assay 3. The MICs of clove bud and rosewood were 1. 38 mg/ml against S. epidermidis and P. acnes. The MIC of litsea was 1. 11 mg/mL against S. epidermidis and 2. 23 mg/mL against P. acnes. The antimicrobial activity of a ternary combination of these EOs was further investigated using the checkerboard method with calculation of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) 4.

Methods: Nonionic surfactant blends of Tween&reg; and Tween&reg;/Span&reg; series were screened based on their solubilization capacity with water for palm kernel oil esters. Tween&reg; 80 and five blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 in the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value range of 10. 7 &ndash; 14. 0 were selected to study the phase diagram behavior of palm kernel oil esters using the water titration method at room temperature. Results: High solubilization capacity was obtained by Tween&reg; 80 compared with other surfactants of Tween&reg; series. High HLB blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 at HLB 13. 7 and 13. 9, respectively, have better solubilization capacity compared with the lower HLB values of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80. All the selected blends of surfactants were formed as water-in-oil microemulsions, and other dispersion systems varied in size and geometrical layout in the triangles. The high solubilization capacity and larger areas of the water-in-oil microemulsion systems were due to the structural similarity between the lipophilic tail of Tween&reg; 80 and the oleyl group of the palm kernel oil esters. Conclusion: This study suggests that the phase diagram behavior of palm kernel oil esters, water, and nonionic surfactants is not only affected by the HLB value, but also by the structural similarity between palm kernel oil esters and the surfactant used. The information gathered in this study is useful for researchers and manufacturers interested in using palm kernel oil esters in pharmaceutical and <b>cosmetic</b> <b>preparation.</b> The use of palm kernel oil esters can improve drug delivery and reduce the cost of cosmetics.
