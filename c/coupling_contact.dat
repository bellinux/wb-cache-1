A clamping device for dry <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> {{between the end of}} the waveguide and pipe surface was designed and fabricated. A computer program for multi-channel on-line monitoring of the pipe thickness at high temperature was also developed. Both a four-channel buffer rod pulse-echo type and a shear horizontal ultrasonic waveguide type for high-temperature thickness monitoring system were successfully installed to the test section of the FAC proof test facility.

40|$|We derive Bardeen-like {{expressions}} for {{the transmission}} probabilities between two multi-probe mesoscopic conductors coupled by a weak tunneling contact. We emphasize especially the dual {{role of a}} weak <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> as a current source and sink and analyze the magnetic field symmetry. In the limit of a point-like tunneling contact the transmission probability becomes a product of local, partial density of states of the two mesoscopic conductors. We present expressions for the partial density of states in terms of functional derivatives of the scattering matrix {{with respect to the}} local potential and in terms of wave functions. We discuss voltage measurements and resistance measurements in the transport state of conductors. We illustrate the theory for the simple case of a scatterer in an otherwise perfect wire.

40|$|Ultrasonic cutting {{is widely}} used in food {{processing}} applications to produce a clean and accurate cut. However, it {{is yet to be}} adopted as an instrument of choice in orthopaedic applications, mainly due to the high temperatures that can be generated at the cut site and the consequent requirement to use additional cooling. For example, if cutting temperatures above 55 – 60 °C are reached, particularly for sustained periods, bone necrosis can occur, compromising post-operative recovery. A recent study by the authors has shown that the thermal response in natural materials, such as wood and bone, is affected by the absorption of ultrasonic energy and conduction of heat from the cut site. In this paper the dependency of cutting parameters, such as blade tip vibration velocity, applied load, tuned frequency and <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> conditions, on the thermal response are reported and results show {{that it is possible to}} maintain cutting temperatures within safety limits by controlling the cutting parameters. A novel cutting blade design is proposed that reduces frictional heat generated at the cut site.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical model that virtualises {{the fabric of}} a natural sand obtained from micro computed tomography (μCT) to simulate the mechanical response of the material, termed here a micro finite-element (μFE) model. The grain-to-grain interactions under loading are modelled in a framework of combined discrete–finite-element method. The basis {{of this approach is}} that using a true representation of soil fabric and deformable grains will enable a more realistic representation of the physics of granular behaviour. Each individual grain is represented in a numerical mesh and modelled as a continuum body allowed to deform according to a prescribed constitutive model with appropriate friction contact conditions. An important feature of this model is the ability to compute the map of stress distribution inside the grains. A case study of an intact sand subjected to oedometer compression is presented to demonstrate the insights that can be gained into the stress transmission mechanisms and yield initiation within the grains. The displacement field, inertia tensor and active contact number are used to quantify grain kinematics as the virtual fabric deforms. By <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> dynamics with contact topology, this approach provides a robust numerical tool to infer important grain scale parameters that link the micro phenomena to the macro response of soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} FTS {{concept for}} Space Station Freedom (SSF) {{was to provide}} telerobotic assistance to enhance crew activity and safety and to reduce crew EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) activity. The first flight of the FTS manipulator systems would demonstrate several candidate tasks and would verify manipulator performance parameters. These first flight tasks included unlocking a SSF Truss Joint, mating/demating a fluid <b>coupling,</b> <b>contact</b> following of a contour board, demonstrating peg-in-hole assembly, and grasping and moving a mass. Future tasks foreseen for the FTS system included ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) change-out, Hubble Space Telescope Servicing, Gamma Ray Observatory refueling, and several in-situ SSF servicing and maintenance tasks. Operation of the FTS was planned to evolve from teleoperation to fully autonomous execution of many tasks. This wide range of mission tasks combined {{with the desire to}} evolve toward fully autonomy forced several requirements which may seen extremely demanding to the telerobotics community. The FTS requirements appear to have been created to accommodate the open-ended evolution plan such that operational evolution would not be impeded by function limitations. A recommendation arising from the FTS program to remedy the possible impacts from such ambitious requirements is to analyze candidate robotic tasks. Based on these task analyses, operational impacts against development impacts were weighed prior to requirements definition. Many of the FTS requirements discussed in the following sections greatly influenced the development cost and schedule of the FTS manipulator. The FTS manipulator has been assembled at Martin Marietta and is currently in testing. Successful component tests indicate a manipulator which achieves unprecedented performance specifications...|$|E

40|$|Presence {{of contact}} {{interface}} between deformable bodies can {{have very different}} purposes in mechanical systems. In some application {{the aim is to}} maximize the energy dissipation (e. g. brake systems); on the contrary in other cases the aim is to allow for a relative displacement between the two bodies, maximizing the efficiency (joints). In both cases frictional forces at the contact interfaces allow for <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> and system dynamics, and they can give origin to dynamic instabilities. From a numerical point of view the contact forces introduce an asymmetry on the system stiffness matrix, acting as a cross coupling factor between tangential and normal deformation at the contact interface [1]. Typical examples of this phenomenon, largely investigated in literature [2], are the squeal noise emission in automotive brakes or railway wheels. The coupling between system and contact results on unstable vibrations of the system. During vibration, the deformations due to the dynamic response of the system modify substantially the contact stress distribution. This variation bring to the onset of contact nonlinearities, such as the local transition between the different contact status (sliding, sticking, detachment) modifying the boundary conditions of the system. In case of dynamic instabilities, "Friction induced vibration" can result in high amplitude vibrations characterized by a harmonic spectrum at an eigenfrequency of the mechanical system and generally associated to noise emission. Between the mechanisms retained at the origin of such vibrations, the unstable coupling between two modes of the system {{is one of the most}} commonly adopted. The presence of friction forces governed by Coulomb Low couples the tangential and normal modal deformation at the contact of two coalescing modes. In order to generalize the mode coupling phenomenon an analysis developed on a simplified system, able to reproduce in-plain modal instabilities a single deformable body, is here proposed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} comprehensive {{methodology for}} characterization of metallic nanowires (NWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), {{and evaluation of}} their performance for interconnect applications at microwave/ mm-wave/THz frequencies. The research {{focus is on the}} development of modeling and measurement methods to determine constitutive material parameters, i. e. conductivity, and contact resistance of platinum (Pt) NWs, {{as well as on the}} development of modeling approaches to evaluate characteristic parameters for antennas, nano-coaxial lines, and single wire transmission lines composed of CNTs. Applicability of traditional two-port measurements is investigated for accurate determination of material parameters for Pt NWs over a broad frequency range. Two test-setups are developed. First, several configurations with directly contacted Pt NWs to a host coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure are designed and realized to determine the conductivity and contact resistance. Full-wave finite element and circuit models are used to determine the two parameters by fitting simulations to measurements. It is found that the single measurement setup with direct contacts cannot determine the two parameters simultaneously. To solve this problem, two approaches based on transmission line and lumped element models for Pt NWs are developed. Both approaches employ a set of two NWs with different lengths. The feasibility of both approaches is thoroughly studied and relevant conclusions are made. An approach based on lumped element models is validated experimentally, and it is shown that the contact resistance and conductivity of 300 nm diameter Pt NWs are about 50 W and 0. 013 sbulk, respectively. In the second setup, the capacitive <b>coupling</b> <b>contact</b> between the Pt NWs and the CPW structure is exploited to determine the NW’s conductivity. Two variations of this setup, specifically in-slot and on-dielectric configurations, are developed. Full-wave finite-element models are utilized to demonstrate suitability of the two configurations and to determine the conductivity of Pt NWs by fitting to measurements. Structural and elemental analyses of fabricated devices are conducted to assess fabrication and measurement issues. Full-wave modeling for individual CNTs and CNT bundles is performed by the use of method of moments and finite element method codes in order to CNTs as antennas, nano-coaxial lines, and single wire transmission lines. Characteristic parameters, such as impedance, gain, efficiency, and line loss for each interconnect are evaluated and compared to those of their copper-based counterparts. Results show better performance of CNTs over conventional metals at microwave frequencies. The extension of modeling and metrology for semiconducting NWs and CNTs, and the study of graphene at microwave frequencies are proposed as directions for future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the signal due to light beam induced current (LBIC) at the remote {{contacts}} is verified as a lateral photovoltage for non-uniformly illuminated planar p-n junction devices; simulation and experimental results are presented. The limitations imposed by the ohmic contacts are successfully overcome {{by the introduction of}} capacitively <b>coupled</b> remote <b>contacts,</b> which yield similar results without any significant loss in the estimated material and device parameters. It is observed that the LBIC measurements introduce artefacts such as shift in peak position with increasing laser power. Simulation of LBIC signal as a function of characteristic length L-c of photo-generated carriers and for different beam diameters has resulted in the observed peak shifts, thus attributed to the finite size of the beam.

We show that, in the presence of spin-orbit <b>coupling,</b> <b>contacting</b> the 2 DEG to a narrow strip of an s-wave superconductor produces a topological superconducting gap along the contact as a result of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) processes across the strip. The sign of the topological gap, controlled by the CAR amplitude, depends periodically on the Fermi wavelength and strip width and can be externally tuned. An interface between two halves of a long strip with topological gaps of opposite sign implements a robust π-junction, hosting a pair of Majorana zero modes that do not split despite their overlap.

This reversible operation, however, occurs only in the ideal case of vanishing <b>coupling</b> to the <b>contacts,</b> wherein the transmission function is delta shaped, and under open-circuit conditions, where no electrical power is extracted. In this paper, we delve into the thermoelectric performance of quantum dot systems by analyzing the power output and efficiency directly evaluated from the nonequilibrium electric and energy currents across them. In the case of interacting quantum dots, the onequilibrium currents {{in the limit of}} weak <b>coupling</b> to the <b>contacts</b> are evaluated using the Pauli master equation approach. The following fundamental aspects of the thermoelectric operation of a quantum dot setup are discussed in detail: (a) With a finite <b>coupling</b> to the <b>contacts,</b> a thermoelectric setup always operates irreversibly under open-circuit conditions, with a zero efficiency.
