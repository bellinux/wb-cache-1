Proponents of underwriting believe that if given the ability to purchase coverage without regard for pre-existing medical conditions (no underwriting), people would wait to purchase health insurance until they got sick or needed medical care. Waiting to obtain health insurance coverage until one needs coverage then creates a pool of insureds with [...] "high use," [...] which then increases the premiums that insurance companies must charge to pay for the <b>claims</b> <b>incurred.</b> In turn, high premiums further discourage healthy people from obtaining coverage, particularly when they realize {{that they will be able}} to obtain coverage when they need medical care.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to project possible impacts of climate change on heavy rainfall-related water damage insurance <b>claims</b> and <b>incurred</b> losses for four selected cites (Kitchener-Waterloo, London, Ottawa, and Toronto) located at Ontario, Canada. To achieve this goal, the future climate change scenarios and rainfall simulations, at local scale, were needed. A statistical downscaling method was used to downscale five global climate model (GCM) scenarios to selected weather stations. The downscaled meteorological variables included surface and upper-air hourly temperature, dew point, west-east and south-north winds, air pressure, and total cloud cover. These variables are necessary to project future daily rainfall quantities using within-weather-type rainfall simulation models. A model result verification process has been built into the whole exercise, including rainfall simulation modeling and the development of downscaling transfer functions. The results of the verification, based on historical observations of the outcome variables simulated by the models, showed a very good agreement. To effectively evaluate heavy rainfall-related water damage insurance <b>claims</b> and <b>incurred</b> losses, a rainfall index was developed considering rainfall intensity and duration. The index was evaluated to link with insurance data as to determination of a critical threshold of the rainfall index for triggering high numbers of rainfall-related water damage insurance <b>claims</b> and <b>incurred</b> losses. The relationship between rainfall index and insurance data was used with future rainfall simulations to project changes in future heavy rainfall-related sewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} forecasting the number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred.</b> After subtracting the number of claims reported to date, the number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> but not reported (IBNR) can be forecasted.

Instead of assuming the data are available in the usual claim run-off triangle format, we assume that the only data available are the number of claims reported at the valuation date for each accident interval of an observation period. Box-Jenkins methods are used to forecast the ultimate number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> and to obtain approximate confidence intervals for the number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred.</b> The forecast of the ultimate number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> is used to derive the IBNR forecast.

40|$|In the {{insurance}} area, especially based on {{observations of the}} number of claims, N(w), corresponding to an exposure w, and on observations of the total amount of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred,</b> Y (w), the risk theory arises to quantify risks and to fit models of pricing and insurance company ruin. However, the main problem is the complexity to obtain the distribution function of Y (w) and, consequently, the likelihood function used to calculate the estimation of the parameters.

40|$|The {{insurance}} futures contracts {{introduced in}} December 1992 by the Chicago Board of Trade offer insurers {{an alternative to}} reinsurance as a hedging device for underwriting risk. These instruments have the usual features of liquidity, anonymity, and low transactions costs that characterize futures contracts. This paper addresses the issue of pricing insurance futures contracts in an arbitrage-free framework as the expectation under the risk-neutral probability measure of the terminal cash flow provided, for instance, by a long position in a futures contract. Since by definition of the contract the terminal cash flow {{is related to the}} aggregate <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> during a calendar quarter, the valuation problem is of the same type as the one that arises in the pricing of zero-exercise price Asian options.

40|$|The stormy years {{following}} {{introduction of the}} single market appear to be over at last. In {{spite of the fact}} that the premium level in the main segments was cut for good, insurers were for the first time able to impose substantial increases in premium rates in 2001, a development which is reflected in the consumer price index. Premium revenues were also augmented by a greater number of insured risks. The need for Austrian insurers to correct their price policy was driven chiefly by the negative actuarial results of the property and liability insurance. More than a third of the insurers in this business were unable to compensate losses from the actual insurance business by income from investment. Echoing the overall economic development, income from premiums on life insurance also showed stunted growth in 2001. The only volume to develop with genuine dynamism was that of annuity insurance premiums (+ 42. 8 percent). Payouts from life insurance rose dramatically in 2001, as a consequence of the 1996 tax reform which produced a surge in advanced insurance contracts. Those contracts are now beginning to mature. Demand for supplementary health insurance coverage has been declining for years, but insurers could still boost revenues by increasing premium payments. Expenditure on claims was affected by an increase of almost 3 percent in the number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred.</b> After the disasters of 2000, the number of <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> levelled off throughout the property liability insurance sector. Developments in both revenues and expenditures markedly moderated the claims ratio for the entire business segment. In 2001, private insurers recorded the lowest growth rate of provisions during the past decade. The lower growth rate in actuarial reserves for life insurance was not fully compensated by the upswing in the two other segments. With regard to the portfolio structure, the shift from loans to mutual funds continues; cash holdings expanded considerably in 2001. The return on investment dipped slightly, so that the gap to the yield on federal bonds narrowed to some 1. 5 percentage points.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two major}} refinements to common practices in estimating {{the variability of}} loss reserves. The first is specification of a closed form density function that very closely approximates the aggregate loss distribution resulting from the convolution of the typical frequency and severity distributions—even at the extreme tails. This new distribution apparently has the following useful properties: (1) the sum of two of these distributions is also a distribution of the same form, {{regardless of whether the}} original distributions are independent or correlated; and (2) the values of the coefficients of the combined distribution {{is a function of the}} coefficients of the original distributions. These two properties should significantly streamline the process of determining the aggregate distribution for loss reserves. This paper openly questions the validity of the practice of approximating the confidence level factors for the aggregate distribution of loss reserves by using those factors from the aggregate distribution of all <b>claims</b> <b>incurred</b> for one (or more) accident years. It presents an alternative approach that avoids the likely inaccuracies of this common practice by using the new density function to represent: 1) the variability of eac...|$|E

Proposed Resolution: Yes, <b>incurred</b> <b>claims</b> and earned premiums should be on a net of reinsurance basis, {{as reported in the}} Income Statement {{that is part of the}} quarterly financial statutory reports. For example, where a company has entered an assumption reinsurance transaction to transfer 100 % of the premiums and claims for certain policies to a second company, the second company should report the assumed premiums and claims as part of its MLR and rebate calculations. Exceptions: <b>Incurred</b> <b>claims</b> and earned premiums should be adjusted to remove the impact of any quota-share reinsurance that covers a percentage smaller than 100 % of the claims obligations, because quota-share reinsurance can be used to “game the system ” by blending a low MLR from one company with a high MLR from a second company in order to avoid paying rebates based on the low MLR. Neither assumed excess reinsurance sold to an insurer nor stop-loss insurance sold to a self-funded employee welfare plan should enter into the MLR calculation, to the extent that the claim threshold is high enough t...|$|R
