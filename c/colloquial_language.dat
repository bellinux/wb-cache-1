The purposes of this research are to identify (1) the markers of phatic communion in <b>colloquial</b> Javanese <b>language,</b> (2) the types of phatic communion in <b>colloquial</b> Javanese <b>language,</b> (3) communicative functions of phatic communion (metalinguitics politeness) as the politeness markers in spoken language. In this study, I used pragmatic approach by analysing the language functions in which they are expressed in the form of speech acts. The data were <b>colloquial</b> Javanese <b>language</b> which had phatic communion. The subject of the study were standard Javanese speakers, Banyumas Javanese speakers, and East Java Javanese speakers. The data were collected by recording technique and note-taking technique. The data were analyzed by using Creswell’s steps. In this study, there were six categories of the phatic communion in <b>colloquial</b> Javanese <b>language.</b> They were congratulation, hope, humiliation, invitation, prohibition, and farewell. In their construction, the speakers used the phatic marker as the modifier and the markers of speech purposes. Thus, this form of communication showed the characters of polite language.
