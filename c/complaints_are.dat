5|$|There {{have been}} {{scattered}} complaints {{in some communities}} that the LinkNYC towers themselves are a nuisance. These complaints mainly {{have to do with}} loitering, browser access, and kiosk volume, the latter two of which the city has resolved. However, these nuisance <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> rare citywide; of the 920 kiosks installed citywide by then, there had been only one complaint relating to the kiosk design itself.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

Lakas Kampi CMD's Simeon Datumanong of Maguindanao's 2nd district insisted that the second complaint be barred; Majority leader Neptali Gonzales II of Mandaluyong answered that while the constitution forbids two impeachment proceedings, it does not forbid two impeachment complaints, adding that the two complaints can be consolidated for they were simultaneously referred to {{the committee}}.|$|E

500|$|Political parties, {{candidates}} and voters who have endorsed a particular candidate (or state) in presidential, parliamentary or European Parliament elections may file complaints with the State Electoral Commission regarding irregularities {{in the election}} process within 48 hours of a disputed activity. In the European Parliament elections, voter <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> required to be endorsed by at least 100 voters (or {{five percent of the}} voters). If the commission finds the complaint valid, it will order the part of the election process directly affected by the disputed activity to be repeated (possibly postponing the election date if there is insufficient time left). The commission must provide its decision within 48 hours after the complaint is submitted. The decision may be appealed before the Constitutional Court of Croatia within 48 hours of its receipt and once petitioned, the court must return a ruling within 48 hours. In local council elections, [...] <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> processed by county, city or town electoral commissions (as appropriate). In mayoral elections, <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> filed with the county electoral commission. This does not apply to Zagreb mayoral elections, where <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> submitted to the State Electoral Commission (the case also in county prefect elections). The time allowances and appeals procedure are the same as for presidential and parliamentary elections.|$|E
500|$|... "There {{may be some}} {{justification}} for the hundreds complaining about these distressing issues being presented in prime time: equally it is courageous for the Beeb to include a scenario which challenges the public’s perception of what is a ‘typical paedophile’. The repellent Tony’s grooming and seduction of his stepdaughter, Whitney, {{is a much more}} familiar pattern of abuse than the more commonly held image of predators lurking in parks. [...] The producers of Eastenders, labouring under a welter of tabloid protest and viewers’ <b>complaints,</b> <b>are</b> attempting to make people get past the initial revulsion of the act of abuse and accept the grim fact that ‘paedophiles’ are very often members of the same family." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the suit}} he filed was rejected, the case {{garnered}} international media attention. Responding {{to questions about}} Chen’s allegation, a senior official with the National Population and Family Planning Commission told the Washington Post {{that the practice of}} forced abortions and sterilizations was “definitely illegal,” and indicated that the complaints were being investigated. “If the Linyi <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> true, or even partly true, it's because local officials do not understand the new demands of the Chinese leadership regarding family planning work,” said the official. In September 2005, [...] the Commission announced that several Linyi officials had been detained. But local authorities in Linyi retaliated against Chen, placing him under house arrest in September 2005 and embarking on a campaign to undermine his reputation; the Linyi officials portrayed him as working for [...] "foreign anti-China forces", pointing out that he had received foreign funding for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled.|$|E
