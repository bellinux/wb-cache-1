Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the noise exposure levels in oil drilling rig floor and camp facilities in Ahvaz, Iran. Materials and Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Environmental and personal noise exposure measurements were carried out by the method established by ISO- 9612 with a sound level meter and noise level dosimeter. Results All the measurements were performed in two parts of an oil drilling rig: the operation area and the camp area. The noise levels in 100 points in the rig area were between 54 - 110 dB. The noise levels were also measured in 38 points in the camp area and ranged between 52 - 100 dB. Conclusions Our results showed that only 17 % of the measured points in the oil drilling rig floor were in safe area; 39 % were in <b>caution</b> <b>area</b> and 44 % were in danger area. In the camp facilities area, 51 % of the points were in safe area, 38 % were in <b>caution</b> <b>area</b> and 11 % in danger area.

40|$|Tractor {{stability}} predominantly determines operator’s safety. For {{a tractor}} parking on lateral slopes, overturning accidents have been frequently discussed using mathematical models. While the existing static models remarkably contribute tractor overturning mechanisms, {{few of them}} have considered the stability {{from the perspective of}} tractor sideslip. In our study, a relatively precise quasi–static model presented recently was adopted as the base model. We expanded it by introducing potential tractor sideslips. While the original model pointed out the lateral slope angle as the main factor influencing tractor overturns, we investigated tractor slipping stability under the influences of the slope angle and the coefficient of friction. The dimensional parameters of the example tractor for simulation were set the same as those in the original work. It was found that the allowable friction forces of both the front and rear tires primarily depended on the coefficient of friction rather than the slope angle. By comparing the surfaces of the allowable friction forces and the corresponding friction forces, tractor slipping thresholds for the front and rear tires were identified. <b>Caution</b> <b>areas</b> implying certain ground conditions that will definitely cause tractor sideslip were marked accordingly.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the association between the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency by conjunctival impression cytology and the diagnosis of infectious trachoma by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the Lumbini zone of Nepal.  METHODS— 70 children under the age of 11  in a rural village in the Lumbini zone were examined for clinical evidence of active trachoma. The conjunctiva of each child was tested for ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection using PCR, and for loss of goblet cells (a sign of subclinical vitamin A deficiency) using conjunctival impression cytology.  RESULTS—The presence of infectious trachoma was associated with the loss of goblet cells on conjunctival impression cytology (p= 0. 02). This relation was present and significant even when adjusted for age (p= 0. 05) and degree of inflammation (p= 0. 02). In fact, even subclinical infection with chlamydia was associated with an abnormal conjunctival impression cytology (p= 0. 02).  CONCLUSIONS—Children with infectious trachoma are significantly more likely to have an abnormal conjunctival impression cytology, even if the infection is subclinical. Thus, the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency from conjunctival impression cytology alone should be made with some <b>caution</b> in <b>areas</b> with endemic trachoma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{bacillus}} Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination can confound {{the results}} of a tuberculin skin test (TST). We sought to determine a cutoff diameter of TST induration beyond which the influence of BCG vaccination was negligible in evaluating potential Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a population of health care workers with a high vaccination rate and low incidence of tuberculosis. METHODS: From 1991 through 1998, all new employees at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, underwent a 2 -step TST at entry visit. We also gathered information on demographic characteristics, along with factors commonly associated with tuberculin positivity, including previous BCG vaccination, history of latent M. tuberculosis infection, and predictors for M. tuberculosis infection. RESULTS: Among the 5117 investigated subjects, we found that influence of BCG vaccination on TST results varied across categories of age (likelihood ratio test, 0. 0001). Prior BCG vaccination had a strong influence on skin test results of <or= 18 mm in diameter among persons < 40 years old, compared with the influence of factors predictive of M. tuberculosis infection. Prior latent M. tuberculosis infection and travel or employment in a country in which tuberculosis is endemic also had significant influences. CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of TST reactions of <or= 18 mm among BCG-vaccinated persons < 40 years of age must be done with <b>caution</b> in <b>areas</b> with a low incidence of tuberculosis. In such a population, except for persons who have never been vaccinated, TST reactions of <or= 18 mm {{are more likely to be}} the result of prior vaccination than infection and should not systematically lead to preventive treatment...|$|R

When ≥ 5. 5 U/mL {{was used as the}} best cutoff value of Helicobacter pylori antibody titer, 8. 6 % (20 of 233) were positive for H. pylori infection. PG I and II levels were higher among smokers, and PG I was higher in alcohol drinkers than in their counterparts. PG II level was significantly higher, whereas PG I/II ratios were lower in H. pylori-positive than in H. pylori-negative patients. PG I/II ratios showed a significant inverse correlation with the inflammation and atrophy scores of the antrum. The best cutoff values of PG I/II were 4. 05 and 3. 55 for discriminating chronic and atrophic gastritis, respectively. PG I, PG II, and PG I/II ratios were significantly lower in subjects from Bangli than in those from Makassar and Surabaya, and concordant with the ABC group distribution; however, group D (H. pylori negative/PG positive) was the lowest in subjects from Bangli.
