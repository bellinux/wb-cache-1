30|$|Aim: International thyroid {{societies}} recommend 18 F-FDG PET/CT in radioiodine-negative thyroid {{cancer patients}} with Tg[*]≥[*] 10  ng/ml. However {{according to recent}} publications, it appears that no clear <b>cutt-off</b> Tg value can be established (1). TSH stimulates thyrocyte metabolism, Glut 1 expression in thyroid cells, glucose trapping, and glycolysis and published data suggest that TSH stimulation significantly improves the sensitivity of 18 F-FDG-PET/CT (2). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic efficiency of TSH-stimulated 18 F-FDG PET/CT in radioiodine-negative differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) with different levels of TSH stimulated thyroglobulin (TSH-Tg).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was {{determining}} the type of weapon and shooting distance depending on chemical analysis of inorganic gunshot residue from the skin gunshot wounds in experimental animals (pigs). Methods: Experimental study was conducted in order to determine components and their percentage in gunshot residue (GSR). In 60 samples, pig skin was shot by fi ring projectiles from four different weapons and from three different distances (contact wound and near contact wound from 5 cm and 10 cm). The methodology included determining the presence of inorganic material: antimony, barium, lead, nickel, zinc and copper in the skin and subcutaneous tissue using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Results : Formula for determining weapon type was provided <b>cutt-off</b> points for different weapons, with 78. 6 % of original grouped cases being correctly classifi ed. Formula for determining weapon type was provided <b>cutt-off</b> points for different distances, with 58. 9 % of original grouped cases being correctly classified, which was slightly less reliable compared to weapon type discrimination analysis. Conclusion: The presented study showed that chemical analysis of GSR in entrance wound with AAS could be useful in determining the type of weapon, as well as the shooting distance, i. e. in our study, determining whether the wound is contact or near contact. This could be particularly useful in postmortally putrefi ed or charred bodies with gunshot wounds...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesEarly {{detection}} of anthracyclines–induced cardiotoxicity in child with malignant disease by specific biomarkers: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) {{and to establish}} IECA efficacy in treatment of this cardiotoxicity. MethodsThe authors was evaluated 27 patients (3 - 18 years old), from Pediatric Oncology by clinical exam;ECG; chest X-ray, echocardiography (Echo), cardiac biomarkers: BNP,cTnI and cardiac enzymes: ASAT,ALAT,CPK. Patients were divided into 3 groups (A,B,C) :A- 11 new cases of childhood cancer; B- 10 children on treatment with enalapril for cardioprotection; C- 6 children with chemotherapeutic protocol completed, without cardioprotector treatement. Patients monitorisation: differently depending on the subgroup studied. ResultsClinical manifestations: heart failure (1 case), untypical clinic signs (mild dyspnea, fatigue, asthenia, palpitations) : 15 cases; Echo : suggestive modifications for cardiotoxicity: 6 cases (22, 2 %) : diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle(LV) (5), systolic dysfunction LV- 1 case; ECG changes: sinusal tachycardia, minor ventricular repolarization disturbances. High values of plasma BNP (<b>cutt-off</b> value – 100 pg/ml) were highlighted in 11 patients: values 100 - 200 pg/ml= 4 and > 200 pg/ml= 7. cTnI values: all cases was situated under the <b>cutt-off</b> value of 0. 4 ng/mL. Increased values of plasma BNP was directly correlated with cumulative dose of antraciclines All children on cardioprotector treatment had normal values of BNP and cTnI. Any changes of ASAT, ALAT, CPK weren’t correlated with changes in the BNP and cTnI values. ConclusionsThe results proved the utility of research of cardiac specific biomarkers for early {{detection of}} anthracyclines–induced cardiotoxicity, the correlation with stage of disease treatment and cumulative dose and the suggestive Echo changes for cardiac involvement, the favorable cardioprotector effect of enalapril in prevention and treatment of this cardiotoxicity...|$|E

SUBJECTS/ METHODS: We have studied 18 children and teenagers with CL, 10 girls and 8 boys, and 18 gender and age matched normal controls, with the same pubertal stage. All were recruited from the outpatient pediatric clinic nutrition unit. None of the children with CL showed symptoms of chronic illness, they had normal laboratory results, they had a normal caloric food intake, {{and they did not}} agree with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for anorexia nervosa. We describe the body mass index (BMI) of children and their parents. The children were classified according to Cole's recently published BMI cut-offs for thinness: under 18. 5 points in CL group, stable at least in the last year, and between 18. 5 and 25 <b>cutt-offs</b> in the control group. The body composition was calculated by anthropometric methods (skinfold thickness measurements). In addition REE was measured using fasting indirect calorimetry. The CL group had a higher mean percentage of FFM, and a mean FM significantly less, relative to controls (p < 0. 001). The average absolute REE was significantly lower in the CL group (1, 106. 55 ± 240. 72 kcal) than the control group (1, 353. 33 ± 270. 01 kcal/dia) (p < 0. 01). However, the REE adjusted for FFM showed a mean significantly greater in the CL group (41. 39 ± 2. 26 kcal/kg FFM) (Mean confidence interval (CI) 95 %: 40. 33 - 42. 45) than the controls (37. 37 ± 3. 06 kcal/kg FFM) (Mean CI 95 %: 35. 93 - 38. 81) (p < 0. 001). Finally, in the family study, the mean BMI of fathers of CL group was significantly lower (p < 0. 01), but there were not any differences in the mean BMI of mothers. Among parents with BMI known, 8 of 35 parents of CL group had an BMI lower 18. 5, and only 2 of 36 parents in the control group (p < 0. 05). This increased energy expenditure-to-FFM ratio differentiates between CL and controls. These metabolic differences are probably genetically determined...|$|R

The two main objectives of the trial were to determine hemoglobin cut-off values for the diagnosis of anemia in Bolivian women of childbearing age living at high altitudes, and to estimate the prevalence of anemia in this population. The study showed that nutritional anemia is an important public health problem in such populations and that many methods of assessing it lead to an underestimation of prevalence.

40|$|We model {{a setting}} in which {{citizens}} form coalitions to seek preferential entry to a given market. The lower entry the higher firm profits and political contributions, but the lower social welfare. Politicians choose to either control entry directly and be illegally bribed, or regulate entry using a general rule and be legally lobbied. We show how direct control generates lower entry rates and grants politicians more bargaining power, as no interest group has a strategic advantage in the lobbying game. Using a rule namely creates a <b>cutt-off</b> creating a free riding advantage for citizens with characteristics favoured by the rule. By forming a separate interest group these 'strongest' citizens are able to reduce competition from other groups, which is impossible with direct political control. Despite generating lower rents, the illegality of bribes induces politicians to switch to regulation when political accountability is high. Countries with weak accountability are characterised by bribing and relatively low entry while countries with strong accountability exhibit lobbying and higher entry rates...|$|E

In this work, {{capillary}} electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is used {{to carry}} out a metabolomic study of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A CE-MS coupling with an electrospray sheath-liquid interface (ESI) and a time of flight (TOF) MS analyzer were used in this work. Due to the high scan speed and high mass resolution of TOF MS, this analyzer is well-suited for on-line coupling with fast separation techniques as CE to analyze complex samples. TOF MS also provides high mass accuracy determination, essential to obtain as much information as possible from complex biological fluids as CSF. The CSF was analyzed with minimal sample pre-treatment: deproteinization was carried out by using ultracentrifugation and a membrane with 3000 Da <b>cutt-off.</b> The ultrafiltrate was directly injected to the CE-MS.

They were divided into three age groups, 5 ～ 9 years, 10 ～ 14 years and 15 ～ 18 years, in accordance with the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and their cardiovascular risk factors were examined based on their family histories and TC levels. In each group, TC levels remained under 200 mg/dl in 86 to 88 percent of cases for both boys and girls. In the group of girls aged 15 ～ 18 years, TC levels were 200 to 220 mg/dl, which was higher than that of the boys in the same age group. The incidence of hypercholesterolemia was highest in the 5 ～ 9 year old age group. Children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia over 240 mg/dl had many cardiovascular risk factors. The TC levels of Japanese children and adolescents in the 90 th percentile were equal to those of American children and adolescents in the 95 th percentile. The 95 th percentile values of Japanese children and adolescents registered 210 ～ 220 mg/dl, higher than those of American children and adolescents. However, it is necessary to consider changes in TC levels according to sex and age, and establish standard values for determining the cut-off point of hypercholesterolemia. It is also noteworthy that the acceptable value of the <b>cutt-off</b> point for screening hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents is 200 mg/dl...|$|E
40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex, {{frequent}} and serious clinical problem with {{high rate of}} mortality. Therefore {{there is a serious}} need for early detection of AKI, with a tendency to detect early stage – RISK dut to start with therapy as soon as possible and prevent irreversible changes in renal function. Study 2 ̆ 7 s purposes were to explore the rhythm of urine neutrophile gelatinase associated lipocalin (urine NGAL) concentration changes before and after cardiovascular surgery and compare results of urine NGAL values with results of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance as main diagnostic indicators of renal function in order to define role of urine NGAL biomarker in early diagnosis of acute kidney injure. In the prospective clinical study 150 cardiovascular surgery patients were included. Basal value and concentration of urine NGAL were tested 3, 6 and 12 hours after cardiovascular surgery, and concentration of serum creatinine was tested once per day first three days after surgery. Also creatinine clearance value was calculated according to Cockrof-Goult formula. After above mentioned, rate of acute kidney injure was estimated according to RIFLE criteria. The study results showed that the value of urine NGAL was elevated above <b>cutt-off</b> after cardiac operation in a group of patients who developed AKI (defined according to RIFLE criteria). There were statisticaly significant difference between all four measerments (p< 0. 05). There were also moderate positive correlation (0. 500 and 0. 502) between urine NGAL values and percentage difference of serum creatinine and creatinine clearence. All that indicate that higer values of urine NGAL are followed by higher percentage difference of serume creatinine and creatinine clearence. By using of automated urine NGAL test detection of acute kidney injure is posible 24 - 48 hours earlier comparing with actual results acquired by determination of serum creatinine concentration. The results of this study will indicate urine NGAL as a reliable biomarker of early acute kidney injure. A combination of early and late markers of kidney damage (urine NGAL, serum creatinine) can greatly contribute to better control the outcome of all those who are a risk group for the development of AKI...|$|E
40|$|Density {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{parameters}} to characterize a plasma. Microwave reflectometry has been used for the electron density profile and fluctuation measurements in many plasma devices. The advantages of the reflectometry are: 　 1. obtaining information about local plasma electron density (not line averaged value like in the case of interferometry); 　 2. requiring only a small port for access to the plasma; In this thesis a very young type of microwave reflectometry is treated: pulsed radar reflectometer. We have developed the pulsed radar reflectometer for Compact Helical System (CHS). Major emphasis will be placed on technical aspects. It must be also stressed that this work is the first trial for helical systems. 　In the conventional reflectometry a wave of the specific frequency is launched towards the plasma to be reflected from the layer in the immediate vicinity of the critical density. The phase difference of the launched wave and reflected wave contains the information on the position of the reflecting layer. In the case of pulsed radar reflectometry, short (～ 1 ns) microwave pulses are launched into the plasma. The pulse is reflected from a corresponding critical density layer and received by the time of flight measurement system. The measured quantities for those types of reflectometers are phase or time delay. The advantages of the pulsed radar are as follows in comparison with the conventional reflectometry: 　　 1. temporary losses of the reflected signal are not so serious, each pulse carries all information about the position of the critical density layer; 　　 2. false reflection from window, horn lens or waveguides could be easily filtered, because they all occur outside of interested time window; 　　 3. due to the very short time for the microwave propagation, plasma fluctuations seem to be "frozen" and they will not affect the measurements significantly; 　　 4. effect of mode coupling becomes less critical because reflected ordinary and extraordinary mode pulses arrive at the different time; simultaneous measurements of O- and X-mode reflection are in principle possible yielding the total magnetic field; 　Numerical simulation has been done to study the propagation and detection processes of the microwave pulses. Due to the dispersion in plasmas, the pulse share of the microwaves is deformed. This deformation causes timing error in the Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD), which yields a logic pulse. This discriminator is inevitable for our system to do amplitude insensitive measurements. The pulse deformation is more serious for shorter pulse width, and leads to a larger error in the timing. We have found that the errors decrease with the increase of the pulse width and errors are negligible (less than 1 %) for pulse width longer than about 1 ns. 　A 1 -channel (with changeable frequency 51, 54, 57 GHz) pulsed radar system has been designed for CHS. It is similar to that developed by RTP tokamak group, where pulsed radars were introduced for the first time. The difference is that our system uses bandpass filters at the IF stage, and can be upgraded to a multichannel system more easily. The system consists of: 　　 1. microwave pulse production part; 　　 2. microwave transmission, vacuum window and antenna, bandstop filter; 　　 3. mixer and IF pulse electronics; 　　 4. time of flight measurement electronics 　To produce a suitable microwave pulse (short, large amplitude and well shaped) we tested special nonstandard fast switches (Millitech fast PIN switch and IRE varactor-diode fast modulator). The minimum pulse widths are 1. 9 ns and 0. 28 ns, respectively with heterodyne type detection, and the output power is around 50 mW at the peak of amplitude. Since a serious pulse broadening occurs in the long fundamental waveguide (WG), its length has been minimized. Although two independent launching and receiving antennas are used for most reflectometers, we use only one antenna for launching and receiving. This causes the problem that a small reflection (～ 2 %) at the vacuum window makes a false pulse. In principle, the problem does not affect the measurements, because the false reflection occurs at a time window different from that for the true reflection (from plasma). This is the advantage of pulsed radar reflectometry. By using another PIN switch in front of the mixer we have succeeded for the first time in reducing the effect of false reflection to a practically acceptable level. Since the frequencies of ECH and reflectometer are rather close each other, we use a bandstop filter to reject strong ECH microwaves. Instead of an RF detectors, we use a mixer and IF electronics, so that the system has a good signal to noise ratio (SNR), and the potential for the multichannel system. A CFD yields the peak timing of the reflected pulse, and the timing is independent of the amplitude. This is very useful for the measurements, because large amplitude change occurs often. A Time-to-Amplitude Converter (TAC) is used to measure the time delay of the reflected pulse. The output of the TAC is sampled by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). 　Free space time measurements have been done to calibrate the timing electronics. Instead of the plasma cut-off layer, a metallic mirror is used and moved by 50 - 90 cm in front of the antenna. A spatial resolution of 0. 3 cm has been reached, that comes from the accuracy of TAC output reading. 　A 51 GHz 1 -channel pulsed radar reflectometer has been installed in CHS. As a wave polarization, ordinary and extraordinary modes are launched. We probed the plasma with microwave pulses of 1. 9 ns. The plasmas were initiated by IBW (Ion Bernstein Wave) or ECH and heated by NBI and ECH. These measurements were done for discharges with the magnetic field of 0. 85 T and the maximum electron density of about 6 × 10 19 m- 3. At the first stage, we used an oscilloscope instead of CFD-TAC time of flight measurement electronics. Due to the function of oscilloscopes, we could get only one waveform for each discharge. The result showed that the reflected waveform was distorted but not significantly, and that in most cases the amplitude of the reflected pulses is rather small. When we read the peak timing by eyes, the relation between the time delay and the line averaged density agreed with the calculated curve both for 0 -/X-modes launching experiments. 　As the next step, we used the CFD-TAC electronics by which we could get the time behavior for each discharge. The repetition rate of the pulse launching and measurement is 200 kHz. The launching polarity is adjusted to X-mode to measure relatively low density plasma. When the discharge starts, the density gradually increases. Below the critical density, the pulse passes through the plasma and is reflected at the back wall of the vacuum vessel. The reflected pulse passes through the plasma again and detected by the receiving system. This situation is called as delayometry. When the density increases, the cut off appears and moves towards the antenna. The time behavior of the time delay agrees with the calculation of this scenario by assuming the parabolic density profile. Instead of assuming the whole profile, we assume a linear profile between the plasma edge and the cut-off layer. Then the estimated positiorn of the cut off layer coincides well with Thomson scattering measurements. The spatial accuracy of the determination of the position of the reflected layer during plasma measurements was about 5 - 8 mm. 　While the reflectometer can follow the fast and large changes in density, the HCN interferometer fails, which is partly shown in the ice pellet injection experiment. The fast movement of the <b>cutt-off</b> density layer during the density collapse was successfully measured with the pulsed radar reflectometry. This fact demonstrates the reflectometer has a high temporal resolution. 　The first pulsed radar measurements in a helical system have been done. We have succeeded in measuring the density with one antenna system, that means reflectometry requires only a small port. The density fluctuations could also be measured because of its high spatial and temporal resolution of pulsed radars...|$|E
