500|$|Any {{member of}} the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane, typhoon and {{tropical}} cyclone committees can request that {{the name of a}} tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists. A name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety, such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage, impact, or for other special reasons. A replacement name is then submitted to the <b>committee</b> <b>concerned</b> and voted upon, but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons: these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name, the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names, and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media. PAGASA also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least [...] in damage or have caused at least 300deaths.|$|E
500|$|Damage {{from the}} weather and {{deterioration}} in the concrete meant that the church closed for worship in 2004, requiring worshippers to attend services elsewhere on Anglesey. Demolition was a possibility in 2006. An appeal launched raised the estimated £1.2million to £1.4million necessary for repairs, which included replacing the roof coverings, redecorating internally and externally, and repairing the steps. An application for planning permission for the work was submitted in May 2008 to the Isle of Anglesey County Council. An application for a grant of £840,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund was rejected on 18 March 2009, with the <b>committee</b> <b>concerned</b> about the proposed new extension (terming it [...] "inappropriate"), although recognising the [...] "high heritage merit" [...] of the proposal. Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) made a grant of £150,000 in 2007; the National Churches Trust made a grant of £10,000 in June 2010; and other bodies and individuals made donations to the appeal. [...] The church reopened after its restoration on 1 May 2011 with a Mass celebrated by the Bishop of Wrexham, Edwin Regan.|$|E
500|$|When {{the house}} assembled, George Mason was {{initially}} appointed to a <b>committee</b> <b>concerned</b> with raising additional militia {{during that time}} of war. In 1759, he {{was appointed to the}} powerful Committee on Privileges and Elections. He was also placed during the latter year on the Committee on Propositions and Grievances, which mostly considered local matters. Mason dealt with several local concerns, presenting a petition of Fairfax County planters against being assessed for a tobacco wharf at Alexandria, funds they felt should be raised through wharfage fees. He also played a major role as the Burgesses deliberated how to divide Prince William County as settlement expanded; in March 1759, Fauquier County was created by legislative act. In this, Mason opposed the interest of the family of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, [...] who wanted existing counties expanded instead, including Fairfax. This difference may have contributed to Mason's decision not to seek re-election in 1761. Mason biographer Jeff Broadwater noted that Mason's committee assignments reflected the esteem his colleagues held him in, or at least the potential they saw. [...] Broadwater did not find it surprising that Mason did not seek re-election, as he did not attend the sessions between 1759 and 1761.|$|E

500|$|Any {{member of}} the World Meteorological Organisation's hurricane, typhoon and {{tropical}} cyclone committees can request that {{the name of a}} tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists. A name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the tropical cyclone has acquired a special notoriety, such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage, impacts or for other special reasons. Any tropical cyclone names assigned by the Papua New Guinea National weather Service are automatically retired regardless of any damage caused. A replacement name is then submitted to the <b>committee</b> <b>concerned</b> and voted upon, but these names can be rejected and replaced for various reasons. These reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name, its similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names, and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media. PAGASA also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones, when they have caused at least [...] in damage and/or have caused at least 300deaths. There are no names retired within the South-West Indian Ocean, as names that are used are automatically removed from the three naming lists used in that basin.|$|E

This was the traditional direction for the Catholic Church to look for evangelizing. Catechisms were printed in many languages and seminarians sent to places as far as Malabar. The most concrete result was the union with Rome of the Ruthenian Catholic communion, most concentrated in modern-day Ukraine and Belarus; the union was formalized at Brest in 1596.|$|E
