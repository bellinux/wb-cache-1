25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the <b>convected</b> <b>heat</b> flux necessary.|$|E

Both models involve coupled heat- and mass-transfer equations that describe the changes in the concentration of each solvent, the temperature, and the thickness of the film throughout the drying. The model equations become highly nonlinear because of the strong and complicated concentration and temperature dependencies of the thermodynamic and transport properties of polymer solutions.

Observables, such as the heat flux, have a simple-periodic (harmonic) time dependence. The more complex flow {{has at least one}} additional characteristic frequency [...] the horizontal frequency of the cold, downward- and the warm, upward-flowing plumes. Observables of this latter flow have a broadband frequency distribution. The two flow morphologies, at the same Rayleigh number, have different rates of entropy production and different Lyapunov exponents. The simpler "harmonic" flow transports more heat (produces entropy at a greater rate), whereas the more complex "chaotic" flow has a larger maximum Lyapunov exponent (corresponding to a larger rate of phase-space information loss). A linear combination of these two rates is invariant for the two flow morphologies over the entire range of Rayleigh numbers for which the flows coexist, suggesting a relation between the two rates near the onset of convective turbulence.

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{shares of}} {{fluctuating}} {{renewable energy sources}} induce higher and higher power flow variability at the transmission level. The question arises as to what extent exist-ing networks can absorb additional fluctuating power injection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resulting power flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to line temperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling and simulation methodology for estimating the occur-rence of critical line temperatures {{in the presence of}} fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integration of the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is sped up by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction tech-nique adapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction in computational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant to short-term operational assessments. A case study performed on a single line model provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting critical line temperatures under given power flow fluctuations. A transmission system application shows how the proposed method can be used for a fast yet accurate operational assessment.

40|$|Abstract. Cross-eld {{particle}} transport increases {{sharply with}} distance into the SOL and plays a dominant {{role in the}} ‘main-chamber recycling ’ regime in Alcator C-Mod, a regime in {{which most of the}} plasma particle eux recycles on the main-chamber walls rather than flows into the divertor volume. This observation has potentially important implications for a reactor: contrary to the ideal picture of divertor operation, a tightly baed divertor may not oer control of the neutral density in the main-chamber such that charge exchange heat losses and sputtering of the main-chamber walls can be reduced. The conditions that give rise to the main-chamber recycling regime can be understood by considering the plasma{neutral particle balance: when the flux surface averaged neutral density exceeds a critical value, flows to the divertor can no longer compete with the ionization source and particle fluxes must increase with distance into the SOL. This critical neutral density condition can be recast into a critical cross-eld plasma flux condition: particle fluxes must increase with distance into the SOL when the plasma flux crossing a given flux surface exceeds a critical value. Thus, the existence of the main-chamber recycling regime is intrinsically tied to the level of anomalous cross-eld particle transport. Direct measurement of the eective cross-eld particle diusivities De in a number of ohmic L mode discharges indicates that De near the separatrix strongly increases as plasma collisionality increases. <b>Convected</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes correspondingly increase, implying that there exists a critical plasma density (or perhaps collisionality) beyond which no steady state plasma can be maintained, {{even in the absence of}} radiation. 1...|$|E
40|$|A slot with applied {{temperature}} stratification is considered when mean gravity is directed along its length and weak quasistatic jitter is {{applied in the}} spanwise direction, but {{when there is no}} component of gravity in the vertical. The behavior of the slot is governed by a number of factors: The sense of the mean gravity with respect to the applied stratification, the spanwise and lengthwise Rayleigh numbers, the Prandtl and Biot numbers, and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio of the slot. A perturbation expansion of the governing equations is performed for weak spanwise jitter. At the first order of perturbation there is a circulation around the slot, producing an advected temperature field with spanwise gradients. At second order there are inflows or outflows in both the spanwise and lengthwise directions, along with a vertical redistribution of fluid. There is also a temperature field with lengthwise gradients, which typically competes with the applied temperature gradient. Equations are derived governing the vertical structure of all these fields and are solved in terms of a set of special basis functions. A parametric study is performed for the solutions. When lengthwise buoyancy forces are absent (the lengthwise Rayleigh number is zero), it is comparatively easy to deduce the required fields. However, finite lengthwise Rayleigh numbers couple the momentum and thermal equations thereby affecting the structure of the fields. Interesting behavior is predicted for small Biot numbers, when <b>convected</b> <b>heat</b> is effectively trapped in the slot: Infinitessimal flows can produce finite advected temperatures. The limits of small Biot number and small lengthwise Rayleigh number are found to be noninterchangeable. At large lengthwise Rayleigh number, boundary layers occur for stable applied stratification and layered cellular structures occur for unstable stratification. For the stable case at moderately small Biot number, the temperature jump across the boundary layer is small compared with the depth independent temperature in the bulk. Then by exploiting the boundary layer nature of the solutions, it becomes simple to predict the bulk fluid temperatures, interfacial heat fluxes and the circulations associated with the buoyant flows. Turning to the unstably stratified case, it is demonstrated that runaways can occur at first order in the spanwise jitter, and these correspond to resonant excitation of three-dimensional, stationary, long wave Rayleigh–Bénard modes. It is demonstrated how the Biot number and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio of the slot influence the lengthwise Rayleigh number at which these resonances occur. There is in addition a set of two-dimensional Rayleigh–Bénard modes, which can potentially become excited at second order. When the Biot number and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio are not too large, the Rayleigh numbers corresponding to the two sets of modes are nearly coincident. The second-order system will then be strongly forced near resonance, causing it to have a disproportionately large response...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} work {{carried out to}} develop a 3 -D coupled Finite Volume/BEM-based {{temperature}} forward/flux back (TFFB) coupling algorithm to solve the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) which arises naturally in analysis of systems exposed to a convective environment. Here, heat conduction within a structure is coupled to heat transfer to the external fluid which is <b>convecting</b> <b>heat</b> into {{or out of the}} solid structure. There are two basic approaches to solving coupled fluid structural systems. The first is a direct coupling where the solution of the different fields is solved simultaneously in one large set of equations. The second approach is a loose coupling strategy where each set of field equations is solved to provide boundary conditions for the other. The equations are solved in turn until an iterated convergence criterion is met at the fluid-solid interface. The loose coupling strategy is particularly attractive when coupling auxiliary field equations to computational fluid dynamics codes. We adopt the latter method in which the BEM is used to solve heat conduction inside a structure which is exposed to a convective field which in turn is resolved by solving the NASA Glenn compressible Navier-Stokes finite volume code Glenn-HT. The BEM code features constant and bi-linear discontinuous elements and an ILU-preconditioned GMRES iterative solver for the resulting non-symmetric algebraic set arising in the conduction solution. Interface of flux and temperature is enforced at the solid/fluid interface, and a radial-basis function scheme is used to interpolated information between the CFD and BEM surface grids.

In some cases, the resulting thermocapillary flow is vigorous enough to <b>convect</b> <b>heat</b> toward {{the edges of the}} pool, increasing the driving force in a sort of positive feedback. In this work we examine this mechanism and its effect on the solid-liquid interface through a model problem: a half space of pure substance with concentrated axisymmetric surface heating, where surface tension is strong enough to keep the liquid free surface flat. The numerical method proposed for this problem utilizes a finite volume element (FVE) discretization in cylindrical coordinates. Because of the axisymmetric nature of the model problem, the control volumes used are torroidal prisms, formed by taking a polygonal cross-section in the (r, z) plane and sweeping it completely around the z-axis. Conservation of energy (in the solid), and conservation of energy, momentum, and mass (in the liquid) are enforced globally by integrating these quantities and enforcing conservation over each control volume. Judicious application of the Divergence Theorem and Stokes' Theorem, combined with a Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme leads to an implicit algebraic system to be solved at each time step. It is known that near the boundary of the pool, that is, near the solid-liquid interface, the full conduction-convection solution will require extremely fine length scales to resolve the physical behavior of the system. Furthermore, this boundary moves as a function of time. Accordingly, we develop the foundation of an adaptive refinement scheme based on the principles of Fast Adaptive Composite Grid methods (FAC).

This configuration encourages mean horizontal flows of zero horizontal wavenumber, which we study as an idealization of zonal flows in tokamaks, planetary atmospheres, and annular cylindrical convection experiments. These systems often satisfy free-slip conditions {{on at least one}} boundary and are approximately two-dimensional. Stable steady states with zonal flow are found for Prandtl numbers up to 0. 3. Stable and unstable steady states with horizontal periods up to six times the layer height are computed for a Prandtl number of 0. 1 and Rayleigh numbers, Ra, up to 2 * 10 ^ 5. Concurrently stable states with and without zonal flow are found where the state without zonal flow <b>convects</b> <b>heat</b> over 10 times faster. Steady zonal flow arises subcritically whenever the horizontal period is not forced to be narrow, contrary to most prior predictions by truncated models. Steady states and their bifurcations are studied in a truncated model that does predict subcriticality. Direct numerical simulations are performed with a horizontal period twice the layer height, Prandtl numbers between 1 and 10, and Ra between 5 * 10 ^ 5 and 2 * 10 ^ 8 [...] Zonal flow arises subcritically as Ra is raised but is seen in all quasi-steady states at large Ra. The fraction of the total kinetic energy comprised by zonal flow approaches unity as Ra grows. At a Prandtl number of 1, vertical convective heat transport occurs in temporal bursts, nearly vanishing in between, and is non-monotonic in Ra. At Prandtl numbers of 3 and 10, convective transport at no time nearly vanishes, and time-averaged Nusselt numbers scale as Ra^ 0. 077 and Ra^ 0. 19, respectively. Both growth rates are below the range accepted for Rayleigh-Benard convection without zonal flow. In the second part, two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are conducted for convection sustained by uniform internal heating in a horizontal fluid layer. Top and bottom boundary temperatures are fixed and equal. Prandtl numbers range from 0. 01 to 100. A control parameter, R, that is similar to the usual Rayleigh number is varied up to 5 * 10 ^ 5 times its critical value at the onset of convection. The asymmetry between upward and downward heat fluxes is non-monotonic in R. In a broad high-R regime, dimensionless mean temperature scales as R^- 1 / 5.

This paper attempts to illustrate the scale-related difficulties in modelling a convection-driven geodynamo by studying both linear and nonlinear convection {{in the presence of}} imposed toroidal and poloidal ­ fields. We show that there exist three extremely large disparities, as a direct consequence of small viscosity and rapid rotation of the Earth’s fluid core, in the spatial, temporal and amplitude scales of a convection-driven geodynamo. We also show that the structure and strength of convective motions, and, hence, the relevant dynamo action, are extremely sensitive to the intricate dynamical balance between the viscous, Coriolis and Lorentz forces; similarly, the structure and strength of the magnetic field generated by the dynamo process can depend very sensitively on the fluid flow. We suggest, therefore, that the zero Ekman number limit is strongly singular and that a stable convection-driven strong-­field geodynamo satisfying Taylor’s constraint may not exist. Instead, the geodynamo may vacillate between a strong ­field state, as at present, and a weak ­ field state, which is also unstable because it fails to <b>convect</b> sufficient <b>heat...</b>|$|R

[...] METRIC calculates ET as a residual of the surface energy balance, where ET is estimated by keeping account of total net short wave and long wave radiation at the vegetation or soil surface, the amount of heat conducted into soil, {{and the amount of}} <b>heat</b> <b>convected</b> into the air above the surface. The difference in these three terms represents the amount of energy absorbed during the conversion of liquid water to vapor, which is ET. METRIC expresses near-surface temperature gradients used in heat convection as indexed functions of radiometric surface temperature, thereby eliminating the need for absolutely accurate surface temperature and the need for air-temperature measurements.|$|R
5000|$|In Y. Ke1 and V. S. Solomatov’s model, {{the core}} is liquid and is vigorously <b>convecting.</b> [...] The <b>heat</b> flux {{out of the}} thermal {{boundary}} layer (at the upper boundary) is close to zero because the temperature profile above the thermal boundary layer quickly reaches a steady state profile {{in the frame of}} reference associated with the moving upper boundary of the thermal boundary layer. As the core temperature decreases, the driving temperature difference for convection inside the thermal boundary layer decreases, and the heat flux decreases. Cooling and crystallization of the molten thermal boundary layer is very fast(~100 years). After the melt fraction drops to ~40% the viscosity significantly increases and the core-mantle boundary temperature continues to decrease at a much slower rate. When a relatively modest viscosity contrast between the thermal boundary layer ( [...] at the rheological transition) and the mantle is achieved, a superplume is generated.|$|R
40|$|All large {{continental}} igneous {{provinces and}} most high-temperature magmas (picrites, komatiites) are {{found on the}} margins of cratonic lithosphere. The standard plume model of flood basalt formation offers no explanation for this observation. We propose that thick lithosphere (usually Archean) adjacent to thinner lithosphere may control the locations of flood basalt provinces. The boundary between thick and thin lithosphere focuses both the strain in the lithosphere and the upwelling convection. In addition, the non-uniform boundary condition actually induces a small-scale form of convection that is not present in simple convection and plume models. Whereas plumes are a form of convective instability rising from the base of a <b>convecting</b> system <b>heated</b> from below, the form of convection we are discussing is triggered from above. Unlike other lithospheric mechanisms, the asymmetric lithosphere does not require convective thinning or heating of the plate in order to produce melting. This eliminates time delay between the arrival of the plume head and the onset of volcanism in the stretching model. We consider a series of calculations with a step-function change in thickness of the boundary layer and an externally imposed pull-apart. The flow in our models is shallow and sub-horizontal, and brings hot material from under the thicker (cratonic) boundary layer towards the pull-apart. A simple estimate of the amount of melt generated by this mechanism suggests that it is capable of producing a large igneous province, even for a dry mantle...|$|R
