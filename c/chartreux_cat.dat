50|$|As {{for every}} French cat with a pedigree, {{the first letter}} of the {{official}} name of a <b>Chartreux</b> <b>cat</b> encodes the year of its birth. All Chartreux born {{in the same year}} have official names beginning with the same letter. The code letters rotate through the alphabet each year, omitting the letters K, Q, W, X, Y, and Z. For example, a Chartreux born in 2011 would have an official name starting with the letter G.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chartreux</b> <b>cats</b> {{tend to be}} quiet, rarely making noises such as mewing or crying, {{and some}} are mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux {{learning}} to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. <b>Chartreux</b> <b>cats</b> are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects {{in the same manner}} as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy. Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.|$|R
