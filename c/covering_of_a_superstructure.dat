50|$|The major {{differences}} between khmaralite and sapphirine-2M are the prescense <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2xa <b>superstructure</b> {{and the larger}} count of Be at one tetrahedral site. Khmaralite and sapphirine-2M cannot be distinguished by optical properties alone because the internal effects of Be on the crystal structure are covered by the effect of Fe substitution for Mg and Al. But the presence of 2 wt% or more <b>of</b> BeO indicates <b>a</b> likely advocate for khmaralite. Confirmation is available by using electron diffraction {{to see if there}} is <b>a</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>superstructure.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{isomorphism}} {{classes of}} several types <b>of</b> graph <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph have been enumerated by many authors. Kwak and Lee (Canad. J. Math. XLII (1990) 747; J. Graph Theory 23 (1996) 105) enumerated the isomorphism classes <b>of</b> n-fold graph <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph G. Similar works for regular <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph {{can be found}} in (Discrete Math. 143 (1995) 87; J. Graph Theory 15 (1993) 621; Discrete Math. 148 (1996) 85; Math. Scand. 84 (1999) 23; SIAM J. Discrete Math. 11 (1998) 273). Recently, Archdeacon et al. (Discrete Math. 214 (2000) 51) characterized <b>a</b> bipartite <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> G and enumerated the isomorphism classes of regular 2 p-fold bipartite <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-bipartite graph. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> continuation <b>of</b> their study, we enumerate the isomorphism classes <b>of</b> regular balanced <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> signed graph and those <b>of</b> regular bipartite <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph. Jones (Math. Scand. 84 (1999) 23) enumerated the equivalence classes of the regular branched <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> any given surface according to the degrees of branch points. This enables us to count the isomorphism classes of the regular branched <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surface. But, {{it is not easy to}} derive a counting formula for the isomorphism classes of regular branched orientable surface <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-orientable surface. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> application <b>of</b> the result, we also enumerate the isomorphism classes of regular branched orientable surface <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-orientable surface having a finite abelian covering transformation group. It gives a partial answer for the question raised by Liskovets (Acta Appl. Math. 52 (1998) 91) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{critically}} {{investigate the}} model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doped excitonic insulator, which recently has been invoked to explain some experimental {{properties of the}} ferromagnetic state in Ca_{ 1 -x}La_xB_ 6. We demonstrate that the ground state of this model is intrinsically unstable towards the appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>superstructure.</b> In addition, the model {{would lead to a}} phase separation regime and the domain structure which may be prevented by the Coulomb forces only. Recent experiments indicate that <b>a</b> <b>superstructure</b> may indeed show up in this material. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R

25|$|The {{southern}} part of the station consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>superstructure</b> which provides access from the overpass. Designed by Arne Henriksen, it has a unique shape and design, inspired by Aldo Rossi. Henriksen's superstructure is listed as a cultural heritage. The unique design of the station has made it a local landmark and it has been featured among other things in a borough logo. The northern part has <b>an</b> access <b>superstructure</b> made <b>of</b> steel and hardened glass, chosen to be resistant against vandalism. Both accesses have an elevator and stairs.|$|R
40|$|G-quadruplex-forming are {{widespread}} in eukaryotic genomes. In particular, G-quadruplex motifs {{have been found}} in the promoter region of 40 % human genes. One of these genes is hTERT, encoding the catalytic subunit of human telomerase, whose up-regulated expression is responsible for the unlimited proliferative potential of most cancer cells. hTERT core promoter exhibits a high potential for G-quadruplex formation, containing nine partially overlapping PQS (putative quadruplex sequence) in <b>a</b> G-rich region <b>of</b> 68 nucleotides. Here we show the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>superstructure</b> in the hTERT promoter deriving from the simultaneous folding of three adjacent G-quadruplex structures. Interestingly, G-quadruplex ligands are able to stabilize hTERT G-quadruplex structures and to alter transcription from the hTERT promoter, suggesting that the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> G-quadruplex <b>superstructure</b> could play <b>a</b> role in regulating gene transcription...|$|R

40|$|We discuss 3 -manifolds {{which are}} cyclic <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> the 3 -sphere, {{branched}} over 2 -bridge knots and links. Different descriptions of these manifolds are presented: polyhedral, Heegaard diagram, Dehn surgery and coloured graph constructions. Using these descriptions, we give presentations for their fundamental groups, which are cyclic presentations {{in the case}} of 2 -bridge knots. The homology groups are given for <b>a</b> wide class <b>of</b> cases. Moreover, we prove that each singly-cyclic branched <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2 -bridge link is the composition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meridian-cyclic branched <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> determined link and <b>a</b> cyclic branched <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trivial knot.

If <b>a</b> high amount <b>of</b> the silane fixed on the particles surface is covalently bound, both mechanical properties are improved strongly. The combination of the surface modified fumed silica with silicone nanoparticles lead to a strong synergistic interaction with respect to adhesion properties.
