40|$|We {{study the}} {{electromagnetic}} fields of an arbitrarily moving <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> and the radiation reaction on the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> using a novel approach. We first {{show that the}} fields of an arbitrarily moving <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> in an inertial frame can be related in a simple manner to the fields of a uniformly accelerated <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> in its rest frame. Since the latter field is static and easily obtainable, {{it is possible to}} derive the fields of an arbitrarily moving <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> by a coordinate transformation. More importantly, this formalism allows us to calculate the self-force on a <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> in a remarkably simple manner. We show that the original expression for this force, obtained by Dirac, can be rederived with much less computation and in an intuitively simple manner using our formalism.

5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is a stream of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).|$|E
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} is a stellar-wind bubble, {{a region}} of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400km/s its solar wind, a stream of <b>charged</b> <b>particles,</b> until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of the}} Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiation}} from a <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> carries energy and momentum. In order to satisfy energy and momentum conservation, the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> must experience a recoil {{at the time}} of emission. The radiation must exert an additional force on the <b>charged</b> <b>particle.</b> This force is known as the Abraham-Lorentz force in the nonrelativistic limit and the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force in the relativistic setting.|$|R

Currently, there lacks quantitative evaluation method for the impact of spatial <b>charged</b> <b>particle.</b> Besides, there is limitation for the widely used mass shielding, permanent magnet deflection and anticoincidence technology in shielding spatial <b>charged</b> <b>particle.</b> So, this paper reviews the researches about the problem, and provides a novel design thought about spatial <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> shielding system for spatial optical sensor & detector based on electric & magnetic complex field...|$|R

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> moving around a slowly rotating Kerr {{black hole in}} the presence of an external magnetic field is investigated. We are interested in exploring the conditions under which the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> can escape from the gravitational field of the black hole after colliding with another particle. The escape velocity of the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> in the innermost stable circular orbit is calculated. The effective potential and escape velocity of the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> with angular momentum {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field is analyzed.

40|$|The first {{measurements}} from proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV {{recorded with}} the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. Data presented here {{were collected on}} 30 th March 2010 using a minimum-bias trigger. The <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, {{and the relationship between}} mean transverse momentum and <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> multiplicity are measured for events with at least one <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> in the kinematic range |eta|&lt; 2. 5 and pT&gt; 500 MeV. This analysis follows very closely the strategy used in the sqrt(s) = 900 GeV data publication. The final sqrt(s) = 7 TeV results are compared to these published values. Several improvements were made to both the track and the vertex reconstruction algorithms. The range in both the transverse momentum and the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> multiplicity is extended. This note concentrates on describing the aspects of the analysis that have changed. The <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity for |eta| = 0 is measured to be 2. 418 +/- 0. 004 (stat.) +/- 0. 076 (syst.).

50|$|Electron wake is the {{disturbance}} left after a high-energy <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> passesthrough condensed matter or plasma. Ions passing through can introduce periodic oscillations in the crystal lattice or plasma wave with the characteristic {{frequency of the}} crystal or plasma frequency. Interactions of the field created by these oscillations with the <b>charged</b> <b>particle</b> field alternate from constructive interference to destructive interference, producing alternating waves of electric field and displacement. The frequency of the wake field {{is determined by the}} nature of the penetrated matter, and the period of the wake field is directly proportional to the speed of the incoming <b>charged</b> <b>particle.</b> The amplitude of the first wake wave is the most important, as it produces a braking force on the <b>charged</b> <b>particle,</b> eventually slowing it down. Wake fields also can capture and guide lightweight ions or positrons in the direction perpendicular to the wake. The larger the speed of the original <b>charged</b> <b>particle,</b> the larger the angle between the initial particle's velocity and the captured ion's velocity.|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by <b>charged</b> <b>particles</b> created by the planet's magnetic field.

The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind.
