Gamma rays of average energies 112. 2 ± 0. 6 kev., 206. 3 ± 1. 0 kev., and 317 - 3 ± 1. 5 kev., have been found, the former two of comparable intensity {{and the latter}} much weaker. <b>Characteristic</b> <b>X-radiation</b> from Hf has also been observed. These energies are computed from four conversion lines on the beta spectrum at 46. 9 ± 0. 5 kev., 101. 8 ± 0. 6 kev., 109. 9 ± 0. 6 kev., and 141. 4 ± 0. 8 kev., {{as well as from}} photoelectron lines using lead, gold, and tin radiators.

40|$|The hadronic {{ground state}} shift and width in pionic {{deuterium}} (piD) were measured with high precision at the pion factory of the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Switzerland (PSI-Experiment R- 06. 03). The shift in pionic deuterium {{is directly related}} to the pion-nucleon isospin scattering lengths as measured from the shift and broadening in pionic hydrogen (piH) (PSI-Experiment R- 98. 01). The combination of the high-precision results from piH with the value from piD will provide a decisive constraint for effective field theories like chiral perturbation theory (ChiPT) describing QCD in the non-perturbative regime. In particular, the shift in piD is very sensitive to isospin-breaking corrections in contrast to charged pion-nucleon reactions. Furthermore, the hadronic width in piD {{is directly related to}} pion production at threshold, a field of considerable efforts from the theoretical side also within the frame work of ChiPT. In this experiment the piD(3 p- 1 s) X-ray transition of about 3 keV was measured using a high-resolution Bragg crystal spectrometer equipped with a large-area position sensitive CCD detector. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>X-radiation</b> stems from a de-excitation cascade of the pionic atom. In order to produce an intense X-ray source, the cyclotron trap was used to stop pions in a cryogenic D_ 2 target after winding up the pion beam in a magnetic field. The hadronic shift is obtained from the measured transition energy by comparison to the pure electromagnetic value, where the determination of the broadening requires the precise knowledge of the spectrometer response, obtained from measurements of narrow X-ray transitions from highly ionised atoms, produced in an electron cyclotron resonance ion trap. The major problem of the experiment is to disentangle from the observed energy shift and width of the X-ray line the pure hadronic contributions from collision-induced effects during the atomic cascade. It is known, that molecules are formed in piD+D_ 2 collisons and a possible X-ray emission from molecular states leads to an additional energy shift. As the formation rate is assumed to be density dependent, the piD(3 p- 1 s) X-ray energy was measured at three different D_ 2 pressures. Another cascade process (Coulomb de-excitation) transforms the energy release of de-excitation steps into kinetic energy of the collision partners leading to a Doppler broadening of subsequent X-ray transitions. The hadronic broadening is only obtained after deconvolution of the spectrometer response function and the contributions from Doppler broadening. No energy dependence of the piD(3 p- 1 s) was found, and it is concluded that radiative de-excitation from molecular states is negligible within the experimental accuracy. Hence, the result for the shift reads epsilon(1 s) =(- 2. 325 ± 0. 031) eV, corresponding to an accuracy of 1. 3 % and represents the average of the three measured densities. The uncertainty is dominated by the accuracy of the gallium K alpha_ 2 transition used for the energy calibration. From the analysis of the Doppler broadening no significant contribution from high kinetic energies could be identified from the line shape. With Doppler contribution constrained to kinetic energies below a few eV, the result for the hadronic ground-state width is Gamma(1 s) =(1. 162 + 0. 024 - 0. 049) eV, corresponding to an accuracy of (+ 2. 1 - 4. 2) %. The precision of both shift and width as obtained in this experiment reaches or exceeds the accuracy envisaged in present and forthcoming ChiPT calculations. Hence, experiment and theory contribute at comparable level to the extraction of the pion-nucleon scattering lengths and related parameters...|$|E
