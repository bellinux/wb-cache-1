5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E
5|$|A <b>{{cervical}}</b> <b>mucus</b> plug, {{called the}} operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> described below.|$|E
50|$|Hydrocolpos is the {{distension}} of {{the vagina}} caused by accumulation of fluid due to congenital vaginal obstruction. The obstruction is often {{caused by an}} imperforate hymen or less commonly a transverse vaginal septum. The fluid consists of <b>cervical</b> and endometrial <b>mucus</b> or in rare instances urine accumulated through a vesicovaginal fistula proximal to the obstruction.|$|R
40|$|Mucus glycoproteins (mucins) from <b>cervical</b> {{pregnancy}} <b>mucus</b> were fractionated {{by using}} rate-zonal centrifugation in a gradient of guanidinium chloride. The {{distribution of the}} macromolecules, as assessed by using sialic acid determination, suggested the presence of three populations of different size. Individual fractions were subjected to laser light-scattering performed as total-intensity measurements as well as photon correlation spectroscopy. The results showed that points of inflexion {{were present in the}} distribution of both Mr and DT (translational diffusion coefficient) and that the three populations have Mr values of approx. 24 X 10 (6), 16 X 10 (6) and 6 X 10 (6) respectively. The weight-average Mr for the whole distribution, as calculated from the values obtained for the individual fractions, was 13. 6 X 10 (6), which is in good agreement with that found for the unfractionated material (11. 1 X 10 (6]. Plots of log RG (radius of gyration) and log (1 /DT) versus log Mr are in keeping with the macromolecules being linear flexible chains...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{detection}} in ewe by acidity, {{elasticity of}} the <b>cervical</b> and vaginal <b>mucus</b> and by vaginal temperature measurement. Three simple methods were tested to predict oestrus in adult Texel ewes in conjonction with progesterone essays {{or the use}} of vasectomized ram. The pH of the vaginal mucus enables oestrus detection : more acid during oestrous and more alkaline during the luteal phase. The use of cervico-vaginal mucus elasticity as a predictor of oestrus was difficult due to its scarcity during some phases of the cycle and even the total lack of mucus by some ewes. The temperature measurement has been ineffective for heat detection...|$|R
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
40|$|Mucus glycoproteins (mucins) were {{extracted}} from human <b>cervical</b> pregnancy <b>mucus</b> by 6 M-guanidinium chloride {{in the presence}} of proteinase inhibitors. Purification was subsequently achieved by isopycnic density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl/ guanidinium chloride gradients. The purified macromolecules represented approx. 85 % of the total and were devoid of nucleic acids and proteins, as judged by analytical density-gradient centrifugation, disc electrophoresis and u. v. spectroscopy. Sedimentation-velocity centrifugation revealed a single unimodal peak with S 20,W 50. 1 S in 0. 2 M-NaCl and 37. 0 S in 6 M-guanidinium chloride. Molecular weights obtained by light-scattering were 9. 7 X 10 (6) and 5. 9 X 10 (6) in 0. 2 M-NaCl and 6 M-guanidinium chloride respectively. The chemical analyses were typical of those of epithelial mucins. The macromolecules contained approx. 20 % (w/w) of protein, and 65 % (w/w) was accounted for as carbohydrate. Serine and threonine constituted 32 mol/ 100 mol and proline 10 mol/ 100 mol of the amino acids. The major sugars found were N-acetylglucosamine (12. 8 %), N-acetylgalactosamine (9. 7 %), galactose (18. 7 %), sialic acid (15. 0 %) and fucose (7. 5 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{marmosets}} (F. Callithricidae), {{in common}} with other South American primates, do not menstruate. This is a major disadvantage in animals which otherwise have many attributes as experimental models for studies in repro-ductive physiology. The conventional methods of determining {{the stage of the}} ovarian cycle by means of vaginal smear cytology do not work for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear is no indication of oestrus because marmosets mate frequently and apparently indiscriminately throughout the cycle and early pregnancy (Hearn & Lunn, 1974). The patterns ofLH, oestradiol and progesterone in the peripheral plasma of the common marmoset show that this species has a clearly defined ovarian cycle of 16 =. =+-=. days (Hearn & Lunn, 1974), and it seemed possible that some change in the <b>cervical</b> or vaginal <b>mucus</b> might be used to monitor the ovarian cycle. We have examined samples of vaginal lavage for pH, peroxidase activity(Linford, 1974), vaginal cytology and protein composition. Only the protein patterns showed any correlation with the hormonal cycle. These changes were restricted to the prealbumins, a group of small proteins which appear betwee...|$|R
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. <b>Cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. <b>Cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> and {{paying attention to the}} sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body is gearing up for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise. The rise in progesterone causes a distinct change in {{the quantity and quality of}} mucus observed at the vulva.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{evidence}} {{also supports}} removal of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> before transfer.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms-based methods involve {{tracking}} {{one or more}} of {{the three}} primary fertility signs: basal body temperature, <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> and cervical position. Systems relying exclusively on <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> include the Billings Ovulation Method, , the Creighton Model, and the Two-Day Method. Symptothermal methods combine observations of basal body temperature (BBT), <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> and sometimes cervical position. Calendar-based methods rely on tracking a woman's cycle and identifying her fertile window based on the lengths of her cycles. The best known of these methods is the Standard Days Method. The Calendar-Rhythm method is also considered a calendar-based method, though it is not well defined and has many different meanings to different people.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs, such as decongestants, {{can change}} <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus.</b> In women taking these drugs, the mucus sign may not {{accurately}} indicate fertility.|$|E
25|$|High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, {{such as the}} injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat, {{completely}} inhibit follicular {{development and}} ovulation. The same <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Another primary {{mechanism}} of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration through the cervix into the upper genital tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the viscosity of the <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, {{such as the}} progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant Implanon), {{allow some}} {{follicular}} development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> changes occur as with low dose progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Saliva microscopes, when {{correctly}} used, {{can detect}} ferning {{structures in the}} saliva that precede ovulation. Ferning is usually detected beginning three days before ovulation, and continuing until ovulation has occurred. During this window, ferning structures occur in <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> as well as saliva.|$|E
25|$|Women who are fertile {{experience}} a natural period of fertility {{before and during}} ovulation, and they are naturally infertile {{during the rest of}} the menstrual cycle. Fertility awareness methods are used to discern when these changes occur by tracking changes in <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> or basal body temperature.|$|E
25|$|Combination pills usually work by {{preventing}} a woman's ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation). They also thicken the <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> which keeps sperm from penetrating into the uterus and joining with an egg. The hormones in combination and progestogen-only pills also thin {{the lining of}} the uterus. This could prevent pregnancy by interfering with implantation of a blastocyst.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{combined}} hormonal contraceptives, Ortho Evra / Evra works {{primarily by}} preventing ovulation. A secondary {{mechanism of action}} is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus.</b> Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation; however, no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use.|$|E
25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of {{fertility}} are basal body temperature (BBT), <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> and cervical position. A woman practicing symptoms-based fertility awareness {{may choose to}} observe one sign, two signs, or all three. Many women experience secondary fertility signs that correlate with certain phases of the menstrual cycle, such as abdominal pain and heaviness, back pain, breast tenderness, and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains).|$|E
25|$|More {{effective}} than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track basal body temperature, <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> or both, {{are known as}} symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method. Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years, and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using hyaluronic acid as adherence medium for the embryo. Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer. Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{fertility}} awareness rely on observation {{of changes in}} {{one or more of the}} primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> and cervical position), tracking menstrual cycle length and identifying the fertile window based on this information, or both. Other signs may also be observed: these include breast tenderness and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains), urine analysis strips known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), and microscopic examination of saliva or cervical fluid. Also available are computerized fertility monitors.|$|E
25|$|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), {{also known}} as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), is a {{glycoprotein}} enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA {{is a member of}} the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. PSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely. It is also believed to be instrumental in dissolving <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> allowing the entry of sperm into the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of certain}} {{calendar}} rules {{to determine the}} length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase allows unprotected intercourse during {{the first few days of}} the menstrual cycle while maintaining a very low risk of pregnancy. With mucus-only methods, there is a possibility of incorrectly identifying mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding as menstruation. Keeping a BBT chart enables accurate identification of menstruation, when pre-ovulatory calendar rules may be reliably applied. In temperature-only systems, a calendar rule may be relied on alone to determine pre-ovulatory infertility. In symptothermal systems, the calendar rule is cross-checked by mucus records: observation of fertile <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> overrides any calendar-determined infertility.|$|E
25|$|Female {{masturbation}} alters {{conditions in}} the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on {{the timing of the}} masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such an orgasm can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them. Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> and by moving debris out of the cervix.|$|E
25|$|Infertility affects {{both men}} and women. At least 97% of men with cystic {{fibrosis}} are infertile, but not sterile and can have children with assisted reproductive techniques. The main cause of infertility in men with CF is congenital absence of the vas deferens (which normally connects the testes to the ejaculatory ducts of the penis), but potentially also by other mechanisms such as causing no sperm, abnormally shaped sperm, and few sperm with poor motility. Many men found to have congenital absence of the vas deferens during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF. Around 20% of women with CF have fertility difficulties due to thickened <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> or malnutrition. In severe cases, malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes a lack of menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{were developed}} to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. They inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.|$|E
500|$|Several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60mg of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus</b> a day, {{increasing}} to 600mg {{around the}} time of ovulation. It is viscous as it contains large proteins known as mucins. The viscosity and water content varies during the menstrual cycle; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. These changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. It contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as amylase; and prostaglandins. Its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. At midcycle {{around the time}} of ovulation—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus, and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm. It is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the [...] "ferning" [...] pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern. The mucus has stretchy character described as Spinnbarkeit most prominent {{around the time of}} ovulation.|$|E
2500|$|Some symptoms-based {{forms of}} {{fertility}} awareness require observation or touching of <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> an activity with which {{some women are}} not comfortable. Some practitioners prefer {{to use the term}} [...] "cervical fluid" [...] to refer to <b>cervical</b> <b>mucus,</b> in an attempt to make the subject more acceptable to these women.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{hormonal}} agents on the reproductive system is complex.
