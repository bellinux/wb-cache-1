40|$|The {{increase}} of international cyberterrorism {{in recent years}} has resulted in computer-based criminal activities that generate worldwide fear, destruction and disruption. National laws and policies that address cyberterrorism are mainly limited to developed nations and are not cohesive in managing 21 st century cyberterrorism. Given the absence of an international legal framework to address cyberterrorism, authorities and governments around the world face extreme challenges in finding and prosecuting those responsible for cyberterrorism.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCommunities {{on the international}} border are often interconnected by more than simple proximity. They are connected through social networks, economy, culture, and shared natural resources. Despite this interdependent relationship, {{and in spite of}} international agreements that support mutual aid between countries, crossing the border with emergency resources, even for a humanitarian purpose, can be problematic. This thesis examined existing agreements on both the northern and southern U. S. borders to determine how various regions address their <b>cross-border</b> <b>agreements.</b> Research indicated that unique challenges—such as liability concerns, local politics, and border violence—along the Mexican border must be addressed. By examining the fuller context, this thesis recommends that local entities examine their specific challenges to establishing fully interoperable agreements.

In particular, the research focuses on: 1) the direction and degree of dependency organizations had on their cross-border counterparts for information and response implementation; 2) the use of formal and informal processes in transnational decision-making and communication; 3) {{the extent to which}} standardization inconsistencies affected the disaster response; 4) whether or not transnational interaction occurred primarily between centralized emergency organizations or decentralized agencies involved in flood-fighting efforts. The analysis uses a grounded theory examination of <b>cross-border</b> <b>agreements,</b> agency and governmental reports, newspapers, and interviews conducted with sixty-two key representatives from principle Canadian and American organizations involved in the flood response. The study describes the nature and frequency of the interaction. It finds that although several problems or areas of cohesion developed, transnational interaction between organizations during the 1997 flood was generally successful, with respondents reporting satisfaction with the willingness and ability of their counterparts to provide information and assistance.

40|$|When Swedish {{administrative}} authorities co-operate {{with foreign}} administrative authorities, this may {{give rise to}} legally complex situations. This thesis investigates legal frameworks to solve the ensuing problems. The investigation in particular deals with binding agreements concluded by Swedish state authorities and municipalities with corresponding types of foreign public bodies. By the conclusion of such agreements more than one legal system may be involved. This thesis deals with Swedish national law and public international law. A question for this thesis is to what extent {{it is possible for}} a Swedish administrative authority to regulate cooperation by means of a binding agreement. The answer to this question is that the possibilities are relatively good, if and when the agreements in questions are not subject to the provisions in the Swedish Constitution - in chapter 10 of the Instrument of Government - on international agreements. These provisions are applicable to binding agreements under public international law and possibly also to certain agreements regulated by rules of other legal systems. Another main question for this thesis is which terms may be included in cross-border co-operation agreements. Swedish law sets up limits on the matters for which public authorities may enter into <b>cross-border</b> <b>agreements.</b> These limits affect agreements concerning matters of foreign policy or concerning the transfer of the right of decision-making to non-Swedish authorities. In addition to these two central questions, this thesis also deals with a number of others, mainly questions concerning choice of a legal system regulating a cross-border agreement and legal effects of ultra vires agreements...|$|E

40|$|Avtal med internationell karaktär är idag vanligt förekommande, då handel inte enbart sker inom ett lands gränser. En fråga som oftast aktualiseras när tvist uppkommer mellan parter i ett internationellt avtalsförhållande är vilken lag som ska tillämpas. För att lösa tvisten och lagvalsfrågan, finns olika tvistlösningsalternativ, bl. a. tvistlösning vid allmän domstol där lagvalsfrågan avgörs med tillämpning av den s. k. Rom I-förordningen, eller tvistlösning genom internationellt kommersiellt skiljeförfarande. Vid båda dessa alternativ är principen om partsautonomi en viktig hörnsten. Principen innebär att parterna själva kan avtala om vilken lag de vill ska tillämpas på avtalet. Vid införandet av Rom I-förordningen utvidgades principen om partsautonomi, från dess tidigare utformning i Romkonventionen, till att även innebära en möjlighet för parterna att välja icke-statliga regler. Denna utvidgning motiverades bl. a. av att detta var möjligt för parter som valde internationellt skiljeförfarande som tvistlösningsalternativ. Frågan som då uppkommer är varför denna utvidgning av principen gjordes, och framförallt varför man motiverade utvidgningen genom att jämföra med principens utformning i internationellt skiljeförfarande. Dessa två tvistlösningsalternativ påvisar stora olikheter, där skiljeförfarandet karakteriseras av att parterna har den övervägande bestämmanderätten av hur förfarandet ska gå tillväga och vilken lag som ska tillämpas. Partsautonomin inom internationellt skiljeförfarande är i stort sett obegränsad, medan det i Rom I-förordningen ställs upp begränsningar som gör att parternas lagval kan frångås. Utformningen av partsautonomin i Rom I-förordningen får anses strida mot den förutsebarhet som principen och förordningen har till syfte att uppnå, och den utformning av principen som hämtades från skiljeförfarandets utformning, är därför inte ändamålsenlig. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are more}} common today, since it’s not unusual that a {{contract}} is entered into by parties resident in different states. A question that often occurs when a dispute arises between parties to an international contract is which law {{that is to be}} applied. In order to resolve the dispute and determine the applicable law there are various options, for example resolving the dispute before a general court where the applicable law is determined by the provisions of the Rome I Regulation, or by settling the dispute by international commercial arbitration. In both cases, the principle of party autonomy is an important cornerstone. The principle allows the parties to an international contract to determine the applicable law. The principle, which was acknowledged already in the Rome Conventionen, was widened when the Rome Convention was replaced by the Rome I Regulation. Parties were given an additional possibility to choose non-state rules to govern the contract. This was motivated {{by the fact that the}} possibility to choose non-state rules was acknowledged in international arbitration. The question that arises is why the principle was widened, and why this was justified by a comparison of the design of the principle in international arbitration. There are notable differences between these two alternatives of resolving a dispute, where the principle of party autonomy in international arbitration is basically unrestricted, while the same principle in the Rome I Regulation is subject to restrictions that might result in another applicable law than the one chosen by the parties. The design of the principle in the Rome I Regulation is in contrary to the purpose of the principle and the Regulation, since the restrictions makes it more difficult for the parties to predict the applicable law. The design of the principle, which was effected by the design of the principle in international arbitration, is therefore not considered as appropriate...|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} of European integration and the forming of the European Union begun {{at the end}} of World War II did not include education as part of that agenda. As revealed in a review of the literature, education came into the process through indirect means. The {{processes of}} European integration and the forming of the European Union have fostered processes that have influence domestic policies. Characterized as Europeanization, those processes have influenced and are at the root of European nations forming an intergovernmental <b>cross-border</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1999 to change their higher education systems. Known as the Bologna Declaration, the reforms called for focus on six objectives and include a key principle of European integration, mobility. This dissertation focuses on reviewing the antecedents to the Bologna Process, the direct influences of the Bologna Declaration, and the reports prepared for the 2003 Berlin follow-up meeting that are statements of the progress toward the implementation of the six objectives of the Bologna Declaration. This review suggests that the key instruments of change, harmonization of higher education, and the building of the European Higher Education Area are the first four objectives of the Bologna Process: 1) a system of easily readable and comparable degrees; 2) a system based on two main cycles: undergraduate and graduate; 3) a system of credits, and; 4) the promotion of mobility. Further, the Bologna Declaration represents a process of the Europeanization of higher education. The findings suggest that by 2003 while in the majority nations articulate commitments to the Bologna Process and progress toward the implementation of policy changes, what steps were taken to achieve the four main objectives of the Bologna process depend on the degree to which nations carry out the reforms called for in the Bologna Declaration...|$|R

40|$|The European Banking Union is a {{major step}} forward in fixing major {{deficiencies}} in the institutional framework of the Euro area. The absence of effective banking supervision and resolution powers at the European level promoted excessive private risk-taking in the up-run to the Euro crisis. Effective private risk sharing once risks materialized has been hampered. A properly designed Banking Union facilitates and improves private risk sharing, and it is thus a necessary institutional complement to a monetary union. Yet, the institutional framework of the Banking Union needs further strengthening in three regards. First, the supervisory framework needs to ensure uniform supervisory standards for all banks, including those located in non-Euro area countries. Also, conflicts of interest between monetary policy and banking supervision need to be mitigated. Second, bank resolution suffers from a highly complex governance structure. Restructuring and bail-in rules allow for a high degree of discretion {{at the level of the}} resolution authority. We propose to introduce a statutory systemic risk exception, by which the exercise of discretion would be reduced, thereby strengthening the credibility of the bail-in.

40|$|As {{trade is}} an {{important}} driver of growth and infrastructure is a necessity for trade, infrastructure development has a key {{role to play in}} economic development. This study aims to quantify the potential benefits of the development of the economic transport corridors, along with the implementation of the <b>Cross-Border</b> Transport <b>Agreement</b> (CBTA) in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Some of the key linkages between upgraded infrastructure, economic growth, and sectoral responses are explored using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. The study provides a static view of one-off gains from a conservative estimate in a reduction in transport costs and improvements in trade facilitation. The findings show clear gains from improvements in physical land transport and the more substantial gains from improved trade facilitation. The results also provide a glimpse into the potential gains from intra-regional trade, highlighting the potential markets within the GMS. The implications of these results are that once a sufficient physical system is in place, additional benefits are marginal compared with improvements in policy initiatives under the heading of trade facilitation. While the GMS does not have the level of physical infrastructure that would be considered adequate for its desired level of economic activity, the results show that investing in soft aspects now still has substantial payback. In the future, as a greater physical base is put in place, the region should enjoy further benefits from expanded markets having a solid trade facilitation system in place. In sum, the CBTA and transport corridor development can significantly improve transit times and trade service costs, albeit with some drawbacks, throughout the region...|$|R

This was the biggest motivation for Waissi to initiate an alternative transit route, later called the Lapis Lazuli Transit and Transport Route. His ideas was accepted by Jawed Ludin, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Afghanistan and later by Zarar Ahmad Osmani, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan. Waissi was being appointed immediately by Minister Osmani to follow with the concerned counties and coordinate to become party of the this initiative. Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia immediately joined and Turkey was the last country to become as a party to this initiative. In early 2014 Waissi {{and a team of}} experts from the Afghan Government started the negotiation from Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Waissi was leading the negotiation for the agreement on behalf of Afghan Government. The Lapis-Lazuli Transit & Transport Route (known as the 'Lapis Lazuli Route') agreement aims to enhance regional economic cooperation and connectivity between the countries of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, thereby expanding economic and cultural links between Europe and Asia. In doing so, the initiative seeks to improve transport infrastructure and procedures (including for road, rail, and sea), increase exports, and expand the economic opportunities of citizens in countries benefiting from this new transport corridor. Barriers to regional trade and transit and transaction costs will be reduced, in part, through a new Custom Integration Procedure and, between Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, a new <b>Cross-Border</b> Transport <b>Agreement.</b> Its projected impact is considerable not only because most of the needed infrastructure is already in place, but also because most of the investment required will focus on improving policy and governance.The Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value still need to be established, but with a discount rate applied at 12%, the overall returns are expected to be positive. The Lapis Lazuli Route will connect with Turkey’s Middle Corridor Project (“East-West Trans-Caspian Trade and Transport Corridor”).|$|R
