25|$|When <b>{{children}}</b> <b>see</b> a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, {{the children}} {{try to get}} close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts {{to get close to}} the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail. Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old. Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of African-Caribbean teachers in the UK, {{it has been suggested that}} their under-representation in inner-city schools is a major factor in the failure, particularly of secondary-level schools, to achieve a satisfactory average of achievement for the community's <b>children</b> (<b>see</b> Bernard Coard and the Swann Report of 1985). Though research by the Longitudinal Survey of Young People in England in 2011 showed that 66 per cent of those from native African backgrounds went on to university, compared to an average of 59 per cent of British Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) students, which therefore suggests that as an average, more people from Black African backgrounds are now progressing to university than those of a South Asian background.|$|E

On the one-year anniversary, she encouraged parents to instead read to their children, and perhaps light a candle in memoriam, saying, [...] "Don't let your <b>children</b> <b>see</b> the images, especially on September 11, when you know it'll probably be on television again and again – the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, some quick {{decisions}} {{needed to be}} made, particularly that involving his half-completed New Testament Theology; accordingly, Hurst was appointed Caird's Literary Executor.

2500|$|Even {{as a child}} grows older, {{death is}} still {{difficult}} to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger <b>children</b> <b>see</b> death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest themselves in [...] "acting out" [...] behaviors: a return to earlier behaviors such as sucking thumbs, clinging to a toy or angry behavior; though {{they do not have}} the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity. As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.|$|E

The current study is {{a comparison of the}} cohort of <b>children</b> <b>seen</b> from January through December 1984 with the parallel group seen from January through June 1994.

2500|$|A {{saturated}} solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses {{several times a}} day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be mL) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an expectorant (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for [...] uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100 mg a day for an adult, to less than this for <b>children</b> (<b>see</b> table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150μg per day (150 micrograms, not milligrams).|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees {{exhibit a}} variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for {{termites}} using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites. [...] Some of this variation {{may be the result}} of [...] "environmental shaping" [...] (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects. [...] When <b>children</b> <b>see</b> their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.|$|E
2500|$|... separations and reunions {{having the}} same meaning for all children. This may be a major {{constraint}} when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances. Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation {{have been developed for}} older preschool <b>children</b> (<b>see</b> Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990) but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood. Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn & Waters, 1990). A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also {{it is not at all}} obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".|$|E

2500|$|Camazotz – A {{planet of}} extreme, {{enforced}} conformity, {{ruled by a}} disembodied brain called IT. [...] Meg's father, Dr. Alex Murry, is imprisoned there for a time, inside a building called [...] "CENTRAL Central Intelligence". [...] Camazotz is described as being similar to Earth, with familiar birch, pines, and maple trees, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which [...] "might {{have been one of}} any number of familiar towns". Its ordinary appearance becomes less so as the <b>children</b> <b>see</b> that everything is endlessly duplicated without variation (except for one noncomforming boy, who is later punished). [...] Thus, the houses are [...] "all exactly alike, small square boxes painted gray"; this characterization has been compared with [...] "the burgeoning American suburbia" [...] such as the post-war housing developments of Levittown, Pennsylvania. The {{people who live in the}} houses are similarly described, with [...] "mother figures" [...] who [...] "all gave the appearance of being the same". Camazotz has also been compared with [...] "an early sixties American image of life in a Communist state", a characterization partially dismissed as too glib. [...] It is stated that Camazotz is a planet that has [...] "given in(to the Black Thing" [...] which implies that it was once a free world that was conquered by the Black Thing, which gave rise to IT's presence on the planet. The world is said to have a psychological significance for the character Meg, in that the pressure to conform there is similar to the pressures she faces in the small town where she lives. The name Camazotz refers to a Mayan bat god.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} inappropriately timed immunizations {{and their relationship}} to record keeping practices in Los Angeles public health centers. METHODS: Records of children's visits were reviewed at four public health centers maintaining separate records. RESULTS: One third of all <b>children</b> <b>seen</b> at both immunization-only and well child clinics were given inappropriately timed immunizations. Almost half of the immunizations were not transferred between sets of records. <b>Children</b> <b>seen</b> in both clinics were {{more than twice as likely}} to receive at least one inappropriately timed immunization as those seen only at the well child clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Keeping separate immunization records at separate clinics leads to inappropriately timed immunizations...|$|R
