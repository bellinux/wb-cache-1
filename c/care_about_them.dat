Among all majors, 75 % reported feeling their STEM professors <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and their learning.

However, fully 25 % of students about to graduate with a STEM major reported feeling their STEM professors did not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their learning, which raises an issue of concern to be investigated further. While the results for white men and men of color were nearly identical, white women reported the most care while women of color reported the least. Only 60 % of the women of color in our sample reported feeling their professors <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> despite being seniors about to receive their degrees in a STEM field.|$|R

500|$|The {{first two}} anime DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania Entertainment. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge felt the anime reminded him of [...] "parts of Princess Princess, especially {{when it came to the}} Elder status piece. It's even reminiscent of Strawberry Panic in this way." [...] The series is described as [...] "all about the [...] "moe" [...] factor, bringing about an atmosphere that makes you like the characters, <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and feel good about seeing them interact. It does it well even if it doesn’t have an amazing hook." [...] For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that the series continues to be [...] "very predictable and bland" [...] which is [...] "at this point fun but entirely forgettable." [...] Beveridge also wrote how [...] "the characters are all pleasant, nicely designed and with mildly interesting personalities that could lead to something more but never does." ...|$|E

[...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>them...</b> For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope".

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Badmotorfinger, Soundgarden went on a tour in North America during October and November 1991.

Soundgarden rejoined Guns N' Roses {{as part of the}} Use Your Illusion Tour in the summer of 1992 for a tour of Europe along with fellow opening act Faith No More. Regarding the time spent opening for Guns N' Roses, Cornell said, [...] "It wasn't a whole lot of fun going out in front of 40,000 people for 35 minutes every day.

500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] care less about them. And the story in this issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't have to wait a year between issues anymore".|$|E

500|$|Although {{originally}} intended as an unambiguous ending {{to the television}} series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over {{the possibility of a}} sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that [...] "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed." [...] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted [...] "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> and did go back and see it more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.|$|E
