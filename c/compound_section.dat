40|$|Magnitude of flood {{prediction}} {{is the fundamental}} for flood warning, determining the development for the present flood-risk areas and the long-term management of rivers. Discharge estimation methods currently employed in river modeling software are based on historic hand calculation formulae such as Chezy’s, Darcy-Weisbatch or Manning’s equation. More recent work has provided significant improvements in understanding and calculation of channel discharge. This ranges from the gaining knowledge to interpretation of the complex flow mechanisms to the advent of computing tools that enable more sophisticated solution techniques. When the flows in natural or man made channel sections exceed the main channel depth, the adjoining floodplains become inundated and carry part of the river discharge. Due to different hydraulic conditions prevailing in the river and floodplain, the mean velocity in the main channel and in the floodplain are different. Just above the bank-full stage, the velocity in main channel {{is much higher than}} the floodplain. Therefore the flow in the main channel exerts a pulling or accelerating force on the flow over floodplains, which naturally generates a dragging or retarding force on the flow through the main channel. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channel water and that of the floodplain. The interaction effect is very strong at just above bank full stage and decreases with increase in depth of flow over floodplain. The relative “pull” and “drag” of the flow between faster and slower moving sections of a <b>compound</b> <b>section</b> complicates the momentum transfer between them. Failure to understand this process leads to either overestimate or underestimate the discharge leading to the faulty design of channel section.

40|$|Reliable {{estimates}} of discharge capacity {{are essential for}} the design, operation, and maintenance of open channels, more importantly for the prediction of flood, water level management, and flood protection measures. During floods, the river water overtops its banks and spreads to the adjoining floodplains. For such compound channels, the flow structure becomes complex due to the transfer of momentum between the deep main channel and the adjoining floodplains. Discharge in meandering compound channels is strongly dependant on the interaction between flow in the main channel {{and that in the}} floodplain.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} roughness coefficients is of vital importance in any {{open channel flow}} study. In flood routing in natural rivers, most channels have compound sections and the roughness values in main channel and flood plains are usually different. In order to have more accurate results, the roughness of main channel and flood plains should be considered separately. It is possible to identify the values of roughness using optimisation methods. However, studies on the inverse problem of estimating roughness values in compound channels are still limited. In this study, some sets of synthetic data {{to work on the}} problem of identification of roughness values in a compound channel have been used. The writers adopt the implicit finite difference four-point box scheme to solve the Saint-Venant equations. The compound channel is treated as a divided channel section in which for any depth the conveyance of the <b>compound</b> <b>section</b> is then the sum of the main channel and floodplain conveyances. The algebraic equation system is linearised and solved by using the double sweep algorithm. The objective function of least square errors between observed and simulated discharge/stage is chosen for this inverse problem and solved by the Powell algorithm. The roughness values in compound channels are formulated as two quadratic polynomial functions of stage, one for main channel (nc) and the other for flood plains (nf). The performance of the model is evaluated for both cases when observed data are with and without noise. The computed results indicate that when observed data contain no noise the model can obtain very good results, especially for the main channel roughness. However, when the data contain noise although the computed main channel roughnesses are still very good there are some more biases of the computed floodplain roughness from the tru...|$|E

Experiments were conducted for these channels in the Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics laboratory of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India by making smooth, rigid, straight and converging within a concrete flume. Micro-ADV, Preston tube, notch, pointer gauge, manometers and other hydraulic equipment {{have been used to}} measure 3 -d velocity, boundary shear stress, and water surface profile at different sections of the channels. The research investigates the modeling of water surface profile, distribution of longitudinal velocity, depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear stress and energy loss for overbank flow cases in both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of converging compound channels. As a complementary study to the experimental research, numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. ANSYS is applied to simulate the flow for both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of converging compound channels. All the important flow parameters are extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values. As a prediction of flow variables in a non-prismatic converging compound channel is a much complex phenomenon, so an ANN has also been employed for prediction of depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear, and energy loss for different flow conditions. From the experimental study, new expressions for the water surface, energy loss and stage-discharge relationship for converging compound channels have been developed and validated with the present data and data sets from previous research projects.

Just above the bank-full stage, the velocity in main channel {{is much higher than}} the floodplain. Therefore the flow in the main channel exerts a pulling or accelerating force on the flow over floodplains, which naturally generates a dragging or retarding force on the flow through the main channel. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channel water and that of the floodplain. The interaction effect is very strong at just above bank full stage and decreases with increase in depth of flow over floodplain. The relative “pull” and “drag” of the flow between faster and slower moving sections of a <b>compound</b> <b>section</b> complicates the momentum transfer between them. Failure to understand this process leads to either overestimate or underestimate the discharge leading to the faulty design of channel section. This causes frequent flooding at its lower reaches. Due to transfer of momentum between the subsections of the meandering compound channel, the shear distribution is largely affected. For such compound channels, the apparent shear force at the assumed interface plane gives an insight into the magnitude of flow interaction. The results of some experiments concerning the velocity distribution and the flow distribution in a smooth and rough compound meandering channel of rectangular cross section are presented. The influence of the geometry on velocity and flow distribution and different functional relationships are obtained. Dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the velocity distribution and flow distribution between main channel and flood plain subsections. Once these equations get formed one can judge the exact flow in main channel and flood channel sections which could possibly guide in flood prediction. The experiments concerning the flow in simple meander channels and meander channel - floodplain geometry have been conducted at the Fluid Mechanics and Water Resources Engineering Laboratory of the Department Civil Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. Channels of different shapes and sizes have been fabricated in the laboratory with different equipments installed in them. Water is allowed to flow through these channels and the flow is maintained smooth. The Acoustics Doppler Velocitimeter (ADV) installed in the lab is worth mentioning. Taking the aid of a laptop terminal, this equipment helps in determining the three- dimensional velocities (Vx, Vy, Vz) at any point in the water channel. All the velocity readings obtained are recorded and finally velocity contours (i. e. isovels) are plotted with a software 3 D-Field. Depending on the flow pattern and shape of the channel, contours are obtained. All the contours are converted to bitmap image and finally inputted in MATLAB software. Now with this software discharge through a channel cross-section is generated which when compared to the actual flow discharge gives a very less percentage of error. Finally equations related to the flow distribution are formed based on the given datas. These formed equations are validated with datas collected from IIT Kharagpur (Bhattacharya, A. K.

40|$|The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB), which is formed by brain {{capillary}} endothelial cells, effectively protects {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) from potential neurotoxic agents and maintains the brain homeostasis for synaptic signaling (Abbott, 2004). Unfortunately, the restrictive permeability properties of the BBB also exclude the majority of potential therapeutics from entering the brain and present a major challenge in the treatment of many CNS disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and brain tumors (Pardridge, 2003). Therefore, strategies to deliver drugs across the BBB to the brain are of increasing interest. Moreover, a predictive in vitro BBB model retaining barrier-specific properties for the screening of drug candidates and for the evaluation of drug delivery strategies to the brain would be of great benefit in the development of CNS therapeutics. Primary brain capillary endothelial cells mimic the in vivo BBB characteristics the best with respect to paracellular tightness and functional expression of transporters and receptors (Gumbleton and Audus, 2001). However, primary cells can be maintained in culture only for a limited life span before they undergo senescence. Moreover, since primary brain endothelial cells are often isolated from animals, species differences may exist (Reichel et al., 2003). Immortalized cells can be used to overcome these drawbacks of short life span and species differences. However, immortalized cell lines suffer from reduced paracellular resistance and downregulation of gene expression of most transporters (Pardridge, 2004 a). A potential approach to overcome these limitations is to generate a conditionally immortalized cell line using a temperature-sensitive immortalization gene. This immortalization gene is only active at a temperature of 33 °C that leads to cell proliferation. At physiological temperature of 37 °C, this immortalization gene is inactivated and cell differentiation is favored (Terasaki et al., 2003). Therefore, a focus of the present thesis was to characterize the conditionally immortalized human BBB in vitro model, termed TY 09, with respect to its BBB specific characteristics and its potential application in transendothelial drug transport screening (section 3. 1). This in vitro model was obtained by immortalization of primary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from a human brain tissue with a temperature-sensitive immortalization gene. The cells exhibited spindle-shaped morphology similar to primary cells, expressed von Willebrand factor and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and showed acetylated LDL uptake. Western blot and mRNA analysis revealed the expression of important tight junction proteins, solute carriers, and ATP efflux transporters up to a passage of 50. Transendothelial transport experiments of reference compounds with different physicochemical properties in TY 09 cells showed similar transport characteristics as compared to the well-characterized human hCMEC/D 3 model. However, the slightly higher paracellular tightness of TY 09 model led to a lower background signal and allowed a better differentiation of compounds with low, medium and high permeability. This enhanced tightness enables mechanistic bidirectional transport studies of compounds with similar lipophilicity. Transport studies of psychoactive compounds (i. e. cathinones) in TY 09 cells revealed good brain penetration for all tested cathinones. An asymmetric transport characteristic was detected for methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), indicating the potential participation of an active uptake process, which may contribute to the high potency of this <b>compound.</b> <b>Section</b> 3. 2 discusses the in vitro evaluation of the BBB permeability of the psychoactive compounds. As stated above, the poor penetration of neurotherapeutics remains a challenge for the treatment of brain diseases. Therefore, much research has been put on the development of drug delivery strategies. Utilization of endogenous receptor-mediated transport systems that are highly expressed at the brain endothelium offers an effective strategy to overcome the BBB (Pardridge, 2003). Antibodies directed against these receptors have been shown to undergo transcytosis in animals and can be used as transport vectors for brain drug delivery (Pardridge, 1997; Pardridge et al., 1995). Conjugation of nanoparticles to targeting antibodies directed against an endogenous receptor system offers the possibility to carry drugs to the brain in pharmacologically significant quantities. Hence, much research has been focused on the development of different nanoparticles for brain drug delivery. In the past years, drug delivery systems based on artificial vesicles, such as polymersomes, have attracted much attention due to their tunable carrier properties and their ability to carry hydrophilic compounds in their aqueous core and lipophilic substances in their membrane (Ahmed and Discher, 2004; Christian et al., 2009; Discher and Eisenberg, 2002). Hence, another aim of this thesis was to evaluate the potential of antibody-targeted polymersomes for the implementation of drug targeting strategies to the brain (section 3. 3). For this purpose, the anti-human insulin receptor antibody 83 - 14 (83 14 mAb) was used as targeting vector because this antibody has been shown to undergo transcytosis in vivo upon binding to the insulin receptor with high affinity (Pardridge et al., 1995). Polymersomes based on poly(dimethylsiloxane) -block-poly(2 -methyl- 2 -oxazoline) [PDMS-b-PMOXA] block copolymers were used in this study. Characterization of polymersomes confirmed their hollow sphere and vesicle-shaped morphology. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments showed the successful conjugation of the 83 14 mAb to the polymersomes. Flow cytometry analysis revealed binding and uptake of the 83 14 mAb conjugated polymersomes by brain capillary endothelial cells expressing the insulin receptor. Competitive uptake inhibition studies confirmed the specificity of this process. Intracellular trafficking analysis showed the colocalization of the 83 - 14 mAb with a subpopulation of early endosomes and lysosomes after incubation for 20 min. An altered intracellular localization of the 83 14 mAb conjugated polymersomes was observed. The transcytosis process of the 83 14 mAb across the BBB remains unresolved and the factors involved in the altered trafficking of 83 - 14 mAb conjugated polymersomes need to be elucidated. Nevertheless, these observations contribute to the further understanding of the transcytosis process of the 83 14 mAb and the intracellular pathway of 83 - 14 mAb conjugated nanoparticles. With respect to screening of BBB permeability of compounds, sensitive analytical methods are required. This is particularly important for substances where only small quantities cross the BBB such as macromolecules. Capillary electrophoresis represents with its advantages (high sensitivity, low sample requirement, fast and automated measurements) a promising analytical technique for the quantification of molecules in the context of transport studies. Therefore, another objective of this thesis was to develop a sensitive analytical method based on capillary electrophoresis equipped with laser-induced fluorescence detector (CE-LIF) for the quantification of the transport of macromolecules across the BBB in vitro (section 3. 4). In this study, we aimed to quantify the BBB permeation of fluorescently labeled 83 14 mAb across monolayers of hCMEC/D 3 and TY 09 cells expressing the insulin receptor. The analytical method using CE-LIF obtained a low limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the antibody in the picomolar range. However, in contrast to the in vivo observation of the 83 - 14 mAb transcytosis to the brain (Pardridge et al., 1995), in vitro analysis of the transported amount of fluorescently labeled 83 14 mAb across human brain endothelial cell monolayers did not reveal the active process of transcytosis. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed in this section. With regard to future applications of therapeutic antibodies, one of the topics of the present thesis was to extend the analytical method based on capillary electrophoresis for the viscosity determination of therapeutic antibody solutions (section 3. 5). Therapeutic antibodies are often administered as highly concentrated solutions in order to achieve a therapeutic effect. These highly concentrated solutions show an increase in viscosity which limits their application. Therefore, in drug development, the viscosity of the protein solutions needs to be determined in order to optimize the formulation and adjust the viscosity appropriate for parenteral application. Different methods are applied for viscosity measurements. Most methods need a relatively high amount of the expensive samples and are time consuming. Therefore, in the present thesis, the possibility to employ capillary electrophoresis for viscosity measurements of protein samples was evaluated. Using CE, it was possible to estimate the viscosities (in the range of 2 to 40 mPas) of typical protein formulations with Newtonian flow behavior. The advantages of this analytical method over other methods for viscosity measurements are the low sample consumption and the fully automated viscosity determination. ...|$|E
