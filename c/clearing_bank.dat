50|$|The {{following}} list {{shows the}} first two digits of the sort codes allocated to <b>clearing</b> <b>banks.</b> Thus, in the example 01-10-01, 01 indicates that the bank is {{a branch of the}} National Westminster Bank; the other sets of digits are for internal use. This example represents the NatWest branch in Spring Gardens, Manchester. <b>Clearing</b> <b>banks</b> can act for other banks, so looking up a bank by sort code in this list does not always mean the account is actually handled by that bank, e.g. the sort code 08-32-00 HMRC VAT is not a Co-operative Bank account but a Citibank account, as is 08-32-10 for National Insurance.|$|R

40|$|The species {{richness}} of fishes and the distributions of six fish species were compared among four habitat types, snaggy <b>banks,</b> <b>clear</b> <b>banks,</b> mud banks and mid channels, in an estuary in tropical Australia. Both {{day and night}} samples were collected in fish traps, on four occasions, three months apart. On each sampling trip {{the highest number of}} species was trapped from snaggy habitats, intermediate numbers from <b>clear</b> <b>banks</b> or mud banks, and the fewest species from mid channels. Although more species occurred in night than in day samples, the pattern of difference among habitats was consistent. The probability of capture of the six most abundant species, Acanthopagrus australis, Acanthopagrus berda, Arothron manilensis, Arius argyropleuron, Epinephelus coioides and Lutjanus russelli, was compared among habitat types and between day and night samples. Overall, snag habitats tended to be associated with high probabilities of capture of a number of species, particularly A. berda and L. russelli. At night, mid channels were characterized by high numbers of A. argyropleuron. <b>Clear</b> and mud <b>banks,</b> and day samples from mid channels were associated with low numbers of most species...|$|R

40|$|Concern {{about the}} {{relationship}} between small firms and <b>clearing</b> <b>banks</b> has resurfaced periodically over many years.

There {{is no doubt that the}} issues raised by the relationship are potentially very significant for the future development of the Scottish economy and accordingly warrant detailed and careful consideration. With this sort of thing in mind, in July 1991 the Association of British Chambers of Commerce commissioned our survey of small firms in Southern England, the English Midlands and Scotland. We posted a questionnaire to 1500 Chambers of Commerce members. This paper examines the 73 responses from small firm customers of Scottish <b>clearing</b> <b>banks.</b> These responses are discussed in Section 3. Section 2 provides background information by briefly noting major issues of concern (1) ...|$|R
