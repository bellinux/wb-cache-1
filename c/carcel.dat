25|$|García <b>Cárcel</b> {{estimates}} that the total number processed by the Inquisition throughout its history was approximately 150,000; applying the percentages of executions {{that appeared in the}} trials of 1560–1700—about 2%—the approximate total would be about 3,000 put to death. Nevertheless, {{it is likely that the}} toll was higher, keeping in mind the data provided by Dedieu and García <b>Cárcel</b> for the tribunals of Toledo and Valencia, respectively. It is likely that between 3,000 and 5,000 were executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the punishments varied considerably over time. It is believed that sentences of death were enforced in the first stages within {{the long history of}} the Inquisition. According to García <b>Cárcel,</b> the court of Valencia employed the death penalty in 40% of the processings before 1530, but later that percentage dropped to 3%.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} prisoners {{were kept in}} various jails around the country. When an international human rights commission came to Argentina in 1979 to assess {{the conditions of the}} prisoners, the Videla regime decided to move a group of high profile prisoners to Caseros, inaugurating the new <b>cárcel</b> de Caseros with great pomp, as a way of showing the international community the respect and care they were giving to their {{political prisoners}}.|$|E
25|$|Historian Vicente <b>Carcel</b> Orti {{asserts that}} anticlerical Freemasons played {{a large part}} in the anti-Catholic acts of the {{government}} since they held key government positions, including at least 183 deputies in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament) {{and so they were}} instrumental in the making of anti-Catholic laws. As early as March 1933, Abilia Arroyo de Roman had declared at a rally in the Salamancan pueblo of Macotera that Spain was governed by Masonic lodges, intent on 'decatholicizing' Spain, and the Gaceta Regional blamed the Law of Congregations on 'an occult power' that had taken refuge in Spain 'to carry out its experiments'.|$|E
25|$|The {{archives}} of the Suprema only provide information surrounding the processes prior to 1560. To study the processes themselves, {{it is necessary to}} examine the {{archives of}} the local tribunals; however, the majority have been lost to the devastation of war, the ravages of time or other events. Jean-Pierre Dedieu has studied those of Toledo, where 12,000 were judged for offences related to heresy. Ricardo García <b>Cárcel</b> has analyzed those of the tribunal of Valencia. These authors' investigations find that the Inquisition was most active in the period between 1480 and 1530, and that during this period the percentage condemned to death was much more significant than in the years studied by Henningsen and Contreras. Henry Kamen gives the number of about 2,000 executions in persona in the whole of Spain up to 1530.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} {{began with}} an assault of strategic installations, such as the civilian Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a PDF garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. U.S. Navy SEALs destroyed Noriega's private jet and a Panamanian gunboat. A Panamanian ambush killed four SEALs and wounded nine. Other military command centers throughout the country were also attacked. The attack on the central headquarters of the PDF (referred to as La Comandancia) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. During the firefight at the Comandancia, the PDF downed two special operations helicopters and forced one MH-6 Little Bird to crash-land in the Panama Canal. The opening round of attacks in Panama City also included a special operations raid on the <b>Carcel</b> Modelo prison (known as Operation Acid Gambit) to free Kurt Muse, a US citizen convicted of espionage by Noriega.|$|E
500|$|He and {{his brother}} Juan also opened the Sala de Armas, a fencing club, in Manila. When he learned of the {{underground}} societies that were planning a revolution and was asked to join, he scoffed at the idea and turned down the offer. Like other Filipino émigrés involved in the Reform Movement, he {{was in favor of}} reform rather than revolution as the way towards independence. Besides affecting their property, the proponents of the Reform Movement saw that no revolution would succeed without the necessary preparations. Nevertheless, after the existence of the Katipunan was leaked in August 1896, the Luna brothers were arrested and jailed in Fort Santiago for [...] "participating" [...] in the revolution. His statement concerning the revolution was one of the many statements used to abet the laying down of death sentence for José Rizal. Months later, José and Juan were freed but Antonio was exiled to Spain in 1897, where he was imprisoned at the <b>Cárcel</b> Modelo de Madrid.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, McDonald's sued Cebu-based {{fast food}} {{restaurant}} MacJoy {{for using a}} very similar trade name. In its defense, MacJoy insisted {{that it was the}} first user of the mark under the title [...] "MACJOY & DEVICE" [...] for its business in Cebu City which started in 1987, five years before McDonald's opened its first outlet in the same city. MacJoy stated that the requirement of “actual use” in commerce in the Philippines before one may register a trademark pertains to the territorial jurisdiction on a national scale and is not merely confined to a certain locality or region. It added that [...] "MacJoy" [...] is a term of endearment for the owner's niece whose name is Scarlett Yu <b>Carcel.</b> In response, McDonald's claimed that there was no connection with the name Scarlett Yu <b>Carcel</b> to merit the coinage of the word [...] "MacJoy" [...] and that the only logical conclusion over the name is to help the Cebu restaurant ride high on their (McDonald's) established reputation.|$|E

[...] Anne Maudslay told her adventure in the book A glimpse at Guatemala, from the Victorian Era perspective: [...] "After riding {{a mile or two}} along a road bordered by cottages bosomed in fruit trees we rose to a bleak tableland. [...] It was {{one of the very few}} days of unpleasant weather which we experience during the whole of our journey; a fierce wind raised clouds of dust and rustled through the ugly dry rastrojos, or stubbles of Indian corn, which covered the plain. We passed through the little Indian town of Zaragoza, chiefly noted for the manufacture of aparejos, the native pack-saddles. [...] I have been told that the Indians here have such a liking for dried alligator meat as a Lenten fare that the vendors of the highly-perfumed delicacy have to be locked up in the <b>carcel</b> (English: Jail for protection and sell the meat through the prison bars. [...] The streets were full of gaily-dressed people assembled for a fiesta, and dancing was going on in a shed, to a monotonous sound of a marimba. [...] We were not tempted to loiter for long, and rode on again over the dull plan to uninteresting town of Chimaltenango." ...|$|E

60|$|She silenced Walthew's {{objections}} {{and they}} set off, striking into a broad track some distance farther on. For a time, it wound, deep with dust that clung about their feet heavy with the dew, across a belt of cultivated land where indistinct, orderly rows of coffee bushes ran back from its edge. Then it plunged into thick forest, where the soil {{was soft and}} the darkness impenetrable, and they stumbled along blindly, trying to feel their way. For all that, Grahame was conscious of keen satisfaction as he breathed the warm, night air. Heavy as it was, it seemed strangely invigorating after the foul atmosphere of the <b>carcel</b> {{where he had been}} imprisoned, and it was something to walk at large again. Walthew, however, felt anxious and limp. He had been highly strung for several hours, and he held himself responsible {{for the safety of the}} girl he loved. Listening for sounds of pursuit, he tried to pierce the darkness in front, and started when a leaf rustled or some animal moved stealthily through the forest. He thought his footsteps rang down the branch-arched track alarmingly loud.|$|E

50|$|The lamp {{was invented}} by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume <b>Carcel</b> (1750-1818) to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. <b>Carcel</b> designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, {{in the body of}} the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, <b>Carcel</b> housed a clockwork mechanism in the lamp base that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the lamp base.|$|E
