5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by the agreement. The U.S., without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> coalition, had changed its mind about {{striking}} Syria.

5|$|Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen. She found {{particularly}} offensive the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, {{who often}} acted without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen. Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained {{in office and}} continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in France without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister. The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration {{had been replaced by}} a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby.|$|E

5|$|Gladstone {{returned}} to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchère to the Cabinet, so Gladstone {{agreed not to}} appoint him. In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister {{for the remainder of}} Victoria's reign.|$|E

Messages were repeatedly sent {{back and forth between}} the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.|$|E

The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class.

5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E

5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. Without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E
5|$|He {{then made}} way to Egypt, {{arriving}} to a tumultuous reception in January AD 19. He had gone there to relieve a famine {{in the country}} vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, because it had violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor). He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders to the cities and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably beyond his authority.|$|E

5|$|In 1127 Theobald {{was made}} prior of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, {{following}} Boso's death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected {{him to be}} their new abbot without first <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Rouen, Hugh de Boves, who consequently threatened to void the result. Audoen, the Bishop of Evreux, and brother of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. Another problem then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E

5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|Thus the consulship of Drusus was successful, {{but at the}} end of {{the year}} he fell ill. His illness {{prompted}} the equestrian, Clutorius Priscus, to write his elegy, who had thought his life in jeopardy. Priscus previously wrote an elegy for Germanicus for which he was paid. He thought that he would be rewarded again, and so recited his elegy before an audience in preparation for Drusus' death. An unamused informer brought the matter before the Senate, and it was voted that he be executed. Hid execution was decreed and carried out without first <b>consulting</b> <b>the</b> emperor. This induced Tiberius to introduce a law where the Senate must wait 10 days after such condemnations before making such decrees public as to allow him to learn of their decisions first.|$|E
