25|$|Although the {{original}} layout {{did have a}} short section of catenary, {{most of it was}} destroyed when the layout was torn down. However, the new layout is being constructed with a full PRR-Style compound <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> over the entire layout. This <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> is being integrated into the power distribution, so that the electric locomotives and MU cars will receive power via their operating pantographs.|$|E
25|$|OSE {{owns and}} TRAINOSE {{operates}} twenty electric Desiro EMU-5 (OSE class 460) equipped for the 25-kV overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>system.</b> They {{operate on the}} Kiato–Athens International Airport suburban line and as a stopping service on the mainline between Thessaloniki and Larissa, which is also advertised as a suburban service. OSE is in litigation with the Joint Venture of Siemens & Hellenic Shipyards for the supply of those 20 Desiro.|$|E
25|$|Edison {{was active}} in {{business}} {{right up to the}} end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.|$|E
50|$|Simple wire {{installations}} {{are common}} in light rail, especially on city streets, while more expensive <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> are suited to high-speed operations.|$|R

50|$|In 2001, Pfisterer gave up its {{offices in}} Stuttgart-Untertürkheim and {{relocated}} the company’s headquarters to Winterbach. In 2004, the Pfisterer Group pooled its {{areas of activity}} in four international centers of expertise: cable systems (Winterbach, Germany), components (Gussenstadt, Germany), overhead systems (Malters, Switzerland), and railway <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> (Barcelona, Spain).|$|R
25|$|Because {{only one}} major line (the Gippsland line) had been electrified, the {{economic}} advantages of electric traction were not fully realised {{due to the}} need to change locomotives for trains that extended beyond the range of the electrified network, which added to the overall cost per mile. Furthermore, the additional expense associated with maintaining the 1,500 V DC overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> saw V/Line move to withdraw the L class from service and dewire the Gippsland line beyond Pakenham. The L class fleet were withdrawn from service by 1987.|$|E
25|$|Acela {{service was}} {{originally}} {{expected to begin}} in late 1999 but was delayed. The <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> could not support the intended speeds between Washington DC and New York City, but the newer system between New York City and Boston allows the higher speeds. Attention {{was drawn to the}} decreased 4.2° tilt, but this was not the root of the speed problem, as the tracks from New York to Boston are similar to those between New York and Washington, and the tilt mechanism is not the factor enabling higher speeds. Following repairs, the first Acela service began on December 11, 2000, a year behind schedule.|$|E
25|$|The VGN {{had a very}} major {{grade at}} Clark's Gap, West Virginia, and tried large steam {{locomotives}} before turning to an alternative already in use by one of its neighboring competitors, Norfolk & Western Railway: a railway electrification system. With work authorized beginning in 1922, a 134-mile portion of the railroad in the mountains from Mullens, West Virginia over Clark's Gap and several other major grades to Roanoke, Virginia was equipped with overhead wires supported by a <b>catenary</b> <b>system.</b> The VGN built its own power plant at Narrows, Virginia. The electrification was completed in 1925 {{at a cost of}} $15 million, equal to $ today. A link was established with Norfolk & Western to share electricity from its nearby electrification during contingencies. ALCO and Westinghouse supplied the electric locomotives, which were equipped with pantographs. The 36 initial units were normally linked in groups of three as one set, and had much greater load capacity than the steam power they replaced. In 1948, four huge EL-2B twin-unit locomotives were purchased, followed by twelve EL-C rectifier locomotives in 1955.|$|E
25|$|The class uses five {{different}} standards of overhead: domestic catenary {{in each of}} Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; fixed-height catenary on LGV lines; and taller catenary in the Channel Tunnel, designed to accommodate double-deck car-carrying trains and roll-on roll-off heavy goods vehicle trains. The driver must lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between <b>catenary</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{service was}} {{operated}} using New Jersey Transit (NJT) equipment under an operating agreement among NJT, Metro-North, and Amtrak. NJT equipment is required as its electric locomotive power {{is capable of}} running under the various <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> over three separate railroads using different power supplies. The program was only being offered for the early afternoon games so that the NJT equipment can be moved back {{in place for the}} Monday morning rush hour.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, 25Hz, a once-common {{industrial}} power frequency, {{is used on}} Amtrak's 25Hz {{traction power}} system at 12kV on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City and on the Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. SEPTA's 25Hz traction power system uses the same 12kV voltage on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical catenary voltage, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak power distribution system has a 138kV transmission network that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12kV to feed the <b>catenary</b> <b>system.</b> The SEPTA power distribution system uses a 2:1 ratio autotransformer system, with the catenary fed at 12kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24kV. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad used an 11kV system between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, which was converted to 12.5kV 60Hz in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Train {{stops on}} open {{stretches}} without platform can outnumber train stops in railway stations by a 2:1 margin, but these stopovers on open stretches {{are usually not}} included, when railway stations are counted. There are 25 dedicated railway stations along the railway with 23 having a single platform for passengers to enter or to leave trains. These platforms allow access without having the need to use stairs. Only the Furi-Labu railway station (and the Awash railway station after completed expansion in 2018) have two platforms connected through a footbridge above the overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>system.</b> This footbridge also has elevators at both ends for mobility-reduced passengers. The platforms are roofed to protect passengers against sun, wind and rain. Railway stations for passenger trains always have a station building directly attached {{to the back of}} the principal platform. Consequently, all railway stations with a single platform have space for only one platform line and do not allow the presence of more than one train at the platform at the same time. In contrast, the Furi-Labu and Awash railway stations with their two platforms have the space for two (Furi-Labu) or three (Awash) platform lines. All platforms are around 330 meters long. The Awash railway station plays a special role as it sits at the junction of two railway lines.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 October 2015, about 41,000 commuters were {{affected}} during morning peak hour when a power fault crippled the whole line from Punggol to Harbourfront stations. This {{is the first}} time that both the north- and south-bound service are affected which resulted in the mobilization of about 100 free shuttle buses across the NEL. The Alstom Metropolis C751C train was returning to the Sengkang Depot when the driver saw sparks from above the train and stopped the train [...] at a stretch where the mainline and depot <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> wires overlap. This resulted in arching between the wires of the mainline and the depot. This caused the <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> wires to melt and eventually snap. As a precautionary measure, SBS Transit has marked non-stopping areas at all overlapping zones and reduced electrical voltage difference between the <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> wires at the overlap point, in case trains stop at this stretch.|$|E
50|$|The {{designers}} considered several voltages for {{the transmission}} {{segment of the}} system including 3-6 kV, 11 kV, and 22 kV. Ultimately, the transmission and <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> were combined into a transformerless system, that utilized the same voltage from output of generator to catenary to locomotive pantograph. As 11 kV was the highest voltage that could be obtained directly from {{the output of the}} generators of 1907, 11 kV was selected as the transmission and catenary voltage of the system.|$|R
25|$|Currently, the {{corridor}} uses three <b>catenary</b> <b>systems.</b> From Washington, D.C., to Sunnyside Yard (just east of New York Penn Station), Amtrak's 25Hz traction power system (originally {{built by the}} Pennsylvania Railroad) supplies 12 kV at 25Hz. From Sunnyside to Mill River (just east of New Haven), the former New Haven Railroad's system, since modified by Metro-North, supplies 12.5 kV at 60Hz. From Mill River to Boston, the much newer 60Hz traction power system supplies 25 kV at 60Hz. All of Amtrak's electric locomotives can switch between these systems at speed.|$|R
50|$|Unlike simple {{overhead}} wires, {{in which}} the uninsulated wire is attached by clamps to closely spaced crosswires supported by poles, <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> use at least two wires. The catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures, and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire, attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as droppers. The second wire is straight and level, parallel to the rail track, suspended over it as the roadway of a suspension bridge is over water.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remaining}} [...] are on {{the surface}} on Main Street in downtown Buffalo. On the surface section, trains interact with automobile traffic from the theater district where it emerges from the tunnel until Mohawk Street where it reverts to a transit mall and at cross streets, where movements are governed by traffic signals. Catenary poles are spaced every [...] to support the overhead electrical lines. Metro Rail operates electric multiple-unit light rail vehicles (LRVs) in two-to-four car trains with power drawn from an overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>system.</b> Three-car trains are limited to rush hour and special events and four-car trains to special events. The Buffalo trains and SEPTA's light rail cars in Philadelphia are the only modern non-articulated LRVs operating in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The slowest {{section of}} the {{electrified}} NEC is the portion owned by Metro-North Railroad and the Connecticut Department of Transportation between New Haven, Connecticut and New Rochelle, New York and is heavily used by commuter trains. Amtrak's trains here achieve [...] only on a limited [...] stretch in New York State and rarely exceed [...] at any time eastbound through Connecticut until reaching New Haven. In 1992, ConnDOT began plans to upgrade the <b>catenary</b> <b>system,</b> replace outdated bridges, and straighten certain sections of the New Haven Line to enable the Acela to run slightly faster. [...] the catenary replacement and bridge work were under way and {{expected to be completed}} in 2015. Curve straightening was deemed too expensive, and there are no current plans to increase speeds on the New Haven Line.|$|E
2500|$|Tilting enables {{passengers}} to ride more comfortably on curved sections of track faster than {{would otherwise be}} possible, by leaning into the bend. Acela trainsets tilt above [...] {{on most of the}} system, but some segments of track in the Northeast Corridor are too close together for the cars to safely tilt while maintaining FRA minimum space between trains on parallel tracks. [...] Metro-North Railroad restricts tilting on the segment of track north of New York which it owns. The system was originally designed for a 6.8° tilt, but the cars were redesigned [...] wider to accommodate wider seats and aisles that reduced allowable tilt to 4.2° to fit within the clearance constraints of the existing tracks. Traveling at higher than [...] also requires constant-tension catenary, which is only implemented on the more modern <b>catenary</b> <b>system</b> north of New York City. South of New York City the trains are restricted to [...] By comparison, Northeast Regional and the now-defunct Metroliner service reached [...]|$|E
50|$|The upgrade of {{the line}} to permit the {{operation}} of tilting trains and a line speed of 140 km/h began on 28 February 2011. This required a complete blockade {{of the line}} between Glauchau-Schönbörnchen and Gößnitz. During the construction work, all rail services were substituted by buses. In addition to the renewal of tracks and the track base, the <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> and the signalling and communications technology were completely renewed. Meerane station was transformed fundamentally. Overall, Deutsche Bahn spent €20 million on the upgrade of the 13 kilometre-long connection. Rail services resumed on 11 December 2011.|$|R

50|$|Along with {{extensive}} upgrades to retail areas, the Pitt Street Mall's pedestrian area saw a A$10 million refurbishment during 2010-11. This included {{the provision of}} new seating {{as well as new}} pavers and a <b>catenary</b> lighting <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electric {{operation}} started {{early on}} part of the Anhalt line. The Bitterfeld-Dessau section of the Trebnitz-Leipzig railway was electrified as a test track in 1911. Electrification on the Bitterfeld-Leipzig section was put into operation on 5 June 1914. However, the electrical equipment was disconnected on 1 August 1914 year. In 1922, it was reinstated, but a planned extension to Berlin was abandoned because of {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. In March 1946, the <b>catenary</b> <b>systems</b> had to be dismantled for war reparations to the Soviet Union. Electrical operations on the Leipzig-Dessau line were restored on 9 July 1958. Electrification of the Anhalt line commenced in 1976 and the whole line was open for electrical operation by 1984.|$|R
40|$|Applying buoys to the <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>system</b> in {{deep water}} may reduce part of the weight and radius of mooring. In order to {{investigate}} the effect that buoys system has on the dynamics of mooring systems and the motion responses of platform, the global responses of a semi-submersible platform are numerically simulated in the time domain. Firstly, the governing equations of mooring line and the hydrodynamic model of semi-submersible platform are built. Secondly, different size and location of buoys are designed to attach on the mooring line. Finally, the three hours simulations under 100 -year return period of South China Sea are executed. The results may give another approach {{in the design of}} <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|Analyzed are {{the merits}} and demerits of <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>system</b> and taut mooring system, which are {{commonly}} used nowadays. As falling somewhere between these two systems, a new mooring <b>system</b> integrating <b>catenary</b> with taut mooring is proposed. In order to expound and prove the advantages of this new system, the motion performance of a semi-submersible platform is simulated by employing full time domain coupled analysis method. A comparison of the result of new mooring system with that of taut mooring system shows that {{the movement of the}} platform using the new type mooring system is smaller than that using the taut mooring system, which ensures a better working condition. Furthermore, the new mooring system is also compatible with the characteristics of <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>system,</b> which eliminates the requirement of anti-uplift capacity of the anchors...|$|R
