5|$|The Silver Age of <b>Comic</b> <b>Books</b> was {{a period}} of artistic {{advancement}} and commercial success in mainstream American <b>comic</b> <b>books,</b> predominantly those in the superhero genre. Following the Golden Age of <b>Comic</b> <b>Books</b> and an interregnum in the early to mid-1950s, the Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to circa 1970, and was succeeded by the Bronze and Modern Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} and circulation of <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> about superheroes declined following World War II, and <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> about horror, crime and romance took larger {{shares of the}} market. However, controversy arose over alleged links between <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> and juvenile delinquency, focusing in particular on crime and horror titles. In 1954, publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content.|$|E

He is also an enemy of Spider-Man sometimes just as himself and not just only as his Goblin persona.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially <b>comic</b> <b>books)</b> {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading <b>comic</b> <b>books,</b> and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age of <b>Comic</b> <b>Books,</b> due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of <b>Comic</b> <b>Books</b> under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character {{has been the subject}} of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in <b>comic</b> <b>books,</b> to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{comic book}} {{readers of the}} Silver Age were more scientifically-inclined than {{previous}} generations.

5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off <b>comic</b> <b>books</b> and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E
