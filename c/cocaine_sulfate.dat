50|$|Coca paste (paco, basuco, oxi) is a crude extract of the {{coca leaf}} which {{contains}} 40% to 91% <b>cocaine</b> <b>sulfate</b> along with companion coca alkaloids and varying quantities of benzoic acid, methanol, and kerosene. In South America, coca paste, {{also known as}} cocaine base and, therefore, often confused with cocaine freebase in North America, is relatively inexpensive and is widely used by low-income populations. The coca paste is smoked in tobacco or cannabis cigarettes and use has become widespread in several Latin American countries. Traditionally, coca paste has been relatively abundant in South American countries such as Colombia where it is processed into cocaine hydrochloride ("street cocaine") for distribution {{to the rest of}} the world. The caustic reactions associated with the local application of coca paste prevents its use by oral, intranasal, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Coca paste can only be smoked when combined with a very inflammable material such as tobacco or cannabis.|$|E
