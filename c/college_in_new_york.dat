5|$|George {{donated the}} royal library to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He had no {{interest}} in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, which later became Columbia University.

5|$|In 1763, Dr. Johnson was {{succeeded in}} the {{presidency}} by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate {{of the class of}} 1777, Alexander Hamilton. The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 {{with the arrival of the}} Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces. Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> which was seized by the rebels and renamed Columbia College. The Loyalists, led by Bishop Charles Inglis fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded King's Collegiate School.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens <b>College</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
