Grounding on her woman knowledge, a woman, Diotima, in Plato's Symposium, told us what is Philosophy : love for knowledge -and what is love (Eros) : birth in beauty. Strangely we recognize an echo of that assertion in Kant's text : What is orientating oneself into Thought ? Here Kant sets a « subjective principle <b>of</b> <b>différenciation</b> », which opens the field for {{an understanding of the}} philosophical knowledge which would take the « difference » into consideration - and among many others, the sexual difference.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of both an acceleration {{in the development and}} technological progress of exchanges and a starting integration process of European capital markets, international performance comparisons involving European marketplaces have, lately, been in the spotlight of financial markets. Basing on previous academic research on the subject, this investigation aims in the first place at putting into perspective the terms of a debate that, in some cases, appears to have led to obvious misinterpretations. Thus, it starts with a qualification of the terms of the comparisons and an identification of the factors determining implicit liquidity costs on equity markets. Accordingly, an important factor <b>of</b> <b>differenciation</b> <b>of</b> trading costs appears to relate to the type of organisation adopted by the market. More specifically, these differences in nature may be evidenced both by splitting implicit trading costs into their main components and by a careful examination of how those costs impact on the price-time trade off for the various categories of agents involved in equity trading. In a second stage, and using a selection of relevant indicators and intra-day data, a measure of implicit trading costs i...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} divided into two parts: {{one-dimensional}} markets and two-dimensional markets. Also, we develop both one and two-dimensional models. Within each, we distinguish (a) bounded, (b) unbounded but finite, and (c) unbounded, infinite spaces. Among other things, we show: in one dimension, the nature of the space is not, as many investigators have thought, critical; in two dimensions, however, the very existence of equilibrium is seen to depend upon the nature of the space; the commonly-used rectangular customer density function yields results that do not generalize to any other density function; the existence of multiple equilibria in both one and two dimensions is a pervasive phenomenon in any of the spaces studied, and MD occurs only when the number of firms is restricted to two. Although the analysis and discussion are in terms of location theory and are concerned with the relationship between equilibrium configuration of firms and the transport-cost minimizing configuration, many of the results generalize to other forms <b>of</b> <b>differenciation.</b> The conditions under which the results generalize are considered in the concluding section of the paper. ...|$|R
