2500|$|Though {{soldiers}} were citizens, Cicero typifies the former as [...] "sagum wearing" [...] {{and the latter}} as [...] "togati". He employs the phrase <b>cedant</b> arma togae ("let arms yield to the toga"), meaning [...] "may peace replace war", or [...] "may military power yield to civilian power", {{in the context of}} his own uneasy alliance with Pompey. He intended it as metonym, linking his own [...] "power to command" [...] as consul (imperator togatus) with Pompey's as general (imperator armatus); but it was interpreted as a request to step down. Cicero, having lost Pompey's ever-wavering support, was driven to exile. In reality, arms rarely yielded to civilian power. During the early Roman Imperial era, members of the Praetorian Guard (the emperor's personal guard as [...] "First Citizen", and a military force under his personal command), concealed their weapons under white, civilian-style togas when on duty in the city, offering the reassuring illusion that they represented a traditional Republican, civilian authority, rather than the military arm of an Imperial autocracy.|$|E

50|$|In per risk, the <b>cedant's</b> {{insurance}} policy limits {{are greater than}} the reinsurance retention. For example, an insurance company might insure commercial property risks with policy limits up to $10 million, and then buy per risk reinsurance of $5 million in excess of $5 million.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{strengths and}} weaknesses of reinsurance and securitization in managing insurable risks. Traditional reinsurance operates efficiently in managing relatively small, uncorrelated risks and in facilitating efficient information sharing between <b>cedants</b> and reinsurers. However, when the magnitude of potential losses and the correlation of risks increase, the efficiency of the reinsurance model breaks down, and the cost of capital may become uneconomical. At this juncture, securitization has a role to play by passing the risks along to broader capital markets. Securitization also serves as a complement for reinsurance in other ways such as facilitating regulatory arbitrage and collateralizing low-frequency risks.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} catastrophic risk, traditional {{measures for}} evaluating risk, {{such as the}} probable maximum loss (PML), value at risk (VaR), Tail VAR (TVaR), and others, can become practically impossible to obtain analytically in certain types of insurance, such as earthquake. Given the available information {{it can be very}} difficult for an insurer to measure this risk. The transfer of risk in this type of insurance is usually done through reinsurance schemes that can be of diverse types that can greatly reduce the extreme tail of the <b>cedant’s</b> loss distribution. This effect can be assessed mathematically. The PML is defined in terms of a very extreme quantile. Also, under standard operating conditions, insurers use several “layers ” of non proportional reinsurance that will be combined with some type of proportional reinsurance. The resulting reinsurance structures will then be very complicated to analyze and to evaluate their mitigation or transfer effects analytically {{it may be necessary to}} use alternative approaches, such as Monte Carlo simulation methods. This is what we do in this paper in order to measure the effect of a complex reinsurance treaty on the risk profile of an insurance company. We compute the pure risk premium...|$|R
40|$|A general {{formulation}} of risk load for total cash flows is presented. It allows completely additive co-measures 1 {{at any level}} of detail for any dependency structure between random variables constituting the total. It is founded on the intuition that some total outcomes are more risky per dollar than others, and the measure of that is a “riskiness leverage ratio. ” This riskiness leverage function is an essentially arbitrary choice, enabling an infinite variety of management attitudes toward risk to be expressed. The complete additivity makes these models useful. What makes them interesting is that attention can be turned toward asking “what is a plausible risk measure for the whole, while being prepared to use the indicated allocation technique for the pieces? ” The usual measures are special cases of this form, as shown in some examples. While the author does not particularly advocate allocating capital to do pricing, this class of models does allow pricing at the individual policy clause level, if so desired. Further, the desirability of reinsurance or other hedges can be quantitatively evaluated from the <b>cedant’s</b> point of view by comparing {{the increase in the}} mean cost with the decrease in capital cost from reduction of capital required...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} situational analysis of business transfer ecosystem in France {{as it stands}} in early 2015. In France there are no dedicated public datasets about ownership transfers. Ownership transfers can be deduced from different sources (e. g. Insee, Infogreffe, Diane, etc.), which result slightly different numbers about realized business transfers. Depending on the source, there are around 50 000 potential firms to be transferred each year in France (including all sizes, types, and industries). The French statistic organism (INSEE) does not count the creation of holding {{to the purpose of}} buying a target as transfers but as creations from scratch. Some of the key actors of the SME ownership transfer market carry out surveys about the ecosystem. For example, CNCFA and Epsilon Research survey the ownership transfer market each year since 2010. DG Tresor (governmental organization), Groupe BPCE (private bank), CRA (National association for SME transfers), and BPI France (a public investment bank) also publish reports and studies about ownerships transfers in France. The material for this report comes from these above secondary sources and interviews with some of the key actors in the SME ownership transfer market. The interviewed actors were AFIC (Association Français des Investisseurs pour la Croissance), CCI (Chamber of Commerce and Industry), CNCFA (Syndicat des Professionnels des Fusions et Acquisitions), CRA (<b>Cédants</b> et Repreneurs d’Affaires), CGPME (Confédération généraledes petites et moyennes entreprises), and Reseau Entreprendre Isère. The interviews were carried out by the authors of this report. Each interview produced a mini-case about an actor in the SME markets. The mini-cases can be found from the appendixes of this report. To put the business transfers in its proper context, there were around 3. 14 million firms (non-agricultural) in France in 2011, of which 243 were big, 5 000 mid-size, 138 000 SMEs, and 3 million micro-firms. On average there are 500 - 550 000 new entries (of which around 5 % employ more than one person) and 50 - 60 000 exists each year in France...|$|R
50|$|In {{catastrophe}} {{excess of}} loss, the cedant's retention {{is usually a}} multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. {{they are designed to}} protect the <b>cedant</b> against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|E

The shield is supported by two rearing silver horses (the white horse is the traditional symbol of the region, which was part of Iași County before 1812).

50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek surplus {{reinsurance}} {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the <b>cedant</b> would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|E

40|$|We compare {{two types}} of {{reinsurance}}: excess of loss (EOL) and largest claim reinsurance (LCR), each of which transfers the payment of part, or all, {{of one or more}} large claims from the primary insurance company (the <b>cedant)</b> to a reinsurer. The primary insurer’s point of view is documented in terms of assessment of risk and payment of reinsurance premium. A utility indifference rationale based on the expected future dividend stream is used to value the company with and without reinsurance. Assuming the classical compound Poisson risk model with choices of claim size distributions (classified as heavy, medium and light-tailed cases), simulations are used to illustrate the impact of the EOL and LCR treaties on the company’s ruin probability, ruin time and value as determined by the dividend discounting model. We find that LCR is at least as effective as EOL in averting ruin in comparable finite time horizon settings. In instances where the ruin probability for LCR is smaller than for EOL, the dividend discount model shows that the <b>cedant</b> is able to pay a larger portion of the dividend for LCR reinsurance than for EOL while still maintaining company value. Both methods reduce risk considerably as compared with no reinsurance, in a variety of situations, as measured by the standard deviation of the company value. A further interesting finding is that heaviness of tails alone is not necessarily the decisive factor in the possible ruin of a company; small and moderate sized claims can also {{play a significant role in}} this...|$|E
40|$|Reinsurance is {{a global}} {{business}} by nature. It operates on the macroeconomic level and spread the risks not only between companies but also between countries and regions. The situation in the reinsurance market changed significantly during the last 20 - 30 years. It has changed from being a relationship based on trust and loyalty, so-called “Gentlemens Agreement” into more precise performance of contract rights and obligations. The reasons for this are changed economic situation {{and the fact that}} cedants previously took most of the risks, while nowadays cedants often keep only 5 - 10 percent of the total insured risk. It became more common to reduce the risk exposure by the use of reinsurance. Under the ordinary insurance contract a person, who is exposed to risk transfers it to an insurer/ <b>cedant</b> who assumes the risk for a fee, insurance premium. Reinsurance objects usually involve significant property values which are often endangered and it is rather unusual that a single insurer is responsible for all risk and typically {{there is a need to}} allocate the risk among several insurers. Therefore, the insurer/cedant who already concluded an insurance contract with assured/ person effecting the insurance insures further a portion of his risk with another insurer/ reinsurer. As a result there are two contracts: original insurance contract and reinsurance contract. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the relationship between the “cedant”/ “reinsured” and the “reinsurer” in reinsurance contracts. Consequently attention will be put on the interrelationship and use of the most often disputed “as original”, “follow the settlements” and “claims cooperation” clauses in reinsurance contracts. Particularly this thesis will focus on analysis of problematic relationship and combination of “follow the settlements” and “claims cooperation” clauses in the reinsurance contracts. This work does not aim to provide an exhaustive analysis of all the legal questions that may arise, but seek to solve selected problems that illustrate main aspects of the topic. The essential characteristic of reinsurance is that there is no contractual relationship between the assured/ person effecting the insurance and the reinsurer. Therefore, the original policyholder will claim against the <b>cedant</b> and can not go directly against the reinsurer. This can cause difficulties for the <b>cedant</b> in a situation where the <b>cedant</b> and reinsurer/reinsurers can not agree on the settlement. The relevance and interest of the topic “The combination and use of “as original”, “follow the settlement” and “claims co-operation” clauses in reinsurance contracts” is also proved by the fact that there is very little Norwegian legal practice covering the reinsurance field. Most disputes are resolved through negotiations or arbitration but arbitration awards are very seldom published. There are only two Norwegian courts decisions that are directly related to reinsurance. In 2006 there has been taken a decision by Borgarting Court of Appeal which directly involved interpretation of claim cooperation clause in reinsurance contract. Except the above mentioned case of Borgarting Court of Appeal there was only decision by the Supreme Court of Norway concerning reinsurance issue in so-called “Vingtor” case. On contrary the English law provides an extensive legal practice and a number of court decisions covering interpretation of the “as original”, “follow the settlement” and “claims cooperation clause” in reinsurance contracts. From the above mentioned it looks very valuable to look at the English law practice in this field. Therefore, this thesis will be mostly based on the English court decisions. However, it should be kept in mind that English interpretation tradition is different from the Norwegian one. Under the English law there is “four corners rule” principle and most emphasis is put on the contract wording. Instead under Norwegian law the negotiations between the parties and surrounding circumstances play very important role. Therefore it is obvious that Norwegian courts will not necessarily always accept the English courts position because the assessment of the issue can be different. However in practice the English court decisions usually have relevance for Norwegian courts especially if there is no other practice. In the last chapter it will be discussed the main problem that arise with the combination and use of “follow the settlements” and “claims cooperation” clauses in the same reinsurance contract. In particular, whether the reinsurer/reinsurers are obliged by the “follow the settlements” clause in the situation where the conditions of the “claims cooperation” clause are breached. So, the relationship between these two clauses is problematic and can cause difficulty. The courts tried to solve this problem during the last decades and it seems that English courts have more clear position on this question. The central cases dealing with this issue are The Insurance Company of Africa vs. Scor (UK) Reinsurance Company Ltd (“ICA v. Scor’) and Eagle Star Insurance Company Limited v J N Cresswell and Others (“Eagle Star v Cresswell”). In the last case the Court of Appeal concluded that the effect of the “follow the settlements” clause was nullified by the “claims cooperation” clause, which was formulated as a “condition precedent” to reinsurer’s liability...|$|E
40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{frequently}} used definition of reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies, by reinsurance the <b>cedant</b> (insurance company) cedes part of the risk to the reinsurer. Reinsurance plays nowadays a crucial role in insurance industry as it does not only reduce the reinsured's exposure, but it can also significantly reduce the required solvency capital. In past few decades various approaches to reinsurance actuarial modelling were published and many actuaries are nowadays just reinsurance specialized. The thesis provides an overview of the actuarial aspects of modelling a non-life per risk and for motor third party liability per event excess of loss reinsurance structure, according to the author's knowledge no study of such wide scope exists and various aspects have to be found in various fragmented articles published worldwide. The thesis is based on recent industry literature describing latest trends and methodologies used, the theory is compared with the praxis as the author has working experience from underwriting at CEE reinsurer and actuarial reinsurance modelling at global reinsurance broker. The sequence of topics which are dealt corresponds to sequence of the steps taken by actuary modelling reinsurance and each step is discussed in detail. Starting with data preparation and besides loss inflation, more individual claims development methods are introduced and own probabilistic model is constructed. Further, burning cost analysis and probabilistic rating focused on heavy tailed distributions are discussed. A special attention is given to exposure rating which is not commonly known discipline among actuaries outside of reinsurance industry and different methodologies for property and casualty exposure modelling are introduced including many best practice suggestions. All main approaches to the reinsurance modelling are also illustrated on either real or realistically looking data, similar to those provided by European insurance companies to their reinsurers during renewal periods...|$|E
40|$|As Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, {{federalism}} can {{impede the}} government 2 ̆ 7 s {{ability to plan}} for and respond to emergencies. Many emergencies transcend federalist divisions of power and responsibility, rendering unclear which level of government should respond. In addition, while emergencies may require a coordinated response by heal, state, and national government, getting different levels of government {{to work together in}} times of crises is difficult. Further, even when states and localities call for outside assistance, they tend to resist undue federal interference in their affairs;a national government that lacks experience working with local actors on the ground can find it difficult to implement relief programs. Given the widely recognized failures of the government 2 ̆ 7 s response to Katrina and the urgent need for reform, some federal officials have proposed that, in a future emergency, rather than try to work with state and local response personnel, the federal government should simply deploy the military to take over the relief effort. This Article presents an alternative solution: emergency commandeering. This solution would allow the federal government, when it responds to certain kinds of emergencies, to call into periods of mandatory federal service the emergency response personnel of the state in which the emergency occurs, and, if necessary, emergency response personnel from other states. These state employees—police, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, urban search and rescue teams, and public health specialists—would serve with compensation under the command of the President. Emergency commandeering allows the national government to mount an effective response, one that draws upon the skills and experiences of state and local personnel, without the hindrance of multiple command structures or other forms of state and local resistance. Emergency commandeering is authorized by the Constitution, consistent with federalism, and, compared to the alternative of sending the military into our streets, good for democracy. <b>Cedant</b> arma togae. —Cicero(FN 1) Reprinted by permission of the publisher...|$|E
