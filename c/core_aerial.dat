40|$|Using {{numerical}} modeling, {{this work}} estimates sediment dispersion patterns {{caused by the}} incidence of waves in five distinct coastline contours of the Jequitinhonha River delta plain during the Late Holocene. For this study, a wave cliate odel based {{on the construction of}} ave refraction diagras relative to the current boundary conditions as defined and assumed to be valid for the five coastlines. Numerical modeling from the refraction diagrams was carried out considering the angle of incidence and wave height along the coastline. This work has allowed us to reproduce past and current patterns of net longshore sediment drift defined by a conceptual model developed from the integration of sediment <b>cores,</b> <b>aerial</b> photograph interpretation, C 14 datings and geomorphic indicators of longshore drift. These results show that, on average, current wave conditions in the east-northeastern Brazilian region seem to have remained characteristically the same from approximately 5100 years BP until the present time. This type of information can be important when attempting to simulate possible future situations in terms of the long-term general behavior of the east-northeastern Brazilian coastal region...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{new data}} sets unavailable {{in previous studies}} of the central Platte River to better characterize and quantify the processes involved in the creation and evolution of a braided stream system. In the first study, sediment cores, wireline logs, borehole cuttings, and optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) data were used to characterize the dimensions and chronology of {{a new model of}} the Platte River entrenched valley fill. Periods of entrenchment and aggradation within the different valley elements were associated with regional climate changes. In the second study, data compiled from aerial photography, general Land Office maps (GLOs), and discharge data of the Platte River braided channel were used to provide new insight toward the understanding and quantification of channel evolution and partial abandonment of the central Platte River. Analysis of aerial photographs and GLOs in ArcMap™ show that channel areas and widths decreased from 1858 to 2006. Stabilization through vegetation of bars and channel banks is cited as the major contributing factor to the development of anabranching system within the boundaries of the 1858 channel. The Wood River, a tributary to the Platte River, has also experienced channel evolution {{in the form of an}} increase in sinuosity, after occupying an abandoned channel of the Platte River at the beginning of the 20 th century. Platte River channel evolution is explained using a channel abandonment model that accounts for the gradual abandonment of the Platte River and its evolution from a braided to an anabranching system. ^ In the third study, wireline logs, sediment <b>cores,</b> <b>aerial</b> photography, and ground penetrating radar (GPR) data from the central and lower Platte River channel were used to reformulate the vertical sequence alluvial facies and bar initiation models of the Platte River. GPR profiles of the active central and lower Platte Rivers exhibit a general lack of large downstream-directed planar cross-beds, indicative of downstream-accreting macroform bars that dominate previous alluvial facies and bar inception models. Therefore, three new vertical facies models are introduced to account for stratigraphic features prevalent in the central and lower Platte not accounted for in previous models. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical modeling {{estimation of the}} sediment dispersion patterns caused by waves inciding through four distinct coastline contours of the delta plain of the Doce River during the Late Holocene. For this, a wave climate model based {{on the construction of}} wave refraction diagrams, as a function of current boundary conditions, was defined and was assumed to be valid for the four coastlines. The numerical modeling was carried out on basis of the refraction diagrams, taking into account the angle of approximation and the wave height along the coastline. The results are shown to be comparable with existing data regarding the directions of net longshore drift of sediments estimated from the integration of sediment <b>cores,</b> interpretation of <b>aerial</b> photographs and C 14 datings. This fact apparently suggests that, on average, current boundary conditions appear to have remained with the same general characteristics since 5600 cal yr BP to the present. The used approach may prove useful to evaluate the sediment dispersion patterns during the Late Holocene in the Brazilian east-northeast coastal region...|$|R
40|$|The {{credit card}} {{industry}} is huge with over {{two and a}} half billion cards shipped annually. A local card manufacturer, with a production volume in excess of forty million cards annually, approached the University of Canterbury to design and develop advanced card manufacturing technology. The motivation behind this development was the desire of the sponsoring company to keep abreast of new technologies and {{to have the ability to}} manufacture and supply cards with this new and emerging technology into a highly competitive world market. This thesis reports the research surrounding the development of a dedicated new machine tool explicitly designed to implement the emerging technologies found in the international credit card industry. The machine tool, a dedicated milling machine, was not developed in its entirety within these pages; however, three major constituents of the machine were researched and developed to a point where they could be implemented or become the subject of further research. The three areas of interest were; • A machine table system that avoided the increased zonal wear to which linear bearings are subject, typically due to short high frequency traversals, and also the high friction and mass generally found in dovetail slides. • Design requirements demanded the use of a single commercially available carbide cutter to produce 1500 components per hour. Therefore, a purpose built high (revs per minute) rpm spindle and drive system specifically for use with polymeric materials, (R-PVC in particular) was deemed necessary. • Tracking the cutter depth in relation to an RFID aerial track embedded within the credit card <b>core.</b> The <b>aerial</b> tracking was to be dynamic and occur during the machining process with the machine “remembering” the depth of cut at contact with the aerial. Each of the three areas was researched via an in-depth literature review to determine what and if any material had been published in these fields. For the development of the machine table a novel flexure hinge idea was considered. Considerable material was discovered about flexures, but very little was found to be relevant to the application of high displacement metal flexures necessary to meet the required levels of table movement. In effect the proposed machine table system and research in this field would be novel. The high performance spindle investigation became directed into a much narrower focus as it progressed; that of determining the power consumption required to machine the integrated circuit pockets in an R-PVC work piece. This was due to the lack of information pertaining to the physical properties of polymeric materials, in particular the specific cutting pressure. The depth following sensor array was configured using capacitance detection methods to determine the distance between the cutter?s end and the aerial tracks. Capacitance sensing methods, whilst not new, were developed into a novel arrangement to meet the specific cutter tracking requirements of the proposed new machine tool. Each of the respective development areas had concept designs completed and were prototyped before being tested to determine the effectiveness of the respective designs. The outcomes from the testing are reported herein, and show each constituent part to be basically feasible, in the application. The results were sufficient to indicate that each development showed distinct potential but further development and integration into the machine tool should ensue...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{delivery}} from upland fluvial {{systems in}} the UK is of considerable importance in catchment management. However, scarcity of detailed data on sediment sources, storage and linkages between geomorphic processes inhibits current understanding of such systems. A sediment budget for an un-gauged, upland catchment at Burnhope Reservoir (North Pennines, UK) has been developed that couples catchment sediment sources and suspended sediment dynamics to reservoir sedimentation and; quantifies historic and contemporary sediment yields. Stream-side scars and cut banks are the dominant catchment sediment sources with greatest connectivity in first order tributaries during high discharge events. The catchment sediment system is supply-limited and sediment exhaustion occurs on an intra and inter-storm event basis. Bathymetric surveys, <b>core</b> transects and <b>aerial</b> photographs {{were used to assess}} spatial variability in sediment accumulation in the reservoir. Physical and radiometric analysis ((^ 137) Cs) of core sediments provided estimates of dry bulk density, particle size variations and a sedimentation chronology. Total reservoir sedimentation over the 67 year period has been estimated at 592 t yr(^ 1) ± 10 % (33. 3 t km(^- 2) yr(^ 1)) with average sedimentation rates of 1. 24 and 0. 77 cm yr(^- 1) calculated from the distal and proximal areas of the reservoir respectively. Inputs of fine suspended sediment from direct catchwater streams accounts for 54 % of sediment supply to the reservoir (best estimate yield of 318 t yr(^- 1) ± 129 %), while inputs from the actively eroding reservoir slopes and shorelines contribute a gross yield of 328 t yr(^- 1) + 92 %. However, 70 % of sediment from shoreline erosion is > 2 mm diameter and is stored on the shoreline and toe slopes. The remaining 30 % (98. 41) of fine sediment is transferred to deep-water reservoir storage. This highlights the importance of shoreline erosion and sediment storage in the overall budget. Error analysis of the sediment balance equation enabled the residual sediment inputs from ungauged tributary streams to be estimated (232. 6 t yr(^- 1) ± 394. 9 %). The specific sediment yield of 33. 3 t km(^- 2) yr(^- 1) to Burnhope Reservoir is relatively low. It is 40 % lower than the average yield of 84 t km(^- 2) yr(^- 1) estimated from British storage reservoirs (DETR, 2001) and an order of magnitude lower than estimates from South Pennine reservoirs. Analysis of the particle size of core sediments showed abrupt increases in sand-sized particles in the top 20 cm of the cores (late 1970 s onwards). This is related to the diverging trends in winter and summer-centred rainfall records and rapidly fluctuating reservoir levels. The sediment budget approach together with the chronology of reservoir sedimentation identifies the main sediment transfer pathways in the Burnhope catchment, and provides evidence of both extrinsic and intrinsic controls on sediment transfer and deposition.
