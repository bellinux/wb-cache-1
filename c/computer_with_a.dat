5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the Yellow Book CD-ROM {{standard}} was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data computer data storage medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> CD-ROM drive.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{clustering}} {{relies on}} a centralized management approach which makes the nodes available as orchestrated shared servers. It is distinct from other approaches such as peer to peer or grid computing which also use many nodes, but with a far more distributed nature. By the 21st century, the TOP500 organization's semiannual list of the 500 fastest supercomputers often includes many clusters, e.g. the world's fastest in 2011, the K <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> distributed memory, cluster architecture.|$|E

25|$|The Xerox PARC user {{interface}} consisted of graphical {{elements such as}} windows, menus, radio buttons, and check boxes. The concept of icons was later introduced by David Canfield Smith, who had written a thesis on the subject {{under the guidance of}} Kay. The PARC {{user interface}} employs a pointing device along with a keyboard. These aspects can be emphasized by using the alternative term and acronym for windows, icons, menus, pointing device (WIMP). This effort culminated in the 1973 Xerox Alto, the first <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> GUI, though the system never reached commercial production.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Mac Mini {{has been}} praised as a {{relatively}} affordable <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solid range of features. However, many also {{agree that it is}} relatively costly for a computer aimed at the lower segment of the market. It is possible to buy small computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and more storage. The small size has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, its size and reliability has helped keep resale values high.|$|E
25|$|Zuse founded another company, Zuse KG in Haunetal-Neukirchen in 1949; in 1957 the company’s {{head office}} moved to Bad Hersfeld. The Z4 was {{finished}} and {{delivered to the}} ETH Zurich, Switzerland in September 1950. At that time, {{it was the only}} working computer in continental Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold, only beaten by the BINAC, which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43, were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22, the first <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> memory based on magnetic storage.|$|E

25|$|The first commercially {{available}} <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> GUI was the 1979 PERQ workstation, manufactured by Three Rivers Computer Corporation. In 1981, Xerox eventually commercialized the Alto {{in the form}} of a new and enhanced system – the Xerox 8010 Information System – more commonly known as the Xerox Star. These early systems spurred many other GUI efforts, including the Apple Lisa (which presented the concept of menu bar and window controls) in 1983, the Apple Macintosh 128K in 1984, and the Atari ST with Digital Research's GEM, and Commodore Amiga in 1985. Visi On was released in 1983 for the IBM PC compatible computers, but was never popular due to its high hardware demands. Nevertheless, it was a crucial influence on the contemporary development of Microsoft Windows.|$|E
25|$|Blade Runners {{main focus}} is detective work rather than puzzles or combat, and the {{majority}} of gameplay consists of searching for evidence, questioning suspects and analyzing clues. Occasionally, the player must solve compulsory puzzles, and often, to progress the story, certain clues must be located. Clues are found by searching crime scenes, and {{come in the form of}} items, photographs, interviews, or unusual markings. When analyzing photographs, the player must use the ESPER system, a high-density <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity which allows for the enhancement of photos and enables the player to find details within the picture. Combat is occasionally available in the game, but is rarely compulsory. The only weapon available to the player is McCoy's standard issue police pistol, which may be loaded with various types of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I {{personal}} computer. The visionaries gained {{fame and}} wealth {{a year later}} for the Apple II, {{one of the first}} highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> GUI, the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a series}} of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom, which is short for Family Computer. Masayuki Uemura {{designed}} the system. Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead {{decided to go for}} a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the <b>computer</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E
