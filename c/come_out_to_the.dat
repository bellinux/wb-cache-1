The following week, Carlito was defeated by Cena.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, for true believers and the righteous, death {{will cause a}} feeling of love, then it's arrives and their souls will be aparted tender. When a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angel of death comes, and tells the soul to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{pleasure}} and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called Munkar and Nakir. He succeeds in answering the questions, and is blessed with heavenly rewards.|$|E
500|$|As {{the season}} for outdoor {{performances}} was coming to a close, Goldfaden {{tried and failed to}} rent an appropriate theater in Iaşi. A theater owner named Reicher, presumably Jewish himself, told him that [...] "a troupe of Jewish singers" [...] would be [...] "too dirty." [...] Goldfaden, Grodner, and Goldstein headed first to Botoşani, where they lived in a garret and Goldfaden continued to churn out songs and plays. An initial successful performance of Di Rekruten (The Recruits) in an indoor theater ("with loges!" [...] as Goldfaden wrote) was followed by days of rain so torrential that no one would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theater; they pawned some possessions and left for Galaţi, which was to prove a bit more auspicious, with a successful three-week run.|$|E

500|$|Both men {{agreed to}} avoid shooting, {{and to avoid}} getting anyone on either side hurt. Ali even {{surprised}} Shamir by predicting that Sadat wanted peace with Israel, not just a cease-fire. In coming days, soldiers from both sides would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clearing between their positions and fraternized. When shooting erupted in nearby sectors, they would return to their respective positions. Initially, the Egyptians would fire if it was nighttime, but the Israelis held their fire, and soon the Egyptians stopped firing as well. Soon, the commandos and paratroopers would meet daily, drinking coffee, playing backgammon and soccer, getting to personally know each other, and occasionally holding a kumzits, with the Egyptians slaughtering a sheep and the Israelis presenting food parcels sent from home. The example set by the Egyptians and Israelis here was soon emulated in other sectors, and even Sharon came to see for himself the [...] "local armistice" [...] that had taken place. At one point, two officers came with Ali to meet with Shamir and said they hoped relations between Egypt and Israel would come to match the relations between Shamir's and Ali's men.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had asked each of them to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 {{while at}} the peak of his playing career, Ian Roberts became the first {{high-profile}} Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public as gay. John Amaechi, who played in the NBA with the Utah Jazz, Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers (as well as internationally with Panathinaikos BC of the Greek Basketball League and Kinder Bologna of the Italian Basketball League), came out in February 2007 on ESPN's Outside the Lines program. He also released a book Man in the Middle, published by ESPN Books (...) which talks about his professional and personal life as a closeted basketball player. He was the first NBA player (former or current) to come out.|$|E
2500|$|The Gateway Grizzlies {{baseball}} team of Sauget, Illinois have served the Luther Burger at their ballpark.

2500|$|There is a {{road that}} runs from Los Llanos de Aridane to {{the capital city of}} the island Santa Cruz de La Palma (known by locals as simply Santa Cruz). [...] This road is a two-lane highway that {{includes}} a pair of two-lane tunnels that go right through the top of the mountain. [...] The older tunnel is shorter (...) and higher than the newer tunnel (...) [...] When traveling {{from one side of the}} mountain to the other it is common to enter one side in complete clouds (the east side) and <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sunny side (western side). [...] This is due to the clouds not being able to cross the mountains, an effect caused by the counter trade wind.|$|E

2500|$|At {{least one}} batsman will be not {{out at the}} end of an innings, because once ten batsmen are out, the {{eleventh}} will have no partner to bat on with. Two batsmen will be not out if the batting side [...] "declares" [...] in first-class cricket, and often at the end of the scheduled number of overs in limited overs cricket. [...] A batsman further down the batting order than the not-out batsmen will not <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease at all and is noted as did not bat rather than not out; by contrast, a batsman who comes to the crease but faces no balls is not out.

2500|$|World-class celebrities {{visited the}} Bolshaya Dmitrovka. In 1843 Franz Liszt gave two concerts at the Merchants Club. [...] One {{of the most}} {{important}} events of the Moscow social life was the meeting of the great composer with writers, musicians and philosophers which took place in the Club on May 6, 1843. A famous critic Stepan Shevyrev, who knew Liszt very well through his concerts in Europe and Saint-Petersburg, made a speech of welcome at the banquet. The musician was treated to Russian cuisine. The two-meter sturgeon carried into the dining room by several men moved Liszt to applause. A real artist of a cook named Vlas, who once served at the house of Pushkin’s uncle, had to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> applause. The Sokolov’s choir performance which enraptured Liszt was an inspiration for his studies of gypsy music. He once performed an improvisation on the themes of gypsy songs at a concert in Moscow, and later published an article on the nature of gypsy art in “Le Figaro”.|$|E

50|$|Kickoffs - If a kickoff {{leaves the}} field of play on the fly, <b>the</b> ball <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 25-yard line. The {{sideline}} walls and end zone walls are not out of bounds, and balls can be played off of them. If a kickoff leaves {{the field of}} play after making contact with the field or a player on either team, <b>the</b> ball <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 5-yard line, or the point in which it leaves the field of play, whichever is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kicking team's goal line.|$|R

2500|$|Usually {{death is}} portrayed as a terrifying and painful event for sinner's or a disbeliever. Thus [...] the angels of {{punishment}} arrive and take position in front of him. Then, the angel of death arrives and tells the soul to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrath of God. Being terrified, the soul desperately tries to hide itself in the body. Thereupon, the angel of death starts beating the soul and extracts it from the body in a most painful way. The painful process of taking out a sinner's soul has been compared with [...] "the dragging of an iron skewer through moist wool, tearing the veins and sinews." [...] The soul is then wrapped in a dirty cloth which emits bad smell. Carrying the soul, the angels head towards the sky. On the way, other angels inquire about this wicked soul. They are told {{that this is the}} soul of that and that sinner person. The angels then arrive at the upper sky, but its doors are not opened for the evil soul. Consequently, the soul is then thrown in lowest stage of the earth called 'Sijjin' where it is punished until the Day of Judgment.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in {{the series}} against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100runs, which he had not done {{previously}} in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer {{in the series}} while his six wickets cost 48.50runs each.• Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said [...] "All {{of a sudden there}} was this new-found confidence. You need to have a leader who can <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle and make some sort of contribution. He has done enough and should not feel he has one foot in and one foot out as far as the leadership in concerned. He has done his bit to provide a winning environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kicking: kickoffs {{are from}} the goal line, to begin the halves and odd overtimes, or after any score except a safety, in which a free kick is {{undertaken}} by the team yielding the safety from their own 5-yard line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. All kicks must be made by either place kick or drop kick; punting is prohibited. The receiving team may field any kick that rebounds off the net or its surrounding framework and lands {{in the field of}} play. Any kickoff that goes out of bounds untouched or hits an overhead structure is to be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal [...] "slack net" [...] or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> five-yard line. The touchback is not automatic; players must attempt to advance the ball out of their own end zone if it is caught there. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the end zone and under the net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the endzone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the endzone, the ball is placed on the 2½-yard line. Any field goal or extra point attempted by drop kick is worth one additional point (thus four points for a drop-kicked field goal or two for drop-kicked conversion).|$|E
