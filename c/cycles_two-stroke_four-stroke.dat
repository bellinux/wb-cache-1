40|$|This paper {{gives the}} results of air-flow tests through <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> and <b>four-stroke</b> cycle diesel engine {{cylinder}} heads and ports on steady-flow low-pressure air flow rigs. An analysis is made of the pressure drop through a diesel engine cylinder head inlet port system which shows {{the effect of the}} various parts of the system on flow loss. This also includes the effects of valve lift, valve seat angle, and valve shape on isentropic area. A comparison is made between tandem and Siamese porting on a four-stroke cycle engine cylinder head. The results of tests on uniflow scavenged <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> inlet ports and exhaust vaIves are aIso included...|$|R
40|$|<b>Two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> and <b>four-stroke</b> cycle {{diesel engines}} are {{in use in}} rail {{traction}} with four-stroke cycle design dominating the field. Cycle simulation by computer programmes {{have shown that the}} conventional <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> is inferior to its four-stroke cycle counterpart in combustion efficiency and thermal loading. Research at Sulzer Brothers Ltd., to decide on the choice of cycle for production of a high power locomotive engine concluded that. conventional <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engine is not suitable for locomotive application. A report by Ricardo Ltd., based on a survey of engines in current production for traction application suggested that there are potentials in <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> design. This research project is concerned with comparison of two well proven locomotive engines, one of <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> and the other of four-stroke cycle. Performance, mechanical loading, thermal loading and vibration were chosen as parameters to be investigated to provide information about the status of the two cycles in relation to lower range, fuel consumption, reliability and durability, with a view to assist the users of locomotive engines to make the correct choice. Results and analysis of these findings are presented. A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Two-stroke,</b> <b>Four-stroke,</b> and {{continuous}} machine {{are very different}} from each other. However it was shown [...] that there is a quantum regime where all these machines become thermodynamically equivalent to each other. While the intra cycle dynamics in the equivalence regime is very different in different engine types, when the cycle is completed they all turn out to provide the same amount of work and consume the same amount of heat (hence they share the same efficiency as well). This equivalence is associated with a coherent work extraction mechanism and has no classical analogue.|$|R

50|$|The free-piston linear generator's great {{versatility}} {{comes from}} {{the absence of a}} crankshaft, removing a great pumping loss, giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be <b>two-stroke</b> engine or <b>four-stroke</b> engine. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to propel the piston through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the <b>two-strokes</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{controlled}} auto-ignition (CAI) <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engine suggests an exceptional aspect and promising future for internal combustion engines (ICEs), {{such as a}} higher power-toweight ratio, higher combustion efficiency and lower exhaust gas emissions. Conventional <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engines emit higher exhaust gas emissions and offer lower fuel saving economy. Most of these drawbacks can be addressed if CAI combustion {{is associated with a}} <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engine. An experimental investigation is carried out based on a single-cylinder CAI <b>two-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engine using Internal and External Exhaust Gas Recirculation (In-EGR and Ex-EGR) and fuels with different octane numbers to investigate the exhaust emissions characteristics. The experimental results indicate a remarkable improvement in the engine's exhaust gas emissions. The concentration of uHC and CO emissions decreased with application of In/Ex-EGR.
