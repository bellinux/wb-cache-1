40|$|The {{project set}} out with two main aims. The first {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether large scale multispectral aerial photography could be used to successfully survey and monitor urban wildlife habitats. The second objective was to investigate whether this data source could be used to predict population numbers of selected species expected to be found in a particular habitat type. Panchromatic, colour and <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red,</b> 1 : 2500 scale aerial photographs, taken in 1981 and 1984, were used. For the orderly extraction of information from the imagery, an urban wildlife habitat classification was devised. This was based on classifications already in use in urban environments by the Nature Conservancy Council. Pilot tests identified that the <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> imagery provided the most accurate results about urban wildlife habitats in the study area of the Blackbrook Valley, Dudley. Both the 1981 and 1984 <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photographs were analysed and information was obtained about the type, extent and distribution of habitats. In order to investigate whether large scale aerial photographs could be used to predict likely animal population numbers in urban environments, it was decided to limit the investigation to the possible prediction of bird population numbers in Saltwells Local Nature Reserve. A good deal of research has already been completed into the development of models to predict breeding bird population numbers in woodland habitats. These models were analysed to determine whether they could be used successfully with data extracted from the aerial photographs. The projects concluded that 1 : 2500 scale <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photographs can provide very useful and very detailed information about the wildlife habitats in an urban area. Such imagery can also provide habitat area data to be used with population predictive models of woodland breeding birds. Using the aerial photographs, further investigations into the relationship between area of habitat and the breeding of individual bird species were inconclusive and need further research...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the U. K. government policy regarding the establishment of new towns. The emphasis is now on the redevelopment of existing cities rather than on building new ones. This has created an urgent need to carry out detailed surveys and inventories of many aspects of urban land use in metropolitan areas: this study concentrates on just one aspect - urban open space. In the first stage a comparison was made between 1 : 10, 000 scale black and white and 1 : 10, 000 scale <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> aerial photographs, to compare the type and amount of open space information which could be obtained from these two sources. The advantages of using <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photography were clearly demonstrated in this comparison. The second stage was the use of <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photography as the sole source of data to survey and map the urban open space of a sample area in Merseyside Metropolitan County. This sample area comprised eleven 1 / 4 km 2 squares, on each of which a 20 m x 20 m grid cell was placed to record, directly from the photography, 625 sets of data. Each set of data recorded the type and amount of open space, its surface cover, maintenance status and management. The data recorded were fed into a computer and a suite of programs was developed to provide output in both computer map and statistical form, for each of the eleven - 1 / 4 km 2 -sample areas. The third stage involved a comparison of open space data with socio-economic status. Merseyside County Planning Authority had previously conducted a socio-economic survey of the county, and this information was used to identify ' the socio-economic status of the population in the eleven ilkm 2 areas of this project. This comparison revealed many interesting and useful relationships between the provision of urban open space and socio-economic status...|$|E
40|$|In Northrhine-Westphalia {{research}} into the causes of forest decline is aided by <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photoflights. For this purpose some small areas, and several large regions were covered by flights since 1983. The analysis reported is confined to spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) because symptoms of new forest damage are reasonably well understood. Besides normal damage and vigour assessment, additional information such as the social status of individual trees, crown density, sample plot position in the stand and thinning activities were collected. The main outcome of the data analysis is represented by graphical illustrations. The results indicate that silvicultural treatments could not have caused the present appearance of spruce because these have not changed rapidly {{in the last decade}} and, furthermore, the research shows no correlation between thinning activities and extent of tree stress. On the contrary, dominant and edge trees indicate that all areas show the well known damage symptoms which are attributable to extreme exposure to rain, fog and wind. The new forest decline is especially unmistakable in older stands. Old trees seem more at risk than young ones. The <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> technique can only indirectly elicit relationships but the results of photointerpretation show it to be a practicable assessment method...|$|E

The results were considered a failure at the time, and Baird moved on leaving behind several discs in the hands of museums and favoured company members.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{results of}} {{an evaluation of the}} spectral signatures of vegetation communities recognised on multispectral photography, at scales of 1 : 15, 000 and 1 : 5, 000, in North West Queensland, Australia, with reference to specific environmental parameters, notably bedrock mineralization, and microdensitometer optical density measurements. Detailed ground-truth information obtained for the evaluation included plant species frequency recording and plant and soil sampling along a series of transects located across known mineralized zones and across spectral anomalies detected on the photography. Overlays of the spectral signature units, including those subjected to enhancement techniques, were prepared and correlated with the ground-truth data and a number of microdensitometer scan lines measuring the optical density within each of the eight spectral bands of the multispectral photography. The spectral signatures of vegetation, and especially the distinct spectral signature of geobotanically anomalous plant communities forming surface expression of mineralized bedrock and related geochemical soil anomalies, are best displayed on false <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> photography which covers the visible and near infra-red part of the spectrum in which plant reflectivity is most sensitive, consequently yielding most information. Ground-truth investigations, confirming the interpretation of infra-red spectral signatures, reveal the composition of anomalous and background vegetation units and indicatethe influence of the mineral status of the soil, relief, drainage and lithology on plant species distribution. Over mineralized terrain, higher reflectivity in all spectral bands and especially the true colour green, panchromatic green and false <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> are recorded by microdensitometer optical density measurements which positively correlate with the above average concentrations of metal in the indicator plants and surface soils. In the semi-arid environment of North West Queensland, the use of multispectral photography, in conjunction with detailed field studies, is shown to have application in the study of vegetation associations and plant conmunities forming surface expression of characteristic ground conditions. The recognition of geobotanical anomalies and differences in soil and plant reflectivity indicative of bedrock mineralization offers considerable promise in mineral exploration for the detection of ore bodies. <p...|$|E
40|$|Japanese Knotweed s. l. taxa are {{amongst the}} most {{aggressive}} vascular plant Invasive Alien Species (IAS) in the world. These taxa form dense, suppressive monocultures and are persistent, pervasive invaders throughout the more economically developed countries (MEDCs) of the world. The current paper utilises the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach of Definiens Imaging Developer software, in combination with very high spatial resolution (VHSR) <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> (CIR) and visible‑band (RGB) aerial photography in order to detect Japanese Knotweed s. l. taxa in Wales (UK). An algorithm was created using Definiens in order to detect these taxa, using variables found to effectively distinguish them from landscape and vegetation features. The results of the detection algorithm were accurate, as confirmed by field validation and desk‑based studies. Further, these results may be incorporated into Geographical Information Systems (GIS) research as they are readily transferable as vector polygons (shapefiles). The successful detection results developed within the Definiens software should enable greater management and control efficacy. Further to this, {{the basic principles of}} the detection process could enable detection of these taxa worldwide, given the (relatively) limited technical requirements necessary to conduct further analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{alteration}} of hydrological regimes through {{the construction of}} dams and minor diversion weirs has significant detrimental ecological effects on the downstream river reaches. In the case whereby approximately 99 % of the Mean Annual Flow (MANF) has been diverted, the flow regulation has often resulted in a constriction in the river channel and a reduction in complexity of the aquatic and riparian vegetation and encroachment of terrestrial plant species. The Snowy River Increased Flows (SRIF) environmental flow program aims to return 21 % of the MANF to the Snowy River below Jindabyne. This revised flow regime attempts to re-introduce the hydrological cues such as seasonal flow patterns, annual floods and greater daily flow variability. In the case of the Snowy River, a higher magnitude annual flood was introduced to flush sediment and vegetation within the river channel and the more variable daily flow rate aims create a more natural and complex riparian and aquatic vegetated habitat. This study examined the changes in aquatic and riparian vegetation at two sites in the Dalgety Uplands macro-reach of the Snowy River using four band <b>colour</b> <b>infra-red</b> high-resolution aerial photography in 2007, 2010 and 2013. A supervised maximum likelihood classification to determine vegetation classes and post-classification change detection was used to quantify the vegetation changes. The results indicated than an increase in flow magnitude was able to create a more open water and aquatic habitats. Furthermore an increase in the frequency of inundation across the lower benches increased the abundance of flood tolerant amphibious species and removed water susceptible species. These changes are reflective {{of the importance of the}} moisture gradient in riparian zones and the zonation of riparian plant species is largely determined by the flow regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} {{described in}} this article was developed in connection with two different projects and entails texture mapping by time-of-flight laser scanner. In order to verify its operational effectiveness and applicability to other contexts, sites with extremely different morphological characteristics were studied. The basic rationale of this simple method derives from the need to obtain different types of mapping – including RGB real <b>colour</b> images, <b>infra-red</b> images, false <b>colour</b> images from georadar scans, etc. – from the same scanned surface. To resolve this problem, we felt that the most appropriate step was to obtain a UVW mapping based on the high resolution real colour images and then use the samecoordinates to rapidly map the false colour images as well. Thus we fitted a device to the camera to determine its trajectory (similar to a gunsight); when scanned by the laser scanner in the same context as the monument, it makes it possible to know the exact coordinates of the viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|The Agulhas Current {{with its}} retroflection and {{attendant}} eddy-shedding {{is the cause}} of some of the greatest mesoscale variability in the ocean. This paper considers the area to the south and east of Madagascar, which provides some of the source waters of the Agulhas Current, and examines the propagating sea surface height signals in altimetry and output from a numerical model, OCCAM. Both show bands of variability along the axis of the East Madagascar Current (EMC) and along a zonal band near 25 ˚S. Sequences of images plus associated temperature data suggest that a number of westward-propagating eddies are present in this zonal band. The paper then focuses on the region to the south of the island, where ocean <b>colour</b> and <b>infra-red</b> imagery are evocative of an East Madagascar Retroflection. The synthesis of data analysed in this paper, however, show that remotely observed features in this area can be explained by anticyclonic eddies moving westward through the region, and this explanation is consistent with numerical model output and the trajectories of drifting buoys...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The upland moorlands of Britain form {{distinctive}} {{landscapes of}} international conservation importance, comprising mosaics of heathland, acid grassland, blanket bog and bracken. Much of this landscape is managed by rotational burning to create suitable habitat for gamebirds {{and there is}} concern over whether this is driving long-term changes in upland vegetation communities. However, the inaccessibility and scale of uplands means that a practical way to monitor changes in vegetation and burning practices is {{through the use of}} remotely sensed data. We develop methods to classify aerial imagery into high-resolution vegetation maps, including the distribution of burns on managed grouse moors. Using the maps, we test for effects of environmental gradients on vegetation cover and its management. Location: Peak District National Park, UK. Methods: We classified <b>colour</b> and <b>infra-red</b> aerial photographs into eight dominant cover classes using the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm. In addition, heather (Calluna vulgaris) was further differentiated into growth phases, including sites that were newly burnt.

40|$|Initially {{a variety}} of {{established}} photo-interpretation methods have been applied {{to the study of}} mineralised areas and to the mapping of geological features, hydrographic surveys and miscellaneous investigations of small sites using commercially available black and white, <b>colour</b> and <b>infra-red</b> false <b>colour</b> photography. In addition the potential of multi-spectral and infra-red linescan imagery has been investigated. A method using a radio-controlled mini-drone has been developed for the acquisition of imagery covering small areas for base mapping and interpretation purposes. The imagery obtained {{has been found to be}} of acceptable quality and may be used either to supplement the conventional imagery particularly where only black and white cover is available, or to carry out a mini-drone survey in its own right. Microdensitometry and statistical analysis of the image data has been carried out together with computer graphics to assist in the interpretation and display of results. The work demonstrates the value of utilising imagery of all types and at all scales for geological interpretation purposes and the flexibility of relatively simple and cheap data acquisition and image processing facilities for limited areas. Although successful in exposed situations the problems of interpretation of vegetated and soil covered terrain in the United Kingdom are highlighted, but nevertheless a significant increase in detectability of subtle features in mineralised zones in difficult terrain, has been achieved using techniques such as microdensitometry...|$|R
40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{models for the}} evolution of T Tauri stars surrounded by circumstellar discs. The models include the effects of pre-main-sequence stellar and time dependent disc evolution, and incorporate the effects of stellar magnetic fields acting on the inner disc. For single stars, consistency with observations in Taurus-Auriga demands that disc dispersal occurs rapidly, on much less than the viscous timescale of the disc, at roughly the epoch when heating by stellar radiation first dominates over internal viscous dissipation. Applying the models to close binaries, we find that because the initial conditions for discs in binaries are uncertain, studies of extreme mass ratio systems are required to provide a stringent test of theoretical disc evolution models. We also note that no correlation of the <b>infra-red</b> <b>colours</b> of T Tauri stars with their rotation rate is observed, in apparent contradiction to the predictions of simple magnetospheric accretion models.

40|$|The RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) is {{a survey}} to detect objects whose optical {{intensity}} varies on timescales {{of less than}} ~ 70 min. In our pilot dataset taken with the INT and the Wide Field Camera in Nov 2003 we discovered nearly 50 new variable objects. Many of these varied on timescales much longer than 1 hr. However, only 4 objects showed a modulation on a timescale of 1 hour or less. This paper presents followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of these 4 objects. We find that RAT J 0455 + 1305 is a pulsating (on a period of 374 sec) subdwarf B (sdB) star of the EC 14026 type. We have modelled its spectrum and determine Teff = 29, 200 +/- 1900 K and log g = 5. 2 +/- 0. 3 which locates it on the cool edge of the EC 14026 instability strip. It has a modulation amplitude {{which is one of}} the highest of any known EC 14026 star.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to study the {{diagnostic}} performance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and alternative diagnostic tests for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Methods employed are as follows:systematic review and meta-analysis; INDEX TEST: OCT including time-domain (TD-OCT) and the most recently developed spectral domain (SD-OCT); comparator tests: visual acuity, clinical evaluation (slit lamp), Amsler chart, <b>colour</b> fundus photographs, <b>infra-red</b> reflectance, red-free images/blue reflectance, fundus autofluorescence imaging (FAF), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP), and microperimetry; reference standard: fundus fluorescein angiography. Databases searched included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, EMBASE, Biosis, SCI, the Cochrane Library, DARE, MEDION, and HTA database. Last literature searches: March 2013. Risk of bias assessed using QUADAS- 2. Meta-analysis models were fitted using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves. Twenty-two studies (2 abstracts and 20 articles) enrolling 2124 participants were identified, reporting TD-OCT (12 studies), SD-OCT (1 study), ICGA (8 studies), PHP (3 studies), Amsler grid, colour fundus photography and FAF (1 study each).

No absorptions were detected {{in any of the}} sources. We calculated upper limits to the column density in molecular absorption, using an excitation temperature of 10 K, to be N(CO) < 10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 16 cm^- 2, equivalent to hydrogen columns of order N(H) < 10 ^ 19 - 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2. These limits are significantly lower than the values N(H) ≈ (2 - 6) 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 that might be expected if the red colours of these sources were due to dust absorption at the quasar redshift as suggested by Webster et al. (1995). Should the excitation temperature of the molecular transitions be higher than 100 K, the upper limits to the H 2 column densities would be greater than those derived from the red colours. To explain the lack of molecular absorption we conclude that either the optical extinction takes place outside the host galaxy (along the line of sight), or the excitation temperature of the molecular transitions is very high, or the obscuration is not associated with significant amounts of cold molecular gas. It is quite possible that the hard X-ray flux from the central source of these AGN is strong enough to photo-dissociate the molecules.

40|$|Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are {{recognised}} globally {{as effective}} tools for protecting valuable and vulnerable marine ecosystems (habitats, species and communities), maintaining the biological diversity, and safeguarding the associated {{historical and cultural}} resources. MPAs accommodate local communities and regulate the different uses of the sea, fostering more sustainable use of marine resources. Moreover, MPAs are increasingly being used as environmental laboratories, enabling a greater scientific understanding of marine systems. In the Mediterranean Sea about a hundred of MPAs have been designated during the last decades, {{all but one of}} which are in coastal areas. This study develops a new way of using RS techniques tailored for the monitoring and management of Mediterranean MPAs. The advance in satellite Remote Sensing (RS) technologies has made possible to look at the MPAs not only by means of discrete in situ surveys but rather {{on the basis of a}} “synoptic” and repeated view. The primary aim of this thesis was to establish how the satellite sensors can be successfully used and whether RS provides reliable tools for monitoring and managing Mediterranean MPAs. The study aimed specifically at describing and identifying, by means of passive remote sensors, the spatial and temporal scale of the bio-physical processes occurring in Mediterranean MPAs. Observations retrieved by ocean <b>colour</b> and thermal <b>infra-red</b> sensors, for a range of MPA study sites, were used to depict system functioning by the analysis of the prevailing spatial and temporal variations of the geophysical parameters and biophysical conditions. The seasonal variations of the ecological indicators (i. e. phytoplankton blooms and thermal trends) were analysed over various MPAs located in different regions of the Mediterranean basin, and different biooptical algorithms were tested in a coastal MPA. The short-term and long-term monitoring (interannual) of the ecological indicators is key to elucidating trends and modifications in the biogeochemical balance of the basin possibly caused by environmental changes which could potentially affect the MPA’s resilience. Consequently it is now possible to monitor MPAs easily and at low cost, by integrating RS with the traditional sampling methodologies to work towards safeguarding of valuable marine habitats and species. RS should be considered as key tool that fosters the ecosystem-based management. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Galaxies can be {{separated}} into two broad classes; those actively forming stars (star-forming) {{and those with}} little-to-no ongoing star formation (passive). A key question of galaxy evolution is, how is star formation shut down in galaxies? As passive galaxies are predominantly more massive than their star-forming counterparts, and contain ≈ 50 % of the stellar mass in the present Universe, their formation history gives insight into the formation mechanisms for all galaxies. How did they form? How and why was their star formation shut down? Colour {{can be used as}} a rough proxy for these two classes of galaxy. Galaxies that largely emit red light are made up of an older stellar population and are thereby passive. Whereas galaxies that largely emit blue light contain newly forming massive blue stars and are thereby star-forming. Galaxies separated by colour tend to occupy different environments, where red galaxies are found in very dense clustered environments and blue galaxies are generally not. Consequently, environment must play some role in the truncation of star formation in galaxies. To understand the nature of this connection, in this work I measure the clustering properties of galaxies as a function of their physical properties. Using ≈ 180 deg² of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, I measure the projected clustering and dark matter halo occupation statistics for 172, 377 galaxies as a function of rest-frame r-band luminosity, stellar mass and colour, over the redshift (z) range 0. 05 1 using a sample of Extremely Red Objects (EROs), galaxies at ≥ 1. 0 with star-forming and passive sub-populations that are selected using very red optical to <b>infra-red</b> <b>colours</b> (e. g., (R − K) Vega > 5. 0). The clustering strength of all galaxies increases with increasing luminosity and stellar mass at all redshifts. Red galaxies have stronger clustering at all scales than blue galaxies to the same stellar mass and luminosity. The small scale clustering strength of red galaxies increases with decreasing stellar mass, opposite to that of the blue galaxy population. The fraction of red galaxies that are satellites therefore increases with decreasing stellar mass. Blue galaxy stellar mass is found to be closely tied with their halo mass, and the majority of blue galaxies are centrally located within their halos. The fraction of all satellite galaxies that are red is ≥ the fraction of all central galaxies that are red at all stellar masses and luminosities. This means that star formation quenching of in-falling blue galaxies occurs across the entire stellar mass and luminosity range analysed in this work. At low stellar masses and faint luminosities, the majority of centrals are blue so these must be quenched as satellites. At high stellar masses and bright luminosities, the majority of centrals are already red so these must be quenched before they become satellites...|$|R
