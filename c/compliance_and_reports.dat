40|$|International audience^The {{literature}} on product-based workflow design considers only static collaborative environments where the product model is static {{and does not}} change. However the possible evolution of the product model and thus {{its impact on the}} collaborative environment are not considered despite the importance of this evolution for innovative product design. As a result the uncontrolled changes can easily break the cross-organizational process that links the different stakeholders in the collaborative environment. In this paper we present a framework that builds the collaboration contract from the product model and supports a controlled evolution of this contract. We leverage this framework by a set of management operations (services) that enable the contract evolution and investigate how a tailoring operation will not impact the executable cross-organizational process unless this process is maintained executable by the workflow engine. These operations are provided as services by a collaborative platform. Nevertheless, software applications that are provided through services following the Software as a service (SaaS) paradigm generally need to be compliant to some standards. In order to implement our management operations, we need to select the software application that provides the most conformant service interface to a given standard. Accordingly, we develop a formal framework that tests the <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> quantitative results that help experts take the right decision. Unlike existing work that focuses on a single dimension when checking the compliance of a software application with the corresponding standard (for example the functional dimension exclusively, or the syntactic dimension exclusively), in this work we consider multiple dimensions at the same time.

40|$|Religion in the {{contemporary}} times has potentials from which conventional models and theories could leverage for public wellbeing. Considering the moral and ethical dimensions of corporate social responsibility (CSR), understanding this nebulous concept from the religious lenses could help strengthen CSR <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> in the industrial societies, where religions play direct and indirect role in corporate governance and people‘s lifestyle. This paper explores eclectic sources to provide answer to the questions: Does CSR have theological foundation in Islam Christianity and Judaism? Can religions strengthen CSR <b>and</b> fortify <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting?</b> The authors sourced the required qualitative data from journal articles, Islamic jurisprudence, Judaic sources and Biblical texts as well as relevant online resources on the subject. The extractions from eclectic sources were subjected to content analysis from which conclusions on the two questions were established. The findings indicate that CSR has theological foundation in the three religions, and religious ethics and values could be potent drivers for strengthening CSR <b>and</b> <b>reporting...</b>|$|R

30|$|On the whole, the {{transfer}} of rights by license agreement to a third party, not being {{the author of the}} patent, remains inadequately regulated and most often, the commercialisation of the fruits of intellectual labour is limited to the format of the small innovative enterprise (SIE). Moreover, the majority of these SIEs are pseudo-R&D structures created for the purposes of <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>report</b> <b>and</b> attraction of the grant funding, rather than functional startups. What was the reason for this? According to Federal Law No. 217, the college owned 33 % of shares with no dilution of ownership possiblei. This proportion was too big and made it difficult to attract investors. Besides, the university’s share is a constant if invisible presence in the regulatory control organs and thus confers obligations of compliance to certain rules and regulations, for example - Rosstat (Federal State Statistics Service) registration: ‘You have to register with the Rosstat which makes the keeping of accounts much more complicated {{due to the fact that}} Rosstat adopts a huge amount of absolutely unintelligible reports. Whereas a normal company does not have to register; and nothing untoward occurs; SIE’s are nevertheless obliged to do so’j.|$|R
