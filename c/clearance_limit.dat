50|$|Flight 168's {{first leg}} was from São Paulo, Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro, which was {{completed}} uneventfully. The flight then departed Rio de Janeiro {{on its way}} to Fortaleza. As the flight approached its destination, it was cleared to descend from its cruising altitude of flight level 330 - approximately 33,000 feet (10,059 m) mean sea level - to 5,000 feet (1,524 m).

5000|$|At that point, Flight 610 was {{scheduled}} to make a right turn to intercept the 168 degree course line of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, which was its next <b>clearance</b> <b>limit.</b> To intercept that course line, the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210 degrees, which was a proper intercept angle of almost 45 degrees. If the pilot had configured his audio selector switches properly, {{he would have been}} able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of [...] "A", for the north side of that low frequency range, and then as he neared the course line itself, he would begin to hear the [...] "N" [...] identifier. That would be the signal that it was time to turn left again, and track the 168 degree course line to the WONT intersection. But, the plane never turned left again.
