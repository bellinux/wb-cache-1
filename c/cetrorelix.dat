50|$|<b>Cetrorelix</b> (INN, BAN), or <b>cetrorelix</b> acetate (USAN, JAN), is an {{injectable}} gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that is marketed primarily {{under the}} brand name Cetrotide. A synthetic decapeptide, it is used is used in assisted reproduction to inhibit premature luteinizing hormone surges The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In addition, <b>cetrorelix</b> {{can be used to}} treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the prostate and breast (in pre-/perimenopausal women) and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). It is administered as either multiple 0.25 mg daily subcutaneous injections or as a single-dose 3 mg subcutaneous injection. The duration of the 3 mg single dose is four days; if hCG is not administered within four days, a daily 0.25 mg dose is started and continued until hCG is administered.|$|E

50|$|A GnRH modulator, or GnRH {{receptor}} modulator, {{is a type}} of drug which modulates the GnRH receptor, {{the biological}} target of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). They include GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists. These drugs may be GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and <b>cetrorelix</b> - peptides that are structurally related to GnRH - or small-molecules like relugolix, which are structurally distinct. GnRH modulators affect the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn affects the gonads, influencing their function and hence fertility as well as the production of sex steroids, including that of estradiol and progesterone in women and of testosterone in men. As such, GnRH modulators can also be described as progonadotropins or antigonadotropins, depending on whether they serve to increase or decrease gonadotropin levels.|$|E
50|$|DHT, {{and to a}} {{significantly}} smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as leuprorelin or <b>cetrorelix.</b> Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously {{and not in a}} pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the expression of receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in human specimens of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In addition, we used in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC to investigate if these receptors are suitable targets for the treatment with the LHRH antagonist <b>cetrorelix.</b> Receptors for LHRH were expressed in all tumor samples and in the TNBC cell lines HCC 1806 and HCC 1937.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{elaborate}} an efficient method for the micronization of the decapeptide <b>cetrorelix</b> (a GnRH-antagonist), in order to obtain a microsuspension as basis for other pharmaceutical preparations, such as e. g. inhalation aerosols. A modified pearl-mill coupled with a cryostat was used for the micronization of <b>cetrorelix</b> in fluid propellant and operated under different conditions. The obtained <b>cetrorelix</b> suspensions were analyzed for particle size distribution, purity of <b>cetrorelix,</b> and for metal contamination through abrasion from parts of the mill. The method allowed an effective micronization of <b>cetrorelix.</b> The mean particle size of the initial <b>cetrorelix</b> lyophilizate bulk ware was reduced from 52. 5 Î¼ (Volume Mean Diameter, VMD) down to 14. 9, 6. 1 and 3. 1 Î¼m, respectively, respectively. The HPLC analysis of all <b>cetrorelix</b> suspensions after micronization did not show signs of decomposition as compared to the initial product. The elementary analysis of the suspensions performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed a negligible amount of contaminants in the suspension (Zr=max. 0. 6 ppm; Fe, Cr, Ni, Ba, below limit of quantification, i. e. < 0. 14 ppm). The only appreciable contaminant. Aluminum (Al= 1. 1 ppm), was derived from the mechanical capping of aluminum canisters prior to analysis. The Zr determination in the suspension of 0. 6 ppm, is still considered to be negligible as compared to the legally tolerated limit of air contamination. By low-temperature micronization in fluid propellant, fine drug suspensions of <b>cetrorelix</b> for pMDIs can be directly manufactured in one-step procedure without destruction of the peptide structure and without appreciable product contamination...|$|E
40|$|Antagonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), {{unlike the}} LH-RH agonists, {{suppress}} gonadotropins and sex steroid secretion immediately after administration, without initial stimulatory effects.

In this study, the binding characteristics of receptors for LH-RH in membrane fractions from rat anterior pituitaries were investigated after a single injection of <b>Cetrorelix</b> at {{a dose of}} 100 microg per rat. To determine whether the treatment with <b>Cetrorelix</b> can affect the concentration of measurable LH-RH binding sites, we applied an in vitro method to desaturate LH-RH receptors by chaotropic agents such as manganous chloride (MnCl 2) and ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN). Our {{results show that the}} percentages of occupied LH-RH receptors at 1, 3, and 6 h after administration of <b>Cetrorelix</b> were approximately 28 %, 14 %, and 10 %, respectively, of total receptors. At later time intervals, we could not detect occupied LH-RH binding sites. Ligand competition assays, following in vitro desaturation, demonstrated that rat pituitary LH-RH receptors were significantly (P < 0. 01) down-regulated for at least 72 h after administration of <b>Cetrorelix.</b> The lowest receptor concentration was found 3 - 6 h after <b>Cetrorelix</b> treatment and a recovery in receptor number began within approximately 24 h. The down-regulation of LH-RH binding sites induced by <b>Cetrorelix</b> was accompanied by serum LH and testosterone suppression. Higher LH-RH receptor concentrations coincided with elevated serum hormone levels at later time intervals.

40|$|<b>Cetrorelix,</b> a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, {{has been}} shown to limit growth of the human androgen-independent {{prostate}} cell line DU- 145, although other inhibitory actions may also be affected. Both growth and invasion of DU- 145 cells are linked to autocrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling. Invasiveness requires not only cells to migrate to conduits, but also reduced adhesiveness between tumour cells to enable separation from the tumour mass. Thus, we investigated whether <b>Cetrorelix</b> alters the DU- 145 cellâcell adhesion and if this occurs via altered EGFR signalling. Pharmacologic levels of <b>Cetrorelix</b> limited the invasiveness of a highly invasive DU- 145 subline overexpressing full-length EGFR (DU- 145 WT). Extended exposure of the cells to <b>Cetrorelix</b> resulted in increased levels of the cellâcell adhesion complex molecules E-cadherin, Î±- and Î²-catenin, and p 120. Puromycin blocked the increases in E-cadherin and Î²-catenin levels, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required. The <b>Cetrorelix</b> effect appears to occur via transmodulation of EGFR by a protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent mechanism, as there were no changes in DU- 145 cells expressing EGFR engineered to negate the PKC transattenuation site (DU- 145 A 654); downregulation of EGFR signalling produced a similar upregulation in adhesion complex proteins, further suggesting a role for autocrine signalling. <b>Cetrorelix</b> increased the cellâcell adhesiveness of DU- 145 WT cells to an extent similar to that seen when autocrine EGFR signalling is blocked; as expected, DU- 145 A 654 cellâcell adhesion also was unaffected by <b>Cetrorelix.</b> The increased adhesiveness is expected as the adhesion complex molecules moved to the cells' periphery. These data offer direct insight into the possible crosstalk pathways between the LHRH and EGFR receptor signalling. The ability of <b>Cetrorelix</b> to downregulate EGFR signalling and subsequently reverse the antiadhesiveness found in metastatic prostate cancer highlights a novel potential target for therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} luteinizing hormone (LH) -releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists suppress pituitary gonadotroph functions and LHRH-receptor (LHRH-R) expression are incompletely understood. Consequently, we investigated the direct effect of LHRH antagonist <b>cetrorelix</b> in vitro on {{the expression of}} the pituitary LHRH-R gene and its ability to counteract the exogenous LHRH and the agonist triptorelin in the regulation of this gene. We also compared the effects of chronic administration of <b>cetrorelix</b> and triptorelin on the LHRH-R mRNA level and gonadotropin secretion in ovariectomized (OVX) and normal female rats. The exposure of pituitary cells in vitro to 3 -min pulses of 1 nM LHRH or 0. 1 nM triptorelin for 5 h increased the LHRH-R mRNA level by 77 â 88 %. Continuous perfusion of the cells with 50 nM <b>cetrorelix</b> did not cause any significant changes, but prevented the stimulatory effect of LHRH pulses on the receptor mRNA expression. In OVX rats, 10 days after administration of a depot formulation of <b>cetrorelix,</b> releasing 100 Î¼g of peptide daily, the elevated LHRH-R mRNA level was decreased by 73 %, whereas daily injection of 100 Î¼g of triptorelin caused a 41 % suppression. In normal female rats, <b>cetrorelix</b> treatment suppressed the LHRH-R mRNA level by 33 %, but triptorelin increased it by 150 %. The highly elevated serum LH levels in OVX rats and the normal LH concentration of cycling rats were rapidly and completely suppressed by <b>cetrorelix.</b> Triptorelin decreased the serum LH in OVX rats to the precastration level, but had no effect on basal LH in normal rats. Our results confirm that LHRH antagonists, such as <b>cetrorelix,</b> inhibit the gene expression of pituitary LHRH-R indirectly, by counteracting the stimulatory effect of LHRH.

METHODS: Multicentre, randomized study. One hundred and eighty two patients were randomized to receive <b>cetrorelix</b> with OC pretreatment (n = 91) or to receive buserelin (n = 91). The <b>cetrorelix</b> group started with daily OCs on cycle day 5 and continued for 21 - 28 days. <b>Cetrorelix</b> (0. 25 mg) was given daily from stimulation day 6 up to and including the day of r-hCG administration. The buserelin group started with buserelin (500 microg/day) for at least 10 days until down-regulation was achieved, after which the dose was reduced to daily 200 microg up to and including the day of r-hCG administration. r-hFSH was started in both groups on a Friday, in the <b>cetrorelix</b> group 5 days after the last OC pill intake. Both regimens were followed by a standard IVF or ICSI procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved per patient. RESULTS: Number of oocytes, cancellation rates, r-hFSH requirements, number of oocyte retrievals during the weekend or public holiday and number of pregnancies were similar in both groups.

40|$|Treatment with antagonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) {{leads to}} {{down-regulation}} of pituitary LH-RH receptors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LH-RH antagonist <b>cetrorelix</b> on the binding characteristics and subcellular localization of receptors for LH-RH in rat pituitaries. Radioligand binding studies, performed after in vitro desaturation, revealed that a single s. c. injection of <b>cetrorelix</b> at a dose of 100 Î¼g per rat significantly decreased the number of pituitary membrane receptors for LH-RH in a time-dependent manner with the nadir occurring at 6 h. In contrast, 2 â 6 h after <b>cetrorelix</b> treatment, the concentration of binding sites for LH-RH in the nuclei of rat pituitaries was significantly higher (P < 0. 01) than in controls. Chronic administration of <b>cetrorelix</b> also decreased the level of membrane receptors for LH-RH by 83 % (P < 0. 01) after 7 days, and 86 % (P < 0. 01) after 14 days. The number of LH-RH binding sites in the nuclear pellet was increased 3 -fold (P < 0. 01) by days 7 and 14 after the initiation of treatment with <b>cetrorelix.</b> A single injection or prolonged treatment with LH-RH antagonist also decreased the mRNA expression of pituitary receptors for LH-RH. Our results demonstrate that the down-regulation of LH-RH receptors on the cell membranes of rat pituitaries after therapy with antagonist <b>cetrorelix</b> is associated with an increase in receptor concentration in the nuclei.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} treatment of female rats with large doses of <b>Cetrorelix,</b> an antagonist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), reduces levels of serum LH, estradiol, progesterone, and the concentration of pituitary LHRH receptors (LHRH-Rs) and their mRNA expression. Serum LH and testosterone levels and pituitary LHRH-R in male rats are also decreased by high doses of <b>Cetrorelix.</b> This approach {{can be used for}} therapy of sex hormone-dependent cancers. However, in conditions where an incomplete hormone deprivation is indicated, lower doses of <b>Cetrorelix</b> may suffice. Thus, we investigated the effect of a 30 -day treatment with a low-dose depot formulation of <b>Cetrorelix</b> (20 - 24 Î¼g per kg per day) on the pituitary-gonadal axis of male and female rats. In both sexes, lower serum LH levels were observed on day 4 after administration. In males, LH returned to control levels by day 10, whereas in females, a rebound LH elevation occurred. Testosterone levels in male rats were decreased up to day 20, but on day 30, the values were similar to controls. In females, serum estradiol was reduced on day 4; however, by day 10 it returned to normal. Progesterone levels were diminished through the entire period.

The weights of testes and ovaries were significantly lower, but not the weights of prostate, seminal vesicles, and uterus. Pituitary LHRH-R mRNA and LHRH-R protein levels were not significantly different from the controls. Thus, the treatment with low doses of <b>Cetrorelix</b> did not seriously impair gonadal functions.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone acts via cell surface receptors {{but most}} human (h) GnRH receptors (GnRHRs) are intracellular.

Here we have quantified GnRHR by automated imaging in HeLa cells transduced with adenovirus expressing hemagglutinin-tagged GnRHR. Consistent with an intracellular site of action, IN 3 increases cell surface hGnRHR, and this effect is not blocked or mimicked by membrane-impermeant peptide antagonists [Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa- D 3 Pal-Ser-Tyr-D-Cit-Leu-Arg-Pro-D-Ala-NH 2 (<b>cetrorelix)</b> and antide]. However, when the C-terminal tail of a Xenopus (X) GnRHR was added (h.

Thus <b>cetrorelix</b> has effects other than GnRHR blockade; it acts as an inverse agonist in internalization assays, supporting the potential importance of ligand-biased efficacy at GnRHR. We also developed an imaging assay for GnRH function based on Ca 2 +-dependent nuclear translocation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells reporter. Using this in HeLa and L beta T 2 cells, IN 3 and <b>cetrorelix</b> behaved as competitive antagonists when coincubated with GnRH, and long-term pretreatment (16 h) with IN 3 reduced its effectiveness as an inhibitor whereas pretreatment with <b>cetrorelix</b> increased its inhibitory effect.

The HPLC method, {{which is used to}} determine <b>cetrorelix</b> in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms, was validated per ICH guidelines. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 reversed-phase column using acetonitrile, water and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as mobile phase and wavelength was set at 275 nm. The calibration curve was linear (r 2 = 0. 999) over <b>cetrorelix</b> concentrations ranging from 62. 50 to 12. 50 Âµg/mL (n = 6). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated from the peak-to-noise ratio as 15. 6 and 62. 5 Âµg/mL, respectively. The method had an accuracy of> 97 % and intra- and inter-day RSD of < 0. 3 % and < 1. 6 %, respectively and was validated with excellent specificity, sensitivity, and stability.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if the effect of llama OIF on LH secretion is mediated by stimulation of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Methods Using a 2 -by- 2 factorial design to examine the effects of OIF vs GnRH with or without a GnRH antagonist, llamas with a growing ovarian follicle greater than or equal to 8 mm were assigned randomly to four groups (n = 7 per group) and a) pre-treated with 1. 5 mg of GnRH antagonist (<b>cetrorelix</b> acetate) followed by 1 mg of purified llama OIF, b) pre-treated with 1. 5 mg of <b>cetrorelix</b> followed by 50 micrograms of GnRH, c) pre-treated with a placebo (2 ml of saline) followed by 1 mg of purified llama OIF or d) pre-treated with a placebo (2 ml of saline) followed by 50 micrograms of GnRH. Pre-treatment with <b>cetrorelix</b> or saline was given as a single slow intravenous dose 2 hours before intramuscular administration of either GnRH or OIF. Blood samples for LH measurement were taken every 15 minutes from 1. 5 hours before to 8 hours after treatment. The ovaries were examined by ultrasonography to detect ovulation and CL formation. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken every-other-day from Day 0 (day of treatment) to Day 16.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and {{pituitary}} gonadotropins, {{which appear}} to be proinflammatory, undergo profound secretory changes during events associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) onset, flares, or improvement e. g. menopausal transition, postpartum, or pregnancy. Potential anti-inflammatory effects of GnRH-antagonists may be most pronounced in patients with high GnRH and gonadotropin levels. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a GnRH-antagonist, <b>cetrorelix,</b> in RA patients with high gonadotropin levels. We report intention-to-treat post hoc analyses among patients with high gonadotropin levels (N = 53), i. e. gonadotropin levels>median, from our proof-of-concept, double-blind AGRA-study (N = 99). Patients with active longstanding RA, randomized to subcutaneous <b>cetrorelix</b> (5 mg days 1 - 2; 3 mg days 3 - 5) or placebo, were followed through day 15. Only predefined primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed. The primary endpoint, Disease Activity Score of 28 -joint counts with C-reactive protein (DAS 28 -CRP), improved with <b>cetrorelix</b> compared with placebo by day 5 (- 1. 0 vs. - 0. 4, P = 0 â 010). By day 5, more patients on <b>cetrorelix</b> achieved at least a 20 % improvement in the American College of Rheumatology scale (44 % vs. 19 %, P = 0. 049), DAS 28 -CRPâ¤ 3. 2 (24 % vs. 0 %, P = 0. 012), and European League against Rheumatism 'Good-responses' (19 % vs. 0 %, P = 0. 026). Tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin- 1 Î², interleukin- 10, and CRP decreased with <b>cetrorelix</b> (P = 0. 045, P = 0. 034, P = 0. 020 and P = 0. 042 respectively) compared with placebo by day 15. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. GnRH-antagonism produced rapid anti-inflammatory effects in RA patients with high gonadotropin levels. GnRH should be investigated further in RA.

40|$|The {{effects of}} depot {{formulations}} of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist Decapeptyl (25 Î¼g/day) for 30 days or LHRH antagonist <b>Cetrorelix</b> pamoate (100 Î¼g/day) for 30 days and daily injections of 100 Î¼g of Decapeptyl for 10 {{days on the}} expression of mRNA for pituitary LHRH receptor (LHRH-R) and the levels of LHRH-R protein were evaluated in rats. Serum sex steroid concentrations and the weights of the reproductive organs were greatly reduced in all groups treated with analogs, demonstrating an efficient blockade of the pituitaryâgonadal axis. Decapeptyl microcapsules elevated serum LH in female rats, but decreased it in male rats. LHRH-R mRNA expression in female pituitaries was reduced to 41 % and 56 â 65 % on days 10 and 30, respectively, whereas LHRH-R protein was 64 % of control on day 10 and returned to pretreatment levels on day 30. Decapeptyl microcapsules reduced LHRH-R mRNA expression in male pituitaries to 58 % on day 30 but not LHRH-R protein. Daily injections of Decapeptyl caused a desensitization of LH responses in female rats, while raising LHRH-R mRNA expression in female rats by 23 % and LHRH-R protein levels by 119 %. <b>Cetrorelix</b> pamoate reduced serum LH in female rats and diminished LHRH-R mRNA to 30 % and 26 % and LHRH-R protein to 57 % and 48 % on days 10 and 30, respectively. Elevated LHRH-R protein levels of ovariectomized rats were reduced after 10 -day treatment with <b>Cetrorelix</b> or 100 Î¼g/day Decapeptyl. Thus, changes in the mRNA expression after treatment with <b>Cetrorelix,</b> but not always Decapeptyl, paralleled those of LHRH-R protein. The inhibitory effect of <b>Cetrorelix</b> on serum LH, pituitary LHRH-R mRNA, and LHRH-R protein was {{greater than that of}} Decapeptyl...|$|E

Results: Ovulation rate was not different (P = 0. 89) between placebo+GnRH (86 %) and placebo+OIF groups (100 %); however, no ovulations were detected in llamas pre-treated with <b>cetrorelix.</b> Plasma LH concentrations surged (P < 0. 01) after treatment in both placebo+OIF and placebo+GnRH groups, but not in the <b>cetrorelix</b> groups. Maximum plasma LH concentrations and CL diameter profiles did not differ between the placebo-treated groups, but plasma progesterone concentrations were higher (P < 0. 05), on days 6, 8 and 12 after treatment, in the OIF- vs GnRH-treated group. Conclusion: <b>Cetrorelix</b> (GnRH antagonist) inhibited the preovulatory LH surge induced by OIF in llamas suggesting that LH secretion is modulated by a direct or indirect effect of OIF on GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus.
