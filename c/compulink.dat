50|$|In 1992, Compupress {{launched}} <b>CompuLink</b> {{the largest}} Bulletin Board System in Greece. Initially <b>CompuLink</b> {{was just a}} large SCO UNIX-based BBS running CoSy (the same system used by the British CIX) The <b>CompuLink</b> team developed and/or purchased on-line services for target-groups relating to the various computer magazines the company was publishing. Amongst its services was a full-text searching facility for {{a large number of}} Greek magazines (apart from Compupress' own), a number of on-line games (most notably Air Warrior and Federation II), an online database with scientific and business news, online access to a daily newspaper custom-made according to each users' preferences etc.|$|E

50|$|Since 1984, the NHRA officially uses <b>CompuLink</b> timing {{systems at}} venues on their {{professional}} drag racing circuit (includes the Christmas Tree, control units, timing sensors, cables, program software and time slip printer). Many divisional tracks {{for both the}} NHRA and IHRA also use <b>CompuLink,</b> but current timing system manufacturers of similar operations including Accutime, TSI, PortaTree and RaceAmerica among others {{can be seen at}} various drag strips throughout the world so long as these timing systems comply to rules and regulations set forth by the respective drag racing organizations for which they are members. There are still a few drag strips which continue to use the much older Chrondek timing system, although the company was sold to Daktronics in the 1980's and parts for that system are no longer made. Most drag racing time scoreboards currently seen at the tracks are provided by Daktronics or RaceAmerica.|$|E

50|$|In 1987, Kesmai (the {{company which}} {{developed}} Islands of Kesmai) released Air Warrior on GEnie. It was a graphical flight simulator/air combat game, initially using wire frame graphics, and could run on Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, or Commodore Amiga computers. Over time, Air Warrior {{was added to}} other online services, including Delphi, CRIS, CompuServe, America Online, Earthlink, GameStorm and <b>CompuLink.</b> Over time, Kesmai produced many improved versions of the game. In 1997, a backport from Windows to the Macintosh was made available as an open beta on the Internet. In 1999, Kesmai was purchased by Electronic Arts, which started running the game servers itself. The last Air Warrior servers were shut down on December 7, 2001.|$|E
5000|$|CIX (originally <b>Compulink</b> Information eXchange) is {{an online}} based {{conferencing}} discussion system {{and was one}} of the earliest British Internet service providers. Founded in 1983 by Frank and Sylvia Thornley, it began as a FidoNet bulletin board system, but in 1987 was relaunched commercially as CIX. At the core of the service were many thousands of [...] "conferences" [...] - groups established by users to discuss particular topics, conceptually not unlike newsgroups but limited to CIX subscribers (who sometimes describe themselves as 'Cixen'). These conferences still exist today although the CIX service has since expanded to include many other features. The service is funded by a monthly subscription charge rather than by advertising.|$|E
40|$|During 2002 - 2005 the {{assessment}} of possibilities for disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in Lithuania was performed with support of Swedish experts. Potential geological formations for disposal of SNF were selected, disposal concept was developed and preliminary generic safety assessment was performed. Performing safety assessment the analysis of radionuclides migration from the repository {{as well as their}} impact to human and environment were also very important issues. In this paper results on the analysis of the radionuclide releases from the near field of the geological repository for RBMK- 1500 SNF in crystalline rocks in Lithuania are presented. Radionuclide migration in the near field region was assessed using computer code <b>COMPULINK</b> 7 (SKB, Sweden) The results of analysis show that most of safety relevant radionuclides of RBMK- 1500 SNF are effectively retarded in the near field region. The release is dominated by 129 I and 59 Ni firstly while after app. 50 thousand years 226 Ra is dominating. The sensitivity analysis was also performed for the parameters that have direct influence on releases...|$|E
