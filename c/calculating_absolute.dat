40|$|International audienceReal-time {{embedded}} systems are becoming ever more complex. We are reaching {{the stage where}} even if static Response-Time Analysis (RTA) was feasible from a cost and technical perspective, the results of such an analysis are overly pessimistic. This makes them less useful to the practitioner. In addition, the temporal validation and verification of such systems in some applications, e. g., aeronautics, requires the probability of obtaining a worst-case response time larger than a given value {{in order to support}} dependable system functions. All these facts advocate moving toward statistical RTA, which instead of <b>calculating</b> <b>absolute</b> worst-case timing guarantees, computes a probabilistic worst-case response time estimate.

Furthermore, our analysis is applicable to real systems that are complex, e. g., from a task dependencies perspective...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNuclear Resonant Reaction Analysis (NRRA) is {{a common}} method {{detecting}} the nearsurface hydrogen distribution of a sample in a depth of up to a few microns. The mass density and related stopping power of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer depends on the hydrogen content. Correct hydrogen depth profiles are calculated considering the effective ion beam stopping crosssection {{as well as the}} related stopping power of the investigated film. The consideration of the local hydrogen concentration is important to avoid misinterpretations of the hydrogen distribution regarding profile depth. Therefore, stopping powers have to be considered carefully when interpreting hydrogen depth profiles especially of films that exhibit variations in hydrogen concentration. Moreover, further investigations like morphology dependent changes of the effective stoppingcross section are not possible without correctly calculated hydrogen depth profiles. Here the correct way is presented how to consider the embedded hydrogen of an a-Si:H layer when <b>calculating</b> <b>absolute</b> depth information of a NRRA measured hydrogen depth profile...|$|E
