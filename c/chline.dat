40|$|Lecithin {{preparation}} (glycerol : phosphorus : nitrogen : cholin= 1 : 1 : 1 : 0. 9) {{was isolated}} from the egg yolk by the Pangoorn's method. Using this preparation, three hydrolysis procedures were compared quantitatively on the choline determination. It was substantiated that the HCl-methanol was most excellent, and the NaOH-ethanol method was also available but the Ba(OH) 2 - ethanol method, providing only 50 % of the theoretical <b>chline</b> value, {{was found to be}} inadequate as a quantitative hydrolysis method of an almost pure lecithin preparation...|$|E
