The carbohydrate moiety of these proteins {{is thought to}} interfere with the thiobarbiturate (TBA) and nitroblue tetrazolium <b>colorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> which are used for assaying non-enzymatic glycosylation (NEG) of serum proteins. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the effect of the APR on the specificity of the <b>colorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> in non-diabetic and diabetic subjects. A positive correlation was found between C-reactive protein (CRP), an APR glycoprotein, and non-specific TBA reactivity as determined after borohydride reduction (BH 4 -resistant TBA, BR-TBA), both in non-diabetics (r= 0. 61;P< 0. 01) and diabetics (r= 0. 68;P< 0. 01). The BH 4 -sensitive specific TBA (SP-TBA) was not influenced by glycoproteins, and its increase in diabetics was correlated with the nitroblue tetrazolium assay (r= 0. 89;P< 0. 01). An independant effect of diabetes and APR on non-specific TBA was also demonstrated, suggesting an effect of hyperglycaemia on both protein glycation and glycosylation.

It is an acid hydrolysis, which splits larger chain units (dimers and trimers) into single unit monomers and oxidizes them. This leads to a colour change, which can be measured using a spectrophotometer. The greater the absorbance at a certain wavelength of light, the greater the potency.

40|$|The {{validity}} of different colorimetric {{methods used to}} quantify various families of antioxidant compounds was evaluated with standard compounds. The colorimetric tests for global evaluation of flavonoids, anthocyans, and flavanols were found generally unreliable, as reactions could be different for individual compounds within a family (anthocyanins or flavonols or flavan- 3 -ols) and not specific to one family. In the flavonoid test, for example, flavonols reacted very well, anthocyanins did not react, and flavanons reacted only slightly. The same methods were applied also to beverages known for their antioxidant content (apple, orange, grape, and vegetable juices, ice tea, and red wine) and the data were compared {{with the results of}} HPLC analysis of specific compounds. The values obtained in a <b>colorimetric</b> <b>test</b> were generally higher than the sum of the values obtained for the corresponding individual compounds by HPLC analysis, mainly because other compounds can interfere with the colorimetric tests. For example, in wine, anthocyanin concentrations obtained by <b>colorimetric</b> <b>test</b> were 9068  1407 µ mol / 100 ml (mean  SEM), higher than the sum of the six main anthocyanidins detected by HPLC, only 41 µmol/ 100 ml. The relative antioxidant capacity values determined for beverages on the basis of colorimetric tests could exceed by far the values previously measured in radical-scavenging tests (for instance, the antioxidant capacity attributable to anthocyans in wine {{on the basis of the}} <b>colorimetric</b> <b>test</b> was 50 times higher than the total antioxidant capacity measured by the ORAC assay). In conclusion, colorimetric tests for flavonoids, anthocyans, and flavanols appeared generally unreliable for estimating their content and thus the antioxidant capacity reliable to these compounds.

The initial experimental work involved identification of suitable LED’s for detection of various analytes in water.

To assess the burden and risk factors of {{schistosomiasis}} and intestinal parasitic helminthes in the children of Cubal, Angola, and to compare different diagnostic approaches for urinary schistosomiasis under field conditions. A cross-sectional study was conducted. Urine and faeces samples of school children were microscopically studied.
