The main church is Agios Charalambos {{located near the}} nice neighbourhood of “Halliliana”. There is an annual celebration for the name day of the church. Until recently the village {{did not have any}} modern roads but today it can be reached via a narrow modern asphalt <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> from one side leading to the nearby town of Paleochora. The north approach to the village demanded a 4x4 off-road car or other durable vehicle up till the end of 2008 when a new asphalt <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> was constructed. This has protected the area and the environment has remained calm and unspoiled.|$|E

50|$|Shed Road, {{the first}} {{all-weather}} turnpike in the American South, {{was constructed in}} the 1870s and operated from 1874 to 1886. It extended for 9 mi from Red Chute to the Red River. There was a plantation {{at the end of}} the elevated and covered roadway, which was reached by a ferry boat. The <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> made the transportation of goods easier before the arrival of the railroads.|$|E

50|$|A glacis, a <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> and half-moons {{prolonged}} the fortifications on the landward side. The parapets were redesigned {{and given}} plunging embrasures. To form a vast artillery platform, the tour Duchesse Anne and the tour Nord were linked {{by a new}} work. Only the tours Paradis retained the medieval appearance. The curtain walls were widened, and a fausse-braie built to reinforce the wall between tour Madeleine and the tours Paradis against artillery fire. Batteries {{at the mouth of}} the goulet, at Camaret and Bertheaume, were also built. The interventions of Vauban were the last major stage in the castle's evolution.|$|E

Bubba Ray then <b>covered</b> <b>Road</b> Dogg to win the WWF Tag Team Championship for his team.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} weeks of April, O'Neill's Irish scouts reconnoitered the Pensacola fortifications. The redoubt {{farthest}} from the city was the Crescent. Next distant was the Sombrero, followed by Fort George. The Spanish troops established encampments and began extensive preparations for a siege. Hundreds of engineers and laborers brought supplies and armaments to the battlefield. The engineers also dug trenches, and built bunkers and redoubts, besides constructing a <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> to shield the troops from the constant fire of grapeshot, grenades, and cannonballs. On April 12, Gálvez himself was wounded while viewing the British fortifications. Battlefield command was formally transferred to Colonel José de Ezpeleta, a personal friend of Gálvez.|$|E
50|$|Vigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492-94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), {{the great}} patron {{born in the}} town, who {{transformed}} the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is ascribed with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised <b>covered</b> <b>road,</b> high enough for horsemen to ride through, that communicates between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d'Este.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, Mill Creek, {{was lined}} with cement and <b>covered.</b> <b>Roads</b> and {{buildings}} were constructed over it and about one-third of a mile of Mill Creek flows below the surface today.

50|$|Cycle News {{was founded}} in 1965, in Long Beach, California by Chuck and Sharon Clayton. Chuck Clayton {{purchased}} a troubled Los Angeles-area motorcycling newspaper and {{changed its name to}} Cycle News. The Claytons initially ran Cycle News out of their living room. Chuck worked exclusively on the newspaper, relying on Sharon’s income at JR Engineering to support the family and keep Cycle News afloat. On evenings and weekends, Sharon handled the business side of the newspaper, and worked as a photographer and reporter. The Clayton family provided coverage of local and international races, and was a key source for racing results. Cycle News <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> racing, off-road, motocross, supercross, enduro, flat track, speedway, and drag racing, which appealed to a broad range of motorcycle enthusiasts. Cycle News eventually became one of the highest selling newspapers/magazines in the industry, and it had offices on the East and West coasts during its 45-year history.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the French {{were driven}} out by Spanish {{auxiliaries}} soon afterwards, but about 30 men {{held out the}} entire night. The Duke of Monmouth (commander of the English forces fighting on the French side), was colonel of The Blues, and trench general. The serving battalion officer, Sir Henry Jones, formerly a Catholic exile, was like the Anglicans enraged at having to fight fellow Protestants. Moreover half their contingent were Dutchmen, pledged to go into battle against their countrymen. [...] Unsurprisingly, they refused to fight, and resorted to rounding up deserters; Jones recruited his own regiment (the English Regiment of Light Horse in France), yet {{was killed in the}} siege. Until that time, Monmouth was accompanied by a young Captain John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough), tried to take a <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> protecting the moat, and withdrew after suffering the loss of 300 men. It was Captain Churchill who planted a flag on the outwork.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{there was}} {{considerable}} opposition from inhabitants of the suburb {{to the construction of}} the Hymettus ring road (Motorway 64). The ring road was to form a major highway on the mountainside linked directly to the Motorway 6, and the construction of both motorways were to commence immediately. The realization that this plan would demand the felling of a considerable number of trees, as well as spurring an increase in noise pollution, predictably aroused the opposition of the local population, who requested a different solution: a <b>covered</b> <b>road.</b> However, the government would not reverse the decision and, in fact, sent bulldozers to the mountainside. This led to a riot in April, 1993. Thousands of people travelled up the mountainside and faced the bulldozers, forcing the drivers to leave. At length police arrived and managed to force the demonstrators off the site; eventually the construction of the two highways began, and was completed in 2001. The road was covered only at a small section, that running over the Deree College.|$|E

50|$|Tanenbaum is {{currently}} Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as President & CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction Kilmer {{developed into a}} multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries <b>covered</b> <b>road</b> building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer’s road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer’s wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited. Tanenbaum served as Chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada’s largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren’s activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, liquid asphalt trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America’s largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As {{a result of this}} merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the Board and chaired its Finance Committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA. Kilmer today manages infrastructure investments through Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund LP, Quickload CEF Inc., Host Kilmer Service Centres Inc. (ONroute), and DundeeKilmer (PanAm Village Development).|$|E
