5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on <b>cold</b> <b>surfaces,</b> making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

40|$|Polythermal glaciers, i. e. glaciers with a {{combination}} of ice at and below the freezing point, are widespread in arctic and subarctic environments. The polythermal structure has major implications for glacier hydrology, ice flow and glacial erosion. However, the interplay of factors governing its spatial and temporal variations such as net mass balance, ice advection and water content in the ice is poorly investigated and as yet not fully understood. This study deals with a thorough investigation of the polythermal regime on Storglaciären, northern Sweden, a small valley glacier with a <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer in the ablation area. Extensive field work was performed including mapping of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer using ground-penetrating radar, ice temperature measurements, mass balance and ice velocity measurements. Analyses of these data combined with numerical modelling were used specifically to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer, the spatial distribution of the water content just below the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer transition, the effect of radar frequency on the detection of the surface layer, and the sensitivity of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer to changes in forcing. A comparison between direct temperature measurements in boreholes and ground-penetrating surveys shows that the radar-inferred cold-temperate transition depth is within ± 1 m from the melting point of ice at frequencies above ~ 300 MHz. At frequencies below ~ 155 MHz, the accuracy degrades because of reduced scattering efficiency that occurs when the scatterers become much smaller compared to the wavelength. The mapped spatial pattern of the englacial cold-temperate transition boundary is complex. This pattern reflects the observed spatial variation in net loss of ice at the surface by ablation and vertical advection of ice, which is suggested to provide the predominant forcing of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer thickness pattern. This is further supported by thermomechanical modeling of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer, which indicates high sensitivity of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer thickness to changes in vertical advection rates. The water content is the least investigated quantity that is relevant for the thermal regime of glaciers, but also the most difficult to assess. Spatial variability of absolute water content in the temperate ice immediately below the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer on Storglaciären was determined by combining relative estimates of water content from ground-penetrating radar data with absolute determination from temperature measurements and the thermal boundary condition at the freezing front. These measurements indicate large-scale spatial variability in the water content, which seems to arise from variations in entrapment of water at the firn-ice transition. However, this variability cannot alone explain the spatial pattern in the thermal regime on Storglaciären. Repeated surveys of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer show a 22 % average thinning of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer on Storglaciären between 1989 and 2001. Transient thermomechanical modeling results suggest that the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer adapts to new equilibrium conditions in only a few decades after a perturbation in the forcing is introduced. An increased winter air temperature since mid- 1980 s seems to be the cause of the observed thinning of the <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer. Over the last decades, mass balance measurements indicate that the glacier has been close to a steady state. The quasi-steady state situation is also reflected in the vertical advection, which shows no significant changes during the last decades. Increased winter temperatures at the ice surface would result in a slow-down of the formation of cold ice {{at the base of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> layer and lead to a larger imbalance between net loss of ice at the surface and freezing of temperate ice at the cold-temperate transition...|$|R

The heat transfer coefficient was determined as a function of time using the hybrid gage output only through a reference state approach.

Experiments were performed in the cone calorimeter at different heat fluxes to quantify the incident heat flux, net heat flux, heat transfer coefficient, <b>cold</b> <b>surface</b> heat flux, and adiabatic surface temperature as a function of time.

50|$|Through {{a process}} known as condensation, {{atmospheric}} water vapour from the air naturally condenses on <b>cold</b> <b>surfaces</b> into droplets of liquid water known as dew.
