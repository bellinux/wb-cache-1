5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, <b>Conker</b> and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture <b>Conker.</b> In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for <b>Conker,</b> but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes <b>Conker</b> aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill <b>Conker</b> as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. <b>Conker</b> pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After <b>Conker</b> briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. <b>Conker</b> expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give <b>Conker</b> a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Live & Reloaded, Rare began work on another game in the <b>Conker</b> {{universe}} titled Conker: Gettin' Medieval. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature <b>Conker</b> as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled. <b>Conker</b> returned in a new episodic campaign for the sandbox game Project Spark. The campaign, titled Conker's Big Reunion, is set {{ten years after the}} events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. Conker's Bad Fur Day is also included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001. As {{part of the}} <b>Conker</b> video game series, the game follows the story of <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel, a greedy, heavy-drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.|$|E

5|$|<b>Conker</b> the Squirrel {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: <b>Conker</b> 64. However, the new title was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until <b>Conker</b> earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 Scott Henson {{announced}} that Craig Duncan, {{who had worked}} on Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and the Colin McRae Rally series, was hired as senior studio director. Simon Woodroffe, who had worked at several studios (including Adventure Soft, Midway Games, Ubisoft, and Sega), became the studio's creative director in April 2012. A Rare property, Killer Instinct, was revived in 2013. The company had a supporting role in its development, assisting lead developer Double Helix Games. Another Rare mascot, <b>Conker,</b> was also featured in another Microsoft game, Project Spark as episodic downloadable content. Known as Conker's Big Reunion, it was cancelled in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Game {{development}} costs gradually increased, and Nintendo {{did not provide}} Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. According to Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper, they were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare then looked for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. Rare was interested in Activision's offer, but the deal collapsed and on 24 September 2002 Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as <b>Conker</b> of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.|$|E
5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Diddy Kong Racing, {{their first}} self-published game. Originally {{intended as a}} real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It {{was one of the}} fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including Banjo and <b>Conker.</b> At the time, Rare was still working on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed , it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo, and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. Banjo-Kazooie was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, Banjo Tooie, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Timber {{recruits}} a team {{of eight}} racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear, recruited by Diddy; Krunch the Kremling, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup the Turtle, T.T. the Stopwatch, Pipsy the Mouse, and Bumper the Badger, inhabitants of Timber's island. Aided by Taj, an Indian elephant-like genie residing on the island, they eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Drumstick is turned back into a rooster, and Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.|$|E

25|$|In 1952 {{he joined}} the BBC as a {{publicity}} officer, but he was keen to make programmes, and {{he made his first}} appearance on television running a nationwide <b>conker</b> competition, and thence became a familiar face on children's TV with his programme All Your Own. Future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page was a guest on his show in 1957.|$|E
500|$|Conker's {{abilities}} are far simpler {{than those of}} previous Rare platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. <b>Conker</b> also has a few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, climb ladders or ropes, and {{is strong enough to}} push heavy objects. To regain lost health, <b>Conker</b> can eat pieces of [...] "anti-gravity" [...] Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads that allow <b>Conker</b> to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the [...] "B" [...] button atop them. For instance, {{in the beginning of the}} game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, <b>Conker</b> drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn <b>Conker</b> into an anvil to slam into the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.|$|E
500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{follows the}} story of <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel, a red {{squirrel}} who embarks on a quest simply to return home to his girlfriend, Berri, {{after a night of}} binge drinking with his friends. Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that <b>Conker</b> is lost in, finds that his throne's side table is missing one of its legs and orders his paraplegic weasel servant, Professor Von Kriplespac, to solve the problem. Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg for his table, and therefore the Panther King sends his minions to search for one and capture it. As <b>Conker</b> searches for his way home, he finds himself embroiled in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations, including having to recover a bee hive from some enormous wasps, fighting a Terminator-like robot in a barn, confronting a giant opera-singing pile of feces, being turned into a bat by a vampire, and even getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a Nazi-like group of teddy bears known as the [...] "Tediz," [...] which <b>Conker</b> ultimately destroys. During his quest to return home, <b>Conker</b> finds wads of cash scattered throughout the land and becomes sidetracked from his goal.|$|E

50|$|Robin Beanland (born 27 August 1968 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England), is a British {{composer}} {{of video}} game music, composing music for numerous Rare titles, {{such as the}} Killer Instinct franchise, <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day (which he also co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Seavor), and many others. Prior to joining Rare, Beanland composed music for T.V. and films.|$|R
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, <b>Conker</b> realizes {{that he should have}} brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out to bring her back to life, only to realize that they have left already. <b>Conker</b> then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards <b>Conker</b> is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day was {{developed}} by Rare and directed by Chris Seavor. The game was announced to be in development at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997, under the title Conker's Quest. A year later, {{it was revealed that}} the game's title was changed to Twelve Tales: <b>Conker</b> 64 and players would be able to control <b>Conker</b> in action-based settings and Berri in strategy-based settings, with the possibility of two player split-screen gameplay. Early screenshots suggested that the game would be targeted at a family audience and feature cute characters and colourful settings. Rare had a history of making games of this sort and at first Twelve Tales: <b>Conker</b> 64 appeared to be similar. However, Rare was influenced by a critical reception of the prototype game's cuteness, resulting in a game design overhaul. The fact that the game was delayed several times and not mentioned for almost a year led to speculation that the game was quietly cancelled. Rare later clarified that the game was [...] "still being worked on by a full team and with the same level of dedication as when it was first announced." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Conker's Bad Fur Day, Rare began {{development}} of a direct sequel referred to as Conker's Other Bad Day. Chris Seavor revealed that the game would deal with [...] "Conker's somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King. He spends all the treasured money on beer, parties and hookers. Thrown into prison, <b>Conker</b> is {{faced with the prospect}} of execution and the game starts with his escape, ball and chain attached, from the Castle's highest tower." [...] In 2002, however, Rare was purchased by Microsoft, who told them they were not interested in such a project.|$|E
50|$|The final boss is a boss that is at, or near, {{the end of}} the game, with {{completion}} of the game's storyline usually following victory in the battle. Usually, they are the main antagonist of the game, however, there are exceptions, such as in <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day, where the final boss is the antagonist's alien pet.|$|R
5|$|<b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day {{was awarded}} the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for sound, IGN's Game of the Month for March 2001, and GameSpot's Best Platform Game for 2001. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine placed <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever, and GameTrailers rated it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games. In 2010, UGO {{included}} the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings. Although the game fared well with critics in both the United Kingdom and United States, it sold worse than expected (only about 55,000 copies as of April 2001), partly due to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release {{towards the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nevertheless, the game has enjoyed a cult following due to its unique styling.|$|R
50|$|Conker: Live & Reloaded is a {{platform}} video game developed by Rare and exclusively released for the Xbox in June 2005. The single player mode is {{a remake of}} the 2001 game <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day for the Nintendo 64. However, it includes a new multiplayer mode {{that is different from}} the Nintendo 64 version utilising Xbox Live. Development started the moment the studio was bought by Microsoft in 2002.|$|R
500|$|Due to Banjo-Kazooie being {{delayed until}} {{the summer of}} 1998, the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video game in time for Christmas 1997. Rare felt that Pro Am 64 {{did not have a}} strong enough {{intellectual}} property to capture the attention of consumers, and thus changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong. According to Musgrave, the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice, a decision which Nintendo [...] "enjoyed". Once the intellectual property was changed, the team were left to adapt the visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released. Musgrave stated that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it [...] "run as fast" [...] as Mario Kart 64, which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilised sprites of characters whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully 3D models. Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall project due to the [...] "small team" [...] of 14 people who worked on it. In an October 2012 interview, Musgrave stated that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character of Pro Am 64 had the intellectual property for Diddy Kong Racing not been conceived. At least two of the characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo the Bear and <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel, went on to feature in their own series, the Banjo-Kazooie series and <b>Conker</b> series, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{commentary}} on the compilation focused on Rare's choice of selections and concluded that players new and old would find enough new treasures to outweigh the duds. Reviewer favorites included Blast Corps, , the Viva Piñata games, and the Nintendo 64 classics (especially Banjo-Kazooie, <b>Conker,</b> and Perfect Dark). Among the least favorites were Perfect Dark Zero, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, and the early Spectrum games, which reviewers felt had aged the worst. Ars Technica, however, defended the Spectrum titles for showing an experimental and unrefined side of Rare. Many critics regretted the implacable licensing issues {{that led to the}} exclusion of what they considered the company's best games—Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007, and Diddy Kong Racing— while others felt that the package was fine without them. Also omitted were Rare's Super Nintendo-era games, [...] "Mario Kart clones", Nintendo franchise releases, and Kinect Sports series. These timeline gaps precluded, for instance, the player from understanding <b>Conker</b> as an edgy response to the [...] "cutesy" [...] characters of preceding Nintendo games. Despite these absences, Ars Technica critic was impressed by Microsoft's ability to license from publishers including Tradewest, Nintendo, Milton Bradley, and Electronic Arts. Eurogamer reviewer was surprised by Rare's consistent style across the selections, and compared the company's legacy to that of Cosgrove Hall Films. The Kotaku reviewer saw Rare Replay as [...] "image rehabilitation" [...] that would hopefully mark Rare's return to making [...] "deep and daring games" [...] in line with their historical reputation.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Grabbed by the Ghoulies began {{after the release}} of Conker's Bad Fur Day. The idea for the game began with the name, which is a pun on [...] "goolies", a British slang term for [...] "testicles". According to designer Gregg Mayles, {{the name of the game}} materialised after he overheard someone mention [...] "being grabbed by the goolies", and thought that it would make a suitable name for an upcoming Rare game. Before any details of the game were publicised, it was rumoured that Grabbed by the Ghoulies would be the subtitle to the next <b>Conker</b> the Squirrel game. After Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million in 2002, {{development of}} the game for the GameCube was delayed until Rare converted it to the Xbox console.|$|E
50|$|Nintendo 64 Game Pak (NUS-006) are ROM {{cartridges}} {{that store}} game {{data for the}} Nintendo 64. Their sizes vary from 4 MiB (32 Mbit; e.g. Automobili Lamborghini and Dr. Mario 64) to 64 MiB (512 Mbit; e.g. Resident Evil 2 and <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day). The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game.|$|R
5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|R
5|$|Upon release, <b>Conker's</b> Bad Fur Day {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game journalists, who praised its visual appeal and smart, funny humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release {{towards the end}} of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a cult following due to its unique styling. A remake, , was released for the Xbox in 2005. In 2015, the game was included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.|$|R
