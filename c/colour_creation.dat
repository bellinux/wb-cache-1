It deals with the possible functions of the coloration (antipredator, social, thermoregulation) and its creation. Further it is {{an overview of the}} works about juvenile coloration that deal with hypotheses about the function which the juvenile coloration in lizards performs. There are also mechanisms of juvenile coloration and influencing factors mentioned. The thesis includes an experimental part dealing with various coloration characters of juvenile and adult Eublepharidae. We chose several characters: striped tail of the juveniles, striped body of the juveniles, light stripe on the head of the juveniles, striped tail of the adults, striped body of the adults, light stripe on the head of the adults. On several phylogenetic trees we evaluated whether these are the derived characters. After comparing the trees it turned out {{that in the case of}} juvenile coloration it is probably an ancestral character. In the case of adult pattern we have not reached a clear conclusion. Key words: juvenile coloration, ontogenetic color change, lizard...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} {{of a commercial}} hardwood mechanical pulp, E. regnans stone groundwood, to alkaline peroxide bleaching has been studied by examining the kinetics of the bleaching process under conditions of constant reagent concentrations. Several kinetic models have been tested {{for their ability to}} describe the observed kinetic behaviour in terms of a minimum number of chemically meaningful parameters. A previously reported kinetic model, developed to describe the peroxide bleaching of softwoods, was found to be inadequate. As a consequence, two new kinetic models have been proposed, both of which are defined in terms of first order processes. The first model type assumes two distinct categories of chromophores which are eliminated to give colourless products. The chromophoric groups are divided into peroxide susceptible or peroxide resistant groups {{on the basis of their}} kinetic behaviour. The second model type assumes a single class of chromophores which are eliminated to give colourless products and potential chromophores. In this 'equilibrium' model, chromophore elimination is opposed by a chromophore creation route arising from conversion of potential chromophores to chromophores. An understanding of the main chemical processes occurring in peroxide bleaching has been achieved by analysing the behaviour of pseudo-first order rate constants for each model. Both of the proposed models are able to describe a number of kinetic features observed under constant reagent concentrations, such as a maximum in the rate of bleaching in the pH 11 - 12 range. However, only the model containing a reversible step can describe the full range of experimental behaviour observed when reagent concentrations are altered during bleaching, suggesting that colour formation is an important process during alkaline peroxide bleaching. The kinetics of reactions between alkaline peroxide and model lignin chromophores have been examined to lend further interpretation to the kinetic models developed for the bleaching of pulp. Cinnamaldehyde has been studied as a model for a,ß ­unsaturated aldehyde chromophores while the reactions of ortho quinone chromophores have been investigated using 4 -tert-butylorthoquinone as a model. Reactions with cinnamaldehyde have shown that a,ß-unsaturated aldehydes are readily attacked by perhydroxyl anions (H 02 -) to give colourless epoxide intermediates. The epoxides are further degraded to benzaldehyde derivatives leading to an irreversible removal of colour. Reactions between alkaline peroxide and 4 -tertbutylorthoquinone indicate that ortho quinones undergo competing colour removing and <b>colour</b> <b>creation</b> reactions with perhydroxyl anions and hydroxide ions respectively. The <b>colour</b> <b>creation</b> processes result in the formation of peroxide resistant hydroxy para quinones which lead to incomplete removal of colour during bleaching. The kinetic behaviour of model a,ß -unsaturated aldehydes and ortho quinones can be related to the reaction steps in the two chromophore kinetic model described previously, and can explain certain kinetic features observed during the bleaching of pulp. However, the process of chromophore formation contained in the equilibrium kinetic model was not observed in studies on model a,ß unsaturated aldehydes and ortho quinones, and further work is required to identify possible colour causing reactions under peroxide bleaching conditions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{enhances the}} {{capability}} to reproduce multi-coloured images in woven Jacquard forms where weave structure and pattern design were considerably involved in fabrication. In modern weaving, great convenience and efficiencies were established in both production and design process through digitalisation, while the colour adoption has been constrained as the applicable number of figuring yarns were limited. The enhancement toward colour realisation is traditionally related to weaving capability. Surface colour display is dominated by additive, subtractive or optical mixing (Mathur, 2007). An additive colour system offers the largest gamut among output models yet, the light mixing principle is not suitable to apply to weave <b>colour</b> <b>creation.</b> Pre-dyed opaque yarns are used and juxtaposed; small particles of yarn colours reflect lights and they were observed as a certain form of colour. The common and crucial criterial pertinent to an optical mixing of weave colours were aligned more with the subtractive mixing principle. A weave pattern was designed by subtractive primary colour classification and a multi-weft figuring method. Secondary colours are theoretically produced when coupled CMY layers are mixed(i. e., cyan + magenta = blue, cyan + yellow = green, magenta + yellow = red) and black is generated when all CMY primaries are mixed (Berns, 2000);however, non-bendable colours of threads are employed for colour reproduction in weaving {{and there is a}} limit to adopt a pigment mixing principle in the woven form. Therefore, each weave pattern required a modification to redefine primary colour regions and densities once an original artwork was separated and presented in greyscales levels. The weave patterns in an original subtractive scheme were altered by applying region-based segmentation to maximise the accessible colour gamut. In this study, the weaving application developed for the multi-coloured image was introduced and the design process was explained based on a practical experiment proceeded with a newly developed weaving application...|$|E

He pioneered more daring art glass designs at Orrefors and together with Edvin Öhrström and Knut Bergqvist he invented the Ariel technique. In 1950 he joined Kosta Glasbruk as an artistic director before his retirement in 1973. At Kosta, he was the dominant designer, lending his name to many now classic designs. At this point, Lindstrand began to inject more and more <b>colour</b> into his <b>creations,</b> which resulted in iconic designs such as Trees in the Fog and Autumn. He spent the last 10 {{years of his life}} as a freelance artist working with Hanne Dreutler and Arthur Zirrnsack at Studio Glashyttan in Åhus.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of the Belle Heures occurred before the Renaissance of the late 15th and early 16th century when it moved from Italy to other European states. Millard Meiss describes the Belles Heures, and the Très Riches Heures that followed it, are the most impressive group of paintings produced in Europe {{in the early part}} of the 15th century. The bright colours predate the similar style to emerge from Italy closer to the middle of the 15th century. Luminous colours used in the Belle Heures entered the mainstream of 15th-century paintings. Not long after its <b>creation,</b> <b>colour</b> began to fade in importance and dark hues and shadowing began to emerge in the late 15th century. Thus, the Belle Heures was one of the last few manuscripts to be coloured in this manner.|$|R

What the Greeks {{did for the}} horse, and what, as far {{as regards}} {{domestic}} and expressional character, Landseer has done for the dog and the deer, {{remains to be done}} by art for nearly all other animals of high organisation. There are few birds or beasts that have not a range of character which, if not equal to that of the horse or dog, is yet as interesting within narrower limits, and often in grotesqueness, intensity, or wild and timid pathos, more singular and mysterious. Whatever love of humour you have,--whatever sympathy with imperfect, but most subtle, feeling,--whatever perception of sublimity in conditions of fatal power, may here find fullest occupation: all these being joined, in the strong animal races, to a variable and fantastic beauty far beyond anything that merely formative art has yet conceived. I have placed in your Educational series a wing by Albert Dürer, which goes as far as art yet has reached in delineation of plumage; while for the simple action of the pinion it is impossible to go beyond what has been done already by Titian and Tintoret; but you cannot so much as once look at the rufflings of the plumes of a pelican pluming itself after {{it has been in the}} water, or carefully draw the contours of the wing either of a vulture or a common swift, or paint the rose and vermilion on that of a flamingo, without receiving almost a new conception of the meaning of form and <b>colour</b> in <b>creation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{responses}} can incite and entice {{consumers to}} select a particular product from a row of similar items and thus have a considerable impact on purchase decisions. Consequently, more and more companies are challenging designers to address the emotional impact of their work and to design for emotion and consumerproduct relationships. Furthermore, the creation of emotional attachment to one’s possessions {{is one way of}} approaching a sustainable consumer-product relationship. The aim of this research is to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} instantaneous emotional attachment that consumers form with products and its subsequent implications for product development. The foci of the study are visceral design, consumer hedonics and product rhetoric. Studied in a conglomerate they become an area of new investigation: visceral hedonic rhetoric. In this context, the term “visceral hedonic rhetoric” is defined as the properties of a product that persuasively elicit the pursuit of pleasure at an instinctual level of cognition. This study explores visceral hedonic rhetoric evident in the design of interactive products and resides within the context of emotional design research. It employs an empirical approach to understand how consumers respond hedonically on a visceral level to rhetoric in products. Specifically, it examines visceral hedonic responses given by thirty participants to the stimuli of six mobile telephones, six Mp 3 players and six USB memory flash drives. The study findings demonstrate a hierarchy of visceral hedonic rhetoric evident in interactive products. This hierarchy of visceral hedonic attributes include: colour, size, shape, intrigue, material, perceived usability, portability, perceived function, novelty, analogy, brand, quality, texture and gender. However, it is the interrelationships between these visceral hedonic attributes that are the most significant findings of this research. Certain associations were revealed between product attribute combinations and consumer perception. The most predominant of these were: gender bias associated with <b>colour</b> selection; the <b>creation</b> of intrigue through a vibrant attention-grabbing colour; perceived ease of use and function; product confidence as a result of brand familiarity and perceived usability; analogous association through familiarity with similar objects and shapes; and the association of longevity with quality, novelty or recent technology. A significant outcome of the research is the distillation of visceral hedonic rhetoric design principles, and a tool to assist designers in harnessing the full potential of visceral hedonic rhetoric. This study contributes to the identification of the emerging research field of visceral hedonic rhetoric. Application of this study’s findings has the potential to provide a hedonic consumer-product relationship that is more meaningful, less disposable and more sustainable. This theory of visceral hedonic rhetoric is not only a significant contribution to design knowledge but is also generally transferable to other research domains, as later suggested in future research avenues...|$|R
40|$|This thesis re-approaches medieval {{literature}} {{in terms of}} its investment in visuality in general and chromatic perception in particular. The introduction raises the philosophical problem off-colour: its status as an object for science, role in perception, and relationship to language and meaning as expressed within inter-subjective evaluation. Two modes of discourse for colour studies of medieval literature are proposed: the phenomenological (from the philosophical tradition of such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty) seeking localised networks and patterns of inter-subjective, embodied, perceptual meanings and values; and linguistic (informed by the philosophical psychology and language philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein), focusing on the lexicalisation of <b>colour</b> experience and <b>creation</b> of semantic distinctions corresponding with changing colour concepts, which in turn shape individual perceptions (both first-hand experience and that of reading). Part One introduces key medieval ideas and theories pertaining to visual perception in general, and chromatic perception in particular. The authority for, and influence on medieval writers of Plato's Timaeus, Aristotle's De Anima and Parva Naturalia, and relevant biblical material is considered. Subsequent chapters explore Patristic and Neo-Platonist developments in extramissive thought, locating within this tradition the roots of a synthesis of natural philosophy with Christian theology that is found in later medieval thought and its dealings with perception and colour. A key movement in the theology of light in relation to colour is connected to the wider philosophical movement from largely "extramissive" to largely "intromissive" models of perception. This shift in theory and its significance for colour perception is explained in terms of the impact of Aristotle's material colour theory as found in De anima and the De sensti et sensato section of his Parva Naturalia from the late twelfth century onwards. The part concludes with a detailed study of the nineteenth chapter of Bartholomaeus Anglicus's thirteenth-century encyclopedia, De Proprietatibus Rerum, which provides access to an important range of ideas and sources relevant for accessing the medieval mind in its intellectualized perception of colour. Lastly, such philosophical and theological sources and ideas as are found in Part One are compared with relevant examples from literary texts, ranging from the Middle English poem, The Parliament of the Three Ages, to Christine de Pisan's Le Livre de la Cite des Dames. Part Two treats colour perception in relation to a particular medieval phenomenon: the rise of medieval heraldry and the armorial function of the herald. It considers the spiritual and secular ideologies of chivalry and their relationship to armorial displays as found portrayed and construed in various genres of chivalric literature. Texts under discussion include books of chivalry and arms from the early thirteenth to fourteenth centuries, such as those principally indebted to New Testament armorial allegory and motif (from writers such as Ramon Llull to Geoffrey de Charny), to later fourteenth-century treatises employing Aristotle’s De sensu et sensato to establish a secular hierarchy of chivalric colours. The study culminates with Part Three, offering responses to and discussions of particular medieval fictions in terms of their phenomenological, linguistic and intertextual treatment of colour perception. Medieval texts addressed include, amongst others, Le Roman de la Rose by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, and four Middle English metrical romances: Sir Gowther, Sir Amadace, Sir Launfal and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.
