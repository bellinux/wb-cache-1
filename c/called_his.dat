5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Some have <b>called</b> <b>his</b> claims of poverty into question, because, among other things, {{he was able to}} purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, <b>called</b> <b>his</b> autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{initially}} <b>called</b> <b>his</b> discovery the Cosmica Sidera ("Cosimo's stars"), {{in honour of}} Cosimo II de' Medici (1590–1621). At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo {{changed the}} name to Medicea Sidera ("the Medician stars"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo, and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the Sidereus Nuncius ("Starry Messenger"), published in Venice in March 1610, {{less than two months}} after the first observations.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi <b>called</b> <b>his</b> ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He {{believed}} that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.|$|E
5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the land on which he had lived and <b>called</b> <b>his</b> own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville and the subsequent westward migration of Indians away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln hired John Kirby to {{represent}} Nintendo in court. Kirby had won other big cases {{for the likes}} of PepsiCo., General Foods, and Warner-Lambert. Kirby researched the game's development, taking depositions from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he had in fact <b>called</b> <b>his</b> ape character King Kong at first, as that was a generic term in Japan for any large ape.|$|E
5|$|Pennock was {{regarded}} as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in baseball history. Mack later <b>called</b> <b>his</b> sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake.

It was {{revised and}} published in English in 1946 and 1949 as Character Analysis. The book sought to move psychoanalysis toward a reconfiguration of character structure.|$|E
5|$|The couch gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen <b>called</b> <b>his</b> friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers thought it was funny.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, <b>called</b> <b>his</b> cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E

5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker <b>called</b> <b>his</b> finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|Arminius <b>called</b> <b>his</b> tribe, the Cherusci, and the {{surrounding}} tribes to arms. Germanicus coordinated a land and riverine offensive, with troops marching eastward across the Rhine, and sailing from the North Sea up the Ems River in order to attack the Bructeri and Cherusci. Germanicus' forces went through Bructeri territory, where a general Lucius Stertinius recovered the lost eagle of the XIX Legion from among the equipment of the Bructeri after routing them in battle.|$|E
5|$|Brown <b>called</b> <b>his</b> new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} {{that name}} in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E

5|$|In 1855/56, Guise Brittan had Englefield Lodge {{built on}} land {{alongside}} the Avon River {{just outside the}} initial town area (these days the area {{to the east of}} Fitzgerald Avenue). Joseph Brittan chose land a short distance downstream along the Avon River and had his homestead, Linwood House, built in 1857. Fooks was the architect for Linwood House, and, based on an assessment by art historian Dr Ian Lochhead, it is likely that he also designed Englefield Lodge. Joseph Brittan <b>called</b> <b>his</b> property and farm Linwood after his home in Linwood, Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|In May 1638, {{fresh from}} his defeat over Kent Island, Claiborne {{received}} a commission from the Providence Land Company, who were advised by {{his old friend}} Maurice Thomson, {{to create a new}} colony on Ruatan Island off the coast of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea. At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically <b>called</b> <b>his</b> new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, <b>called</b> <b>his</b> performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
