2500|$|Several {{contemporary}} experts cite {{evidence of}} a much larger shortfall, however. Wallace Aykroyd, who {{had been a member of}} the Commission, wrote in 1975 that there had been a 25% shortfall in the harvest of the winter of 1942, exacerbated by increased exports, decreased imports, and a drain on the carryover of that year. , director of the Department of Civil Supplies (DCS) of the Government of Bengal, was responsible for managing food supplies from August 1942 to April 1943. He estimated the crop loss at 20%, with <b>crop</b> <b>disease</b> accounting for more of the loss than the cyclone; other government sources privately admitted the shortfall was [...] "2 million tons". Rutger's University economist George Blyn argues that the Midnapur cyclone and floods of October 1942 plus the loss of imports from Burma caused the famine; he asserts the Bengal rice harvest had been reduced by one-third. These figures have been debated online by experts as recently as 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Bengal's {{economy was}} {{predominantly}} agrarian. For {{at least a}} decade before the crisis, between half and three quarters of those dependent on agriculture were already at near subsistence level. Underlying causes of the famine included inefficient agricultural practices, dense population, and de-peasantisation through debt bondage and land grabbing. Proximate causes comprise localised natural disasters (a cyclone, storm surges and flooding, and rice <b>crop</b> <b>disease)</b> and at least five consequences of war: initial, general war-time inflation of both demand-pull and monetary origin; loss of rice imports due to the Japanese occupation of Burma (modern Myanmar); near-total disruption of Bengal's market supplies and transport systems by the preemptive, defensive scorched earth tactics of the Raj (the [...] "" [...] for rice and boats); and later, massive inflation brought on by repeated policy failures, war profiteering, speculation, and perhaps hoarding. Finally, the government prioritised military and defense needs over those of the rural poor, allocating medical care and food immensely in the favour of the military, labourers in military industries, and civil servants. All of these factors were further compounded by restricted access to grain: domestic sources were constrained by emergency inter-provincial trade barriers, while access to international sources was largely denied by the War Cabinet of Great Britain. The relative impact of each of these contributing factors to the death toll and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. Different analyses frame the famine against natural, economic, or political causes.|$|E

40|$|Crops play an {{important}} role in our daily meal.

Automatic detection of <b>crop</b> <b>diseases</b> is an essential research topic as it may prove benefits in monitoring large fields of crops and thus automatically detect symptoms of diseases.

40|$|Constructing {{accurate}} computational global distribution {{models is}} {{an important first step}} towards the understanding of bacterial <b>crop</b> <b>diseases</b> and can lead to insights into the biology of disease-causing bacteria species. We constructed artificial neural network models of the geographic distribution of six bacterial <b>diseases</b> of <b>crop</b> plants. These ANN modelled the distribution of these species from regional climatic factors and from regional assemblages of host crop plants. Multiple ANN were combined into ensembles using statistical methods. Tandem ANN, where an ANN combined the outputs of individual ANN, were also investigated. We found that for all but one species, superior accuracies were attained by methods that combined biotic and abiotic factors. These combinations were produced by both ensemble and cascaded ANN. This shows that firstly, ANN are able to model the geographic distribution of bacterial <b>crop</b> <b>diseases,</b> and secondly, that combining abiotic and biotic factors is necessary to achieve high modelling accuracies.

40|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are a major}} {{impediment}} to food security in the developing world. The development of cheap and accurate crop diagnosis software would thus be of great benefit to the farming community. A number of previous studies, utilizing computer vision and machine-learning algorithms, have successfully developed applications that can diagnose <b>crop</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, these studies have primarily focussed either on developing large scale remote sensing applications more suited for large scale farming or on developing desktop/laptop applications {{and a few others}} on developing high end smartphone applications. Unfortunately, the attendant hardware requirements and expenses make them inaccessible to the majority of the subsistence farmers, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa where both smartphones and personal computers ownership is minimal. The primary objective of our research was to establish the feasibility of utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a <b>crop</b> <b>diseases</b> diagnosis application that is not only accessible through personal computers and smartphones but is also accessible through any internet enabled feature phone. Leveraging methods established in previous papers, we successfully developed a prototype <b>crop</b> <b>diseases</b> diagnosis application capable of diagnosing two maize foliar diseases, Common Rust and Grey Leaf Spot. This application is accessible through personal computers and high end smartphones as well as through any internet enabled feature phones. The solution is a responsive web based application constructed using open source libraries whose diagnosing engine utilizes an SVM classifier that can be trained using either SIFT or SURF features. The solution was evaluated to establish classification accuracy, page load times when accessed from different networks and its cross-browser support. The system achieved 73. 3 % overall accuracy rate when tested using images identical to images end users would upload. Page load times were considerably long on GPRS and 2 G network tests. However, they were comparable to average page load times users would experience when accessing google search engine pages from similar networks. Cross-browser support tests indicated that the system is fully compatible with all popular mobile and desktop browsers. Based on the evaluation results, we concluded that it is feasible to develop a <b>crop</b> <b>diseases</b> diagnosis application that in addition to being accessible through personal computers and smartphones can also be accessed through any internet enabled feature phones...|$|R
