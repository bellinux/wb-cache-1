5|$|Jones {{spent seven}} years working at his {{business}} in Ruston after leaving the Browns. He worked briefly as a special instructor for the Houston Oilers and an occasional advisor to college programs in Louisiana, but otherwise was out of football.

Jones and <b>Collier</b> had been close during his playing days, and <b>Collier</b> considered him an astute student of the game.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. <b>Collier</b> was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for college coaches.

Standout players under <b>Collier</b> included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E

50|$|In 1909, Dr. Herman <b>Collyer</b> {{moved the}} family into a four-story brownstone in Harlem at 2078 Fifth Avenue. Dr. <b>Collyer</b> {{was known to}} be {{eccentric}} and was said to frequently paddle down the East River in a canoe to the City Hospital on Blackwell's Island, where he occasionally worked, and then to carry the canoe back to his home in Harlem after he came ashore on Manhattan Island. Around 1919, Herman <b>Collyer</b> and Susie <b>Collyer</b> separated. Dr. <b>Collyer</b> moved to a new home at 153 West 77th Street while Susie <b>Collyer</b> stayed in the Harlem brownstone. Homer and Langley, who had never married or lived on their own, chose to remain with their mother. Dr. <b>Collyer</b> died in 1923 leaving his sons all of his possessions, including items from his medical practice, which they brought to their home in Harlem. Susie <b>Collyer</b> died in 1929, leaving the brothers all her possessions and the Harlem brownstone.|$|R
5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. <b>Collier</b> told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting <b>Collier</b> to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. <b>Collier</b> struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, <b>Collier</b> led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E

5|$|York City {{went without}} an {{official}} manager from their formation in May 1922 until {{the appointment of}} Jock <b>Collier</b> in July 1928. <b>Collier</b> initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's last season in the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. <b>Collier</b> oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. George Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager {{for the next three}} years, before <b>Collier</b> was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936–37 FA Cup. In March 1937, <b>Collier</b> retired from football to go into business with his brother. Former player Tom Mitchell was appointed, and in his first full season led York to the quarter-final of the 1937–38 FA Cup.|$|E

5|$|At Great Lakes, <b>Collier</b> went {{regularly}} {{to observe the}} practices of the station's service football team, the Great Lakes Bluejackets. There he met Paul Brown, who had left a head coaching job at Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} Navy and lead the Bluejackets team. <b>Collier</b> took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E

50|$|Albert Payson Terhune (December 21, 1872 - February 18, 1942) was an American author, dog breeder, and journalist.

5|$|<b>Collier</b> {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but <b>Collier</b> appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and <b>Collier</b> died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|First manager: Jock <b>Collier</b> {{managed the}} club for two seasons, which {{included}} 105 matches, from July 1928 to May 1930.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the players, Brown hired a number of assistant coaches. John Brickels, an Ohio native, was brought in early on to sign players while Brown {{was still in the}} Navy. He later served as a backfield coach. Another hire was Blanton <b>Collier,</b> a high school coach for 16 years who had been an assistant to Brown at Great Lakes. <b>Collier</b> succeeded Brown in 1963 as the team's head coach. Fritz Heisler was brought in as a guard coach and stayed with the Browns until the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{continued}} popularity of this breed and their increased appearance in conformation shows, the Rough and Smooth <b>Collies</b> {{began to change}} in form, developing the flat skull and long narrow head familiar in today's <b>collies,</b> along with the more pronounced mane, or bib, of the Rough Collie. [...] The changes occurred due to outcrossing with other dog breeds, possibly the Borzoi but more probably the Greyhound. These physical changes further separated the original Scotch <b>Collies</b> from the <b>collies</b> which developed from it.|$|R
5000|$|When To Tell the Truth {{was planned}} to be revived for syndication, {{producers}} Mark Goodson and Bill Todman wanted <b>Collyer</b> to once again host the show. <b>Collyer</b> declined, citing poor health. When Goodson and Todman called Garry Moore about the job, he immediately called <b>Collyer,</b> who told Moore that [...] "I am just not up to it."

He also played an active role in local administration {{as a member of the}} Town Council of North Providence, serving as its president for a period of three years. From 1848 to his death, <b>Collyer</b> was connected to the fire departments of North Providence and Pawtucket, rising to the rank of Chief Engineer in 1874. In 1851, he married Ellen Whipple and they would later have one daughter, Mary <b>Collyer.</b>|$|R
