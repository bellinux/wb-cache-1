40|$|This article {{explains}} how a multi-frequency ultrasonic beam path is split due to passing through dispersive {{materials and the}} implications that it has in flow measurement using a Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter. The importance of knowing this phenomenon is because dispersive materials are commonly used {{in the manufacture of}} transducer wedges and plastic pipes. Splitting of the ultrasonic beam path occurs when the incident angle is not normal {{to the surface of the}} pipe and a <b>coupling</b> <b>wedge</b> is necessary. The diffraction angle is produced at the boundaries among materials with different propagation velocities (according to Snell’s law), and furthermore, in dispersive materials, the propagation speed depends on frequency. Therefore, when the excitation signal contains several frequential components, each frequency travels with a different velocity. Under this circumstance, different diffraction angles are produced for each frequency at the boundaries between materials. As a result of splitting the path, the ultrasonic beam widens and the reception transducer aperture becomes too small to receive all the frequential components contained in the ultrasonic beam. Thus, when the ultrasonic beam is carried by the liquid flowing inside the pipe, the reception transducer receives different frequential contributions, producing change in its spectral composition. As a consequence of the mixing of these frequencies, the reception signal is modulated in phase and amplitude. Moreover, modulation will change as a function of frequential composition that is combined at the reception transducer. This is the origin of the linearity error in Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the numerical finite-difference time-domain analysis of a strongly localized antisymmetric plasmon, coupled across a nanogap between two identical metal wedges. Dispersion, dissipation, field structure, and existence conditions of such <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> plasmons are determined and investigated on an example of the fundamental coupled mode. It is shown that in the general case there exist three critical wedge angles and a critical gap width (separation between the wedge tips). If the gap width is larger than the critical separation, then the antisymmetric wedge plasmons can exist only in the ranges between the first and the second critical angles, and between the third critical angle and 180 degrees. If the gap width is smaller or equal to the critical separation, then the third and the second critical angles merge, leaving only one interval of wedge angles within which the antisymmetric <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> plasmons can exist. The effect of rounded edge tips is also investigated and is shown to be similar to that of different wedge angles. Feasibility of using these plasmons for the design of efficient subwavelength waveguides is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fractures and {{fracture}} networks play {{a significant}} role in the subsurface hydraulic connectivity within the Earth. While a significant amount of research has been performed on the seismic response of single fractures and sets of fractures, few studies have examined the effect of fracture intersections on elastic wave propagation. Intersections play a key role in the connectivity of a fracture network that ultimately affects the hydraulic integrity of a rock mass. In this dissertation two new types of coupled waves are examined that propagate along intersections. 1) A <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> wave that propagates along a surface fracture with particle motion highly localized to the intersection of a fracture with a free surface, and 2) fracture intersection waves that propagate along the intersection between two orthogonal fractures. Theoretical formulations were derived to determine the particle motion and velocity of intersection waves. Vibrational modes calculated from the theoretical formulation match those predicted by group theory based on the symmetry of the problem. ^ For the <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> wave, two vibrational modes exist that range in velocity between the wedge wave and Rayleigh wave velocity and exhibit either wagging or breathing motion depending on the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. For the intersection waves, the observed modes depend on the properties of the fractures forming the intersection. If both fractures have equal stiffness four modes exist, two with wagging and two with breathing motion. If the fractures have unequal stiffness, four modes also exist, but the motion depends on the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. ^ The velocity of intersection waves depends on the coupling or stiffness of the intersection and frequency of the signal. In general, the different modes travel with speeds between the wedge wave and bulk shear wave velocity. Laboratory experiments were performed on isotropic and anisotropic samples to verify the existence of these waves. For both waves, the observed signals were determined to depend on the applied load, which affects the stiffness of the fractures. ^ These results have significant implications for fracture network characterization using remote techniques in both the laboratory and the field. The coupling parameter used in this discussion, i. e., specific stiffness, is a potential parameter to link the hydraulic properties of the fracture intersections to their seismic response. These results are a first step towards remote characterization to determine the hydraulic connectivity of fracture networks. ...|$|R
40|$|A 36 {{steel is}} a {{commonly}} used material in civil engineering structures where fatigue damage {{can lead to}} catastrophic failure. In this research, nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves are used to characterize damage in A 36 steel specimens caused by monotonic tension and low cycle fatigue. Fatigue damage produces the increased acoustic nonlinearity {{that leads to the}} generation of measurable higher harmonics in an initially monochromatic Rayleigh wave signal. One specimen is subjected to static tension and four specimens are used for low cycle fatigue tests in the tension-tension mode with a constant stress amplitude. The fatigue tests are interrupted at different numbers of cycles for the nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. Tone burst Rayleigh wave signals are generated and detected using a pair of oil <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> transducers. The amplitudes of the first and second harmonic are measured at varying propagation distances to obtain the nonlinearity parameter for a given damage state. The experimental results show an increase of acoustic nonlinearity {{in the early stages of}} fatigue life. Furthermore, a close relationship between plastic deformation and the acoustic nonlinearity is found, which indicates that the acoustic nonlinearity is indeed a measure of microplasticity in this material.

40|$|Cold rolled {{carbon steel}} 1018 C {{is widely used}} in {{pressurized}} fuel pipelines. For those structures, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can pose a significant problem because cracks initiate late in the lifetime and often unexpectedly, but grow fast once they get started. To ensure a safe operation, {{it is crucial that}} any damage can be detected before the structural stability is reduced by large cracks. In the early stages of SCC, microstructural changes occur which increase the acoustic nonlinearity of the material. Therefore, an initially monochromatic Rayleigh wave is distorted and measurable higher harmonics are generated. Different levels of stress corrosion cracking is induced in five specimens. For each specimen, nonlinear ultrasonic measurements are performed before and after inducing the damage. For the measurements, oil <b>coupled</b> <b>wedge</b> transducers are used to generate and detect tone burst Rayleigh wave signals. The amplitudes of the received fundamental and second harmonic waves are measured at varying propagation distances to obtain a measure for the acoustic nonlinearity of the material. The results show a damage-dependent increase in nonlinearity for early stages of damage, indicating the suitability for this nonlinear ultrasonic method to detect stress corrosion cracking before structural failure.

30|$|We modeled {{a simple}} {{geological}} and thermal maturity structure by <b>coupling</b> a <b>wedge</b> deformation model and a thermal structure model. The {{results of the}} numerical simulation were observed {{to agree with the}} natural accretionary wedge observations. The simulation results described the thermal history of the sediments and the spatiotemporal evolution of the thermal maturity structures that were associated with the wedge growth. Two paths of thermal maturity are depicted: one is the deep and high thermal maturity pathway and the other is the shallow and low thermal maturity pathway. The subducting and faulting associated with the wedge growth control the overall maturity of the vitrinite, and the formation of steps, the decay of the step, and the reformation of the step. Our results depict that the existence and absence of steps of thermal maturity should be considered while examining the higher temperature overprint and the reactivation of the fault. The simplified assumptions in the model should be more realistic in future work.|$|R

40|$|Lamb waves {{travel in}} plates and hollow {{cylinders}} over large distances and propagate with multiple mode shapes. Therefore the waves {{can be used}} for integrity tests of large scale structures. Each propagating wave mode has a unique dispersive character and a frequency dependent vibration pattern. Therefore, by interacting with flaws each mode is assumed to generate an individual reflection pattern depending on the flaw type, flaw orientation and size. To extract this information a frequency as well as wave number dependent mode excitation is required ensuring a single mode excitation. The challenge, however, is to control the selective mode excitation electronically to allow a sequence of consecutive tests with different wave modes to collect the data. A method is proposed using phased array wedge transducers with fluid coupling for normal force excitation of Lamb wave modes. The excitation principle is investigated analytically on plates by modelling the wave generation in the <b>wedge</b> and the <b>coupling</b> between <b>wedge</b> and structure. The analytical results of the excitation principle are validated by corresponding experiments where the field patterns on the wedge surface and on the plate were scanned using a laser vibrometer.

40|$|Clamp-on {{ultrasonic}} flowmeters geometry {{includes four}} different {{materials in the}} ultrasound propagation path: <b>wedge,</b> <b>coupling</b> material, pipe and liquid. In this case, oblique incidence ultrasonic beam generated by the emitter transducer is split into several paths caused by multiple reflections in pipe wall or because of propagation mode conversion at interfaces. These multiple paths are recombined at the reception transducer aperture, producing a single signal whose amplitude and phase depend on which proportion each path contributes. The objective {{of this paper is}} to quantify this phenomenon and analyses the implications it has on the accuracy of Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters as a function of the fluid that flows inside the pipe. According to simulations, based on 2 D ray tracing model and experimental measurements, the variations in the recombination signal at the reception transducer produces a linearity error that in case of the installation under test, Z-mode transducers configuration on PVC pipe, could reach a value of 3. 2...|$|R

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants, welded {{components}} {{can be tested}} by ultrasonic non destructive means. Such media have peculiar elastic properties, being anisotropic because of the grain growth in the thermal directions during the solidification process, and being heterogeneous due to the succession of welding layers constituted of disoriented grains. Both properties modify the field radiated by a water (or solid <b>wedge)</b> <b>coupled</b> transducer into this medium, by deviating, distorting and scattering it. In the aim to assist settings and interpretations of ultrasonic tests in these media, the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) extends its model for the field radiated by arbitrary immersed transducers Champ-Sons [1] to such cases. This paper presents the derivation of the theoretical model for predicting the radiation into an arbitrary anisotropic homogeneous medium. The extension is derived by an asymptotic expansion nearby stationary phase points of an integral expressing the refracted angular spectrum (geometrical optics (GO) approximation). Such a method has proved to ensure both computing efficiency and accuracy, when applied {{to the case of}} isotropic medium [2]. Specific developments are required in the neighborhood of caustics (directions of higher intensity), for which the asymptotic expansion is performed to a higher order.

40|$|East of the Patagonian Andes, mafic {{volcanic}} rocks (mainly {{lava flows}} and scoriae) are exposed in the Sierra de San Bernardo fold belt and neighbouring areas (central Patagonia; 44. 5 – 46 ◦ S, 69 – 71 ◦ W). They were erupted {{over a wide}} interval of time (late Eocene–Pleistocene; 14 new K–Ar ages), and show systematic chemical and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic variations in time. The alkaline lavas (Mg number 57 – 66) erupted during the late Eocene and early Miocene, have an intraplate geochemical affinity, and have the highest 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and the lowest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the dataset. Their compositions indicate that their depth of equilibration in the mantle was {{greater than that of}} subsequent lavas. In contrast, the Plio-Pleistocene alkaline lavas (Mg number 58 – 71) are the most enriched in incompatible elements, still showing an intra-plate signature, and have the lowest 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and the highest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. A distinctive group of early Miocene subalkaline lavas is characterized by slightly more evolved compositions (Mg number 56 – 59), coupled with very low incompatible element contents, flat LREE and fractionated HREE patterns (‘kinked’ pattern), and intermediate Sr–Nd–Pb isotope compositions. The Pleistocene basanites (Mg number 71 – 72) from the Cerro Ante monogenetic cone, on the easternmost slopes of the Patagonian Andes, have a marked orogenic geochemical signature and Sr–Nd–Pb isotope ratios that overlap with those of volcanic rocks from the adjacent active Andean arc. They originated in a mantle source extensively modified by the addition of materials from the subducting Pacific oceanic plates. We suggest that the wide chemical and isotopic variability of the Sierra de San Bernardo lavas reflects the upwelling of asthenospheric mantle beneath the study area, which induced lithospheric erosion and progressive involvement of enriched mantle domains in the genesis of magmas. In this context, late Eocene and early Miocene alkaline magmatism was dominantly sourced from the asthenospheric mantle, whereas Plio-Pleistocene alkaline magmas contain the largest proportion of an enriched lithospheric component. The peculiar compositional features of the early Miocene subalkaline lavas are interpreted in terms of high-degree mantle melting followed by melt–lithospheric mantle reaction processes. Based on current knowledge about the relative movement and decoupling between lithosphere and asthenosphere, we propose that the asthenosphere below the study area rose up to compensate for the westward drift of the mantle <b>wedge</b> <b>coupled</b> with the South American lithosphere...|$|R
