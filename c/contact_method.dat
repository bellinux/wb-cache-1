Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of Dinornis and Euryapteryx suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical <b>contact</b> <b>method</b> of avian egg incubation was used."

40|$|Because of {{its high}} speed and high detail output, laser line {{scanning}} is increasingly included in coordinate metrology applications where its performance can satisfy specified tolerances. Increasing its accuracy and repeatability will open the possibility {{to use it in}} other areas where <b>contact</b> <b>methods</b> are still dominant. Multi sensor systems allow to select discrete probing or scanning methods to measure part elements. Decision is often based on the principle that tight toleranced elements should be measured by <b>contact</b> <b>methods,</b> while other more loose toleranced elements can be laser scanned. This paper aims to introduce a method for improving the output of a CMM mounted laser line scanner for metrology applications. This improvement is achieved by filtering of the scanner's random error and by combination with widely spread and reliable but slow touch trigger probing. The filtered point cloud is used to estimate the form deviation of the inspected element while few tactile obtained points were used to effectively compensate for errors in the point cloud position. status: publishe...|$|R
