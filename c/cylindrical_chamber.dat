25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>chamber</b> containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E
500|$|Royal Wedding starred Astaire and Jane Powell as a brother-sister American dancing team {{performing}} in England during {{the occasion of}} the royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip in 1947. Judy Garland was originally cast in the lead role, but was fired for absenteeism due to illness and June Allyson was to replace Garland, but then Allyson found out she was pregnant, so she was replaced by Powell. In the film, Powell's love affair with a wealthy Englishman (Peter Lawford) threatens to ruin the brother-sister act, while Astaire finds his own romance with (Sarah Churchill). The film is loosely based on Astaire's real-life career with his sister and early dancing partner Adele Astaire, who retired after marrying an English lord in 1932. The film contains one of Astaire's most famous dance sequences: the [...] "You're All the World to Me" [...] number in which Astaire defies gravity by dancing first on the walls and then on the ceiling. The shot was achieved by building the set inside a rotating reinforced-steel <b>cylindrical</b> <b>chamber</b> with the camera attached to the cylinder. Both Astaire and the film's lyricist Alan Jay Lerner claimed that they thought of the idea. The film included music by Lerner and Burton Lane and was released in 1951.|$|E

40|$|The {{values of}} the {{replacement}} correction factors (Prepl, or in the IAEA’s notation pdispcav) used for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>chambers</b> in high-energy photon beams represent {{one of the most}} significant differences between the AAPM and the IAEA dosimetry protocols. In a previous study (Wang L L W and Rogers D W O 2008 Med. Phys. 35 1747 – 55), we found that the AAPM protocol adopted incorrect values of Prepl for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>chambers</b> in photon beams. For a 60 Co beam, the calculated Prepl value is 0. 5 % higher than the AAPM value and about 1 % higher than the IAEA value. It was still not clear why the IAEA values, which are based on measurements by Johansson et al, are incorrect. In this study, EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulation codes are used to simulate Johansson et al’s experimental procedures for determining Prepl values. The simulation results agree well with the measurements if the chamber responses versus depth are normalized at dmax as was apparently done in the experiments as it was believed that the chambers of different radii gave the same maximum reading at the respective dmax. However, if the chamber responses are not normalized, then the simulated experimental results lead to a result which agrees well with the Prepl values calculated by the standard Monte Carlo methods. This demonstrates that the normalization procedure used in the experiments is incorrect as is based on an incorrect assumption, and thus the interpretation of Johansson et al’s experimental values as Prepl (pdis) in the IAEA TRS- 398 Code of Practice is wrong. The values of Prepl for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>chambers</b> of different radii in various high-energy photon beams are calculated and an empirical formula is given.
