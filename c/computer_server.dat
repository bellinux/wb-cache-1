He claimed he was working on behalf of Trump campaign advisor (later national security advisor) Mike Flynn, although not on behalf of the Trump campaign itself, and was working closely with Flynn and Flynn's son. At around the same time, there were intelligence reports that Russian hackers were trying to obtain Clinton's emails to pass to Flynn through an unnamed intermediary. Five of the hacker groups Smith contacted, including at least two Russian groups, claimed to have the emails. He was shown some information but was not convinced it was genuine, and suggested the hackers give it to Wikileaks instead.|$|E

25|$|A {{bulletin}} board system or BBS is a <b>computer</b> <b>server</b> running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were {{in many ways a}} precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks, and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. Infoworld estimated that there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services such as CompuServe.|$|E
