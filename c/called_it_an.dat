John Rowland {{proposed}} to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, {{in order to}} decrease the unpopular gas tax. Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line's ability to reduce congestion and pollution, while opponents of the line <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> example of government waste. The Shore Line East Rider's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma {{struck a}} deal with the Peoples Republic of China {{allowing}} the Chinese to build roads within Laos. The road from Meng La in Yunnan Province to Phongsali City opened in January 1963. China supplied the local Pathet Lao units via that road. They also brought troops, as well as construction workers, into Laos on the all-weather highway. When the Patriotic Neutralists split from Kong Le's Forces Armee Neutraliste in April 1963, General Khamouane sided with Colonel Deuane Sunnalath and his new organization. Kham Ouane became the supreme commander of the Patriotic Neutralists in Military Region 1. Although remaining nominally independent, he coordinated his activities with the Pathet Lao. He cut communications with the Royal Lao Government and blocked his local airstrip so their airplanes could not land. By May 1964 there was a Chinese consulate in Phongsali city; the locals <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> embassy. In July 64, the honor guard company of BV 11 in Luang Prabang was disbanded by Kong Le as being pro-communist.|$|E
25|$|After Jacobo Arbenz came {{to power}} in 1951, he {{extended}} political freedom, allowing Communists in Guatemala to participate in politics. This move by Arbenz let many opponents in Ubico’s regime to recognize themselves as Communists. By 1952, Arbenz supported a land reform, and took unused agricultural land, about , from owners who had large properties, and made it available to rural workers and farmers. These lands were to be taken from the United Fruit Company with compensation; however, the UFC believed the compensation was not enough. Meantime, Arbenz allowed the Communist Party to organize and include leaders notably his adviser who were leftist. The propaganda effort that was led by United Fruit Company against the revolution in Guatemala persuaded the U.S. government to fight against communism in Guatemala. The United States clutched on small details to prove the existence of widespread Communism in Guatemala. The Eisenhower administration at the time in the U.S. were not happy about the Arbenz government, they considered Arbenz to be too close to Communism; there have been reports that Arbenz’s wife was a Communist and part of the Communist Party in Guatemala. Even though it was impossible for the U.S. to gather evidence and information about Guatemala’s relations to the Soviet Union, Americans wanted to believe that Communism existed in Guatemala. Many groups of Guatemalan exiles were armed and trained by the CIA, and commanded by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas they invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954. The Americans <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> Anti-Communist Coup against Arbenz. The coup was supported by CIA radio broadcasts and so the Guatemalan army refused to resist the coup, Arbenz was forced to resign. In 1954 a military government replaced Arbenz' government and disbanded the legislature and they arrested communist leaders, Castillo Armas became president.|$|E
