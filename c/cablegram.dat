5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a <b>cablegram</b> to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
25|$|A {{telegraph}} message sent by {{an electrical}} telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) {{was known as}} a telegram. A <b>cablegram</b> was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable, often shortened to a cable or a wire. Later, a Telex was a message sent by a Telex network, a switched network of teleprinters similar to a telephone network.|$|E
25|$|She gave {{talks in}} May at the Center, and was visible as a {{signatory}} of the <b>cablegram</b> of New York clergy supporting peace in India {{with the work}} of Gandhi and his March Salt March. And she was noted renting an apartment from lower 2nd Ave. In June she was listed starting a series of talks in London, as well as submitted a paper to an Esperanto conference in August there. Come October Ford is back giving a talk at the Baha'i Center in New York, followed by one in November, and then by one for a race amity conference, as well as a followup at the Bahá'í Center in December.|$|E
50|$|In June 1896, Chamberlain {{offered his}} {{resignation}} to Salisbury, having shown the Prime Minister {{one or more}} of the <b>cablegrams</b> implicating him in the Raid's planning. Salisbury refused to accept the offer, possibly reluctant to lose the government's most popular figure. Salisbury reacted aggressively in support of Chamberlain, endorsing the Colonial Secretary's threat to withdraw the Company's charter if the <b>cablegrams</b> were revealed. Accordingly, Rhodes refused to reveal the <b>cablegrams,</b> and as no evidence was produced, the Select Committee appointed to investigate the Jameson Raid had no choice but to absolve Chamberlain of responsibility.|$|R

25|$|Jameson {{was sentenced}} to fifteen months in jail, but was soon pardoned. In June 1896, Chamberlain, British Colonial Secretary of the day, offered his {{resignation}} to Lord Salisbury, having shown the Prime Minister {{one or more of}} the <b>cablegrams</b> implicating him in the Raid's planning. Salisbury refused to accept the offer, possibly reluctant to lose the government's most popular figure. Salisbury reacted aggressively in support of Chamberlain, supporting the Colonial Secretary's threat to withdraw the Company's charter if the <b>cablegrams</b> were revealed. Accordingly, Rhodes refused to reveal the <b>cablegrams,</b> and as no evidence was produced showing that Chamberlain was complicit in the Raid's planning, the Select Committee appointed to investigate the events surrounding the Raid had no choice but to absolve Chamberlain of all responsibility.|$|R
25|$|The rematch with McFarland {{was set for}} 4 July, Independence Day, to {{coincide}} with the World Lightweight Title fight between champion Joe Gans and Battling Nelson held in California. The Welsh-McFarland fight was gaining much press attention, and this increased after fight promoter and owner of the Jeffries Arena, Jim Jeffries, had offered Gans a $20,000 purse to face the winner of the bout in August. Betting was heavy for the match, and was to be refereed by Jeffries himself. Fought over 25 rounds, Welsh had the upper hand for the first nineteen, but after an announcement was made that Nelson had won in California, Welsh's game slipped with McFarland taking control. In the final two rounds Welsh took a heavy beating and was knocked down to the canvas in the last round. At the end of the encounter the decision from the referee was a draw. McFarland took the result badly and launched into a vicious tirade of abuse towards Jeffries, though Welsh too thought he had done enough to win in the first two thirds of the fight and sent a <b>cablegram</b> to Wales stating such.|$|E
500|$|Debates raged in Argentina {{over the}} wisdom of {{acquiring}} dreadnoughts to counter Brazil's. The National Autonomist Party cabinet was in favor, despite a probable cost of nearly $10million, but a specific plan for two [...] battleships and ten destroyers was not popular with the public. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a <b>cablegram</b> to his Department of State, warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.|$|E
500|$|Dillinger {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun {{advice on how to}} catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so quickly that Variety joked that [...] "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president." [...] Hays wrote a <b>cablegram</b> to all the studios in March 1934 mandating that Dillinger not be portrayed in any motion picture.|$|E

500|$|By 1904, Brazil—the largest {{country in}} South America in both size and population—began to seriously {{consider}} upgrading its navy, which {{had fallen to}} third in total tonnage. Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought an influx of tax revenue, used to begin a large naval building plan. The centerpiece of the new navy would be two [...] dreadnoughts built by the United Kingdom. The order for these powerful ships, designed to carry the heaviest armament {{in the world at}} the time, shocked Argentina and Chile, causing them to cancel the 1902 armament-limiting pact with immediate effect. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a <b>cablegram</b> to his Department of State, warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin {{decided to}} hold {{the world premiere of}} Limelight in London, since it was the setting of the film. As he left Los Angeles, he {{expressed}} a premonition {{that he would not be}} returning. At New York, he boarded the [...] with his family on 18 September 1952. The next day, attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US. Although McGranery told the press that he had [...] "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it. However, when Chaplin received a <b>cablegram</b> informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States: ...|$|E
500|$|The British {{ambassador}} to Brazil {{was opposed to}} the planned naval expansion, even though the orders went to a British company, for its large cost and its negative effects on relations between Brazil and Argentina. He saw it as [...] "an embodiment of national vanity, combined with personal motives of a pecuniary character." [...] The American {{ambassador to}} Brazil was alarmed, and sent a <b>cablegram</b> to his Department of State in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as Cuba, whose new constitution allowed the American government to intervene in Cuban affairs. The new President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace Aquidabã, which unexpectedly blew up that year, and the antiquated vessels composing the current navy.|$|E

60|$|Dave sat down, and a {{conversation}} lasting {{the best part}} of an hour ensued. The boy told all he knew about Nick Jasniff, and showed the letter which Gus Plum had received. Dunston Porter said he had sent several <b>cablegrams</b> to London, but so far had heard nothing of satisfaction.|$|R
25|$|Sousa Mendes {{continued}} on to Hendaye to assist there, thus narrowly missing two <b>cablegrams</b> from Lisbon sent on June 22 to Bordeaux ordering {{him to stop}} even as France's armistice with Germany became official. Furthermore, Sousa Mendes ordered the honorary Portuguese vice-consul in Toulouse, Emile Gissot, to issue transit visas to all who applied.|$|R
500|$|In 1907, Gates {{took his}} usual summer holiday in Europe. [...] Upon {{arriving}} in Paris, he {{was met with}} an urgent <b>cablegram</b> from Grant Schley. Schley, {{the owner of a}} brokerage and a board member of Republic Steel and Tennessee Coal and Iron, advised Gates of serious business trouble and asked him to return to the US at once. As the Panic of 1907 began, Schley's brokerage had become short of money and it was necessary for him to obtain large loans to try to keep the brokerage solvent. Schley offered some US$6 million shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron Company as part of the collateral for the loans. [...] Oakleigh Thorne was the president of the Trust Company of America bank and {{also a member of the}} Gates coalition. Thorne believed his bank was in sound financial condition until a New York Times article stated otherwise. Thorne told reporters that if he paid off every depositor, he would still have US$4 million in assets. When the clearing house run by J. P. Morgan audited the bank's books, they found the bank was sound, but were quite interested in the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as security.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, several real life criminals became celebrities. Two in {{particular}} captured the American imagination: Al Capone and John Dillinger. Gangsters like Capone had transformed {{the perception of}} entire towns. Capone gave Chicago its [...] "reputation as the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommygun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages." [...] Capone appeared {{on the cover of}} Time magazine in 1930. He was even offered seven figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined. Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so fast that Variety joked [...] "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president." [...] Hays wrote a <b>cablegram</b> to all the studios in March 1934 decreeing that Dillinger should not be portrayed in any motion picture.|$|E

50|$|Keyes entered Duke University in 1938 {{and spent}} two years there. He then studied voice and music at the University of Miami, and helped to found the Miami Opera Guild. In 1941, during the World War II era, Keyes enlisted in a naval {{intelligence}} unit set up to censor <b>cablegrams</b> entering and leaving the United States.|$|R
60|$|A few <b>cablegrams</b> followed, {{and when}} they were read a deep murmur rose from the crowd; but there was no strong excitement. These were not the men to indulge in {{emotional}} sentiment; their attitude indicated relief from suspense, and steady resolve. Perhaps it was characteristic that the man who had stopped the car waved his hand to the driver.|$|R
5000|$|The {{paper was}} named The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate from 1892-1927, and was {{published}} by William White. [...] It sought to publish [...] "The latest colonial and intercolonial telegrams, <b>cablegrams,</b> local and general news". The newspaper was distributed every Wednesday and Saturday mornings from an office in Wingewarra St, Dubbo to surrounding towns including Bourke, Bathurst, Gilgandra, Narromine, Orange, Walgett, and Wellington.|$|R
2500|$|Bahá'ís {{have from}} time to time {{negotiated}} with the government of Israel over such matters as the acquisition of properties that currently compose the Bahá'í World Centre buildings. [...] For example, a <b>cablegram</b> sent by Shoghi Effendi on November 12, 1952 announced the [...] "acquisition of vitally-needed property" [...] of the Mansion of Bahjí and the area around it from [...] "the [...] Development Authority of the State of Israel...The exchange of said property, including land and houses, was made possible by the precipitate flight of the former Arab owners." ...|$|E
60|$|At the Norwegian capital a long <b>cablegram</b> {{was sent}} to Dunston Porter by Dave and his father, telling of their meeting and stating that they and Roger {{would return to the}} United States at once. They also wanted to send a <b>cablegram</b> to Laura, but could not, for they did not know her exact address.|$|E
60|$|Calloway's <b>cablegram</b> {{was handed}} to the {{managing}} editor at four o'clock in the afternoon. He read it three times; and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon-hole in his desk, {{and looked at his}} reflection carefully. Then he went over to the desk of Boyd, his assistant (he usually called Boyd when he wanted him), and laid the <b>cablegram</b> before him.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened a}} Montreal {{newspaper}} and then soon forgot Appleyard. It was some time since any news from England had reached him, and the <b>cablegrams</b> predicted coming war. He read on until Whitney took the trout {{and a can}} of coffee off the fire, and called him to supper. Andrew ate as usual, because he was hungry, but he said very little and wore a preoccupied air.|$|R
60|$|Nearly a {{year had}} elapsed since the sailing of the Fair Emily, and Binchester, which had listened doubtfully to {{the tale of}} the {{treasure}} as revealed by Mr. William Russell, was still awaiting news of her fate. <b>Cablegrams</b> to Sydney only elicited the information that she had not been heard of, and the opinion became general that she had added but one more to the many mysteries of the sea.|$|R

I found Uncle Dunston first, and then we sent letters and <b>cablegrams</b> to you, but no answer came back. Then I started out to hunt you up--and here I am."
