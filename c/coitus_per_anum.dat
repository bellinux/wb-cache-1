40|$|The {{acceleration}} urbanization {{has resulted}} in the growing number of housing in the rural area of surrounding city. As a consequence the size of converted agriculture land is also getting larger. However, the distribution of housing development and the impact on agriculture land have not yet been explored thoroughly through research. Therefore, this research aims at exposing rural-urbanization around city, housing development, and the conversion degree of agriculture land for housing. This research was carried out in the rural area around Yogyakarta city. It encompassed administrative divisions of Sleman and Bantul Districts. The research method is based on secondary data analysis. Several data are among other on population growth and housing distribution of 269 locations within the two districts. Data analysis employs of frequency and cross tabulation, statistics of regression and t test. Result of the research shows that rural-urbanization in around Yogyakarta has been so high. The proportion of rural-urbanized area has increased from 8. 7 percents in 1980 to 43. 5 percents in 1990, and 66. 5 percents in the year of 2000. Similarly, the proportion of rural-urbanized population has increased from 13. 2 percents in 1980 to 54. 7 percents in 1990, and within 10 years (2000) it becomes 75. 3 percents. Housing development of the rural area at the surrounding city was started with only 7 housing locations consisted of 59 units of building in 1973 to be 269 housing locations with 35. 356 units of building in 2000. The rate of increase of the building 1. 349 units <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> The spatial and temporal characteristics of housing development of rural and urban area are different. In northern part of Yogyakarta, housing development has been growing since 1973 with the rate of growth 601 units <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> In southern side of Yogyakarta, housing development in the rural area of Yogyakarta has been growing since 1980 with the rate of growth of 967 units <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> Analysis result shows that number of construction in all housing site will reach 72. 775 units in the year of 2025, out of wich 22. 878 units will be in Bantul and 49. 897 units in Sleman. The impact of the housing development is the conversion of mostly agriculture land, i. e. paddy field (67 %), and only a small percentage are dry land and homestead. Within the last 27 years there has been 1, 232. 93 hectares of land conversion i. e. 1, 068. 45 hectares in Sleman and 164. 47 hectares in Bantul. The rate of conversion in Sleman is 41. 09 hectares <b>per</b> <b>anum,</b> whereas in Bantul it is 9. 67 hectares <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> It is predicted that land conversion in around Yogyakarta City in 2025 will be doubled to be 2. 464 hectares.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} a method for constructing a small-scale policy evaluation model that is applicable to assessing actual policies. The approach adopted in the paper is to construct a perfectly consistent small-scale model adopting the user-friendly CES function, while maintaining the flexibility required for policy evaluation. Measures taken in the passenger vehicle sector to combat global warming were adopted as an example for the policy evaluation model. Part one elucidates the method for constructing a small-scale policy evaluation model using a CES utility function with a simple one-period model. Part two expands the model over multiple periods, making it sufficiently practicable for policy evaluation. Even this multi-period model, however, has a simple structure that enables it to be used by policy makers and consultants who have studied basic microeconomics and econometrics. Passenger vehicle CO 2 emissions are currently one of the fastest-growing factors contributing to emission of greenhouse gases in Japan, and measures to reduce them are a key policy issue. This paper evaluates the policy of adopting a vehicle tax system to reduce CO 2 emission volumes from passenger vehicles. According to the results of the simulation conducted for this paper, taxes on fuel are more effective in reducing CO 2 emissions than taxes on vehicle acquisition or ownership. Policies that heavily tax acquisition or ownership of fuel-inefficient cars while maintaining revenue neutrality, such as "green" taxes, have scarcely any effect on reduction of emissions (approximately 0. 1 %). Although increased fuel taxes are relatively effective, they do not have a significant effect in absolute terms. When simply increasing fuel taxes, a hike of 25 yen per liter over existing prices is desirable, but since the fuel price elasticity of vehicle travel is minimal (about 0. 2), the effect on reduction of CO 2 emissions is also small at around 4. 3 % and the net social benefit of the change in the tax regime is limited to around 360 yen <b>per</b> vehicle <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> Since existing taxes on acquisition and ownership are skewed, a revenue-neutral tax reform that combined higher fuel tax with lower ownership tax would create benefits close to the optimum. The optimal level of tax increase would be 45 yen per liter, which would bring about a reduction in CO 2 emissions of approximately 5. 4 % and net social benefit of around 1, 200 yen <b>per</b> vehicle <b>per</b> <b>anum.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: An {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to evaluate whether}} a previously described technique for laparoscopic sigmoid resection with intracorporeal resection-anastomosis and specimen removal via a suprapubic incision could be facilitated and applied to the rectum. Methods: Ten domestic pigs (median weight 41 kg) underwent low anterior resection of the rectum, which was transected with an articulating endoscopic stapler. Pursestring sutures were fashioned intracorporeally with a laparoscopic pursestring clamp. The anvil of a circular stapler was inserted through a 33 mm port into the colon and pursestring tied intracorporeally. A circular gun with a spike fixed to its shaft was introduced <b>per</b> <b>anum</b> and a double-stapled anastomosis performed. Results: Complete doughnuts were obtained in all cases and anastomoses were all methylene blue tight. All porcine subjects had an uneventful 5 -week postoperative course. The median anastomotic level from the anal verge was 5. 2 cm. Histology of colorectal anastomoses revealed healing mucosa.

Dpcv, the diameter of the PCV, increased from the control values of 18. 725 and 17. 159 microns to 24. 564 and 25. 062 microns following SRBC administration for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{study the}} role of the chicken bursa of Fabricius {{separately}} {{from the rest of the}} gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), four operating methods were developed; these techniques are described in detail. Bursal function and immunological state of the operated chickens were assessed by applying colloidal carbon, Brucella abortus organism, and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) into the isolated bursa and then measuring the humoral immune reponses. Closing the bursal duct, after administering antigens through it, was shown to be a reliable and repro-ducibile method for immunizing chickens strictly via the bursal system. In this method, morphology and endocytosis of carbon in the isolated bursae were normal. Furthermore, the anti-Burcella titers did not significantly differ from those in the unoperated <b>per</b> <b>anum</b> immunized control chickens, whereas the response to SRBC was significantly lower (P<. 001) in the operated chickens compared with controls. Separation of the bursa from the rest of the GALT showed that the chicken bursa of Fabricius functions as a peripheral lymphoid organ; specific antibodies are formed against antigens introduced into the bursal lumen. The operating method also has confirmed that Brucella is a bursa-dependent antigen, but that SRBC need cooperation of the GALT to evolve a good humoral immune response.
