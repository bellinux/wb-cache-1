40|$|<b>C</b> <b>cells</b> are {{primarily}} known for producing calcitonin, a hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic hormone. Nevertheless, besides {{their role in}} calcium homeostasis, <b>C</b> <b>cells</b> {{may be involved in}} the intrathyroidal regulation of follicular cells, suggesting a possible interrelationship between the two endocrine populations. If this premise is true, massive changes induced by different agents in the activity of follicular cells may also affect calcitonin-producing cells. To investigate the behaviour of <b>C</b> <b>cells</b> in those circumstances, we have experimentally induced two opposite functional thyroid states. We hyperstimulated the follicular cells using a goitrogen (propylthiouracil), and we suppressed thyroid hormone synthesis by oral administration of thyroxine. In both scenarios, we measured T 4, TSH, calcitonin, and calcium serum levels. We also completely sectioned the thyroid gland, specifically immunostained the <b>C</b> <b>cells,</b> and rigorously quantified this endocrine population. In hypothyroid rats, not only follicular <b>cells</b> but also <b>C</b> <b>cells</b> displayed hyperplastic and hypertrophic changes as well as increased calcitonin levels. When exogenous thyroxine was administered to the rats, the opposite effect was noted as a decrease in the number and size of <b>C</b> <b>cells,</b> as well as decreased calcitonin levels. Additionally, we noted that the two cell types maintain the same numerical relation (10 ± 2. 5 follicular <b>cells</b> per <b>C</b> <b>cell),</b> independent of the functional activity of the thyroid gland. Considering that TSH serum levels are increased in hypothyroid rats and decreased in thyroxine-treated rats, we discuss the potential involvement of thyrotropin in the observed results...|$|R
