500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, <b>crested</b> <b>tit,</b> bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, <b>crested</b> <b>tit,</b> and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

40|$|Most {{bird species}} show {{specific}} habitat requirements for breeding and feeding. We studied {{the pattern of}} habitat occupation, nestling diet and breeding performance of <b>Crested</b> <b>Tits</b> Lophophanes cristatus in a “typical” (coniferous) and an “atypical” (Holm Oak Quercus ilex) forest in eastern Spain during 2005 – 2007. We aimed to determine which microhabitat characteristics in the Holm Oak forest {{could account for the}} presence of <b>Crested</b> <b>Tits,</b> and checked whether the nestling diet in the Holm Oak forest resembled that obtained in the pine forest. Vegetation maps were produced using GIS from observations made in the field (tree species, tree and shrub cover). Nestling diet was recorded through video surveillance. <b>Crested</b> <b>Tits</b> bred in mature, low-density areas in the pine forest. Those breeding in the Holm Oak forest built their nests in areas including pine trees and avoided densely forested areas. Birds breeding in the pine forest started laying by mid-April and the average clutch size was 5 eggs. In the Holm Oak forest, birds started laying by the end of April and average clutch size was also 5 eggs. Fledglings weighed around 12 g in both forests. Nestling diet, prey size and feeding frequency by the parents did not vary between the forests. The main prey types consumed were Lepidoptera larvae and Diptera. ...|$|R
40|$|Predators {{may either}} learn to avoid aposematic prey or may avoid {{it because of}} an innate bias. Learned as well as innate {{avoidance}} has been observed in birds, but the existing evidence is based on experiments with rather few unrelated model species. We compared the origin of avoidance in European species of tits (Paridae). First, we tested whether wild-caught birds (blue <b>tits,</b> great <b>tits,</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tits,</b> coal tits, willow tits, and marsh tits) avoid aposematic (red and black) adult firebugs Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera) more than nonaposematic (brown painted) ones. Larger proportion of birds avoided aposematic than brown-painted firebugs in majority of species (except coal tits). Second, we tested whether naive hand-reared birds of 4 species (blue <b>tits,</b> great <b>tits,</b> <b>crested</b> <b>tits,</b> and coal tits) attack or avoid aposematic and nonaposematic firebugs, both novel for them. Behavior of the naive blue tits and coal tits {{was similar to that}} of the wild-caught birds; majority of them did not attack the firebugs. Contrastingly, the naive great <b>tits</b> and <b>crested</b> <b>tits</b> behaved differently than the wild-caught conspecific adults; majority of the wild-caught birds avoided the aposematic firebugs, whereas the naive birds usually did not show any initial avoidance and had to learn to avoid the aposematic prey. Our results show that the origin of avoidance may be different even in closely related species. Because blue tits and coal tits avoided not only aposematic firebugs but also their brown-painted form, we interpret their behavior as innate neophobia rather than innate bias against the warning coloration.

There are Scottish crossbills, <b>crested</b> <b>tits,</b> buzzards, golden eagles and, most famously in the Dulnain Bridge area, ospreys. Red squirrels also reside in the woods.|$|R
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European <b>crested</b> <b>tits</b> used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and <b>crested</b> <b>tits</b> was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fourth}} series of Springwatch, the {{production}} team {{moved to a}} new location at the Pensthorpe Nature Reserve in Norfolk due to a change of ownership at the Fishleigh Estate farm. It was broadcast on BBC Two from 26 May to 12 June. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble watched local birds on the nest, including little ringed plovers, goldcrests and reed buntings, all new species for Springwatch. Swallows, blue tits, great tits, greenfinches, pied wagtails and robins were amongst the returning species. Simon King was based in the Cairngorm National Park, where he brought viewers footage of ospreys with chicks, pine martens, Scottish wildcats, ptarmigan and <b>crested</b> <b>tits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The European <b>crested</b> <b>tit,</b> {{or simply}} <b>crested</b> <b>tit</b> (Lophophanes cristatus) (formerly Parus cristatus), is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder in coniferous forests throughout central and northern Europe and in deciduous woodland in France and the Iberian peninsula. In Great Britain, it is chiefly restricted to the ancient pinewoods of Inverness and Strathspey in Scotland, and seldom strays far from its haunts. A few vagrant crested tits have been seen in England. It is resident, and most individuals do not migrate.|$|E

50|$|The {{surrounding}} area is popular destinationVerify for bird and wildlife watchers. The local pine forests {{are home to}} crossbills, rare <b>crested</b> <b>tits,</b> red squirrels and deer. Nearby areas provide summer habitats for snipe, greenshanks, oystercatchers, lapwings and others. On the nature trail in Landmark Forest Adventure Park, {{there is a special}} feeding area that attracts pine wood birds and the red squirrel - endangered in most of the country due to competition from the introduced grey squirrel. Around the area, there are rarely seen golden eagles on the mountains and peregrine falcons are more common. Ospreys fly to their summer home in Loch Garten and red deer are commonly seen.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to crossbills (see above), <b>crested</b> <b>tits</b> {{exist as a}} fragmented population of 2,400 breeding pairs in remnant patches of Caledonian Forest and in some larger plantations such as the Culbin Forest in Moray. Ring ouzels have declined to around 7,000 pairs, possibly due to disturbance from {{the growing number of}} human visitors to their upland habitat. There are fewer than 100 breeding pairs of snow bunting, although in winter they are joined by migrants from continental Europe. A nest site near Dumfries is thought to have been in use by dippers since 1881. Scotland has 95% of the British breeding population of red-listed twite, about 64,000 pairs. However, a recent RSPB survey found a sudden and dramatic fall in winter numbers from 6,000 in 1998 to only 300 in 2006 in the counties of Caithness and Sutherland.|$|R

50|$|The tits are a {{widespread}} family of birds, occurring {{over most of}} Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa. The genus Poecile occurs from Europe through Asia into North America, {{as far south as}} southern Mexico. American species in this genus are known as chickadees. Some species in this genus have quite large natural distributions; one, the grey-headed chickadee, is distributed from Scandinavia to Alaska and Canada. The majority of the tits in the genus Periparus are found in the southeastern portion of Asia. This includes two species endemic to the Philippines. The coal tit, also in this genus, is a much more widespread species, ranging from the British Isles and North Africa to Japan. The two <b>crested</b> <b>tits</b> of the genus Lophophanes have a disjunct distribution, with one species occurring in Europe and the other in central Asia.|$|R
40|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>Tits</b> at Abernethy Forest RSPB {{nature reserve}} {{selected}} broad stumps and dead trees of Scots Pine {{in which they}} excavated nest chambers in the rotten sapwood of the trunks. Given the size requirements for nest chambers, only frees with a diameter greater than about 20 cm are suitable, as sapwood depth is correlated with trunk diameter. There was avoidance of the south-west quadrant of dead trees and stumps, despite the greater depth of soft sapwood {{on the west side}} of dead trees. Prevailing weather or sunlight may affect aspect selection. Nests occurred in old open forest and plantations where the density of the surrounding frees averaged 290 per ha. Mean clutch size was 5. 5 eggs and nest success was 50 %. The provision of potential nest sites by cutting 'high' stumps has shown that it takes about nine years for the sapwood to rot sufficiently for excavation. However, none has been used to date, perhaps because of the small trunk diameters. It is recommended that future stumps should be cut at least 2 m from the ground and have a trunk diameter of over 30 cm...|$|R
50|$|Like {{others in}} the genus, it has a broad black ventral line and has no <b>crest.</b> This <b>tit</b> {{is part of a}} {{confusing}} group of species but is distinct in having a grey-back, black hood, white cheek patch and a white wing-bar. The underparts are white with the black central stripe running along the length. The female has a narrower ventral line and is slightly duller. The upper tail coverts are ashy while the tail is black with the central 4 pairs of feathers ashy on the outer webs and all but the central pair are tipped white. The fifth pair is white with a black rachis and a band of black on the inner web. The outermost pair of tail feathers are all white with a black shaft. The undertail coverts are black towards the centre but white on the sides.|$|R

5000|$|Typical of the Scottish Highlands, {{the slopes}} of the {{mountain}} are largely treeless, especially at higher altitudes. The mountain is instead clad in a variety of grasses and mosses, which towards the summit are covered by snow during parts of the year. The lower slopes are described by Muir as [...] "boggy, sodden moorland". The base of the southern side of the mountain, adjacent to Loch Affric, is wooded with Scots pine interspersed with other species such as oak, birch, and beech. These woods are inhabited by a number of endemic fauna, including the <b>crested</b> <b>tit</b> and the Scottish crossbill.|$|E
