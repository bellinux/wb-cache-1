5000|$|<b>Column</b> <b>lifts</b> are [...] "beefier" [...] {{versions}} of railgates, supporting {{some of the}} highest lifting capacities of any type of hydraulic lift. Like Railgate <b>lifts,</b> <b>Column</b> <b>Lifts</b> feature [...] "tracks" [...] that install directly onto the vehicle body. From the tracks a folding platform extends and lifts completely vertically.|$|R
5000|$|Railgate lifts {{are very}} similar in design to <b>Column</b> <b>Lifts</b> but (generally) support lower lifting capacities. Railgate lifts get their name from the [...] "outrails" [...] which install {{directly}} to the vehicle body and serve as the guides for the liftgate platform. Platforms on railgates are larger than those of parallel arm <b>lifts</b> and, like <b>column</b> <b>lifts,</b> fix at a 90° angle from the outrails and lift completely vertically.|$|R

30|$|<b>Column</b> rocking with <b>lifting</b> {{would happen}} if {{horizontal}} load {{is big enough to}} make the edge of <b>column</b> foot <b>lift</b> from the stone base. Compression stress distributions of the three sub-states with lifting are shown in Fig.  18, which is corresponding to the concept analysis shown in Fig.  6. Compression stress distribution of column foot with large cross section is shown in Fig.  18 a. Compression deformation is mainly located in the large area of column foot at the initial stage of <b>column</b> <b>lifting.</b> The maximum compression stress occurs to the edge of column foot. Compressions stress distribution of the column foot with half-cross section of column foot is shown in Fig.  18 b, and compression stress distributions of column foot with small cross section at the maximum controlled displacement is shown in Fig.  18 c and the maximum compression stress is equal to the ultimate compression stress parallel to the grain of column at this stage.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrently a {{substantial}} amount of cycling research and training is conducted in sports science laboratories utilising cycle ergometers and/or turbo trainers. These devices have been widely used within cycling research, however, they {{have been found to be}} difficult to set-up and adjust, particularly whilst in use as well as to replicate a force profile similar to that experienced when competing. This study details the development of a novel cycle ergometer that incorporates automatic bike set-up and adjustment. The ergometer was designed in accordance with a design specification developed through the use of needs analysis of elite cyclists and performance scientists. The user analysis identified a need for increased adjustability (seat height (SH), seat set back (SS), handlebar drop (HD) and handlebar reach (HBR)) and positioning accuracy, whilst maximising the stability and stiffness of the frame when conducting maximal effort trials particularly at the bottom bracket. The novel ergometer incorporates two <b>lifting</b> <b>columns</b> to provide HD adjustment from 411 mm to 868 mm and SH adjustment from 568 mm to 928 mm. The two <b>lifting</b> <b>columns</b> were mounted on two linear rails to provide horizontal adjustment of the handlebars relative to the seat, and seat relative to the bottom bracket. The motors on both the <b>lifting</b> <b>columns</b> and linear rails were fitted with HTL encoders, increasing the positioning accuracy to+/- 0. 1 mm. An anti-coast brake was also fitted to prevent the <b>lifting</b> <b>columns</b> or linear rails from slipping whilst in use. When comparing existing set up time, adjusting from the largest to smallest set-up, current ergometers can take up to 30 minutes, whereas the new ergometer takes 8 seconds. To minimise twisting of the frame during maximal effort cycling, the bottom bracket has been mounted on a 65 mm x 65 mm square column. Finite element analysis of the structure identified that it would remain stable whilst subjected to up to 800 Nm of torque. In conclusion the development of the novel ergometer allows for greater adjustability, speed of set-up and maximise frame stability during use...|$|R
50|$|A rigid chain actuator, known {{variously}} as {{a linear}} chain actuator, push-pull chain actuator, electric chain actuator or column-forming chain actuator, is a specialized mechanical linear actuator used in window operating, push-pull material handling and lift applications.

60|$|Under that clement sky the {{elements}} do not waste {{the works of}} man as elsewhere, {{and many of the}} houses of Seville are said to be such as the Moors built there. We did not know them from the Christian houses; but there are no longer any mosques, while in our wanderings we had the pretty constant succession of the convents which, when they are still in the keeping of their sisterhoods and brotherhoods, remain monuments of the medieval piety of Spain; or, when they are suppressed and turned to secular uses, attest the recurrence of her modern moods of revolution and reform. It is to one of these that Seville owes the stately Alameda de Hercules, a promenade covering the length and breadth of aforetime convent gardens, which you reach from the Street of the Serpents by the Street of the Love of God, and are then startled by the pagan presence of two mighty <b>columns</b> <b>lifting</b> aloft the figures of Caesar and of the titular demigod. Statues and pillars are alike antique, and give you a moment of the Eternal City the more intense because the promenade is of an unkempt and broken surface, like the Cow-field which the Roman Forum used to be. Baedeker calls it shady, and I dare say it is shady, but I do not remember the trees--only those glorious columns climbing the summer sky of the Andalusian autumn, and proclaiming the imperishable memory of the republic that conquered and the empire that ruled the world, and have never loosed their hold upon it. We were rather newly from the grass-grown ruin of a Roman town in Wales, and in this other Iberian land we were always meeting the witnesses of the grandeur which no change short of some universal sea change can wholly sweep from the earth. Before it Goth and Arab shrink, with all their works, into the local and provisional; Rome remains for all time imperial and universal.|$|R

50|$|It {{is assumed}} that the <b>column</b> drums were <b>lifted</b> by cranes into their place.

The typical drum of Trajan's Column weighs c. 32 t, while the capital, the heaviest block above the base and pedestal, is even at 53.3 t, which had to be lifted 34 m high. To save weight, the treads had probably been carved out before either at the quarry or in situ.|$|R

50|$|The {{telescoping}} {{column is}} formed {{by a pair}} of interlocking stainless steel bands. One band has a vertical rectangular profile and the other horizontal, much like an oversized Slinky. The vertical band spirals up on itself into a stacked helix, forming the wall of the column, while at the same time, the horizontal band interlocks the continuous spiral seam of the vertical band. When the column lowers, the bands separate and retract into two compact coils. The bands are combined, separated and stored by an assembly located {{at the base of the}} column. The result is an efficient (50%-80%) telescoping <b>lifting</b> <b>column.</b>|$|R
