5|$|In January 2007, {{the company}} {{became one of}} the first {{companies}} to offer a frozen energy drink: Banzai Energy Ice, which it created with using the then popular energy drink Banzai. Though the 4-ounce product received good reviews for its citrus flavor and convenient squeeze-up <b>container</b> <b>for</b> on-the-go consumer, the product was a financial failure and was dropped.|$|E
5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of <b>container</b> <b>for</b> long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5000|$|The Equipment Leasing {{engages in}} leasing and {{disposing}} containers and chassis. Basically, {{there are five}} types of equipment for leasing, including Dry Freight <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> general cargo), Refrigerated <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> perishable items), Special Containers (Open Tops and Flat Racks, for heavy and oversized cargo), Tank <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> liquid products transporting), and Chassis (<b>for</b> <b>containers</b> transporting). In addition, the company also provides Generator Sets for leasing.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing first-aid kits, emergency equipment, and food. <b>Containers</b> <b>for</b> securely transporting urine are also commonly carried.

5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or <b>container</b> <b>for</b> consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E
5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open <b>container</b> <b>for</b> immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a <b>container</b> <b>for</b> hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

25|$|During the Tang dynasty (618–907), it {{was popular}} to raise carp in {{ornamental}} ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver colouration. People began to breed the gold variety {{instead of the}} silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. On special occasions at which guests were expected, they would be moved to a much smaller <b>container</b> <b>for</b> display.|$|E

25|$|Application of an {{ice pack}} helps as first aid, because the venom is more active at high temperatures. Applying aloe vera may soothe and help control the pain.

25|$|It's {{important}} to check {{whether there are}} any undesired interactions between the preparation and the <b>container.</b> <b>For</b> instance, if a plastic container is used, tests are carried out to see whether any of the ingredients become adsorbed on to the plastic, and whether any plasticizer, lubricants, pigments, or stabilizers leach out of the plastic into the preparation. Even the adhesives for the container label need to be tested, to ensure they do not leach through the plastic container into the preparation.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{peroxides}} can spontaneously precipitate as concentrated crystalline solids {{within a}} storage <b>container</b> <b>for</b> ether. When this solid is formed {{at the mouth}} of the bottle, merely twisting the cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to detonate. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they are more of a problem in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle. Low-volume users should acquire only small amounts of peroxide-prone solvents, and dispose of old solvents on a regular periodic schedule.|$|E

25|$|The sample return mission {{would be}} {{designed}} to break the chain of contact between Mars and {{the exterior of the}} sample <b>container,</b> <b>for</b> instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger container in the vacuum of space before return to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to return the capsule to the Earth without the use of parachutes: the capsule will fall at terminal velocity and the impact will be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The sample container would {{be designed to}} withstand the force of the impact.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} cycle for QuickTime 3.0, {{part of the}} engineering team {{was working on a}} more advanced version of QuickTime to be known as QuickTime interactive or QTi. Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious. It allowed any QuickTime movie to be a fully interactive and programmable <b>container</b> <b>for</b> media. A special track type was added that contained an interpreter for a custom programming language based on 68000 assembly language. This supported a comprehensive user interaction model for mouse and keyboard event handling based in part on the AML language from the Apple Media Tool.|$|E
25|$|Collecting bonsai {{consists}} of finding suitable bonsai material {{in its original}} wild situation, successfully moving it, and replanting it in a <b>container</b> <b>for</b> development as bonsai. Collecting may involve wild materials from naturally treed areas, or cultivated specimens found growing in yards and gardens. For example, mature landscape plants being discarded from a building site can provide excellent material for bonsai. Hedgerow trees, grown for many years but continually trimmed to hedge height, provide heavy, gnarled trunks for bonsai collectors. In locations close to a tree line (the line beyond which trees do not grow, whether due to altitude, temperature, soil moisture, or other conditions), aged and naturally dwarfed survivors can be found.|$|E
