50|$|Spatter cones and spatter ramparts are {{typically}} formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, {{such as those}} erupted in the Hawaiian Islands. As blobs of molten lava, spatter, are erupted into the air by a lava fountain, they can lack {{the time needed to}} <b>cool</b> <b>completely</b> before hitting the ground. Consequently, the spatter are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying spatter as both often slowly ooze {{down the side of the}} cone. As a result, the spatter builds up a cone that is composed of spatter either agglutinated or welded to each other.|$|E
50|$|After {{the outer}} steel mantle has been cleaned, {{it is again}} lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the inner mould and the outer and inner {{sections}} are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a casting pit which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated until liquid at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities {{before the start of}} the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of brick channels specially constructed in the casting pit, through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to <b>cool</b> <b>completely.</b> Small bells, those under 500 lb, can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.|$|E
40|$|Steady {{accretion}} of a radiating gas onto {{a central}} mass point is described and compared to classic Bondi accretion. Radiation losses {{are essential for}} accretion flows to be observed. Unlike Bondi flows, radiating Bondi flows pass through a sonic point at a finite radius and become supersonic near the center. The morphology of all radiating Bondi flows is described by a single dimensionless parameter. In radiating Bondi flows the mass accretion rate varies approximately as the first power of the central mass [...] this differs significantly from the quadratic dependence on the central mass in classical Bondi flows. Mass accretion rates onto galaxy or cluster-centered black holes estimated from traditional and radiating Bondi flows are significantly different. In radiating Bondi flows the gas temperature increases at large radii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing radiating Bondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their cluster environments. Some radiating flows <b>cool</b> <b>completely</b> before reaching {{the center of the}} flow, and this also occurs in cooling site flows {{in which there is no}} central gravitating mass.

40|$|A {{large number}} of tidal {{disruption}} event (TDE) candidates have been observed recently, often differing in their observational features. Two classes appear to stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective temperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the radiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different locations. In practice, this location is set by {{the evolution of the}} debris stream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it. In this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose dynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic stresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization timescale to the initial stream period is t_ ev/t_ min = 8. 3 (M_ h/ 10 ^ 6 M_) ^- 5 / 3 β^- 3, where M_ h is the black hole mass and β is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they can lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between circularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic stresses efficiency v_ A/v_ c≈ 10 ^- 1, largely independent of M_ h and β. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to accelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks. Ballistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical timescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is sub-Eddington but decays as t^- 5 / 3 only for a slow stream evolution. Finally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is unable to <b>cool</b> <b>completely</b> efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution into a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.

40|$|Abstract. Ion beam {{figuring}} (IBF) {{is a novel}} {{technology for}} Ultra-precise optics. Material is removed from optic surface in atomic or molecular form by physical sputtering. Due to non-contact between the tool and the work piece, the problems involved in the conventional process are avoided, such as edge-effect and tool-wear. The ion beam figuring process is of high determinacy and high efficiency. All these properties make ion beam figuring one of the promising methods for producing mirrors of high precision with nm-rms accuracy. In this article, a new ion beam figuring system which contains doubled vacuum chambers is set up. Optics can be exchanged by a transport vehicle shuttling between the two vacuum chambers without opening the primary vacuum chamber {{and waiting for the}} ion source to <b>cool</b> <b>completely,</b> which means the efficiency can be increased greatly. A high performance processing robot contains three linear axes and two angular axes of motion, providing 5 -axis ion source positioning capability with high accuracy. The angle can be up to 50 ° to figure very steep spherical and aspherical surfaces. Then, the beam removal function of Gaussian shape is obtained by an experimental method and it is extremely stable for a long time. Finally, two sample mirrors are figured by the ion beam figuring system: one is a fused silica flat mirror with a 100 mm diameter (90 % effective aperture) and an ultra-precise flat mirror with a surface error of 0. 89 nm rms, 14. 7 nm PV is obtained; the other fused silica concave spherical mirror with a 100 mm aperture (90 % effective aperture) and 420 mm radius of curvature is figured and a concave spherical mirror with 1 nm rms, 16. 9 nm PV is obtained, which prove that the ion beam figuring system is favourable for the figuring process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Plastic waste {{management}} {{has become a}} major concern environmentally across the globe, especially in developing countries. Plastic waste is synthetic and non-degradable material. However, it has great economic importance when recycle and used with other environmentallyfriendly materials to produce composites for structural engineering works. The production and application of this product will minimise the environmental problems of plastic waste. The usage of this composite material globally, will help reduce the high dependency on the limited forest timbers of soft and hardwoods. Bamboo fibre and plastic waste can be used to produce this composite which will be used for all load carrying elements. Bamboo fibre as reinforcement in polymers is on the increase because is biodegradable and environmentally friendly. This study looks at the effects of the production methods and the materials ratio effect on the mechanical and the physical properties of bamboo fibre and plastic waste composites boards. The fibres were extracted by mechanical method, whilst the wastes plastics are clean, dried and shredded before melting to mix with the fibres. The molten plastics wastes were poured into moulds mixed with fibres and then allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>completely,</b> after removed from the case of open casting. In compression moulding, the mould charge was pressed using the mould cover. Water absorption, bending strength, impact strength and thickness swelling were carried according to standard measures. The fibre content and production method influenced the mechanical and physical properties of the composites. Higher fibre content in the composite resulted in higher water absorption and thickness swelling. It was observed that water absorption was significantly influenced by the fibre content at α = 0. 05. The hydrophilic nature of the fibres has increased water absorption and thickness swelling significantly leading to dimensional instability of the composites. Moulded composites showed better physical properties than open casting method, possibly due to reduced void space during polymerization. These tests suggested that reducing void space and incorporating fibres into the plastic improves the end use properties. These findings could be used to develop alternative materials for construction and manufacturing industries where load bearing is required...|$|E

40|$|The DIII-D {{ohmic heating}} (OH) coil solenoid {{consists}} of two parallel windings of 48 turns cooled by water. Each winding {{is made up of}} four parallel conductors. Desired thermal capability of the coil is 80 MJ at a repetition rate of 10 minutes. One of the conductors started leaking water in July 1995. Between July 1995 and December 1997 the coil was operated at a reduced thermal load using one winding. An experiment followed by analysis was undertaken to determine if the OH-coil could be operated at full capacity by relying on conduction heat transfer to the neighboring cooled conductors without actively cooling the leaking segment. The analysis took into consideration the transient energy equations, including the effect of conduction between neighboring conductors. An experiment was performed on the undamaged coil winding to determine the thermal conductance between neighboring conductors. The experiment consisted of passing hot water through cooling channels of two conductors and cold water through the cooling channels of the remaining two conductors of the same winding. The flow rate, inlet and outlet temperatures from each circuit were measured during the transient. From the experimental data and analysis, an average thermal conductance between the conductors was determined to be about 800 W/m{sup 2 }-C. Using the experimentally determined value of the thermal conductance, an analysis was performed on a coil winding consisting of two uncooled conductors and two cooled conductors. Results show {{that it is possible to}} operate the full OH-coil to the desired thermal load of 80 MJ per pulse without actively cooling the damaged conductor. During an operational test, the coil was instrumented to measure the outlet water temperature from the conductors before operating it at full current capacity. The coil was operated at 80 % energy level and outlet coolant temperatures were compared with analytical results. The comparison between analysis and measured coolant outlet temperatures was within 10 %. This gives us sufficient confidence to operate the OH-coil at full capability in the future. It should be noted that the coil can be operated at a capacity of 180 MJ if adequate time is allowed between cycles ({approx} 30 minutes) for the coil to <b>cool</b> <b>completely.</b> Forces (I x B) with the repaired conductor limit allowable current.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{investigation of a}} number of different approaches to modelling feedback in simulations of galaxy formation. Gas-dynamic forces are evaluated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Star formation and supernova feedback are included using a three parameter model which determines the star formation rate (SFR) normalization, feedback energy and lifetime of feedback regions. The star formation rate is calculated for all gas particles which fall within prescribed temperature, density and convergent flow criteria, and for cosmological simulations we also include a self-gravity criterion for gas particles to prevent star formation at high redshifts. A Lagrangian Schmidt law is used to calculate the star formation rate from the SPH density. Conversion of gas to stars is performed when the star mass for a gas particle exceeds a certain limit, typically half that of the gas particle. Feedback is incorporated by returning a precalculated amount of energy to the ISM as thermal heating. We compare the effects of distributing this energy over the smoothing scale or depositing it on a single particle. Radiative losses are prevented from heated particles by adjusting the density used in radiative cooling so that the decay of energy occurs over a set half-life, or by turning off <b>cooling</b> <b>completely</b> and allowing feedback regions a brief period of adiabatic expansion.

40|$|We report CO {{observations}} towards MS 0735. 6 + 7421 {{a distant}} cooling core galaxy, and towards M 87, the nearest cooling core {{in the center}} of the Virgo cluster. Both galaxies contain radio cavities that are thought to be responsible for the heating that can regulate or stop the cooling of the surrounding gas. In this feedback process, there could still be some gas cooling along filaments, along the borders of the radio cavities. Molecular gas is known to exist in clusters with cooling cores, in long and thin filaments that can be formed behind the rising bubbles inflated by the central AGN. CO emission was searched for at several locations along the radio lobes of those two galaxies, but only upper limits were found. These correspond to cold gas mass limits of a few 10 ^ 9 Msol for each pointing in MS 0735. 6 + 7421, and a few 10 ^ 6 Msol in M 87. This non detection means that either the cooling is strongly reduced by the AGN feedback or that the gas is cooling in very localized places like thin filaments, possibly diluted in the large beam for MS 0735. 6 + 7421.
