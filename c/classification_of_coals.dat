40|$|Coal is a combustible, carbonaceous, {{sedimentary}} rock that is {{formed by the}} accumulation, compaction, and physical and chemical alteration of vegetation [Simon and Hopkins 1981; Bates and Jackson 1987]. Coal is classified according to its type, grade, and rank. The type of coal relates to the plant materials from which the coal originated. The grade of coal refers to {{the purity of the}} coal-or the amount of inorganic material (including ash and sulfur) left after the coal is burned [Bates and Jackson 1987; Stefanko 1983]. The rank of coal indicates its degree of metamorphosis and roughly correlates to the geological age of the coal or the geological environment from which it has been mined [Bates and Jackson 1987]. Rank also indicates the percentage of carbon in dry, mineral-free coal [Whitten and Brooks 1973] {{and the degree to which}} the coalification process has progressed [Larsen 1981]. The geological process of coalification begins with organic materials (e. g., celluloses, lignins, and other plant compounds that are deoxygenated and then dehydrogenated) and ends with coal of various geological ages, from lignite to anthracite [Larsen 1981]. Table 3 - 1 presents the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> by rank. According to Parkes [1982], high-rank coal includes anthracite and semianthracite coal ("hard coal," with 91 % to 95 % carbon); intermediate-rank coal includes low-, medium-, and high-volatile bituminous and sub-bituminous coal ("soft coal," with 76 % to 90 % carbon); and low-rank coal includes lignite (with 65 % to 75 % carbon or less). The rank of coal tends to increase from the western to the eastern United States, with anthracite occurring primarily in eastern Pennsylvania [Schlick and Fannick 1971]. Most of the coal currently mined in the United States is bituminous [Given 1984]. A classification of the coal in the United States is provided in Table 3 - 2...|$|E

From these plots, the three dimensional flammability envelopes defining the explosibility <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> dust/methane/oxygen mixtures can be defined and illustrated for a coal sample. The surfaces of the three dimensional envelope describe limits which separate inert mixtures <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> dust and methane at varying oxygen levels from those concentrations which are ignitable under defined conditions.

40|$|The Indian coal {{industry}} is currently facing {{a number of}} constraints (i. e. socio-economic, geotechnical and environmental issues) due to high demand <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> for industrial growth. In addition to the many potential geotechnical issues, the existence of extensive uncontrolled and concealed fires present a significant problem to the {{coal industry}}, the national economic growth and environment. The cause {{of many of these}} fires is the spontaneous heating <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> seams (Zutshi et al., 2001) that create a significant problem to the productivity, safety and environmental impact of mining operations. The thesis presents the results of a systematic experimental study to determine the susceptibility of a number <b>of</b> Indian <b>coal</b> seams to spontaneous heating. A literature review revealed that the existing crossing point temperature method (CPT) assessment method is not reliable enough to be used to solely predict spontaneous heating. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify an additional robust and reliable technique to determine the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> to spontaneous heating, to assist in the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> seams with respect to their proneness to spontaneous heating. A comprehensive experimental study was conducted to analyse eleven coal samples collected from a variety of fiery and non-fiery coal seams within the Jharia coalfield (JCF) India. In the first part of the investigation, the basic coal characteristics, including a proximate, elemental, petrographic and mineral matter analysis were determined. The spontaneous heating susceptibility of all <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> samples was studied using a number of methods, including: a morphology study <b>of</b> oxidised <b>coal</b> under microscopy, the use of the crossing point temperature method (Indian method), the use of the sponcomb rig at the University of Nottingham and the use of thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> samples. An analysis of the thermogravimetric results obtained for these coal samples at different heating rates resulted in the development of a spontaneous heating susceptibility index (SHSI). In addition, the activation energies were calculated from a kinetic study <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> samples by employing the three different techniques attributed to Coats & Redfern (1963), Friedman (1964), and Chang (1994). Subsequently, a statistical correlation analysis was carried out to identify any links between the intrinsic properties <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and the indices determined from the application of the different spontaneous heating susceptibility methods. It was observed that the proximate, elemental and petrographic analysis results correlated well with the spontaneous heating susceptibility results obtained from the sponcomb rig and TGA experiments. It was further concluded that the results of the mineral matter analyses do not exhibit a good correlation with any of the spontaneous heating susceptibility indices. The hierarchical clustering method was used to examine any links between the intrinsic coal properties and the result obtained from the application of each of the four susceptibility indices investigated. Each susceptibility index was subdivided into three levels, namely highly susceptible, moderately susceptible and poorly susceptible. A critical review of the literature reporting the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> seams based on field observations, spontaneous heating susceptibility studies and hierarchical clustering theory concluded that any coal seam may be assigned to one of these three sub level classes by knowledge of the results obtained from the sponcomb rig and TGA experiments. An initial attempt was carried out to measure the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission fluxes in laboratory condition as well as from spontaneous heating <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> at one fire affected mine for the first time in India. Both initial laboratory and field study results concluded that there is no obvious relationship between the gas emissions experienced under both conditions.

40|$|Former {{manufactured}} gas plants (FMGPs) are a ubiquitous source of environmental con- tamination. The process of gas production created a number <b>of</b> by-products, including <b>coal</b> tar and ammoniacal liquor. Coal tar contains a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, {{many of which}} are toxic and carcinogenic. It is estimated that over 3000 ± 1000 FMGPs exist in the United Kingdom alone, yet there are few recent publications detailing the analysis <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars. The complex composition <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tar is known to vary due to a number of factors, including production method, temperature and coal type, making the analysis and interpretation of such samples extremely challenging. Environmental forensics is concerned with the source, fate and transport of contaminants. The introduction of recent legislation such as the EU Environmental Liabilities Directive 2004 / 35 /EC, which promotes the "polluters pay" policy, has encouraged the development of accurate and robust scientific methods for the identification of contaminants. Analytical instrumentation is constantly evolving, thus new protocols to trace the origin of contamination must also be developed to utilise these technological advances. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) are two exam- ples of advanced analytical instruments which have the potential to aid source identification. GCxGC provides enhanced separation of complex mixtures compared to conventional gas chromatographic techniques, while CSIA allows chemically identical contaminants to be compared based on their isotopic composition. In this study, preliminary research investigated the isotopic composition <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars, as this technique is currently a major tool for source apportionment in environmental forensics. However, the results demonstrated. that the similar nature <b>of</b> British <b>coals</b> used for gas production at the investigated sites produced similar isotopic values in the resultant tars, making the technique redundant in this case. Therefore, the potential of GCxGC was investigated for ultra resolution chemical fingerprinting <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars. Traditionally, chemical fingerprinting of complex mixtures, such as coal tar, is performed using a tiered approach including rigorous sample preparation steps and analysis by multiple instruments. In this work, a new, single-step analytical procedure was developed for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars by GCxGC. Automated sample extraction techniques combined with GCxGC analyses were employed to provide detailed chemical fingerprinting in a fast, yet accurate, manner. This research represents a major advance in knowledge of compositional variation within coal tars. The enhanced separation of GCxGC provides vast quantities of chemical data which can be difficult to interpret without statistical methods. A multivariate statistical model was developed to provide process-specific <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars. The statistical model was validated through use of a blind study, indicating that process-specific apportionment <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tars was achievable. Based on these results, the application of the single-step procedure for environmental forensics on a commercial basis was evaluated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Physical {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> such as {{particle size}} distribution have a large influence on the stability and operational behavior of fluidized bed reactors and metallurgical furnaces. In particular, the presence of large amounts of "fine" particles invariably has a drastic effect on plant performance {{as a result of}} impaired gas permeability characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> or ore burden. Therefore, monitoring and control of {{particle size distribution}} profiles of such aggregate material on reactor feed streams, such as moving conveyor belts, is critical for predictable operation of these processes. Traditionally, the method of sieve analysis using stock or belt cut samples has been widely used in industry. Unfortunately, the reliability and usefulness of belt cut techniques are constrained by frequency of sampling as well as laboratory analysis turnaround times. For real-time monitoring and control purposes, automated sampling and analysis methods are more desirable. Methods: In this study, the problem of estimating the particle size distribution profile of material on a moving conveyor belt is formulated within a texture classification framework, which has its basis in machine vision and incorporates elements from statistical pattern recognition. Using exemplar images <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> particles taken on a process stream, a set of local features that compactly describes the textural properties of each image are expressed in terms of localized nonlinear features called textons. Representation of image information using textons is primarily motivated by insights from neuroscience research on the optimality of linear oriented basis functions as models of perception in early processing of visual information in the cortex regions of the human brain. Using these representations for different textures, nearest neighbor and support vector machine classification models are subsequently used to classify test images. Results: Using a comprehensive evaluation, it is shown that the use of texton representation obtained from decomposing images with linear oriented basis functions can be sufficiently discriminative compared {{to the use of the}} widely used second-order statistical features or features from other baseline models. In particular, model performance obtained with appropriately tuned filters suggest the importance of including shape and spatial structure information in an image representation for texture <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> particles. Furthermore, using nonlinear support vector machines rather than nearest neighbor classifiers significantly improved classification performance. A texture classification approach to particle size profile estimation has potential applications in the online monitoring of the proportion <b>of</b> "fines" in <b>coal</b> material on moving conveyor belts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

After recognition of the roles of the effective parameters influencing the initiation of a spontaneous combustion, a series of intrinsic, geological, and mining characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> seams are investigated. Then, the main stages of the implementation of the FDAHP method are studied and the weight of each parameter involved is calculated. A <b>classification</b> list <b>of</b> each parameter is formed, the CSCPI system is described, and the engineering classifying system is subsequently presented. In the CSCPI system, each coal seam can be rated by a number from 0 to 100; a higher number implies a greater ease for the coal spontaneous combustion capability. Based on the CSCPI system, the propensity of spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> can be classified into three potential levels: low, medium, and high. Finally, using the events <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> spontaneous combustion occurring in one <b>of</b> the Iranian <b>coal</b> mines, Eastern Alborz Coal Mines, an initial validation of the mentioned systematic approach is conducted. Comparison of the results obtained in this study illustrate a relatively good agreement.|$|R

Suicide due to non-gas methods has in general increased, markedly so in some groups. It was suggested that neither improved psychiatric services nor voluntary agencies could have produced such changes. The 'compensatory' trend of gas and non-gas suicide rates was indicated for certain age-sex subgroups. The continuing need for suicide research was pointed out, and questions were raised concerning the psychological meaning of the epidemiological data...|$|R

An example was also presented of using actual particle count to determine precision on a category- by-category basis;AIA was applied to the characterization of mineral matter in samples of 200 mesh Illinois No. 6 (Illinois), Pittsburgh (West Virginia), Adaville No. 11 (Wyoming), and Dietz No. 12 ̆ 62 (Montana) coals before and after float-sink cleaning, and to the characteriza- tion of samples of Illinois No. 6 and Pittsburgh No. 8 coals before and after cleaning with the TRW Gavimelt molten caustic (NaOH-KOH) process. AIA provided a method to identify statistically significant differences in mineral matter features among the coals studied, such as the distribution among mineral phases (e. g., predominant mineral phases being different from one coal to another), the difference in size distribution (i. e., especially after cleaning), and the ability to monitor the formation of new phases associated with chemical cleaning;Factors leading to AIA overestimation of pyritic sulfur by as much as 50...|$|R

Some potential applications of the chemically and mineralogically categorized coal types and subtypes are discussed in the present part 2. The results show that various applications and technological problems <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> such as correlation <b>of</b> different <b>coals,</b> prospecting and recovery <b>of</b> valuable compounds, <b>coal</b> preparation, as well as prediction of combustion residues, slagging, abrasion, corrosion, and combustion performance are related directly or indirectly to specific mineral and chemical coal types and subtypes. Furthermore, some environmental risks and health concerns <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> use, namely acid-mine drainage, water-soluble trace elements, volatilization of hazardous elements, and certain diseases also may be connected with specific mineral and chemical coal types and subtypes.
