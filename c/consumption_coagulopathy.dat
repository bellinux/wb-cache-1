40|$|Introduction Point-of-care {{international}} normalised ratio (INR) {{has been}} suggested {{as a way to}} screen for venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> following snakebite, but has not been validated for this. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic reliability of point-of-care INR for venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy.</b> Methods This was a prospective study of snakebite patients recruited between January 2011 and May 2012 where a point-of-care INR was done and compared to an INR done on a laboratory coagulation analyser, as part of a quality assurance exercise. Data was obtained for each patient, including demographics, information on the snake bite, the point-of-care INR results and any laboratory derived coagulation studies. Snake identification was confirmed by expert identification or venom specific enzyme immunoassay. Results There were 15 patients with a median age of 29 years (2 to 68 y) and 13 were male. Four of the 7 patients with venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> had an abnormal point-of-care INR (3 false negatives) and 1 of the 7 non-envenomed patients had an abnormal point-of-care INR (1 false positive). The patient with a falsely elevated point-of-care INR was given antivenom prior to formal coagulation studies. The point-of-care INR was also negative in the patient with an anticoagulant coagulopathy. Conclusions The study shows that point-of-care INR testing devices should not be used in suspected snakebite cases in Australia to diagnose venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Thrombosis {{is common}} in aneurysms {{immediately}} after stent-grafting, because of exclusion from systemic blood flow. We studied changes in blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection after stent-grafting to examine risk for <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy.</b> Methods: Thirty-one thoracic aortic aneurysms were treated with stent-grafting (aneurysm group), and 29 aortic dissections were treated with entry closure with stent-grafting (dissection group). The stent-graft was constructed from a self-expanding Z stent and thin-walled woven polyester fabric. Platelet count, fibrinogen, antithrombin III (AT III), and thrombin-AT III complex were assayed as markers of coagulation. Plasminogen, α 2 -plasmin inhibitor, α 2 -plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products fragment E (FDP-E), and fibrin degradation products d-dimer were monitored as markers of fibrinolysis. Blood samples were collected before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Results: In both groups platelet count significantly decreased on postoperative days 1 and 3, and increased on postoperative day 14. AT III significantly decreased on postoperative day 1, but recovered after postoperative day 7. FDP-E significantly increased on postoperative day 1 in both groups. There was significant correlation of aneurysm diameter with α 2 -plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex, fibrin degradation products, and d-dimer in the dissection group on postoperative day 1. Conclusions: Activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis was observed after stent-grafting to treat thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. However, no patients exhibited <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> postoperatively. Therefore we believe there is little risk for <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> after stent-grafting...|$|E
40|$|An 80 -year {{old woman}} {{presented}} with spontaneous bruising and anaemia which {{proved to be}} a manifesta-tion of <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> secondary to a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm. The history of dissection was classical and her aorta was hugely dilated. She had recovered spontaneously after two weeks bed rest and had no symptoms until haematuria and bruising occurred.

40|$|Hematologic {{abnormalities}} are {{the most}} common effects of snake envenoming globally. Venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> (VICC) is the commonest and most important. Other hematologic abnormalities are an anticoagulant coagulopathy and thrombotic microangiopathy. Venom-induced <b>consumption</b> <b>coagulopathy</b> is a venom-induced activation of the clotting pathway by procoagulant toxins, resulting in clotting factor consumption and coagulopathy. The type of procoagulant toxin differs between snakes and can activate prothrombin, factor X, and factor V or consume fibrinogen. The most useful investigation in VICC is a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio. The D -dimer may assist in early diagnosis, but fibrinogen levels often add little in the clinical setting. Bedside investigations would be ideal, but point-of-care testing international normalized ratio and whole blood clotting tests {{have been shown to be}} unreliable in VICC. The major complication of VICC is hemorrhage, including intracranial hemorrhage which is often fatal. The role of antivenom in VICC is controversial and may only be beneficial for some types of snakes including Echis spp where the duration of abnormal clotting is reduced from more than a week to 24 to 48 hours. In contrast, antivenom does not appear to speed the recovery of VICC in Australian snake envenoming. Other treatments for VICC include factor replacement, observation and prevention of trauma, and heparin. An Australian study showed that fresh-frozen plasma speeds recovery of VICC, but early use may increase consumption. There is no evidence to support heparin...|$|E
