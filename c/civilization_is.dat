5|$|Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and <b>Civilization</b> <b>is</b> an anthropological and {{philosophical}} {{study of the}} altered states of consciousness found in shamanism and European witchcraft written by German anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr.

50|$|Like {{many games}} before {{it in the}} same genre, Empire Earth II has civilizations for players to lead to greatness. Each civilization has a unique power, giving it an {{advantage}} in a particular field. Each civilization also has a unique unit, which is a more powerful version of a given unit type. The Greek Hoplite, for instance, is a more effective heavy infantry than the other tribes' counterparts. The western <b>civilizations</b> <b>are</b> the Americans, British, Germans, Greeks, and the Romans. The Middle Eastern <b>civilizations</b> <b>are</b> the Babylonians, Egyptians, and the Turks. The Far Eastern <b>civilizations</b> <b>are</b> China, Japan, and Korea. Finally, the Meso-American <b>civilizations</b> <b>are</b> the Aztecs, Incas, and the Mayans.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's <b>Civilization</b> <b>is</b> an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Maya <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into three}} {{principal}} periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods. These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged. Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline. Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary {{by as much as}} a century, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} {{architectural}} styles {{present in the}} game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings.

These three architectural styles are the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the British, French and Dutch; the Eastern European, which consists of wooden and straw structures and is shared by the Germans and Russians, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings made of stucco cement and dry brick, which is shared by the Spanish, Portuguese and Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, an {{outbreak}} of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into cannibalistic monsters known as infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. In the twenty years that follow, most of <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> destroyed by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios and Electronic Arts. Originally released for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2007, {{it is the first}} game of the Mass Effect series. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183, where <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> threatened by a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must stop a rogue agent from carrying out the machine race's galactic invasion. The gameplay requires the player to complete multiple quests that generally involve space exploration, squad and vehicular combat, and interaction with non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to trigger the {{downfall}} of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642â€“1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because <b>civilization</b> <b>is</b> the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challengedâ€”the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
