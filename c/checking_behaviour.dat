40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common psychiatric disorders. Functional imaging studies implicate the involvement of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in the pathophysiology of this disorder. In patients remaining resistant to pharmacotherapy, modulation of these circuits for example by ablative lesioning may consequently reverse clinical symptoms. But the irreversibility of lesional procedures is a great disadvantage and the main reason for restraining to that kind of treatment in OCD patients. Nowadays ablative lesioning has been mainly replaced by deep brain stimulation, particularly high frequency stimulation (HFS). The effect of HFS is supposed to inhibit neuronal activity of those regions, which are stimulated. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an important station of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. High frequency stimulation of the STN has been reported to reduce symptoms of essential tremor, Parkinson´s disease, dystonia, severe depression or epilepsy especially in patients with advanced symptoms. Latest studies have shown that HFS of the STN has an impact on cognitive input, mood and motivation. A clinical study has shown that STN-HFS could attenuate symptoms of compulsive <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It was performed on 18 patients suffering from OCD and three other patients suffering from Parkinson´s disease. The present study tested the effects of bilateral HFS of the STN on <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the Quinpirole rat model of OCD. We could demonstrate that the HFS of the subthalamic nucleus attenuated Quinpirole-induced compulsive <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour</b> in rats.

40|$|AbstractDespite the theorized role of body <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the {{maintenance}} process of binge eating, the mechanisms by which they may impact binge eating remain unclear. Using objectification model of eating pathology as a theoretical framework, the authors examined the potential intervening roles of body shame, appearance anxiety, and dietary restraint in the pathway between body checking and binge eating. Data collected from a large sample of treatment-seeking people with Bulimic-type Eating Disorders (N= 801) were analysed trough structural equation modelling. Results showed that, regardless of specific DSM- 5 diagnostic categories, body <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> were indirectly associated with binge eating and dietary restraint through body shame and appearance anxiety, whereas dietary restraint was directly linked to binge eating. The findings have clinical utility as they contribute to gaining insight into how critical scrutiny of one's body may act in several indirect ways to affect binge eating.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether Salkovskis (1985) inflated responsibility model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) applied to children. In an experimental design, 81 children aged 9 – 12 years were randomly allocated to three conditions: an inflated responsibility group, a moderate responsibility group, and a reduced responsibility group. In all groups children were asked to sort sweets according to whether or not they contained nuts. At baseline the groups did not differ on children’s self reported anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms or on inflated responsibility beliefs. The experimental manipulation successfully changed children’s perceptions of responsibility. During the sorting task time taken to complete the task, <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours,</b> hesitations, and anxiety were recorded. There was a significant effect of responsibility level on the behavioural variables of time taken, hesitations and check; as perceived responsibility increased children took longer to complete the task and checked and hesitated more often. There was no between-group difference in children’s self reported state anxiety. The results offer preliminary support for the link between inflated responsibility and increased <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> in children and add to the small but growing literature suggesting that cognitive models of OCD may apply to children...|$|R

40|$|Checking {{is one of}} {{the most}} common compulsions in {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD). Some have suggested that individuals who check repeatedly may have memory deficits, but findings of memory-related investigations have been inconsistent. In contrast, beliefs about memory have been shown to relate closely to <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Thus, it is possible that mixed findings regarding the presence of memory deficits in association with OCD may be related to maladaptive beliefs influencing performance. Currently no measure exists to assess these beliefs, nor does an intervention to improve them, despite the existence of such measures and interventions for other known maladaptive beliefs central to OCD. The present studies were thus designed to measure and examine the relationships between beliefs about memory, actual memory performance, and checking compulsions. The first study encompassed the development of the Beliefs About Memory Inventory (BAMI) to assess maladaptive beliefs that individuals hold about their memory. Non-clinical (N = 697) and clinical (N = 24) participants completed the candidate items for the BAMI along with other relevant questionnaires to determine its psychometric properties. Results showed that the psychometrically-sound measure is comprised of two factors: beliefs about memory ability, and beliefs about the importance of memory. Furthermore, the BAMI was able to predict checking symptoms over and above existing belief domains known to be relevant to OCD. The second study examined whether a brief cognitive intervention designed to improve beliefs about memory in a sample of compulsive checkers could decrease checking and increase memory performance. Individuals with OCD (N = 24) who exhibited clinical levels of checking symptoms monitored their <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour</b> over the course of a two-session intervention. Half were randomly assigned to the treatment condition, while the other half were randomly assigned to a waitlist control condition. Participants also completed neuropsychological tests pre- and post-treatment/waitlist. Results demonstrated that compared to those in the waitlist condition, individuals in the treatment condition decreased their maladaptive beliefs about memory, <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and symptoms, while increasing their memory performance. The results of these studies are discussed in the context of implications for cognitive-behavioural theories of and interventions for OCD...|$|E
40|$|Inflated {{perceptions}} of responsibility are hypothesized {{to contribute to}} compulsive checking.

A sample of non-clinical participants (N = 100) performed a complex manual classification task under 1 of 4 experimental conditions: high responsibility-high reassurance, high responsibility-low reassurance, low responsibility-high reassurance, or low responsibility-low reassurance, and provided ratings of anxiety, urges to check, urges to seek reassurance, and confidence both before and after experimental manipulations were employed.

40|$|Recent {{theories}} of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder {{have suggested that}} meta-cognitive beliefs, particular confidence in memory, may relate {{to the maintenance of}} symptoms. For example, individuals who worry that their memory is deficient may check {{in order to ensure that}} the doors are locked, regardless of their actual memory ability. While studies have related meta-memory beliefs to OCD symptoms, and have found that memory is affected by checking behaviours; to date, no experimental literature has attempted to ascertain whether lowered confidence in memory directly leads to greater <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In the current study 46 non-clinical participants completed a battery of questionnaires measuring these constructs, before undertaking a “memory task” designed to manipulate their level of confidence in their memory. The effect of the manipulation on the level of checking on a visuomemory task was subsequently assessed. The questionnaires indicated that cognitive confidence predicted variation in obsessive-compulsive symptoms over-and-above the influence of depressive symptoms and other OCD-related beliefs. However, while confidence in memory was successfully manipulated, the group with increased memory confidence was not found to have lower <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Limitations of the study are discussed and directions for further research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is a {{cognitive}} construct which is strongly linked to psychopathology, particularly anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. IU {{has also been}} proposed {{to be linked to}} maladaptive <b>behaviours</b> such as <b>checking</b> and procrastination in uncertain situations. Additionally, two subfactors of IU have recently been identified, Prospective IU (Desire for Predictability) and Inhibitory IU (Uncertainty Paralysis). These factors may differentially predict approach and avoidance behaviours respectively, however research is lacking. This study investigated associations between IU subfactors and self-reported maladaptive behaviours. University students (n= 110; 74. 3 % female) completed self-report measures of <b>behaviours</b> including <b>checking,</b> procrastination, general avoidance and controlling behaviours. We hypothesised that Prospective IU would be associated with <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> while Inhibitory IU would be associated with procrastination. Procrastination was predicted only by Inhibitory IU, however Checking was predicted equally by Inhibitory IU and Prospective IU. The results provide the first evidence of a differentiation between the two IU subfactors in predicting maladaptive behaviours. Uncertainty Paralysis may be an important cognitive factor reflecting tendencies to freeze during uncertainty, which predicts both checking and procrastination. <b>Checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> may be associated with additional unwillingness to leave outcomes to chance.

40|$|Excessive {{checking}} is a common, debilitating {{symptom of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In an established rodent model of OCD <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> quinpirole (dopamine D 2 / 3 -receptor agonist) increased checking in open-field tests, indicating dopaminergic modulation of checking-like behaviours. We designed a novel operant paradigm for rats (observing response task (ORT)) to further examine cognitive processes underpinning <b>checking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and clarify {{how and why}} checking develops. We investigated i) how quinpirole increases checking, ii) dependence of these effects on D 2 / 3 receptor function (following treatment with D 2 / 3 receptor antagonist sulpiride) and iii) effects of reward uncertainty. In the ORT, rats pressed an 'observing' lever {{for information about the}} location of an 'active' lever that provided food reinforcement. High- and low-checkers (defined from baseline observing) received quinpirole (0. 5 mg/kg, 10 treatments) or vehicle. Parametric task manipulations assessed observing/checking under increasing task demands relating to reinforcement uncertainty (variable response requirement and active-lever location switching). Treatment with sulpiride further probed the pharmacological basis of long-term behavioural changes. Quinpirole selectively increased checking, both functional observing lever presses (OLPs) and non-functional extra OLPs (EOLPs). The increase in OLPs and EOLPs was long-lasting, without further quinpirole administration. Quinpirole did not affect the immediate ability to use information from checking. Vehicle and quinpirole-treated rats (VEH and QNP respectively) were selectively sensitive to different forms of uncertainty. Sulpiride reduced non-functional EOLPs in QNP rats but had no effect on functional OLPs. These data have implications for treatment of compulsive checking in OCD, particularly for serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor treatment-refractory cases, where supplementation with dopamine receptor antagonists may be beneficial.

40|$|Background: Blood {{transfusion}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} areas where serious clinical consequences, even death, related to patient misidentification can occur. In the UK, healthcare professional compliance with pre-transfusion checking procedures which help to prevent misidentification errors is poor. Involving patients at a number of stages in the transfusion pathway could help prevent the occurrence of these incidents. Objectives: To investigate patients' willingness to be involved and healthcare professionals' willingness to support patient involvement in pre-transfusion <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Measures: A cross-sectional design was employed assessing willingness to participate in pre-transfusion <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> (patient survey) and willingness to support patient involvement (healthcare professional survey) on a scale of 1 - 7. Participants: One hundred and ten patients who had received a transfusion aged between 18 and 93 (60 male) and 123 healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses and midwives) involved in giving blood transfusions to patients. Results: Mean scores for patients' willingness to participate in safety-relevant transfusion behaviours and healthcare professionals' willingness to support patient involvement ranged from 4 · 96 - 6 · 27 to 4 · 53 - 6 · 66, respectively. Both groups perceived it most acceptable for patients to help prevent errors or omissions relating to their hospital identification wristband. Neither prior experience of receiving a blood transfusion nor professional role of healthcare staff had an effect on attitudes towards patient participation. Conclusion: Overall, both patients and healthcare professionals view patient involvement in transfusion-related behaviours quite favourably and appear in agreement regarding the behaviours patients should adopt an active role in.

However, until now only two studies have used an experimental design to investigate the causal links between cognitive processes and childhood OCD. Therefore, the initial aim {{of this study was to}} develop these studies in order to further investigate the inflated responsibility model of childhood OCD. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of child’s reassurance seeking on mother’s reassurance giving behaviour. Method This study used an experimental between subjects design adapted from previous experimental research with adults and children. 52 participants aged 9 - 11 were randomly assigned to either a high responsibility group or a control group. Dependent variables were perceived responsibility, anxiety, <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> and reassurance seeking. Results After the manipulation, children in the high responsibility group reported higher perceived responsibility than those in the control group. There were no group differences in post-task anxiety, while controlling for baseline anxiety. Children in the high responsibility group took longer to complete the task and also checked, hesitated and sought more reassurance than those in the control group. Mothers with children in the high responsibility group did not provide more reassurance than those with children in the control group. 12 Conclusions The findings offer support for the link between inflated responsibility and childhood OCD by providing preliminary evidence for a causal link between inflated responsibility, <b>checking</b> <b>behaviours</b> and reassurance seeking. The study did not find a link between children’s reassurance seeking and mother’s reassurance giving behaviours. There are a number of methodological limitations that need to be to be considered when interpreting the results.

Experiment 2 (N = 90) replicated Experiment 1 with clinical students and a safety-critical ‘cover story’ for the task. In both studies, Reward and Punishment resulted in significantly fewer errors, more frequent and longer checking, than Control.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} general reality monitoring ability, and selective reality monitoring ability for anxiety relevant actions {{in a group}} of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and a group of non-anxious controls.

No differences were found between both groups in actual reality monitoring ability. Unlike previous studies, the reality monitoring task included actions that were related to the individual concerns of the OCD patients and were ideographically selected. Nevertheless, no differential reality monitoring effect was observed for the anxiety relevant stimuli. Data from the MCQ, however, revealed that OCD patients had less overall confidence in their memory for actions and their reality monitoring ability. Analysis of the confidence ratings of the reality monitoring task showed that this reduced confidence was restricted to the neutral actions.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by significant levels of distrust in memory (e. g. for actions).

Mindfulness training has been defined as including processes such as the self-regulation of attention and metacognitive awareness (Bishop et al., 2004; Shapiro, Schwartz, & Bonner, 2006; Teasdale, 1999). It was hypothesized that a brief mindfulness intervention would attenuate decreases in metamemory following repeated checking.

The cognitive assessment included (a) executive function, (b) facial affect perception, and (c) general social cognition. All three BDD cases illustrated many of the disorder’s clinical features such as excessive disproportionate concerns about their appearance, repetitive (<b>checking)</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and camouflaging. Further, they experience significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. They also demonstrated poor self-esteem, greater self-ambivalence, and more pronounced delusional thinking than a comparison group of ten healthy controls. The cognitive assessment demonstrated deficits in executive functioning and facial affect perception, but not in general social cognition. The findings implicate frontalamygdala and temporal-parietal pathology in BDD although neuroimaging studies are needed to confirm this speculation. The implications of our findings for the treatment of BDD are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Once the {{approach}} was validated, the impregnation of CDC using different electrolytes selected for their respective behaviour was carried out. TiC CDC with pore size of 0.66 and 0.90  nm were used since these materials {{are known to}} show high capacitance [19]. To <b>check</b> their <b>behaviour</b> without any electric field imposed, different electrolytes such as 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI, BF 4) and 1  M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEA, BF 4) in propylene carbonate (PC) are selected to offer {{a wide range of}} ion size in combination to {{the presence or absence of}} solvent.|$|R
5000|$|The testing theory {{related to}} {{equivalence}} partitioning says {{that only one}} test case of each partition is needed to evaluate the behaviour of {{the program for the}} related partition. In other words it is sufficient to select one test case out of each partition to <b>check</b> the <b>behaviour</b> of the program. To use more or even all test cases of a partition will not find new faults in the program. The values within one partition are considered to be [...] "equivalent". Thus the number of test cases can be reduced considerably.|$|R
