The large splitting between transverse and longitudinal modes and the band curvature are inconsistent with reported electrostatic near-field models, and confirm that far-field retarded interactions are important, even for λ/ 5 -sized structures.

25|$|Several {{features}} besides modality {{contribute to}} the musical idiom of Gregorian chant, giving it a distinctive musical flavor. Melodic motion is primarily stepwise. Skips of a third are common, and larger skips far more common than in other plainchant repertories such as Ambrosian chant or Beneventan chant. Gregorian melodies {{are more likely to}} traverse a seventh than a full octave, so that melodies rarely travel from D up to the D an octave higher, but often travel from D to the C a seventh higher, using such patterns as D-F-G-A-C. Gregorian melodies often explore <b>chains</b> of <b>pitches,</b> such as F-A-C, around which the other notes of the chant gravitate. Within each mode, certain incipits and cadences are preferred, which the modal theory alone does not explain. Chants often display complex internal structures that combine and repeat musical subphrases. This occurs notably in the Offertories; in chants with shorter, repeating texts such as the Kyrie and Agnus Dei; and in longer chants with clear textual divisions such as the Great Responsories, the Gloria, and the Credo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Due {{to their}} {{high number of}} joints, {{humanoid}} robots typically have kinematic redundancies to achieve endeffector poses. Examples for such redundancies are the kinematic <b>chains</b> of <b>pitch</b> and yaw joints that allow the robot to turn towards a gaze target. Our humanoid communication robot currently uses its spine, its neck, and its eye joints to direct its cameras towards an object. In this paper, we propose a control strategy that considers three factors, namely tracking error, discomfort, defined at the joint level, and “effort ” to control the pitch and yaw joints. Our strategy is based on gradient descent on a cost function. During the optimization, we use different step sizes to reflect the different inertia of the moved parts. Our control scheme produces human-like motions, where smaller, light-weight parts such as {{the eyes of the}} robot move quickly towards the target and then move back while the larger joints turn towards the target. We present experiments to evaluate the proposed strategy qualitatively and quantitatively. I...|$|R

5000|$|This parallage {{corresponds}} to a certain convention {{in the use of}} notation. Without any sign the parallage follows the tetraphonia γ῾, δ῾, α῾, and finally β῾, as written within the <b>chain</b> of <b>pitches</b> or phthongoi. A parallage within the triphonic tone system has to be indicated by the use of the aphonic or great sign xeron klasma (ξηρὸν κλάσμα), like it is used in Mega Ison (see the sign added in red ink in the picture below, beginning of the third row at the syllable ἀνάσταμα). This sign used three steps above the phthongos γ῾ indicates, that here there will be the same cadence which usually closes on the phthongos of tritos, instead of the phthongos of devteros. Hence, the triphonic parallage will be used which descends {{from the top of the}} branch γ῾, πλ β῾, πλ α', down to πλ δ῾, which is in the center of the right cross at the bottom—the one of tetartos, if we come down from the right branch.

30|$|Once the {{parameters}} (magnitude and frequency) {{of the existing}} partials are found, {{it is necessary to}} group them in order to find musical notes. Piszczalski [87] simply assumes that only a single note sounds at each time frame, without any other noise. This is not true in the general case, but may represent some specific, useful cases, like solo flute or voice. Sterian [106] proposes using multiple time frames, grouping partials that do not change in magnitude or frequency by more than a pre-defined threshold. The result of this grouping process is a set of tracks, which are grouped using the harmonicity criterion. Tanaka [108] uses a rule-based system that groups partials considering that they start and end in similar instants, their amplitudes change slowly and they are harmonically related. Lao [60] and Triki [113] add a rule according to which all partials of the same series must have a similar amplitude. Hainsworth [45] separates the tasks of finding notes and classifying them, so that an algorithm based on framewise energy variation finds note onsets and, after that, notes are classified according to the found partials. Similar approaches were also used by Rao and Rao [92] and Uchida and Wada [114]. Finally, Dressler [31] used a <b>chain</b> of <b>pitch</b> formation rules to detect the predominant pitch in an existing mixture.|$|R

In {{order to}} apply silent chain on conveyor, double-pitch {{time-sharing}} meshing silent chain is proposed, and by comparing with traditional silent <b>chain</b> with same <b>pitch,</b> the self-weight 20 %~ 30 % of this chain is reduced.

Noise comparison test is conducted to verify its excellent performance, when rotate speed is 350 r/min, the noise of double-pitch time-sharing mesh silent chain is 4. 6 dB lower than traditional double-pitch roller chain. Meanwhile, 250 h abrasion test is conducted, the abrasion elongation of chain is 0. 23 % after test, which is significantly lower than traditional double-pitch roller transport chain.

Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where [...] two <b>pitched</b> <b>chains</b> of links and pins with cross bars and blocks of metal and wood to make contact with the ground are passed around the front and rear sprocket wheels, one {{on each side of the}} vehicle and form a track. The weight of the vehicle body (and engine) is taken by side brackets provided with curved pathways or bearing surfaces resting on rollers which, in turn, are supported on the chains, or on rollers of large diameter revolving on fixed pins. With this arrangement, when the vehicle is running the body is, so to say, rolled forward on the chains. Steering may be accomplished by varying the speed of the driving sprocket wheels on either side of the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Tune {{plagiarism}} in {{pop music}} is a common and often feverishly debated phenomenon which surely {{has to do with}} the vast amounts of money that individual melodies are able to generate in today s pop music business. The similarity between melodies is assumed to be a very important factor in a court s decision about whether a new tune is an illegitimate version of a pre-existing melody. Despite the wide-spread belief that there is a fixed and simple limit to the number of corresponding notes between two melodies, actual court decisions are based on far more complex considerations regarding the musical material. This paper first sketches the legal framework and principal features of the legal processing of cases of alleged melodic plagiarism with a focus on US copyright law and discusses selected cases to highlight the corresponding legal practices. In the empirical part of this paper, we model court decisions for cases of alleged melodic plagiarism employing a number of similarity algorithms. As a ground truth dataset we use a collection of 20 publicly available cases from the last 30 years of US jurisdiction. We compare the performance of standard similarity algorithms (edit distance and n-gram similarity measures) to several new similarity algorithms that make use of statistical information about the prevalence of <b>chains</b> of <b>pitch</b> intervals in a large pop music database. Results indicate that these statistically informed algorithms generally outperform the comparison algorithms. In particular, algorithms based on Tversky s (1977) concept of similarity show a high performance of up to 90 % of court decisions correctly predicted. We discuss the performance and structure of the algorithms in relation to a few interesting example cases and give an outlook on the potential and intricacies of our approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The term ‘multipart music’ {{began to}} be used within our {{literature}} recently. Literally, it designates a generic co-presence of manifold components ‘inside a music’ without qualifying {{exactly what kind of}} co-presence is in play. Nevertheless, ‘multipart music’ is used more and more often, replacing the historically connoted term ‘polyphony’ which immediately refers to the domain of so-called western art music. Importantly, ‘multipart music’ has the advantage of containing the term ‘part’ which can be considered in the theatrical sense of ‘role’, thus shifting the focus towards the essence of the musical action, namely the performative behaviours from which the sound intertwining springs. These actions can be interpreted as coordination of diff erent sound gestures, i. e. bodily actions which begin and end and which have c haracteristic features and confi gurations that can be represented in terms of rhythmic-temporal dimensions and <b>pitch</b> <b>chains.</b> In such a perspective this paper focuses on what individuals do when they sing/play together in organized ways.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the process integration of a temporary wafer handling system for wafer thinning and thin wafer backside processing. Thin wafer handling is a key technology and enabler for the wafer level fabrication of through silicon via (TSV) based 3 D architectures. The work was done as evaluation study to prove the compatibility of a thin wafer handling system with standard processes used for thinning and backside processing of "via-first" TSV wafers {{as well as for}} thinning of bumped wafers. The used thin wafer handling system is based on perforated carrier wafers, which are bonded by an adhesive to the customer wafer and de-bonded by solvent release of the adhesive. All wafers used in this work had 200 mm format. The evaluation was run systematically in three major phases. In the first phase the main process scenarios, which require thin wafer handling, were defined. In a second phase setup trials for bonding, thinning, backside processing and debonding we re run on monitor wafers with different types of front side topography, but without TSVs. After finishing the setup trials in a third phase, the monitor wafers were replaced by wafers with copper filled TSVs, which were fabricated in "via-first" technology.
