5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no <b>crosshair</b> for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E
5|$|Xigbar's {{telescopic}} sight was {{changed from a}} <b>crosshair</b> and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a <b>crosshair</b> appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic sights for firearms, {{generally}} {{just called}} scopes, {{are probably the}} device most often associated with <b>crosshairs.</b> Motion pictures and the media often use a view through <b>crosshairs</b> as a dramatic device, which has given <b>crosshairs</b> wide cultural exposure.|$|R
50|$|The line {{of sight}} of the {{telescope}} needed to be exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This could be done by sighting a distant, stationary object, lifting and reversing the telescope on its bearings, and again sighting the object. If the <b>crosshairs</b> did not intersect the object, the {{line of sight}} was halfway between the new position of the <b>crosshairs</b> and the distant object; the <b>crosshairs</b> were adjusted accordingly and the process repeated as necessary. Also, if the rotation axis was known to be perfectly horizontal, the telescope could be directed downward at a basin of mercury, and the <b>crosshairs</b> illuminated. The mercury acted as a perfectly horizontal mirror, reflecting an image of the <b>crosshairs</b> back up the telescope tube. The <b>crosshairs</b> could then be adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perpendicular to the axis.|$|R
50|$|Originally <b>crosshairs</b> were {{constructed}} out of hair or spiderweb, these materials being sufficiently thin and strong. Many modern scopes use wire <b>crosshairs,</b> {{which can be}} flattened to various degrees to change the width. These wires are usually silver in color, but appear black when backlit by the image passing through the scope's optics. Wire reticles are by nature fairly simple, as they require lines that pass {{all the way across}} the reticle, and the shapes are limited to the variations in thickness allowed by flattening the wire; duplex <b>crosshairs,</b> and <b>crosshairs</b> with dots are possible, and multiple horizontal or vertical lines may be used. The advantage of wire <b>crosshairs</b> is that they are fairly tough and durable, and provide no obstruction to light passing through the scope.|$|R

25|$|In Half-Life, Gordon {{wears the}} Mark IV suit. Later in the game, {{the suit is}} {{equipped}} with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In Half-Life 2 Gordon receives the upgraded Mark V suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual zooming capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the <b>crosshair,</b> and the capability to use Combine power nodes to charge the suit.|$|E
500|$|Deus Ex {{features}} a head-up display <b>crosshair,</b> whose size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use; the reticle expands while the player is moving or shifting {{his or her}} aim, and slowly shrinks to its original size while no actions are taken. How quickly the reticle shrinks depends on the character's proficiency with the equipped weapon the number of accuracy modifications added to the weapon, {{and the level of}} the [...] "Targeting" [...] nano-augmentation.|$|E

50|$|At {{the focal}} plane, the eye {{end of the}} {{telescope}} {{had a number of}} vertical and one or two horizontal wires (<b>crosshairs).</b> In observing stars, the telescope was first directed downward at a basin of mercury forming a perfectly horizontal mirror and reflecting an image of the <b>crosshairs</b> back up the telescope tube. The <b>crosshairs</b> were adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perfectly vertical; in this position the circles were read for the nadir point.|$|R

500|$|The idea of {{attaching}} a reflector {{sight to}} a firearm {{has been around}} since its invention in 1900. Soon after World War II models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the Nydar shotgun sight (1945), which used a curved semi-reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle, and the Giese electric gunsight (1947), which had a battery-powered illuminated reticle. Later types included the Qwik-Point (1970) and the Thompson Insta-Sight. Both were beam-splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light: illuminating a green <b>crosshair</b> in the Insta-Sight, and a red plastic rod [...] "light pipe" [...] that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the Qwik-Point.|$|E
500|$|There are six {{or seven}} levels (depending on which version {{of the game is}} being played) that are split into four subsections, each with its own end-of-level boss. [...] Between levels the story is {{explained}} and moved forward through the use of short animated cut-scenes with text on the screen. Players can often choose their own path through the level by selecting a door or arrow using the gun. Several of the home system versions feature light gun support; however, all of them allow the player to move a <b>crosshair</b> to target enemies. The multiplayer game is identical to the single-player experience, but the Sega Master System, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions do not feature multiplayer.|$|E

500|$|The Pinball of the Dead is a pinball video game. The {{game has}} three tables based on {{locations}} from The House of the Dead and The House of the Dead 2: Wondering, Movement, and Cemetery. The player launches {{the ball into}} the table via the [...] "Skill Shot", where a <b>crosshair</b> moves onto a zombie and bonus points can be earned by successfully hitting a zombie. Each table has zombies moving around that the player must kill to score points. Scoring enough points unlock new areas and eventual boss battles. Hitting certain object or characters spell out words such as [...] "Escape" [...] or [...] "Chaos". These words can result in obtaining extra balls or unlocking special events.|$|E
500|$|To {{increase}} the interactivity with the game-world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple [...] "use key" [...] to operate these computers, the <b>crosshair</b> {{acts as a}} mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, from operating security door codes, activating machinery, toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|The team {{overhauled}} the game's {{shooting and}} driving mechanics {{to match the}} standards of its contemporaries. Public reception to the team's previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3) was considered during the process. To increase the pace of shootouts, the team removed hard lockinga central mechanic in Grand Theft Auto IV that instantly locks onto the enemy nearest to the <b>crosshair.</b> Associate technical director Phil Hooker found hard locking [...] "too disorientating" [...] and immersion-breaking, [...] "as you didn't {{have to think about}} enemy locations". He said that Grand Theft Auto IV players [...] "just rely on holding and shooting until a target is dead", so Grand Theft Auto V introduces a timer that breaks the lock on a target after a few seconds. The team refined Red Dead Redemptions cover system for the game, with increased fluidity moving into and out of cover. Regarding the reworked vehicle mechanics, Houser felt the game took influence from racing games and corrected Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "boat-like” driving controls.|$|E

500|$|William Wong of Computer Shopper {{called it}} [...] "a great game that {{is backed by}} good {{graphics}} and sound, and will keep you going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, [...] "If the [...] multiplayer pack {{is as good as}} the standalone version, Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with." [...] PC Gamer UKs James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, [...] "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova, {{and this is one of}} its strongest assets." [...] He noted that it was [...] "virtually impossible to recommend" [...] the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also [...] "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because it feels so real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a <b>crosshair</b> rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".|$|E
2500|$|This only {{appears in}} copied and scanned photos, not the originals.

The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where {{the middle of the}} <b>crosshair</b> is [...] "washed-out" [...] but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one <b>crosshair</b> appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same <b>crosshair</b> are faded or invisible on the white stripes.

2500|$|Gordon wears {{a special}} {{full-body}} hazmat suit, {{known as the}} Hazardous Environment Suit (or HEV Suit), during combat. The suit is {{designed to protect the}} user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its [...] "high-impact reactive armor", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer. A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a heads-up display (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a <b>crosshair.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship.

The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids across your movie work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody.
