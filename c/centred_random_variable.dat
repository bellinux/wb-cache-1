40|$|We {{consider}} a general class of random matrices whose entries are <b>centred</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables,</b> independent up to a symmetry constraint. We establish precise high-probability bounds on the averages of arbitrary monomials in the resolvent matrix entries. Our results generalize the previous results of [5, 16, 17] which constituted a key {{step in the}} proof of the local semicircle law with optimal error bound in mean-field random matrix models. Our bounds apply to random band matrices, and improve previous estimates from order 2 to order 4 in the cases relevant for applications. In particular, they lead to a proof of the diffusion approximation for {{the magnitude of the}} resolvent of random band matrices. This, in turn, implies new delocalization bounds on the eigenvectors. The applications are presented in a separate paper [3]...|$|R

The matrix entries h_xy, indexed by x,y ∈ (/L) ^d, are independent, <b>centred</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> with variances s_xy = |h_xy|^ 2. We {{assume that}} s_xy is negligible if |x-y| exceeds the band width W. In one dimension we {{prove that the}} eigenvectors of H are delocalized if W≫ L^ 4 / 5. We also show that {{the magnitude of the}} matrix entries G_xy^ 2 of the resolvent G=G(z) =(H-z) ^- 1 is self-averaging and we compute G_xy^ 2. We show that, as L→∞ and W≫ L^ 4 / 5, the behaviour of |G_xy|^ 2 is governed by a diffusion operator whose diffusion constant we compute. Similar results are obtained in higher dimensions...|$|R
