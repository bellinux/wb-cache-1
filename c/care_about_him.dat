25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

Several weeks later, Ian worries he will regret selling the restaurant but Kathy reminds him he is doing it for Bobby and must tell everyone soon that Costmart is buying it, or she will. The market traders then discover this from Ian, and Shirley's boyfriend Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) leads a campaign to boycott all of Ian's businesses, fearing they will all lose their jobs.

500|$|In {{a review}} {{for the first}} issue, David Pepose of Newsarama wrote, [...] "The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> quickly. Even though we're still {{scratching}} the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt—that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility—is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like {{a bit of an}} outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles—his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's". James Hunt of CBR.com rated the issue #1 four and a half out of five stars, lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume. The first issue holds a score of 7.8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on 11 reviews, while the final issue, #28, holds a score of 8.3, based on 9 reviews, and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8.3.|$|E

[...] He called the ending scene [...] "heartbreaking." [...] IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 9/10, giving particular praise to Jamie Dornan's ability to be [...] "magnetic in every scene." [...] Ratcliffe called his backstory her favorite fairytale of the series up to that point. Television Without Pity's Cindy McLennan wished they had not killed Graham, but gave credit to the writers for making her <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> She concluded, [...] "Episodes like this give me strong hope for {{the second part of}} this season, one-nighters and all. Bring on the pain, boys." [...] She graded the episode with an A.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E

500|$|Before Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was released, 1UP.com {{featured}} Roxas {{at the top}} {{of their}} [...] "Why You Should Care About Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" [...] feature, calling him [...] "The darling of fanfiction and doujinshi writers everywhere," [...] and commenting on what he does during his only year within Organization XIII. Roxas' role as protagonist was described by G4TV as an attempt to [...] "satiate the ravenous fanboy" [...] due to the explanation from his background. While reviewing 358/2 Days, PALGN's Adam Ghiggino praised Roxas' development saying that even gamers who did not like his character in Kingdom Hearts II would <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as [...] "he evolves from a self-described 'zombie' to a strong-willed and interesting character". Ghiggino especially noted his relationship with Xion and Axel, which he found charming despite the fact that they repeatedly meet {{at the top of}} a clock tower in many scenes. A similar response appeared in Game Informer, which commented that although such scenes were [...] "dull", Roxas' relation with Xion and Axel was appealing and the game's ending would make up for such moments. GamesRadar also commented that Roxas [...] "starts off like a zombie, but rapidly develops a personality" [...] during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream. His growth during the game was also picked as one of the most enjoyable elements of the title. IGN agreed, calling Roxas' friendship [...] "heart-aching". On the other hand, 1UP.com mentioned that although Roxas' relationship with Xion and Axel is appealing, some of his first missions feel like [...] "lonely, sad affairs". His maneuvers in the game were praised by GameSpot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look, while IGN liked the variation between them.|$|E
500|$|Former Living Single star T. C. Carson {{was hired}} as Eugene Dix. Carson {{identified}} his role as [...] "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has {{a change of heart}} as the corpses begin to pile up." [...] The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his [...] "originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." [...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E

2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the Winter Soldier suite, [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|E
