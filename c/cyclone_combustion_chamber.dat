50|$|For {{circulating}} {{fluidized bed}} in coal combustion, the beds {{need to use}} a greater fluidizing speed, so the particles will remained constant in the flue gases, before moving across the <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and into the <b>cyclone.</b> During <b>combustion,</b> a dense bed is required to mix the fuel even though the solids are dispersed evenly all over the unit. The bigger particles are extracted and returned to <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> for further process, which required relatively longer particle residence time. If the total carbon conversion efficiencies gets over 98% it shows good separation process that leaves simply a minor proportion of unburned char in the residues. During the whole process, the operating conditions are relatively uniform for the combustor.|$|R
