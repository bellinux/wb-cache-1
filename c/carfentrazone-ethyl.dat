50|$|Pre-harvest crop {{desiccation}} (also siccation) {{refers to}} {{the application of a}} herbicide to a crop shortly before harvest. Herbicides used include glyphosate, diquat and glufosinate. For potatoes, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> is used. Other desiccants are cyanamide, cinidon-ethyl, and pyraflufen-ethyl.Uneven crop growth is a problem in northern climates during wet summers or when weed control is poor and several of advantages of desiccation have been cited: More even ripening is achieved and harvest can be conducted earlier; weed control is initiated for a future crop; earlier ripening allows for earlier replanting; desiccation reduces green material in the harvest putting less strain on harvesting machinery. Some crop may be mechanically destroyed when crop desiccation machinery moves through the field.|$|E

As misturas de glyphosate nas doses de 252 e 720 g ha- 1 com <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> nas doses de 15 e 30 g ha¹ demonstraram efeito aditivo no controle de A. hybridus, D. tortuosum e Bidens pilosa, à exceção das misturas de glyphosate na dose de 252 g ha- 1 com as doses de 15 e 30 g ha- 1 de <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> que proporcionam efeito sinergístico no controle de D. tortuosum. A adição das duas doses de <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> antagonizou o efeito de glyphosate na menor dose (252 g ha- 1) no controle de E. indica, apresentando, no entanto, efeito aditivo com o glyphosate na maior dose (720 g ha- 1). Já para D. horizontalis, as misturas de <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> com glyphosate na menor dose (252 g ha- 1) apresentaram efeito sinergístico no controle dessa espécie, demonstrando, ainda, efeito aditivo na mistura com glyphosate na dose de 720 g ha- 1. A mistura de <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> com glyphosate proporcionou efeito aditivo no controle de C. benghalensis, independentemente das combinações de doses avaliadas. Os resultados deste experimento indicam que <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> apresenta comportamento diferenciado quanto à interação com glyphosate, dependendo da espécie de planta daninha e da dose dos herbicidas utilizados na mistura em tanque, sendo complementar na mistura em tanque com glyphosate, pois demonstrou efeito antagônico em poucas das combinações estudadas, prevalecendo seu efeito aditivo na mistura com glyphosate, no controle das espécies avaliadas. Under evironmental controlled conditions {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the efficacy of <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> in tank mixture with glyphosate to control six weed species. Glyphosate alone at 720 g ha- 1 was effective in controlling Amaranthus hybridus (100 %), Desmodium tortuosum (100 %), Bidens pilosa (99 %), Eleusine indica (96 %), Digitaria horizontalis (100 %) and Commelina benghalensis (93 %) at 21 DAA. <b>Carfentrazone-ethyl</b> alone controlled only C. benghalensis. efficiently. Glyphosate mixtures (252 and 720 g ha- 1) with <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> at 15 and 30 g ha¹ showed an additive effect in controlling A. hybridus, D. tortuosum and Bidens pilosa, except for glyphosate mixture at 252 g ha- 1 with <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> at 15 and 30 g ha- 1, which showed synergism in controlling D. tortuosum. The addition of the two <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> doses antagonized {{the effect of the}} smallest dose (252 g ha- 1) of glyphosate on E. indica control. However, the largest glyphosate dose (720 g ha- 1) provided additive effect when mixed with both <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> doses. For D. horizontalis, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> mixtures with glyphosate in the smallest dose (252 g ha- 1) had a synergistic effect in the control of this species, also showing and additive effect in the mixture with glyphosate at 720 g ha- 1. <b>Carfentrazone-ethyl</b> mixture with glyphosate provided an additive effect in C. benghalensis control, regardless of dose combinations. The results of this experiment indicate that <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> presents a differentiated behavior when interacting with glyphosate, depending on the weed species and the herbicide dose used in the tank mixtures, being complementary in tank-mix combinations with glyphosate, since it showed an antagonistic effect in few combinations, with its additive effect prevailing in the mixture with glyphosate for the control of the evaluated species...|$|E

Treze tratamentos, dispostos em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, foram constituídos pelas misturas em tanque de glyphosate + chlorimuron-ethyl (1. 440 + 12, 5 g ha- 1) e glyphosate + <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> (1. 440 + 10 g ha- 1) isoladas e associados aos adjuvantes Nimbus®, Joint Oil®, Naturl'Oil®, Triunfo 515 ® e All Fix ®, e uma testemunha sem aplicação. Os adjuvantes utilizados foram eficientes na redução da tensão superficial das caldas; no entanto, não influenciaram nos valores de deposição e na eficiência do controle. Os adjuvantes proporcionaram efeitos distintos na redução da tensão superficial, no pH e na qualidade da aplicação (diâmetro mediano volumétrico, densidade de gotas, potencial de perdas por deriva, área coberta e diâmetro médio das gotas) das misturas em tanque de glyphosate + chlorimuron-ethyl e glyphosate + <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> mas não interferiram na deposição da calda de pulverização sobre os alvos I. grandifolia e lâminas de vidro.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{application}} of herbicides, even if selective, can cause biochemical and physiological changes, resulting in oxidative stress. This stress {{comes from the}} accumulation of reactive oxygen species produced due to exposure to the herbicide. However, plants have developed defense strategies, which can be enzymatic or non-enzymatic. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the morphological and metabolic changes such as photosynthetic parameters, oxidative damage and antioxidant enzyme activity of rice plants after applying herbicides. For this, a study was conducted in a greenhouse and laboratory and the treatments consisted of {{application of}} imazapic + imazapyr, quinclorac, bentazon, cyhalofop-butyl, penoxsulan, bispyribac-sodium and <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> in addition to control without herbicide. The phytotoxicity in plants was strong and there was a reduction in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and efficiency of water use in plants treated with <b>carfentrazone-ethyl.</b> Furthermore, the application of <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> resulted in lower chlorophylls and carotenoids and increased lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation.

Surfactants are able to increase foliar uptake of active ingredients for example, by enhancing retention of spray droplets on cuticles and penetration and absorption into leaf tissue. In this study, dose-response studies with ethoxylated seed oils (soybean, linseed, safflower and high oleic sunflower oil), {{in combination with the}} herbicides sulfosulfuron, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron were conducted. Commercial adjuvants (polyethylated fatty alcohol, polyether siloxane and rapeseed oil methyl-ester) served as standards. The experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions, using Abutilon theophrasti Medik. as test species. Dry weight of A. theophrasti was measured three weeks after treatment and dose-response curves were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Results showed that two of three herbicides did not control A. theophrasti sufficiently when they were applied without any adjuvant. The ethoxylated linseed oil decreased the ED 90 of sulfosulfuron and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron by 245 - and 44 -fold, respectively, whereas the ED 90 of <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> was reduced 2 -fold by the ethoxylated safflower oil. Furthermore, none of the herbicides developed its best efficiency in combination with the respective recommended commercial adjuvant. This experiment demonstrates that the potential of an herbicide can be increased adding ethoxylated seed oil adjuvants. Hence, with precise recommendations for herbicide-adjuvant-mixtures, herbicide application rates and costs could be reduced...|$|E

The trial was installed ar complete randomized block designing, with 11 treatments: lactofen (96 g ha- 1); lactofen (192 g ha- 1); carfentrazone - ethyl (8 g ha- 1); carfentrazone - ethyl (12 g ha- 1); flumioxazin (25 g ha- 1); flumioxazin (50 g ha- 1); lactofen + flumioxazin (96 + 25 g ha- 1); lactofen + flumioxazin (192 + 50 g ha- 1); nicosulfuron (8 g ha- 1); nicosulfuron (40 g ha- 1) and a check without herbicide. The treatments were applied at 30 days after the corn emergence. It were evaluated the effects of the treatments in the height, dry biomass and productivity of the corn and, also, in the dry biomass of the B. ruziziensis. The herbicides flumioxazin, lactofen and <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> didn´t present potential to be used in post-emergence in this integrated system, due to low selectivity for corn. Nicosulfuron atrate of 8 a g ha- 1 provided corn yeld similar to the check with out herbicides, and a initial small suppression of B. ruziziensis; and, consequently, being the best herbicide to be used for weed management in the no-livestock system. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a seletividade de diferentes herbicidas à cultura do milho e a Brachiaria ruziziensis cultivadas no sistema de integração lavoura-pecuária.

Todavia, é prudente verificar a interação desse com os demais métodos de controle empregados em determinada cultura. Dessa forma, objetivou-se avaliar a fungitoxicidade dos herbicidas sobre o crescimento e desenvolvimento dos isolados de Trichoderma spp. Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 6 x 6 x 4, com quatro repetições. O fator A correspondeu aos herbicidas pendimethalin, clomazone, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> oxadiazon, thiobencarb + {{propanil}} e byspiribac-sodium; o fator B, às doses dos herbicidas - 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 e 200 % da dose recomendada; e o fator C, aos isolados de Trichoderma spp. AJAM 18, CE 66, TRI 01 e TRI 02. O ensaio foi realizado em condições in vitro; avaliaram-se o crescimento micelial radial (CMR) e a esporulação dos isolados após aplicação dos herbicidas. Observaram-se diferenças de sensibilidade dos isolados para o mesmo produto testado. O oxadiazon reduziu o CMR dos isolados AJAM 18 e TRI 01 em 66 e 35 %, respectivamente. No entanto, reduziu apenas 16 % do CMR do isolado TRI 02 e não alterou o CMR do isolado CE 66 mesmo em 200 % da dose recomendada. Verificaram-se diferentes efeitos dos produtos em cada isolado. A mistura comercial de thiobencarb+propanil foi altamente tóxica aos isolados de Trichoderma spp., com reduções em torno de 85 % no CMR e no número de esporos. Por outro lado, o byspiribac-sodium pouco afetou os isolados, apresentando reduções inferiores a 10 % no CMR e na esporulação. O <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> e byspiribac-sodium demonstraram ser compatíveis com os isolados de Trichoderma spp. estudados. The use {{of microorganisms}} {{is an alternative}} for the control of plant diseases. However, one should verify its interaction with other methods of control used for a particular crop. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of herbicide fungitoxicity on the growth and development of Trichoderma spp. strains. A completely randomized design was used in a factorial scheme 6 x 6 x 4, with four replications. Factor A consisted of the herbicides pendimethalin, clomazone, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> oxadiazon, thiobencarb + propanyl and byspiribac-sodium; factor B consisted of the herbicides doses 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 % of the recommended dose; and factor C consisted of the Trichoderma spp. strains AJAM 18, CE 66, TRI 01, and TRI 02. The assay was conducted under in vitro conditions, with radial mycelial growth (RMG) and strain sporulation being evaluated after application of the herbicides. A difference was observed in {{the sensitivity of the}} strains for the same product tested. Oxadiazon reduced the RMG of the isolates AJAM 18 and TRI 01 in 66 % and 35 %, respectively. However, it reduced only 16 % of the RMG of the isolate TRI 02, and it did not affect the RMG of the isolate CE 66, even when at 200 % of the recommended dose. Different effects of the products were verified on each isolate. The commercial mixture thiobencarb+propanyl was highly toxic to the isolates with reduction of the RMG and in the number of spores around 85 %.

As avaliações de controle visual e fitotoxicidade foram realizadas aos 15, 30 e 45 dias após a aplicação dos herbicidas. Para elaboração das curvas de dose-resposta, um experimento foi instalado em casa de vegetação, com as plantas daninhas I. nil, I. hederifolia, I. grandifolia, I. quamoclit e C. benghalensis. As doses do herbicida carfentrazone foram: 10 D, 4 D, 2 D, D, 0, 5 D, 0, 25 D, 0, 125 D, 0, 1 D e 0, 01 D, em que D = 20 g ha¹. Os dados foram analisados a partir de curvas de dose-resposta de controle visual e massa fresca. No experimento de campo, observou-se excelente controle das plantas daninhas, sendo a dose de 50 g ha- 1 de carfentrazone a mais eficiente. Nenhum tratamento causou danos à cana-de-açúcar. O experimento de casa de vegetação permitiu concluir que a ordem decrescente de sensibilidade das espécies de corda-de-viola ao <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> é: I. hederifolia > I. quamoclit > I. nil > I. grandifolia; e que C. benghalensis é controlada pelo carfentrazone a partir da dose de 5 g ha- 1. This work {{aimed to}} evaluate the efficacy and selectivity of the herbicide <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> applied in post-emergence to control weeds in sugarcane crop and to evaluate dose-response curves of this herbicide in four species of Ipomoea spp. and Commelina benghalensis.

The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the physiological quality of soybean seeds as due to the use of apreharvest desiccant and desiccation time in two harvests (2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13). The treatments were five soybean cultivars, two growth stages of application, a control (without desiccant application), and three desiccants (glufosinate-ammonium, <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> and paraquat) (2011 / 12 harvest). In the 2012 / 13 harvest the <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> desiccant was replaced by diquat. The physiological quality of seeds was assessed by the percentage of viability and vigor (cold test, tetrazolium test and accelerated aging test). In 2011 / 12 harvest, there was an early harvest in six days with the use of glufosinate-ammonium and paraquat desiccants, when desiccation was done in stage R 7. 1, with maintenance of seed quality; however it was dependent on the cultivar. In the 2012 / 13 harvest there was no early harvesting due to the presence of rain in the preharvest and the use of desiccation did not affect the physiological quality of the seeds either. Cultivar NA 5909 RG was more tolerant to remaining in the cultivation environment and maintained higher viability than 90 % and greater vigor of 71 % by the cold test compared to cultivar BMX Turbo (2011 / 12 harvest).

New strategies for pest management may reduce chemical inputs. The objectives of these 2009 - 2010 field studies were to evaluate: 1) creeping bentgrass cultivars for dollar spot susceptibility; 2) alternative chemical controls for silvery-thread moss; and 3) {{the response of}} silvery-thread moss to nitrogen (N) sources. During peak dollar spot development, ‘Declaration’, ‘A- 4 ’, and ‘Crenshaw’ had 7. 5, 139. 4, and 288. 9 infection centers m[superscript]- 2 under fairway and 2. 1, 27. 2, and 106. 9 infection centers m[superscript]- 2 under putting green conditions, respectively.

L[superscript]- 1), premixed essential oil, and broadcast applications of <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> at 0. 09 kg a. i. ha[superscript]- 1 suppressed moss 39 % to 55 % compared to untreated in 2009. Spot sprays of sodium or potassium bicarbonate, and essential oil, were phytotoxic to creeping bentgrass and required up to 8 or 18 days, respectively, to return to acceptable quality. Fertilization with liquid urea (N at 16. 3 kg ha[superscript]- 1 biweekly, 210 kg ha[superscript]- 1 annually) resulted in 147 %, 150 %, and 155 % more moss than fertilization with IBDU, organic N, and granular urea, respectively, and 156 % more moss compared to untreated. Fertilization with urea (liquid or granular) resulted in the best creeping bentgrass color. Averaged across the entire season, plots treated with organic N had unacceptable color in 2009. Nitrogen concentrations in moss tissue ranged from 0. 4 % to 1. 0 % and were always significantly lower than N concentrations observed in creeping bentgrass (1. 1 % to 2. 1 %), regardless of treatment. In 2010, moss treated with liquid urea had higher tissue N concentrations (1. 0 %) than untreated moss (0. 5 %) or that fertilized with IBDU (0. 4 %). In summary, use of dollar spot-resistant creeping bentgrass cultivars could reduce fungicide requirements. Bicarbonate and essential oil products can reduce moss severity at a similar level to <b>carfentrazone-ethyl,</b> but rates and/or application methods need to be optimized to avoid injury to creeping bentgrass.

40|$|Canola is a cool-season, oilseed crop grown {{throughout}} Europe, Canada, and the Northern Great Plains {{region of}} the United States. The expansion of canola production into new growing regions, such as the Southern Plains region, has resulted in new production challenges. The Southern Plains region cultivates canola as a winter annual compared to a spring annual for the Northern Great Plains and Canada. Given the difference in climate and weed spectrum, region-specific weed management systems need to be developed. Agronomic practices can affect seed oil content, protein content, and fatty acid composition, however the effect of herbicides on these and other characteristic of canola are unknown. Therefore, experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to evaluate {{a broad spectrum of}} herbicides for potential use in South Texas canola production with respect to crop injury, effects on canola seed oil content, fatty acid composition, weed control, biomass yield, and forage quality. Visual crop injury at 42 DAE was unacceptable for saflufenacil at both 0. 12 and 0. 06 kg ai ha- 1 and ethalfluralin at 1. 05 kg ai ha- 1. Trifluralin at 1. 12 and 0. 56 kg ai ha- 1, S-metolachlor at 2. 14 and 1. 07 kg ai ha- 1, pyroxasulfone at 0. 24 and 0. 12 kg ai ha- 1, and pendimethalin at 0. 8 kg ai ha- 1 had lowest visual injury of all treatments. Fluroxypyr applied EPOST caused severe injury at both 0. 21 and 0. 11 kg ae ha- 1. All other EPOST treatments did not cause any visible injury. Seed oil content was not affected by the herbicides evaluated. Fatty acid composition, specifically stearic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, and oleic to linolenic acid ratio, was affected by herbicide treatments. This research found that protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPG oxidase) inhibitor herbicides, such as <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> and saflufenacil, negatively affect canola oil quality. Biomass yield was improved for all herbicide treatments except pendimethalin PRE when compared to the untreated plots. Crude protein content of canola forage was not affected by herbicide treatment. Digestible dry matter appeared to be reduced by treatments that included an EPOST application of sethoxydim. The research shows that pendimethalin and S-metolachlor may be suitable for canola production in South Texas based on low crop injury and effective weed control.

However, PMN seedlings are impacted by competition from nearby weeds for water, nutrients, and sunlight during establishment. To date, there is limited agronomic information on strategies for effective establishment of weed-free PMN stands. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop herbicide response tests to determine the phytotoxic effects of selected pre-crop emergence (PRE) and post-crop emergence herbicides (POST) on the seeded establishment of PMN. Several herbicides with utility for weed free establishment of seeded PMN were successfully identified. Pre-emergent herbicides Balance Pro (isoxaflutole), Dual II (s-metolachlor,) Plateau (imazapic), and Permit (halosulfuron) were effective as long as sufficient rates of seed safener were used. Post-crop emergent herbicides Permit (halosulfuron), Prowl (pendimethalin), Banvel (dicamba), Aatrex (atrazine), AIM (<b>carfentrazone-ethyl),</b> Warrant (achetochlor), and Huskie (pyrasulfotole) were also found to be safe for use at the 5 - 7 leaf stage and beyond...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carfentrazone-ethyl</b> (CE) is {{a reduced}} risk {{herbicide}} {{that is currently}} being evaluated for the control of aquatic weeds. Greenhouse trials were conducted to determine efficacy of CE on water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms- Laub.), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.), salvinia (Salvinia minima Baker) and landoltia (Landoltia punctata (G. Mey.) Les & D. J. Crawford). CE controlled water lettuce, water hyacinth and salvinia at rates less than the maximum proposed use rate of 224 g ha - 1. Water lettuce was the most susceptible to CE with an EC 90 of 26. 9 and 33. 0 g ha - 1 in two separate trials. Water hyacinth EC 90 values were calculated to be 86. 2 to 116. 3 g ha - 1, and salvinia had a similar susceptibility to water hyacinth with an EC 90 of 79. 1 g ha - 1. Landoltia was not adequately controlled at the rates evaluated. In addition, CE was applied to one-half of a 0. 08 ha pond located in North Central, Florida to determine dissipation rates in water and hydrosoil when applied at an equivalent rate of 224 g ha - 1. The half-life of CE plus the primary metabolite, CE-chloropropionic acid, was calculated to be 83. 0 h from the whole pond, and no residues were detected in water above the limit of quantification (5 μg L - 1) 168 h after treatment. CE dissipated rapidly from the water column, did not occur in the sediment above the levels of quantification, and in greenhouse studies effectively controlled three species of aquatic weeds at relatively low rates.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2005 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center. The objective was to compare the performance of various PPO inhibitors [Aim (<b>carfentrazone-ethyl),</b> ET (pyraflufen-ethyl), Blizzard (fluthiacet-methyl) and Resource(flumiclorac) ] as stand-alone defoliation treatments either as a single or sequential application, or tank mixed with Ginstar or CottonQuik. Plots were arranged in a randomized, complete block design with four replicates. Each plot was composed of four, 40 inch rows that measured 25 feet long. Delta and Pine variety DP 449 BR was planted on 12 April 2005. Treatments included: Ginstar @ 6 oz/A, Ginstar @ 8 oz/A, Aim @ 1 oz/A, ET @ 1. 5 oz/A, Resource @ 8 oz/A and Blizzard @ 0. 5 oz/A, Aim followed by Aim, ET followed by ET, Blizzard followed by Blizzard, Resource followed by Resource, Ginstar @ 6 oz/A plus Aim, Ginstar plus ET, Ginstar plus Resource, Ginstar plus Blizzard, CottonQuik at 32 oz/A plus Aim, CottonQuik plus ET, CottonQuik plus Resource, and CottonQuik plus Blizzard. All treatments receiving a PPO inhibitor also contained a Crop Oil Concentrate at 1 % v/v. None of the PPO inhibitors applied as a single application performed as well as Ginstar at either the 6 oz/A or 8 oz/A rates. At 14 days after treatment (DAT), both Aim and Blizzard achieved 74 % defoliation, Resource 69 % and ET 60 %. For sequential applications at 14 DAT, Aim at 1. 5 oz/A followed eight days later by a second application of Aim performed as well as the standalone applications of Ginstar at 6 oz/A and 8 oz/A. Two applications of Blizzard at 0. 5 oz/A eight days apart defoliated as well as Ginstar at 6 oz/A. Tank mixing any of the four PPO inhibitors with Ginstar did not improve defoliation over Ginstar alone, at either rate nor did defoliation rates decrease {{as a result of the}} mixes.

40|$|O gênero Conyza inclui aproximadamente 60 espécies, as quais se distribuem em quase todo o mundo. As espécies Conyza canadensis e Conyza bonariensis, destacam-se por infestarem áreas abandonadas (terrenos baldios e margens de estradas), pastagens, culturas perenes (citros e café) e lavouras anuais (algodão, milho, soja e trigo). Em termos mundiais, estas espécies daninhas infestam mais de 40 culturas. É importante, quando se pensa em manejo das plantas daninhas, conhecer a biologia das plantas alvos, para assim detectar qual é o melhor controle e momento de ação. O experimento foi realizado no Centro de Ciências Agrárias/UFSCar, entre os anos de 2010 e 2011. Os objetivos desta pesquisa foram: (1) determinar o comportamento germinativo de C. canadensis e C. bonariensis em diferentes condições de temperatura (10 oC, 15 oC, 20 oC, 25 oC, 30 oC e 35 oC), luz (presença e ausência), profundidade de semeadura (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, e 10 cm) e germinação em solos com diferentes texturas (arenosa, média e argilosa); (2) caracterizar a superfície foliar das diferentes espécies de C. bonariensis e C. canadensis através da microscopia eletrônica de varredura; (3) determinar o tipo de interação do herbicida {{glyphosate}} (0, 42 kg i. a ha- 1), quando em mistura com amônio glufosinato (0, 5 kg i. a ha- 1), bentazon (0, 72 kg i. a ha- 1), chlorimuron - ethyl (0, 15 kg i. a ha- 1), carfentrazone - ethyl (0, 03 kg i. a ha- 1), 2, 4 -D (1, 0 L i. a ha- 1), metribuzin (0, 48 kg i. a ha- 1) e sulfentrazone (0, 6 kg i. a ha- 1), além dos mesmos herbicidas aplicados isoladamente. Para C. bonariensis e C. canadensis, a melhor temperatura para a germinação das sementes e índice de velocidade de germinação foi de aproximadamente 250 C; ambas as espécies obtiveram maior taxa de germinação quando submetidas à luz comparadas com o tratamento de escuro absoluto, em relação à profundidade de semeadura nos diferentes solos, as sementes de ambas as espécies obtiveram maior taxa de emergência em solo de textura média quando estavam na superfície do solo (0 cm) a partir de 0, 5 cm ocorreu redução da emergência das plântulas. Ambas as espécies são anfiestomáticas, apresentam estômatos na superfície adaxial e abaxial, possuem tricomas tectores unicelulares e pluricelulares, sendo que a espécie C. bonariensis possui visualmente maior quantidade de tricomas na face adaxial. Em relação ao manejo químico os tratamentos utilizando glyphosate + amônio - glufosinato, glyphosate + bentazon, glyphosate + chlorimuron - ethyl e glyphosate + metribuzin foram mais efetivos no controle de C. bonariensis; para C. canadensis, os melhores tratamentos foram às misturas de glyphosate + amônio - glufosinato, glyphosate + bentazon e glyphosate + metribuzin. The genus Conyza includes approximately 60 species, {{which are}} distributed {{throughout most of}} the world. Globally the weed species Conyza canadensis and Conyza bonariensis infest more than 40 types of crops. Both species are noted for their ability to infest abandoned areas (vacant lots and roadsides), pastures, perennial crops (citrus and coffee) and annual crops (cotton, corn, soybeans and wheat). Knowledge of the biology of these weeds is required to inform management actions to control their spread for example to identify which is the best control strategy and time for action. We conducted experiments at the Center for Agricultural Sciences / UFSCar, between 2010 and 2011, to achieve 3 research objectives: (1) determine the germination behavior of C. canadensis and C. bonariensis under different environmental conditions [different temperatures (10 oC, 15 oC, 20 oC, 25 oC, 30 oC and 35 oC), light (with and without), sowing depth (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 cm) and germination in soils with different textures (sand, intermediate and clay) ], (2) characterize the different types of leaf surface of C. bonariensis and C. canadensis by scanning electron microscopy, (3) determine the effects of the application of the herbicide glyphosate (0. 42 kg a. i. ha- 1), when mixed with ammonium glyphosate (0. 5 kg a. i. ha- 1), bentazon (0. 72 kg a. i. ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0. 15 kg a. i. ha- 1), <b>carfentrazone-ethyl</b> (0. 03 kg a. i. ha- 1), 2, 4 -D (1. 0 L a. i. ha- 1), metribuzin (0. 48 kg a. i. ha- 1) and sulfentrazone (0. 6 kg ha- 1), in addition to these herbicides applied in isolation. For both C. bonariensis and C. canadensis, the best seed germination and germination rate temperature was approximately 250 C. Seed germination rate of both species was higher when exposed to light, compared with seeds germinated in the dark. Sowing depth and soil texture also influenced germination, with seeds of both species showing higher emergence rates in intermediate texture soils when they were sown on the soil surface (0 cm), whereas emergence rates declined at sowing depths &# 8805; 0. 5 cm. Analysis of leaf surfaces revealed that both species are amphistomatic with stomata on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, that the non-glandular trichomes are unicellular and multicellular, and that C. bonariensis has a visually larger amount of trichomes on the adaxial surface. The most effective herbicide treatments for the chemical control of C. bonariensis were glyphosate + ammonium glyphosate, glyphosate + bentazon, glyphosate + chlorimuron - ethyl and glyphosate + metribuzin, whereas for C. canadensis, the best treatments were mixtures of glyphosate + ammonium glyphosate, glyphosate + bentazon and glyphosate + metribuzin...|$|E
