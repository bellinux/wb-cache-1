40|$|Motivated by {{an early}} {{conjecture}} that vortex cut-and-connect {{plays a key}} role in mixing and production of turbulence, helicity and aerodynamic noise, the cross-linking of two antiparallel viscous vortex tubes via direct numerical simulation is studied. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved by a dealiased pseudo-spectral method with 64 cubed grid points in a periodic domain for initial Reynolds numbers Re up to 1000. The vortex tubes are given an initial sinusoidal perturbation to induce a collision and keep the two tubes pressed against each other as annihilation <b>continues.</b> Cross-sectional and <b>wire</b> plots of various properties depict three stages of evolution: (1) Inviscid induction causing vortex cores to first approach and form a contact zone with a dipole cross-section, and then to flatten and stretch; (2) Vorticity annihilation in the contact zone accompanied by bridging between the two vortices at both ends of the contact zone due to a collection of cross-linked vortex lines, now orthogonal to the initial vortex tubes. The direction of dipole advection in the contact zone reverses; and (3) Threading of the remnants of the original vortices in between the bridges as they pull apart. The crucial stage 2 is shown to be a simple consequence of vorticity annihilation in the contact zone, link-up of the un-annihilated parts of vortex lines, and stretching and advection by the vortex tube swirl of the cross-linked lines, which accumulate at stagnation points in front of the annihilating vortex dipole. It is claimed that bridging is the essence of any vorticity cross-linking and that annihilation is sustained by stretching of the dipole by the bridges. Vortex reconnection details are found to be insensitive to asymmetry. Modeling of the reconnection process is briefly examined.

The purpose of this research was the identification of heavy metals and other potentially harmful elements emitted during the combustion and baling of polyvinyl chloride insulated copper wire. Analysis of the smoke produced during the burning was conducted and compared to the airborne dust samples collected during the baling process. From these results, occupational exposures to heavy metals during the reclamation of PVC insulated copper wire were assessed. Bulk ash and dust samples were ?aken to compare {{to each other and to}} the air samples to examine the similarities and/or differences that existed between the samples. Neutron activation analysis was used to determine the components found in the bulk ash and dust samples. Atomic absorption was used to analyze the air samples collected during the baling and combustion of PVC insulated copper wire. Particle size distributions were measured using an Anderson 2000 cascade impactor. All tests were performed according to existing standards. The air sampling data yielded some surprising results. These results indicated potentially high occupational exposures to lead and copper while antimony, cadmium, and barium were not detected. This was startling considering previous research indicated the potential for antimony, cadmium, and barium, to be found in quantities that could exceed occupational exposures, but not for lead or copper. The combustion samples taken for five minutes in the smoke plume showed lead and copper results exceeding the allowed daily exposure in 5 to 8 minutes. Although the lead and copper samples taken during the baling operation did not exceed the allowed daily exposure, the results did show potentially high exposures to workers if the baling of burned copper <b>wire</b> <b>continued</b> for the duration of the workshift.

40|$|Lysefjord Suspension Bridge, with a {{main span}} of 446 meters, has had {{problems}} with wire fractures in the main cables. This is reducing the durability of the bridge. Since {{the opening of the}} bridge in December 1997, over 1400 outer wire fractures have been detected. No clear reason for the failure has been found, but some material defects in the wires could be part of the reason. If the <b>wires</b> <b>continue</b> to fracture with the same rate as today, the main cables have to be maintained more often, and maybe changed much earlier than they were planned for in the beginning. Therefore, the bridge should be further analyzed, to detect any other reasons for the wire fractures, and to determine how and when the main cables should be maintained or changed. A new finite element model is created in ABAQUS, and an eigen value analysis of the bridge model is carried out. A brief analysis of the fractures in light of the weather around the bridge is given. The main components of a suspension bridge are described, and analytical calculations are done based on equations from Bleich and Steinman to verify the results from ABAQUS and Alvsat. The bridge behavior during wind loading was briefly checked, and the displacement from wind load, from a 50 year wind speed, on the bridge has been examined. The loading from this wind speed, with coefficients that take into account different angles of the bridge girder, has been created in ABAQUS, through several iterations. The eigenfrequency analysis done in ABAQUS and the analytical calculations give results that are in the same range as the ones from the original analysis done in Alvsat. The result from the analysis of the weather around the bridge in a period with many wire fractures indicates that after a sudden drop in temperature, many wire fractures occur. The critical wind velocity in regard to vortex induced vibrations is 7. 5 m/s for the first vertical symmetric mode, this is a wind speed that can occur around the bridge, and fatigue in the wires could {{be a part of the}} reason for the cable fractures. The demand/capacity rate for the main cables with dead load is 25. 2 %. The results from this work can be used when deciding what to emphasize in further analysis of Lysefjord Bridge...|$|R

Theirs are succinct and eloquent songs; in a long career <b>Wire</b> <b>continue</b> to deal in short, sharp shocks." [...] The review by Tim Klingbiel on Australian music website FasterLouder noted that [...] "From seething political references to prophetic statements about the environment, Red Barked Tree deals {{with a range of}} subjects in a magnificently compelling and thought provoking way", and that the record [...] "serves as an indication that Wire have returned to form in a massive way, and remain just as relevant today as they were 35 years ago".
