40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of magnetic {{field on the}} process of steepening or flattening of the characteristic wave fronts in a plane and cylindrically symmetric motion of an ideal plasma is investigated. This aspect of the problem has not been considered until now. Remarkable differences between plane, cylindrical diverging, and <b>cylindrical</b> converging <b>waves</b> are discovered. For instance, when the adiabatic index γ is 2, the magnetic field does not affect the behaviour of plane waves, but does affect <b>cylindrical</b> <b>waves.</b> As the field strength increases, the time tc taken for the shock formation varies monotonically for plane <b>waves,</b> while for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>waves,</b> in some situations tc exhibits a unique minimum for diverging waves and a unique maximum for converging <b>waves.</b> For <b>cylindrical</b> converging <b>waves,</b> a shock formation takes place if and only if, γ and the field strength are restricted to certain finite intervals. Moreover, tc is bounded in all cases except for <b>cylindrical</b> diverging <b>waves.</b> The discontinuity in the velocity gradient at the wave front is shown to satisfy a Bernoulli-type equation. The discussion of the solutions of such equations reported in the literature is shown to be incomplete, and three general theorems are established...|$|R

Differentiating itself from conventional 'ring-style' transducer arrays which attempt to steer longitudinal axisymmetric <b>cylindrical</b> <b>waves</b> via transducer synchronism, this sparse sensor network shows advantages in some aspects, including the use of fewer sensors, simpler manipulation, quicker configuration, less mutual dependence among sensors, and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The sparse network is expanded topologically, aimed at eliminating the presence of 'blind zones' and the challenges associated with multi-path propagation of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>waves.</b> Theoretical analysis is implemented to comprehend propagation characteristics of waves guided by a cylindrical structure. A probability-based diagnostic imaging algorithm is introduced to visualize damage in pixelated images in an intuitive, prompt, and automatic manner. A self-contained health monitoring system is configured for experimental validation, via which quantitative identification of mono- and multi-damage in a steel cylinder is demonstrated.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{nonlinear}} elastic wave propagation {{has been of}} considerable interest {{for the last four}} decades. This, in part, {{is due to the fact}} that nonlinear parameters are, in general, more sensitive to structural defects than linear parameters. Although guided waves combine the sensitivity of nonlinear parameters with large inspection ranges there are very few studies of guided nonlinear elastic waves due to the mathematical complexity of the problem. This paper presents a theoretical study into nonlinear Lamb <b>waves</b> and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>waves.</b> It has been known that the nonlinearity driven double harmonic in Lamb waves does not support antisymmetric motion.

40|$|Abstract—Off-the-horizon {{propagation}} severely degrades {{the accuracy}} of any field reconstruction technique that presupposes a two-dimensional (2 -D) wireless channel. Therefore, employing the 2 -D <b>cylindrical</b> <b>wave</b> expansion (CWE) to interpolate perimeter channel measurements into a planar region often yields poor results.
