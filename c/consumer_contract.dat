The topic of unfair terms is vast, and could equally include specific contracts falling under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Legislation, particularly regarding consumer protection, is also frequently being updated by the European Union, in laws like the Flight Delay Compensation Regulation, or the Electronic Commerce Directive, which are subsequently translated into domestic law through a statutory instrument authorised through the European Communities Act 1972 section 2(2), as for example with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000.

2500|$|If an {{enforceable}} agreement – {{a contract}} – exists, {{the details of}} the contract's terms matter if one party has allegedly broken the agreement. A contract's terms are what was promised. Yet {{it is up to the}} courts to construe evidence of what the parties said before a contract's conclusion, and construe the terms agreed. Construction of the contract starts with the express promises people make to one another, but also with terms found in other documents or notices that were intended to be incorporated. The general rule is that reasonable notice of the term is needed, and more notice is needed for an onerous term. The meaning of those terms must then be interpreted, and the modern approach is to construe the meaning of an agreement from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the whole context. The courts, as well as legislation, may also imply terms into contracts generally to 'fill gaps' as necessary to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the parties, or as necessary incidents to specific contracts. English law had, particularly in the late 19th century, adhered to the laissez faire principle of [...] "freedom of contract" [...] so that, in the general law of contract, people can agree to whatever terms or conditions they choose. By contrast, specific contracts, particularly for consumers, employees or tenants were built to carry a minimum core of rights, mostly deriving from statute, that aim to secure the fairness of contractual terms. The evolution of case law in the 20th century generally shows an ever-clearer distinction between general contracts among commercial parties and those between parties of unequal bargaining power, since in these groups of transaction true choice is thought to be hampered by lack of real competition in the market. Hence, some terms can be found to be unfair under statutes such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or the Unfair Terms in <b>Consumer</b> <b>Contract</b> Regulations 1999 and can be removed by the courts, with the administrative assistance of the Competition and Markets Authority.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} important terms o f the consumer law i. e. standard terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts,</b> which in Polish civil law is functioning as “wzorzec umowy konsumenckiej”. In order to propose its definition, the author analysed the civil code provisions regulating the institution of standard terms (art. 384), the unfair terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts</b> (art. and the provisions of the Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts.</b> Based on the institution of standard terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts,</b> three major issues have been flagged out: 1) the content of standard terms in consumer contracts; 2) the manner of their edition; 3) the medium of transfer. It has been concluded that only the content of the standard terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts</b> is controlled by the institution of unfair terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts</b> (art. 385 '- 3853 k. c.). In the author’s opinion the Civil Code has introduced the principle of freedom in regard to the way both of edition (art. 384) and the type of the transfer media (art. 60). Further, the author states that the term “standard terms in consumer contracts” is a declaration of will made by the entrepreneur, or the enterprise, regulating mass goods within the scope of his specific, professional business activity. Standard terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>contracts</b> are formulated in order to make an unlimited number of contracts with an unlimited number of consumers and that is why they do not contain provisions defining an individual consumer or the subject of a given contract...|$|R

50|$|The Rome I Regulation {{constrains}} {{the choice}} of law for special types of contracts. With a view to the weaker parties, such as consumers, employees and insurants, special choice of law rules are laid down by articles 5-8. The most important rules for companies, mostly closing contracts with consumers, are listed in Art. 6. Art. 6 (I) defines the <b>consumer</b> <b>contract</b> as a contract where the consumer acts as a private person whereas the businessman acts for his commercial purpose. This articles also says that in absence of an explicit choice of law, a protected <b>consumer</b> <b>contract</b> is governed by {{the law of the}} consumer's habitual residence. In Art. 6 (II) the involved parties are given the possibility of a free choice of law. But {{the choice of}} law is legally void, if the consumer protection is limited by this choice.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{regarded}} as consumer contracts, several requirements must be met.

Third, the <b>consumer</b> <b>contract</b> must be concluded with a consumer, implying that the concerning party is a “private final consumer not engaged in trade or professional activities”. As this protection is an exception to the general rule, it is the person invoking the protection to prove that he is a consumer, and if there is business and personal use to his purchase, to prove that “the business use is only negligible”. The court must not only take into consideration the [...] "content, nature and purpose" [...] of the contract, but also the [...] "objective circumstances in which it was concluded".|$|E

50|$|Beyond common law, {{there are}} three main kinds of {{statutory}} protection. First, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 codified a system of licensing for mortgage lenders.

Second, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 empowers the Office of Fair Trading to engage in similar regulation of the second mortgage market. Third, the content of mortgage is regulated by ordinary <b>consumer</b> <b>contract</b> protection in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.

50|$|The most {{relevant}} protective measure at common law {{today is the}} right of borrowers to cancel mortgages if they were misrepresented about the mortgage's terms, or if they entered agreements because of undue influence. In the leading case, Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge, a group of appeals all involved a husband allegedly pressuring his wife into signing a mortgage agreement with a bank, where security was over the family home. The House of Lords agreed that undue influence would make a contract voidable, and if a bank should have realised this possibility, it could not enforce the mortgage agreement against the spouse's share of the home. Accordingly, if banks wished to ensure valid mortgages {{they would need to}} have confirmation from an independent solicitor that the spouse fully understood the transaction. This ruling was intended to eliminate cases where people do not understand the consequences of mortgages. Alternatively, if despite independent advice, a spouse is still unduly influenced or is misrepresented the facts, he or she will have no recourse against a bank selling the home, but may have a claim against the solicitor for professional negligence.
