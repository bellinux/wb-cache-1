40|$|The {{main problem}} {{examined}} in the current article is the evaluation of <b>tax</b> <b>system.</b> It is suggested that <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> should be evaluated through the hierarchical evaluation system consisting of primary, partially-integrated and complex-integrated indicators.

The system is built taking into consideration the requirements of consistency, comparability and simplicity, and aimed at objective and accurate evaluation of <b>tax</b> <b>systems.</b> The synthesis of partially integrated indicators creates preconditions for complex evaluation of <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> enabling identification of the quality of <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> and comparison of <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> of various countries.

40|$|Different <b>tax</b> <b>systems,</b> {{and their}} impact on work {{motivation}} and tax compliance are significant issues in contemporary political and economic debates. The proportional feature of a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> is assumed to lead to higher performance, while the fairness of the redistributive progressive <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> is assumed to result in higher tax compliance. However, empirical findings on the topic are inconclusive. Both work performance and tax compliance under different <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> were examined in an experiment, with special attention devoted to the effect of a change in <b>tax</b> <b>systems.</b> A flat <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> was supposed to induce greater work performance, whereas a progressive <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> was expected to increase tax compliance based on fairness perceptions, allowing for the opposite effect due to higher complexity. Furthermore, it was assumed that performance and tax payments would be influenced by motives of self-interest. The design included 20 rounds with a real-effort task in each round, determining participants' experimental income. Participants (N = 191) made decisions about their tax payments from round-to-round in four different experimental conditions: (1) a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> (2) a progressive <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> (3) starting with a flat and changing to a progressive, and (4) starting with a progressive and changing to a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system.</b> Results indicate higher work performance in a progressive system.
