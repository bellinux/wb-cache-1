25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI <b>compatible</b> <b>peripherals</b> {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a docking station cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A docking station for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or floppy disk drive controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the docking station. Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one docking station at one time. For example, a docking station for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic docking station, containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|E
25|$|The A600 is {{the first}} of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This {{connector}} allows use of a number of <b>compatible</b> <b>peripherals</b> available for the laptop-computer market, though only 16-bit (Type II) PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit CardBus or PC Card peripherals are incompatible. The port is not fully compliant with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM cards, CD-ROM controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore's expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and CompactFlash adapters.|$|E

50|$|The declining cost of IBM compatibles {{on the one}} hand, and the greatly {{increased}} graphics, sound, and storage abilities of fourth generation video game consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System on the other, combined to cause the market segment for home computers to vanish by the early 1990s in the US.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{availability of}} relatively cheap, reliable {{and easy to}} use digital camera traps has led to their extensive use for wildlife research, monitoring and public outreach. Users of these units are, however, often frustrated by the limited options for controlling camera functions, the generation of large numbers of images, and the lack of flexibility to suit different research environments and questions. We describe the development of a user-customisable open source camera trap platform named 'WiseEye', designed to provide flexible camera trap technology for wildlife researchers. The novel platform is based on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and <b>compatible</b> <b>peripherals</b> that allow the user to control its functions and performance. We introduce the concept of confirmatory sensing, in which the Passive Infrared triggering is confirmed through other modalities (i. e. radar, pixel change) to reduce the occurrence of false positives images. This concept, together with user-definable metadata, aided identification of spurious images and greatly reduced post-collection processing time. When tested against a commercial camera trap, WiseEye was found to reduce the incidence of false positive images and false negatives across a range of test conditions. WiseEye represents a step-change in camera trap functionality, greatly increasing the value of this technology for wildlife research and conservation management...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) /Inertial Navigation System (INS) {{has become very}} important in various navigation applications. In the last decade, with the rapid development of Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS), great interest has been generated in low cost integrated GPS/INS applications. This paper presents a PC 104 based low cost GPS/INS integrated navigation platform. The platform hardware consists of low cost inertial sensors and an assembly of various PC 104 <b>compatible</b> <b>peripherals,</b> such as data acquisition card, GPS receiver, Ethernet card, mother board, graphic card, etc. The platform software including inertial/GPS data acquisition, inertial navigation calculation and integrated GPS/INS Kalman filter is implemented with Simulink, which can be directly loaded and processed in the PC 104 mother board {{with the aid of}} Matlab Real-Time Workshop (RTW) utility. This platform is totally self-embedded and can be applied independently or as part of a system. Simulation and real data experiments have been performed to validate and evaluate the proposed design. A very low cost MEMS inertial sensor was utilized in the experiments. The reference is the navigation solution derived from a tactic grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Test results show that PC 104 navigation platform delivers the integrated navigation solutions comparable to the reference solutions, which were calculated with a conventional laptop computer, however with less power consumptions, less system volume/complexity and much lower over-all costs. Moreover the platform hardware is compatible to various inertial sensors of different grades by configuring the related parameters in the system software...|$|E

Potentials, evoked by monaural 80 dBnHL (re. human threshold) clicks, were studied before, {{and up to}} 7 weeks after inducing neuronal lesions localized to the cochlear nucleus (CN) or the superior olivary complex (SOC), or myelin lesions localized to the fibers of the trapezoid body connecting these two structures. Neuronal lesions were induced by injection of kainic acid (KA), while myelin lesions were induced by injection of L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). With CN neuronal lesions the major changes in 3 CLT were in the time domain of 'b', 'c' and 'd' (components P 2, P 3 and P 4 of single-channel ABEP). With SOC neuronal lesions the major changes were in 'c' and 'd' of 3 CLT (P 3 and P 4 of ABEP). With trapezoid body lesions the major change was in 'c' (P 3 of ABEP). The results are <b>compatible</b> with the <b>peripheral</b> generation of the first ABEP components (P 1 a and P 1 b).
