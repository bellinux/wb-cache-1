50|$|The {{effects of}} contact bounce can be {{eliminated}} {{by use of}} mercury-wetted contacts, but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release. Alternatively, <b>contact</b> <b>circuit</b> voltages can be low-pass filtered to reduce or eliminate multiple pulses from appearing. In digital systems, multiple samples of the contact state can be taken {{at a low rate}} and examined for a steady sequence, so that contacts can settle before the contact level is considered reliable and acted upon. Bounce in SPDT switch contacts signals can be filtered out using a SR flip-flop (latch) or Schmitt trigger. All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'.|$|E

It appears {{as one of}} possible concretizations of a more general “convolutional” approach to the lower bounds problem worked out by the author in 1984 [12]. The method {{is based on an}} appropriate notion of “inner information” or “entropy” of finite objects (circuits, Boolean functions, etc.). Lower bounds on the complexity are obtained by means of entropy-preserving embeddings of circuits into the more restricted ones. This allows to prove in a uniform and easy way that contact circuits, which are local in a sense that the function computed by a subcircuit weakly depends on the whole circuit, require 2 Ω(√n) or even 2 Ω(nlog n) contacts to compute some explicitly defined n-argument Boolean functions from NP...|$|E

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] design logic circuits based {{on the notion of}} zero forcing on graphs; each gate of the circuits is a gadget in which zero forcing is performed. We show that such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two vertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also highlight a phenomenon of ?back forcing? as a property of each function. Such a phenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already used at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually performed at a later stage. Finally, we show that zero forcing can be also used to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a potentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular attention to monotonicity. Moreover, in the light of applications of zero forcing in quantum mechanics, the link with Boolean functions may suggest a new directions in quantum control theory and in the study of engineered quantum spin systems. It is an open technical problem to verify whether there is a link between zero forcing and computation with <b>contact</b> <b>circuits.</b> publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Similarly, let d=⋁J∈D⋀j∈Jxj be the irredundant DNF of the same function, where D is the set of the prime implicants of f. We show that given subsets C′⊆C and D′⊆D such that (C′,D′) ≠(C,D), a new term in (C⧹C′) ∪(D⧹D′) can be found in time O(n(t+n)) +mo(logm), where m=|C′|+|D′|. In particular, if f(x) can be evaluated for every x∈{ 0, 1 }n in polynomial time, then the forms c and d can be jointly generated in incremental quasi-polynomial time. On the other hand, even for the class of ∧,∨-formulae f of depth 2, i. e., for CNFs or DNFs, it is unlikely that uniform sampling from within the set of the prime implicates and implicants of f can be carried out in time bounded by a quasi-polynomial 2 polylog(·) in the input size of f. We also show that for some classes of polynomial-time computable monotone Boolean functions it is NP-hard to test either of the conditions D′=D or C′=C. This provides evidence that for each of these classes neither conjunctive nor disjunctive irredundant normal forms can be generated in total (or incremental) quasi-polynomial time.
