40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a software library, called Identity and <b>Certificate</b> <b>Manager</b> (ICM), for managing, using, and exchanging application-level usernames, users' digital certificates, and cryptographic username-certificate bindings. ICM {{can be used}} in a variety of personal communication applications, such as chat, email, VoIP telephony, and web browsing. As part of ICM, we designed and implemented a communication-efficient protocol, called Identity and Certificate Exchange (ICE), for exchanging certificates, usernames, and bindings within applications. The protocol avoids sending redundant information by remembering what information has been sent to whom; this feature is critical in low-bandwidth networks. The protocol also implements a robust fail-over mechanism for handling out-of-sync situations. To illustrate the benefits of ICM and ICE, we used ICM in a plugin for a popular chat-client, called Pidgin. The plugin allows users to engage in authenticated communication over any of the chat protocols supported by Pidgin, such as Jabber and Oscar (AIM). The plugin relies on ICE to provide assurances about users' identities and to efficiently disseminate users' certificates. by Brian C. Wu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the past to the present theoretical development of the management discipline and the practical application {{of it in the}} South African mining industry. The perceived deficiencies of the theoretical and practical management methods were identified and discussed. The role of the mining industry as one of the major contributors to employment, wealth creation, national gross product and national development was discussed. Existing and future challenges were highlighted. A motivation why the existing available theoretical management practices being utilised were inadequate to enable management to manage comprehensively was identified. The management practices utilised or still being utilised in the South African mining industry were investigated and evaluated. The Mine <b>Manager’s</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Competency, as a legally compulsory suitable qualification for a manager to be appointed as a competent person to manage a mine, part of it or works, was also investigated and evaluated. The ideal management method should, at all times, provide in all the present and future theoretical and practical management needs of the total labour force on all the levels of the organisation. It should enable management to efficiently cope with the demands of rapid change and the efficient management of the future. It should ensure that all activities necessary for the efficient functioning of the organisation are totally integrated and coordinated. This management method should facilitate the optimisation of the collective skills, loyalty and dedication of all the employees on all the levels of the organisation. It should primarily optimise the desired planned results. Such a management method could not be ascertained from the literature and practice. It was concluded that the South African mining industry is in dire need of a comprehensive, practical and integrated management method that would, at all times, provide in all the present and future theoretical and practical management needs of the total labour force on all the levels of the organisation. A sustainable, comprehensive, practical and integrated management theory and an implementation procedure, suitable to apply the management theory equally efficiently on all the levels of the organisation, was developed, discussed and proposed in this thesis.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} an {{exploratory}} research {{effort to understand}} hotel future customers’ intentions to adopt and perform {{the three types of}} ethical tourism, namely positive, negative and discursive types. There has been scant research, so far, with regards to ethical behaviour in the tourism sector. In addition there are considerable voids with reference to the factors that are able to affect this type of behaviour. However, in Greece there is already a considerable number of hotels, which have obtained the Green Key <b>certificate.</b> Their <b>managers</b> do need and seek for the most optimum marketing channels to promote their competitive advantages. The present study aimed to offer a somewhat better understanding of future travellers’ intentions to adopt ethical consumption when travelling. Intentions of future travellers to search, plan and actually visit a green hotel was examined. The examination included also consumers’ willingness to participate in a boycotting against an unethical hotel and further spread their word against unethical hotel practices through discursive activities, such as petitions gathering, taking part in protest events etc. In addition, it was aimed to investigate the impact of attitudes and demographics on customers’ intentions to adopt and perform the above mentioned ethical behaviours. With reference to intentions to stay at a green hotel, it was found that potential travellers seem more agreeable to express their willingness to stay at a green hotel than to plan or make an actual effort to do so. The usual in consumer behaviour gap between intentions and actual behaviour was established here once more. It was also found that travellers are very much willing to participate in a hotel boycotting in cases that the hotel under boycotting has been demonstrably reported for safety and hygiene scandals, child labour, cruelty towards animals and particularly barbaric exploitation of their employees. On the con trary, consumers were not found equally willing to participate in discursive activities against unethical hotels. In fact, all they were found to do is to discuss with their friends the possibility of getting engaged in a hotel boycotting. The results also indicated t hat better educated consumers expressed higher level of intentions to stay at a green hotel, to boycott and discursively act against an unethical hotel, than their counterparts did. Women were found more likely to participate in a hotel's boycotting and consume rs of 35 - 44 years of age were found more likely to enhance discursive activities. Attitudes that concern green hotels {{seem to be able to}} influence moderately travellers’ intentions to stay at a green hotel. Intentions are mostly effected by those attitudes that concern consumers’ feelings that staying at a green hotel is favourable and desirable. Attitudes in overall were found to be more able to influence consumers’ willingness to stay at a green hotel than their actual plans or efforts to do so. Attitudes seem to be able, to a lesser extent, to influence consumers’ intentions to get involved in boycotting and discursive activities. These findings, if studied carefully, might very well be found useful to marketing management strategies in cas es of green hotels or hotels, which would decide to “go green” in the future. The Green Key certification should become one of criteria u sed in searching and locating hotels either through internet or the agencies. In addition, enthusiastic testimonials of past customers might very well be incorporated in the communication campaigns of the green hotels...|$|R
40|$|Edwin Henry Hardy {{worked as}} a {{surveyor}} before going to England to study mining. Upon his return in 1896 he was a representative in Hauraki of English mining companies and supervised several Coromandel mines in addition to acquiring mines in several districts for overseas interests. In late 1898 he purchased the former Aroha Gold Mines’ property at Waiorongomai, which he developed using his own financial resources but probably backed by his wider family. Using his surveying skills, he traced a reef missed by previous owners, and commenced to develop the mines systematically. He also spent several years improving the battery, experimenting with new treatment processes and seeking a patent for a gold saving method. Like all mine owners, Hardy tried to work his property as cheaply as possible, resulting in conflicts with the Thames High School and the county council {{as he tried to}} reduce costs. He proved to be very determined in his rows with those he considered his enemies. In addition to developing the Premier mine, profitably, he tested other ground, notable the Big Blow. He supervised both battery and mines, but as {{he did not have a}} mine <b>manager’s</b> <b>certificate</b> had to employ a series of managers for the latter. After obtaining a good return for several years, in 1904 he formed Hardy’s Mines Ltd, retaining a financial interest and for a time supervising its work before becoming involved with other mines and clashing with the company he had formed. Hardy also held interests in mining companies in other districts. After leaving Waiorongomai, he settled in Te Kuiti and {{worked as a}} surveyor, a purchaser of Maori land, and a farmer. As at Coromandel and Waiorongomai, he was prominent in the local community, notably as a member of the borough council and Te Kuiti’s second mayor. Over time, his financial state deteriorated, partly through being involved with some very dubious businessmen and their schemes. In 1931 he returned to Waiorongomai to show his son Malcolm where he knew of some good ore, but died in dramatic circumstances before he could show him the location. For some time Hardy profited from mining, partly because he took over existing workings and partly because he was able to find ore that others had missed, but as with all mining, profits faded and he had to find other ways to earn a living. But compared with other mine owners at Waiorongomai, he was, for a time, very successful...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the act of}} 1887, {{there have}} {{followed}} five minor acts, based {{on the recommendation of}} the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (" [...] owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager [...] ") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a <b>manager's</b> <b>certificate</b> a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.|$|R

Visual cues such as buttons and icons (e. g. the print button) are often shared between programs. Similarities can be used to impress the knowledge that the software really isn’t impossible to learn. If a person has learned to use one system in the past, there should be no reason why they can’t be trained to use another system. The learners should be encouraged to think. It is import for them to know what they are trying to do. If the person is just clicking buttons at random, chances are they’ll end up with results that they did not expect. If the person knows what they want to accomplish chances are, they’ll be able to relate that goal to visual clues that they see on the screen. If I want to send an email, I look for an envelope. It was suggested that trainers can relate the software to what the users already know. An analogy of learning to drive a new vehicle is a good example. Most people have some idea of how to drive but tend to be very comfortable with the vehicles they drive on a daily basis. Most vehicles have brakes and steering wheel but how those devices function can vary slightly. The extra features such as the audio system might be confusing for new users. It may not occur to the new driver that he or she needs to use the touch LCD screen to adjust the volume or change the radio station. If the person can think of the LCD as the radio then perhaps some of the characteristics of the controls on the old car can be related to the controls on the new car. Concepts should be introduced in small steps in sequence. For example if the system can be though of as a house the first thing they need to before they can get in the house is to get open the door. The login prompt {{can be thought of as}} the door. If they have the right key, they’ll be let in the house. Once the person is inside the house, further training can proceed. The rate at which training proceeds will vary depending on the experience levels of each person. From the Silent Generation to Generation X, Y and Z: Strategies for Managing the Generation Mix – Grinnell College, Valparaiso University, and Hamilton College This presentation focused on people’s opinions of the different generations in today’s workplace. Videos were shown of subjects of varying ages who provided their opinions of generations in which they were not a part of. The presenters encouraged interaction from the audience. As to be expected individual opinions and thoughts were often quite different. Open Source – A Practical Solution – Amherst College During the Spring and Summer seasons of 2006 Amherst College’s was required to find a new ticket tracking system. Up till then they had been using Heat. While they did not go in to specifics they said part of the reason for the decision was the “quirkiness of some of the modules and costly maintenance fees”. They also had IT groups who resisted using the software. They desired a web based solution which is something that Heat could not yet offer. The popularity of open source software was on the rise within their institution. The new software would have to enhance collaboration with IT, augment support efforts for constituencies outside of IT and offer a self service component. They put out a short RFP that focused on core requirements and thoroughly tested four or five systems that they had short listed and recorded the results on a wiki. They included as many Help desk staff as were willing to participate in the test. They looked at OSU ticket tracking software and RuQueue but decided on RT ticket tracking software by Best Practical. The developers of RT published a book, RT Essentials in 2005 which provides documentation for the end user as well advance customization techniques. The book references wiki. bestpractical. com and www. bestpractical. com/rt/lists. html. Both links are useful for bug fixes and feature requests. It is possible to interact with RT entirely by email. Pre-defined scripts can control and record behavior and responses. It sounds like these scripts function much in the same we as our in house built scripts that are used to interact with Heat. The three major components of the system are tickets, queues and email notifications. Queues are used to provide access to control tickets or a specific department. Email notifications alert users of a transaction within the system. Access rights and permissions can be granted at the user or group or global level. The RT database is populated with information that is uploaded nightly from the college’s administration system. The information includes profile and contact type information for faculty, staff, students and alumni. They are not yet using the self service module but have been developing it with plans to use it as an educational tool and a forum for dialog. Overhaul You Helpdesk Ticketing System – Massachusetts College of Art Massachusetts College of Art (MassArt) was using a homegrown ticketing system. It was not user friend and as a result, largely unused. They implemented Unipress Footprints 7 and have since upgraded to version 7. 5. It is linked to their LDAP server for authentication and has a dynamic link address book. Reporting features and survey tools are included. The software is 100 % web based on runs on Windows 2003 Server. The Helpdesk had been struggling before they implemented Footprints. Customers would approach individual IT people directly. The previous system was developed by a student. I get the impression that it was not being supported. A single admin account was used to access the system which made it impossible to track who was working on what. The system lacked reporting features and had no options for customization. Since they are a small institution they opted to purchase a solution rather than develop one. They evaluated GWI’s Incident, BMC’s Remedy and Numara’s TrackIT. The main reason Footprints was selected was due to the fact that it was web based and easy to customize. Footprints ships with 13 different base configurations including “Corporate Help Desk”, “Asset Requisitioning”, “Facilities Management”, and “Sales Tracking”. Following installation they connected the system to their LDAP server. They encountered a few connections problems which Unipress helped them to resolve. Since they were unfamiliar with this type of system they said the learning curve was steep but training was provided on a one on one basis with several short group demonstrations. A week long administrator training course is offered by Unipress and the presenter felt that it was well worth the cost. Since implementation 10 months ago they have logged over 1700 tickets. The presenter could not stress the fact enough that the ticketing system should supplement the business practices of an organization. The business practices should not conform to the design of the system. The ticketing system should help to stream line processes and communications but should not replace what already works. Who’s Really in Your Top 8 : Network Security in the Age of Social Networking – University of Delaware This presentation focused security concerns such as social engineering and how those concerns relate to popular social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, Ruckus, Friendster, LinkedIn, SecondLife and even YouTube. Social networking services encourage people to share information in order to keep friend up to date and to help meet new people. While the sharing of information may sound harmless it’s important to remember that the information provided could be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft. Social engineering is not a new concept. It could be referred to as a con or a scam or in the IT world you may hear terms such as “Phishing” or “Spoofing”. The purpose is often to obtain money, goods or even information that can be used to cause damage or obtain money and/or goods. An example might be if an attacker obtains a person’s and birth date and company email address from a Face book profile. Once the attacker has gather the required information, the attacker could phone the IT services department and request a password reset for that email account. Assuming the IT services department uses birth date to verify the caller, the attacker may obtain access to the victims email account. Email accounts can potentially house confidential or sensitive information such customer information or other passwords. While it is possible for individuals and organizations to mitigate the risk of social engineering type attacks by adopting strict control over what information they provide and how they deliver it, there is no solution that will work 100 % of the time. There is always the human factor to consider. All individuals on some level desire to be accepted and fit in. Attackers and predators prey on these vulnerabilities. Educating individuals and organizations helps to prevent these incidents from occurring but does not guarantee that social engineering attacks will not succeed. Virtualization’s Next Frontier: Security – Ringling College of Art and Design Today virtualization typically refers to the process of running a virtual computer inside a host system (often a virtual server). The virtual operating system operates independently from the hardware and operating system that is installed in the host system. In other words, the virtual machine doesn’t care what the host server’s operating system is. The virtual machines operating system could be Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the host server’s operating system could be Linux. The virtual machine simply exists as a series of files on the host computers hard drive. Server virtualization can improve overall system security and reliability by isolating processes and services from other software stacks. Although multiple virtual machines may be housed by one virtual server, those virtual machines operate independently of each other. Software updates can be applied to the various virtual machines without fear of breaking other processes and services that may not be related to the processes or services that updates apply to.
