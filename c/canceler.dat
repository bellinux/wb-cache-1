40|$|Four {{different}} classes of adaptive signal <b>cancelers</b> {{can be used}} to eliminate narrow-band interference from a broadband signal: (1) cascaded second- order notch filters, (2) high-order in-line notch filters, (3) second-order bandpass noise <b>cancelers,</b> and (4) high-order bandpass noise <b>cancelers.</b> Of the four, a structure based on second-order bandpass filters used as signal <b>cancelers</b> is found to perform better than the other structures.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI) signals that can aect the excision potential of some interference mitigation algorithms. The techniques considered are those that modify signals from auxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an astronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain, where the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal path (adaptive noise canceling), or they {{can be applied to}} the auto- and cross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (post-correlation canceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary interfering signal, both pre- and post-correlation lters can result in complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The post-correlation method has the advantage of being applied on 10 s or 100 s of millisecond time scales rather than 10 s or 100 s of nanosecond time scales. However this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location is changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the interference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate. If the decorrelation is not too severe it can be allowed for, at the expense of a noise increase. The time domain adaptive <b>cancelers</b> are allowed to slightly vary their internal coecients and adapt to changing phases during the integrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However, the freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the ability of both types of <b>cancelers</b> to excise interference originating from a moving source is compared. The <b>cancelers</b> perform well on both observed and simulated data, giving complete cancellation. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{uprising}} of {{efficient and}} low-cost digital signal processors (DSP's) {{lead to the}} development of noise canceling systems with a high performance. The conventional noise <b>cancelers</b> use a Fir transversal filter adapted by the LMS algorithm (ANC) (Windrow, Sterns, 1985). The ANC is quite simple to implement but has important limitations which reduce its efficiency, namely the low convergence rate and the crosstalk between the two input signals, noise and speech. New adaptive structures are presented in this work which purpose is to increase the speed of convergence of the adaptive algorithm. In this method the input signals are band-splitting in sub-bands. Following this frequency band-splitting, a conventional ANC is used for each sub-band. Faster convergence is obtained due the reducing of the spectral dynamic range in each sub-band. A new class of crosstalk resistant structures, referred as MBME (Multi-Banda Mestre-Escrava), are proposed hereafter. The key aspects of the MBME are: low computational costs, high robustness in terms of algorithm stability, fastness of convergence and low speech distortion, allowing to get a high improvement in signal-to-noise ratio at the output. The new structures have been evaluated through the theoretical and experimental results, being the later obtained by real time implementation, on a DSP, of the noise <b>cancelers.</b> The experimental results from the comparison of the MBME and the CTRANC structures (Crosstalk Resistant Adaptive Noise <b>cancelers)</b> (Zinser et al., 1985) have shown that the proposed structures do present, in relation to the CTRANC, several advantages such as: a better robustness in terms of stability of the adaptive algorithm, fastness of convergence and a lower residual error as well as lower computational costs than the CTRANCAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
