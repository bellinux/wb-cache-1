5|$|The {{game was}} heavily {{promoted}} {{both before and}} after its release. Starting on March 6, 2000, Final Fantasy IX <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> used in a line of computer-generated Coca-Cola commercials. Figurines of several <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> also used as prizes in Coca-Cola's marketing campaign. That same year, IGN awarded Final Fantasy dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests.|$|E
5|$|According to interviews, the <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{chosen for}} their popularity, and for {{parallels}} between them from both universes. Boon {{has said that}} some of the characters' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned down to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> developed as downloadable content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being downloadable characters.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the topic was dealt {{with much more}} openly than in the decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> usually derogatory. Gay male <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E
50|$|Character {{creation}} involves assigning {{points to}} seven statistics, or attributes: Agility (how physically able the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Endurance (how healthy and tough the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Intelligence (how well does the character learn, comprehend, remember, or know things), Perception (how aware the <b>character</b> <b>is</b> of their environment), Presence (how cool and intimidating the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> Reflexes (how fast the <b>character</b> <b>is),</b> and Strength (how physically fit the <b>character</b> <b>is).</b>|$|R

5|$|Many critics did {{not like}} the film, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> described as stereotypical.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} several minor <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> recast or {{replaced}} for this film. For example, Ciarán Hinds assumed {{the role of}} Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and bartender of the Hog's Head inn.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, some pieces of artwork {{depicting}} the <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> painted as murals in some cities. Art depicting {{the game was}} featured on NASCAR driver Joey Logano's car in April and June 2010.|$|E
50|$|In theory, the padding <b>character</b> <b>is</b> {{not needed}} for decoding, since {{the number of}} missing bytes can be {{calculated}} {{from the number of}} Base64 digits. In some implementations, the padding <b>character</b> <b>is</b> mandatory, while for others it is not used. One case in which padding <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> required is concatenating multiple Base64 encoded files.|$|R
50|$|TAN {{structure}} is as follows: ANBA99999B: First four <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> letters, next five <b>are</b> numerals, last <b>character</b> <b>is</b> a letter.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{codeword}} 7-bit <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> packed {{from left}} to right (MSB to LSB). The LSB of an ASCII <b>character</b> <b>is</b> sent first (is the MSB in the codeword) as per standard ASCII transmission conventions, so viewed as bits inside a codeword the <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> bit reversed.|$|R
5|$|Two main <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{added to}} the film's cast: Albert Wesker (portrayed by Jason O'Mara) and Claire Redfield (portrayed by Ali Larter) from Resident Evil 2.|$|E
5|$|While some <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{emphasised}} in the BBC promotional material, such as Freema Agyeman, most only {{appeared in}} the first episode as perishing during the viral pandemic.|$|E
5|$|A September 2012 {{analysis}} of tweets found that Graduados was the Argentine television program most frequently mentioned. The most popular <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> Vero Diorio, Dany Goddzer, Pablo Catáneo, Guillermo Almada, Tuca and Vicky Lauría. Several unofficial Twitter accounts {{were created by}} fans and modeled after the characters; the best known was @Jimena_Benitez_ (Patricia Longo's supposed account), with 12,765 followers.|$|E
5000|$|Four <b>character</b> sets <b>are</b> used in PostBar codes, {{known as}} [...] "A", [...] "N", [...] "Z" [...] and [...] "B" [...] characters. Three-bar A <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> used {{exclusively}} to encode letters, and two-bar N characters encode only digits. Three-bar Z characters can encode either letters or digits. A and N <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> typically used to encode postal codes and country codes. Z <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> used for address locators, product types, and customer and service information. B <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> one bar each, {{and are used}} to encode base-4 machine IDs for Canada Post's internal uses.|$|R

5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of rehearsal {{and more than a}} week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|A set of <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> {{indicated}} by Barnum Brown in 1914 to distinguish Corythosaurus {{from all other}} hadrosaurids from Alberta: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by the nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by the premaxillaries; a narrow beak, with an expansion {{in front of an}} elongated naris; and a small narial opening.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the <b>characters</b> <b>were,</b> she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the stories}} and <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> fictional, a number of {{elements}} had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|At each of {{the three}} schools, there are four main characters, who {{comprise}} the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only those twelve appear in the subsequently adapted visual novel version. Other <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict, and these additional characters are also featured in the anime adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
50|$|For the season, three <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> removed, {{and four}} new <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> added as series regulars. Filming {{continued}} {{to take place}} in Dallas, Texas.|$|R

Since the <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> shown facing in opposite directions, the viewer assumes that they are looking at each other.|$|R

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children. When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three Saturday Night Live cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday Night Live. His new <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed the conceptual framework of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E
5|$|DLC costumes for <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> later {{announced}} by Capcom and Marvel, which were released on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace on March 1, 2011. The costume pack contained new outfits for Ryu, Thor, Dante, Iron Man, Chris Redfield, and Captain America. The {{release of the}} pack coincided {{with the release of}} the Shadow Battle DLC.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
