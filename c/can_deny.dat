5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must {{decide whether or not}} to play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> Black this target for the time being by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E
5|$|This is no {{time for}} men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> our {{heritage}} and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E

Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that although the world <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> him, they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past.

He is deeply moved by his vision, and wonders if somewhere Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.|$|E

Lucy O'Brien, author of , appreciated the song's {{addition to the}} soundtrack and found [...] "pathos" [...] in Madonna's vocals. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Even with the faults, Evita has its merits, including the written-for-film ballad 'You Must Love Me'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, wrote that [...] " [...] is an aching farewell that dispels {{the illusion of a}} romance-of-convenience to reveal the inescapable love and tragedy beneath". Teresa Huang from The Tech, said it was [...] "a beautiful addition to an already powerful score".|$|E
500|$|The two symphonies divide opinion {{even more}} sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its [...] "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First [...] "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} did {{not endorse}} some fans' readings, {{according to a}} study on the subject: [...] "Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos [...] that theirs is the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show's success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be." [...] The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode [...] "Milagro" [...] was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point [...] "she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent". The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after them. The best example is Leyla Harrison. Played by Jolie Jenkins and introduced in the eighth-season episode [...] "Alone", Harrison, was created and named in memory of an Internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release.

Faridul Anwar Farinordin of the New Straits Times said, [...] "rest assured, fans will surely grab this one" [...] and selected [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Overprotected" [...] as the best tracks. Annabel Leathes of BBC Online deemed it [...] "calorific as the KFC burgers dished up at her chav-style wedding; twenty finger lickin' tracks that mirror her trajectory from pretty pop puff to lusty strumpet". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime". Andy Petch-Jex of MusicOMH highlighted the first four tracks and commented [...] "true some of the tunes are complete pony plops, but beneath the occasional reek there beats a solid gold pop heart".|$|E
500|$|Marvel's {{announcement}} {{was met with}} widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of Muslimah Media Watch, a diversity advocacy group, told Al Jazeera America that [...] "She {{is going to be}} a window into the American Muslim experience" [...] and that she [...] "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim." [...] Brett White of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes." [...] Hussein Rashid writing for CNN said, [...] "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears to be part of the post-9/11 generation and is a teenager." [...] Muaaz Khan of The Guardian compared Kamala Khan to Malala Yousafzai and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example. However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the University of Liverpool felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially taqiyya: a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual <b>can</b> <b>deny</b> his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution. Political satirist Stephen Colbert joked about Marvel's decision to introduce a Muslim superhero on his television show. Comedian Conan O'Brien also made a joke via Twitter, linking the character's religion to polygamy, but later removed it due to public backlash.|$|E
