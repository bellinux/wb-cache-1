He finds that air pollution levels are highly linked to economic development, with moderately developed countries polluting most. Again, Lomborg argues that faster growth in emerging countries would help them reduce their air pollution levels. Lomborg suggests that devoting resources to reduce the levels of specific air pollutants would provide the greatest health benefits and save {{the largest number of}} lives (per amount of money spent), continuing an already decades-long improvement in air quality in most developed countries. [...] Concerning water pollution, Lomborg notes again that it is connected with economic progress. He also notes that water pollution in major Western rivers decreased rapidly after the use of sewage systems became widespread. <b>Concerning</b> <b>waste,</b> Lomborg notes once again that fears are overblown, as the entire waste produced by the United States in the 21st century could fit into a square 100 feet thick and 28km along each side, or 0.009% of the total surface of the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Mottainai (...) is a Japanese term {{conveying}} a {{sense of}} regret <b>concerning</b> <b>waste.</b> The expression [...] "Mottainai!" [...] can be uttered alone as an exclamation when something useful, such as food or time, is wasted, meaning roughly [...] "what a waste!" [...] or [...] "Don't waste." [...] In addition to its primary sense of [...] "wastefulness", the word {{is also used to}} mean [...] "impious; irreverent" [...] or [...] "more than one deserves".|$|E

After a literature {{review of the}} concept of environmental concern, we precise the construct of <b>concern</b> for <b>waste</b> and build a reliable and valid scale to measure this construct. On the basis of two quantitative studies (224 and 1018 respondents), two dimensions are distinguished and confirmed: a <b>concern</b> for food <b>waste</b> at a rather global level, and a sensibility to food waste at an individual level. Studying the predictive power of the sub-scales shows these two levels have distinct effects on food wasting behavior...|$|R

50|$|Obanzai (おばんざい) is a {{traditional}} style of Japanese cuisine native to Kyoto.

Obanzai cooking heavily relies on vegetables and seafood, prepared simply. Consistent with the concept of mottainai (a sense of regret <b>concerning</b> <b>waste),</b> another characteristic of obanzai is the incorporation of ingredients which are usually discarded as garbage.|$|E

50|$|In a {{circular}} economy, {{one way to}} minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for {{a full range of}} financed waste prevention opportunities. This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions <b>concerning</b> <b>waste</b> prevention. When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels. The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses. However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue. In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.|$|E
50|$|With {{a rapidly}} growing {{population}} and limited space to expand, Israel has faced significant issues <b>concerning</b> <b>waste</b> disposal {{over the last few}} decades. Until the early 90’s, most waste in Israel ended up in unregulated garbage dumps. Following a government order implemented in 1993, the unregulated dumps were closed due to severe contamination of local sources of surface and groundwater. As of 2010, approximately 65% of solid waste in Israel was disposed of via burning and land-filling and approximately 30% was recycled. The issue of limited space has led to pollutants from landfills finding their way into the environment and sources of drinking water. As of 2013, approximately half a million Israelis did not have access to proper sewage infrastructure and waste disposal. In other areas, rapid improvements in the standard of living has resulted in a 4-5% annual increase in solid waste, with the average quantity reaching approximately 11,300 tons per year.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not only}} new, founded cities that had {{extensive}} building regulations. London, Florence, Paris, Venice and numerous smaller cities in Spain and Italy had rules concerning not only the height and shape of buildings, but also for example regulating the width of streets, the projection of roofs and rules <b>concerning</b> <b>waste</b> management, drainage and fire regulations. The Piazza del Campo in Siena, Italy {{is one of the}} earliest examples of [...] "coherent town planning along aesthetic lines, perhaps {{for the first time since}} antiquity." [...] Official regulations governing the size of the palaces facing the square date from 1298. The famous square is dominated by the Palazzo Pubblico, the town hall. With growing prosperity and an emerging sense of civic pride, town halls such as Palazzo Pubblico often became a show-piece of the cities' growing confidence. In the cities of northern Italy, this development started early and many Gothic town halls and other civic monuments have to a large extent survived to this day.|$|E

In the US, regulation of NORM by federal {{agencies such as the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Environmental Protection Agency is not anticipated in the near future because there are no authorizing federal statutes.

50|$|Belgrade's city {{landfill}} (deponija) {{is located}} in Vinča. Official city landfill from 1960 used to be Ada Huja. When the new General Urban Plan (GUP) was adopted in the early 1970s, the projected location of the new landfill was the marsh around Veliko Selo in the municipality of Palilula. The municipality of Grocka endorsed the GUP, but in 1973 the idea of placing the landfill in Vinča was announced by the city. Grocka rejected the proposal and refused to endorse the new decision but the city administration bypassed the local authorities and the new landfill was opened in Vinča in 1977. As of 2017, the landfill covers an area of 68 ha and receives some 2,700 t of garbage daily, which includes not only the domestic waste but also earth and rubble. Out of 17 city municipalities, 13 use this landfill. The landfill raised many ecological questions for years as only in the 2000s {{some of the major}} problems <b>concerning</b> <b>waste</b> managing began to solve. However, despite some recent improvements, the landfill is still far from the European standards of environmental management, like leachate collection and treatment system. It is, as of 2014, not only the Europe's biggest landfill, with between 6,650,000 and 9,500,000 tons of waste deposited in it, but also largest untreated landfill on the continent. Since the city's plan on the waste management for the 2011-202 period, authorities try to make a deal with investors, {{in the form of the}} strategic partnership to manage the landfill. As of 2017, they failed. With layers of untreated garbage that reach 70 m, the landfill is considered to be the most problematic ecological spot in Europe.|$|E
