40|$|Younger {{learners}} {{are widely}} {{considered to be}} technologically savvy and computer literate because of their lifelong exposure to ubiquitous technology. Educators often rely on that assumption to justify changes to institutional curricula, technology initiatives, new classroom strategies, and calls for educators to meet the educational demands of the younger generation. This study examines the <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> of Net Generation Learners (NGLs). This dissertation is composed of a systematic literature review, an examination of learner <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> prior to completing a college level course, and {{an investigation of the}} effects of different types of instruction on learner <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills.</b> In the systematic literature review, identified studies focused primarily on learner familiarity with emerging technologies and relied heavily on self-reported data. Few studies directly measured learner <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills,</b> and none compared the skills of NGLs and non-NGLs. A causal-comparative examination of learner <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> prior to a college level computer literacy course found that both NGLs and non-NGLs exhibited inadequate <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skill.</b> A 1 -way ANOVA indicated NGLs performed significantly better than non-NGLs on a <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> assessment; however, examining learner age as a continuous variable via regression yielded different results. There may be validity to claims regarding the comparative computer proficiency of NGLs to non-NGLs, but the level of skill exhibited by learners does not warrant calls for radical educational changes, and the imprecision of arbitrarily defining age as a dichotomous variable produces potentially erroneous results. The effect of type of instruction on learner <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> was explored. Based on the results in this study, direct instruction focused on a comprehensive scope of <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> better supports learner acquisition of skills than does informal instruction or instruction focused on a limited range of skills. Future research should use statistical methods that analyze age as a continuous variable while continuing to examine directly the comparative <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> of NGLs and non-NGLs at all levels of education. Further inquiry into the effectiveness of different types of instruction to support learner acquisition of <b>computer</b> literacy <b>skills</b> should also be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Competitive forces {{command that}} {{organizations}} do {{something new and}} high tech that enables more {{work to be done}} better and faster than ever. While these pressures stimulate new world-class technology, not everything in this era is new. The work force is aging as people overall live longer and the baby boom generation gets older. ^ Simultaneous demographic and technological trends demand that organizations examine and capitalize on the way new 2 ̆ 2 aged 2 ̆ 2 workers acquire 2 ̆ 2 new age 2 ̆ 2 technological skills. ^ This study faced the organizational challenge of these two 2 ̆ 2 new age 2 ̆ 2 trends. This study proposed that computer self-efficacy beliefs explain the inverse relationship between age and <b>computer</b> technology <b>skill</b> acquisition. As not all older workers are computer illiterate, this study further argued that age-related beliefs and attitudes toward change moderated the relationship between age and computer self-efficacy. Hypotheses were developed and tested for the influences of operationalized variables on <b>computer</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition. ^ Free basic computer training courses provided the setting to actively measure <b>computer</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition for a sample of diverse ages. One hundred and six members of a midwest community voluntarily participated in this computer training research project. Taking measures of performance and confidence at multiple times enabled verification of skill acquisition and corresponding efficacy beliefs. The findings showed that age negatively influenced <b>computer</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition, but for subjective measures only and not for objective assessments. Efficacy beliefs did play a role in influencing performance and also significantly mediated the relationship between age and <b>computer</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition. Introduction of the moderating variables uncovered a complex interaction between age, age-related beliefs in technology, and attitudes toward technological change and the resulting impact on efficacy and skill acquisition. ^ In conclusion, this study 2 ̆ 7 s results revealed the complexity of the relationship between age and <b>computer</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition. Consistent with prior research, multiple factors, including age, influence computer performance. This study makes it clear that the influence of age varies over time and across performance measures. Implications for future investigations, training, and managing an older work force were discussed. ...|$|R
