Since missionaries often travel to areas or people groups where Jesus is not yet known, they frequently take on an evangelistic role. But the apostolic or missionary calling is not necessarily the same (and it is a misnomer and misinterpretation to equate them), as there are many who serve in missionary, church planting, and ministry development roles who have an apostolic calling or serve in an apostolic role but whose primary duty is not evangelism.|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{ideas about}} the nature and {{development}} of colonial communities raised by Miles Fairburn and his critics in a specific local context. Fairburn’s bold characterization of colonial New Zealand society as “atomized ” has provoked numerous responses but not yet yielded sustained analysis of social formations and community in a port community. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative evidence from newspapers, Census data, and archival material relating to churches, voluntary institutions, and the police, this thesis examines the ways in which colonists, both settled residents and mobile sojourners, worked to build community against challenges particular to Port Chalmers during the period 1860 - 1875. Colonists built strong <b>communities</b> around religious <b>denominations</b> and other voluntary institutions, which provided opportunities for sociability and promoted the negotiation of interdependencies and shared values. The relatively fluid and flexible community boundaries shaped by the port’s characteristically high rates of population mobility enabled these smaller communities to coalesce into two larger communities with relative cohesion. The most significant social boundary in the port existed between the communities of seamen and non-seamen, but even these overlapped and the results of their interactions suggest that histories of colonial community formation need to consider the nature of interactions between mobile and more settled populations as well as the respective characteristics of both. Analysing how high population mobility shaped Port Chalmers as a location indicates the need to reassess mobility’s role in defining colonial places and shaping the formation of colonial communities. This demonstrates the advantages place-centred local studies hold for unravelling how the global processes of colonialism played out on the ground and shaped colonial lives lived in local contexts...|$|R

50|$|THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE AND COLONEL WILLIAM JONES ON RELIGIOUS TESTSAND CHRISTIAN BELIEF JANUARY 31, 1788To {{establish}} a religious test as a qualification for {{offices in the}} proposed federal constitution, appears to me, sir, would be attended with injurious consequences to some individuals, and with no advantage to the whole.By the injurious consequences to individuals, I mean, that some, who in every other respect, are qualified to fill some important post in government, will be excluded by their {{not being able to}} stand the religious tests - which I take to be a privation of part of their civil rights.Nor is there to me any conceivable advantage, sir that would result in the whole from such a test. Unprincipled and dishonest men will not hesitate to subscribe to anything, that may open the way for their advancement, and put them into a situation the better to execute their base and iniquitous designs. Honest men alone, therefore, however well qualified to serve the publik, would be excluded by it, and their country be deprived of the benefit of their abilities.In this great and extensive empire, there is and will be a great variety of sentiments in relation among its inhabitants. Upon the plan of a religious test, the question then must be, who shall be excluded from national trusts? Whatever answer bigotry may suggest, the dictates of candour and equity, I conceive, will be none.far from limiting my charity and confidence to men of my own denomination in religion, I suppose, and I believe, sir, that there are worthy characters among men of every other denomination - among the Quakers - the Baptists - the church of England - the papists - and even among those who have no other guide, in the way to virtue and heaven, than the dictates of natural religion.I must therefore think, sir, that the proposed plan of government, in this particular, is wisely constructed: that as all have an equal claim to the blessings of the government under which they live, and which they support, so none should be excluded from them for being of any particular denomination of religion.the presumption is, that the eyes of the people will be upon the faithful in the land, and from a regard to their own safety, will chuse for their rulers, men of known abilities - of known probity - of good moral characters. The apostle peter tells us, that god is no respector of persons, but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him - and I know of no reason, why men of such a character, in a <b>community,</b> of whatever <b>denomination</b> in religion, ceteris paribus, with other suitable qualifications, should not be acceptable to the people, and why they may not be employed, by them, with safety and advantage in the important offices of government. - the exclusion of a religious test in the proposed constitution, therefore, clearly appears to me, sir, to be in favour of its adoption.Colonel Jones (Bristol) thought, that the rulers ought to believe in god or Christ - and that however a test may be prostituted in England, yet he thought if our publik men were to be of those who had a good standing in the church, it would be happy for the United States - and that a person could not be a good man without being a good Christian.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Missiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Community is an {{integrative}} motif and {{the central}} message of the Bible. The divine goal of history is God's establishment of community. The Triune God is the origin of community and community is the mode of existence of God. Christian community is derived from God's community. The church is a community restored by the Triune God, and so {{the essence of the}} church is Christian community. The Bible is the history of community involving the beginning of community, the destruction of community, the restoration of community, and the completion of community. Christian community is a channel of realization of the kingdom of God. As a restored community, the early church was a loving, sharing, praying, and witnessing community. The early church's common possession and sharing of materials in brotherly love had continuously been practiced throughout the churches as indicated in the books of Acts and the Epistles. The early church is a model of Christian community that believers must always strive for and constantly return to. It is possible to live the life of the early church community even now. This is proven by the history of the Protestant community and contemporary Protestant communities. Christian community is not just a conceptual, but also a practical community. Christian community can be practiced in various forms. Protestant community includes the four modes: intentional Christian community, monastic community, church community, and cell group community. These four modes have an equal value in a sense that they exert the communal spirit in diverse ways. These four modes of Protestant community have appeared throughout the history of Protestant community. Protestant communities influenced the renewal of the established church through their devoted community life of love. They have been the wellsprings of renewal in Protestantism. Protestant communities also become a place of reconciliation between divided Christians and <b>denominations.</b> The <b>communities</b> have a role as mediator of reconciliation among divided churches and <b>denominations.</b> <b>Community</b> movements have also acted as the main mission movement in the history of Protestant mission. The main missions such as the Anabaptists, Moravians, and modern mission societies all exerted a powerful mission in a communal basis. The contribution of the Moravian missionaries of the Herrnhut community, beginning half a century before William Carey, brought about a shift of emphasis in missionary awareness within Protestantism. The Herrnhut community included the centripetal mission and centrifugal mission by living an intentional community and sending Moravian missionaries. Mission should be exerted from a community dimension, not an individual level. The history of Protestant mission and contemporary Protestantism testifies that mission through community is the most effective and powerful method of mission. Up to now mission has usually been confined to centrifugal mission at an individual level, which emphasized preaching the gospel to foreign regions. It is a phenomenon of unbalanced mission. A balanced mission includes both centripetal and centrifugal mission. Mission is not only a matter of the scope of preaching the gospel to the ends of earth, but also a matter of content. The content of mission is a radical discipleship and whole gospel in all–inclusiveness, containing centripetal and centrifugal mission, Christian presence and Christian proclamation, and the New Commandment and the Great Commission. Community is an essence of church and an essence of mission. Doctora...|$|R

The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the attitudes of school principals in Newfoundland and Labrador toward French as a second language within the school curriculum. This investigation focused on second language study and its relationship to the aims of education for Newfoundland and Labrador; reasons for decline in second language study; reasons for teaching a second language in schools; and general issue statements related to second language learning. [...] The questionnaire employed in this investigation was adapted from an instrument used in an Australian study by McLean and Van Der Touw (1984). The adapted questionnaire reflected the nature of the Newfoundland educational scene. [...] The questionnaire was sent to 471 school principals. These principals were representative of all thirty-five school boards in Newfoundland and Labrador. Principals surveyed/represented both urban and rural areas, schools from diverse geographical regions, different religious denominations, and schools which varied in terms of student population and facilities. Of these principals, 243, or 52 percent, responded to the questionnaire. [...] Responses on the various concerns were analyzed according to religious affiliation, sex, community size, and school type. [...] Analysis of responses concerning the relationship between the study of French and the attainment of the general aims of education indicated that principals generally did not feel that French contributed significantly to the attainment of any of the provincial aims of education. However, principals perceived that helping students to mature mentally, appreciating other disciplines, and developing the work ethic, which deal mainly with the cognitive advantages of learning a second language, were considered to be the aims most nearly satisfied by the study of French. [...] The majority of principals (76 percent) ranked the removal of French as a matriculation requirement as the most significant reason for decline in second language study at the high school level. In addition, lack of pupil interest/motivation, students' perception of irrelevance, and low achievement were ranked as some of the more important reasons for the drop in French enrollment from the elementary to the senior high school level. - Principals viewed the main reasons for the study of French to be the development of communicative competence in French, empathy with French speaking people, and for personal satisfaction. [...] Another outcome of this study was the detection of an egalitarian outlook on the part of principals with regard to the academic ability and the selection of students who should study French. According to the vast majority of principals (97 percent), all students, regardless of academic potential, should have the opportunity to study French. [...] Differences were detected among principals' according to <b>denomination,</b> <b>community</b> size, sex, and school type. Principals employed with the Integrated and Roman Catholic school boards tended to view French language instruction as a cognitive discipline. Those employed with the Pentecostal Assemblies Board of Education, however, tended to perceive French as being more important in helping students appreciate their privileges and responsibilities as members of their families and the wider community in which they live. Principals in rural areas were more concerned with the learning of French for academic or cognitive reasons than with perceived increased job opportunities. However, the reverse was true of urban principals. [...] Male principals perceived French to be associated mainly with the development of the work ethic. Female principals, however, felt that the development of the four language skills and the possibility of obtaining an interesting job were important reasons for French study. [...] The aims of education which stressed cognitive learning were ranked highest by principals at the high school level, whereas principals at either the elementary or all grade school level indicated that an appreciation of other disciplines was the main aim of education satisfied by the study of French. In addition, only high school principals expressed skepticism concerning the issue that language learning becomes increasingly difficult after 12 - 14 years of age. [...] There were some indication of inconsistencies among the views of principals themselves and also between the views of principals themselves and the views of others involved in French education in the Province. Principals perceived the major aims of education satisfied by the study of French were those associated mainly with cognitive concerns. In contrast, oral competency, rather than the development of the four language skills as promoted by the Department of Education, was viewed as the main reason for language study. The development of communicative competence, however, would not necessarily comprise an important part of a course that was highly cognitive in nature. In addition, principals felt that virtually all students can attain oral competency in the school system as it now exists. This is a view that would probably not be accepted by the majority of French teachers in the Province. [...] The study presents recommendations to encourage communication between the various agencies responsible for French education in the Province, with a view to assisting principals to develop a consistent and realistic approach to the place of French in the curriculum...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the attitudes of school principals in Newfoundland and Labrador toward French as a second language within the school curriculum. This investigation focused on second language study and its relationship to the aims of education for Newfoundland and Labrador; reasons for decline in second language study; reasons for teaching a second language in schools; and general issue statements related to second language learning. [...] The questionnaire employed in this investigation was adapted from an instrument used in an Australian study by McLean and Van Der Touw (1984). The adapted questionnaire reflected the nature of the Newfoundland educational scene. [...] The questionnaire was sent to 471 school principals. These principals were representative of all thirty-five school boards in Newfoundland and Labrador. Principals surveyed/represented both urban and rural areas, schools from diverse geographical regions, different religious denominations, and schools which varied in terms of student population and facilities. Of these principals, 243, or 52 percent, responded to the questionnaire. [...] Responses on the various concerns were analyzed according to religious affiliation, sex, community size, and school type. [...] Analysis of responses concerning the relationship between the study of French and the attainment of the general aims of education indicated that principals generally did not feel that French contributed significantly to the attainment of any of the provincial aims of education. However, principals perceived that helping students to mature mentally, appreciating other disciplines, and developing the work ethic, which deal mainly with the cognitive advantages of learning a second language, were considered to be the aims most nearly satisfied by the study of French. [...] The majority of principals (76 percent) ranked the removal of French as a matriculation requirement as the most significant reason for decline in second language study at the high school level. In addition, lack of pupil interest/motivation, students' perception of irrelevance, and low achievement were ranked as some of the more important reasons for the drop in French enrollment from the elementary to the senior high school level. [...] Principals viewed the main reasons for the study of French to be the development of communicative competence in French, empathy with French speaking people, and for personal satisfaction. [...] Another outcome of this study was the detection of an egalitarian outlook on the part of principals with regard to the academic ability and the selection of students who should study French. According to the vast majority of principals (97 percent), all students, regardless of academic potential, should have the opportunity to study French. [...] Differences were detected among principals' according to <b>denomination,</b> <b>community</b> size, sex, and school type. Principals employed with the Integrated and Roman Catholic school boards tended to view French language instruction as a cognitive discipline. Those employed with the Pentecostal Assemblies Board of Education, however, tended to perceive French as being more important in helping students appreciate their privileges and responsibilities as members of their families and the wider community in which they live. Principals in rural areas were more concerned with the learning of French for academic or cognitive reasons than with perceived increased job opportunities. However, the reverse was true of urban principals. [...] Male principals perceived French to be associated mainly with the development of the work ethic. Female principals, however, felt that the development of the four language skills and the possibility of obtaining an interesting job were important reasons for French study. [...] The aims of education which stressed cognitive learning were ranked highest by principals at the high school level, whereas principals at either the elementary or all grade school level indicated that an appreciation of other disciplines was the main aim of education satisfied by the study of French.
