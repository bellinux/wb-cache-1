40|$|AbstractThe paper dwells upon a {{modified}} centre-of-gravity method {{for determining the}} location <b>of</b> a cargo <b>transit</b> terminal (based on the example of Chelyabinsk region) as a multimodal logistic centre. The modified method for calculating the “centre of gravity” for determining the optimal coordinates <b>of</b> a <b>transit</b> terminal is {{designed to meet the}} following regulations: if there is some unevenness of cargo flows between any point and the transport node, some part of a rolling stock should be unloaded {{in the direction of a}} lesser traffic flow. The coordinates of the terminal complex are determined similarly to the centre-of-gravity coordinates of a physical system and are treated as a transport problem according to the criterion of minimum total annual costs of goods transportations, storage and redistribution in terminal complexes. The paper analyzes integration of terminal-to-terminal transportations in transit terminal complexes that differ in directions, volumes and regional destinations. This measure allows to make cargo transit more efficient by reducing excess transportations and, as a result, non-productive runs <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> <b>traffic.</b> The proposed method for identifying rational location <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> terminal complexes within the existing transport network configuration takes into account the transit data. The integration of terminal-to-terminal transportations in the transit terminal complex, the location of which is determined on the basis of this method, will reduce excess transportations and total costs <b>of</b> operating <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> within the regional transport system, which, in its turn, will improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> transport nodes...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} amount of work has recently gone into localizing BitTorrent traffic within an ISP {{in order to avoid}} excessive and often times unnecessary transit costs. Several architectures and systems have been proposed and the initial results from specific ISPs and a few torrents have been encouraging. In this work we attempt to deepen and scale our understanding of locality and its potential. Looking at specific ISPs, we consider tens of thousands of concurrent torrents, and thus capture ISP-wide implications that cannot be appreciated by looking at only a handful of torrents. Secondly, we go beyond individual case studies and present results for the top 100 ISPs in terms of number of users represented in our dataset of up to 40 K torrents involving more than 3. 9 M concurrent peers and more than 20 M {{in the course of a}} day spread in 11 K ASes. We develop scalable methodologies that permit us to process this huge dataset and answer questions such as: "what is the minimum and the maximum <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> reduction across hundreds of ISPs?", "what are the win-win boundaries for ISPs and their users?", "what is the maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> that can be localized without requiring fine-grained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> inter-AS overlay connections?", "what is the impact to <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> from upgrades <b>of</b> residential broadband speeds?".
