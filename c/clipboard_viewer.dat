2500|$|The {{history of}} Windows {{dates back to}} September 1981, when Chase Bishop, a {{computer}} scientist, designed the first model of an electronic device and project Interface Manager was started. It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name [...] "Windows", but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985. Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity. [...] Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS. The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive. Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, <b>Clipboard</b> <b>viewer,</b> Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows.|$|E
50|$|ClipBook Viewer is a {{discontinued}} utility {{included in}} the Windows NT family of operating system that allows users to view {{the contents of the}} local clipboard, clear the clipboard or save copied and cut items. A feature restricted version, called <b>Clipboard</b> <b>Viewer,</b> is available in Windows 9x and earlier.|$|E
50|$|Windows 1.0 runs a {{shell program}} {{known as the}} MS-DOS Executive, which {{is little more than}} a mouse-able output of the DIR command that does not support icons and is not Y2K-compliant. Other {{supplied}} programs are Calculator, Calendar, <b>Clipboard</b> <b>Viewer,</b> Clock, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Cardfile, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only dialog boxes can appear over other windows, but cannot be minimized.|$|E
50|$|File viewers do not edit files, yet it {{is common}} for {{them to be able to}} export data in a {{different}} file format, or to copy information from the viewed to the system-wide <b>clipboard.</b> A file <b>viewer</b> is limited-functionality software in the sense that it does not have a capability to create a file, or modify the content of an existing one. Instead, it is used only to display or print the content.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{versions}} of the Microsoft Windows operating system, {{the contents of the}} clipboard can be viewed at any time by using the <b>Clipboard</b> <b>Viewer</b> (Clipbook Viewer in Windows XP and 2000) application (clipbrd.exe). It can be run by pressing Windows key + r and typing clipbrd.exe. Alternatively, the program can be found at %windir%\system32\clipbrd.exe on such {{versions of}} Windows. In older versions of Windows the common practice was to open a copy of the [...] "Notepad" [...] or [...] "Wordpad" [...] editor, and paste into that. Often these operations are available from the [...] "Edit" [...] pull down menu and they may be available via a context menu, usually accessible by context-clicking in the window or dialog entry that is to be cut from or pasted into.|$|E
