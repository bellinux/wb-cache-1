40|$|Abstract: Ring and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> wear {{may not be}} {{a problem}} in most current {{automotive}} engines. However, a small change in ring face and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> diameter can significantly affect the lubrication characteristics and ring axial motion. This in turn can cause to change inter-ring pressure, blow-by and oil consumption in an engine. Therefore, by predicting the wear of piston ring face and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> altogether, the changed ring end gap and the changed volume of gas reservoir can be calculated. Then the excessive oil consumption can be predicted. Here, the oil amount through top ring gap into combustion chamber is estimated as engine oil consumption. Furthermore, the wear theories of ring and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> are included. The changed oil consumption caused by the new end gap and the new volume of oil reservoir around second land, can be calculated at some engine running interval. Meanwhile, the wear amount and oil consumption occurred during engine durability cycle are compared with the calculated values. The wear data of rings and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> are obtained from three engines after engine durability test. The calculated wear data of each part are turn out to be around the band of averaged test values or a little below. It is shown that the important factor regarding oi...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the study is to measure the maximum static {{friction}} and dynamic friction in the actuation process of pneumatic cylinder after TiO 2 nanoparticles are added to grease. The study makes an innovative design of a new measuring equipment of friction force, which can measure the friction force between the piston seal in pneumatic cylinder and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore.</b> The friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> directly affects the output dynamic property of pneumatic cylinder motion. Friction force measuring system can measure the change of friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> under the condition with different operating speeds, and can analyze the relationship between friction force of pneumatic cylinder and output dynamic property of pneumatic cylinder. Such a friction force measuring equipment takes pneumatic cylinder as an output of motive force to drive the measurement of pneumatic cylinder, and uses load cell and draw-line encoder to measure the friction force of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> and the motion speed. In the experiment, the friction forces of pneumatic cylinder given with oil and without oil are measured respectively, achieving the friction force property of pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>bore</b> when being lubricated by nanogrease added with nanoparticles of different weight percentages (wt. %). The experimental results show that adding TiO 2 nanoparticles to grease can effectively decrease the friction force produced in the actuation process of pneumatic cylinder...|$|R
