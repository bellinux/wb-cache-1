5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for <b>college</b> <b>coaches.</b> Many fans wrote {{the university to}} complain about him and his staff. Still, several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier at Kentucky, including Don Shula, Chuck Knox, Howard Schnellenberger and Bill Arnsparger. Standout players under Collier included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E
5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball.

He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king.

25|$|Brady {{attended}} Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, {{where he}} graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral. He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was {{not good enough to}} start on the 0–8 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year. However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended to the starting position. He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated. By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of <b>college</b> <b>coaches.</b> He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.|$|E

25|$|Courtney {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in American college {{sports in the}} transition of power away from the students to the head coach. He helped transform the head coach into the dictatorial coach seen throughout the 20th century. When he was first hired, it was common practice for the captain of any team to hire the coach and the captain decided on whether the coach stayed on. Since the captain was a student, they would change {{from one year to}} the next, and there was no job security. Unlike other 1890s <b>college</b> <b>coaches,</b> Courtney signed a multi-year contract, starting in 1895. He used his job security to demonstrate his power when he overruled team selection of the team captain for the Henley Regatta that same year. Another illustration of his authoritative power that he had gained was in 1897 when he kicked out most of team for eating strawberry shortcake before the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta. He would instead take a crew made up of mostly substitutes to victory.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, {{the first}} intercollegiate dual meet {{took place between}} Yale University and Columbia University. The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both college and {{university}} students and high school students. Edward Clark Gallagher, a football and track and field athlete at Oklahoma A College (now Oklahoma State University), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before World War I and with his team launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921 to 1931. In 1927, Raymond G. Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first NCAA Wrestling Team Championship took place on March 30 to 31 {{on the campus of}} Iowa State College. The rules of collegiate wrestling marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF) and the AAU. From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of World War I and World War II, but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by <b>college</b> <b>coaches,</b> and then entering collegiate competition.|$|E

500|$|American {{football}} {{resulted from}} several major divergences from association football and rugby football, {{most notably the}} rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, a Yale University and Hopkins School graduate who {{is considered to be}} the [...] "Father of American Football".

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gameplay developments by <b>college</b> <b>coaches</b> such as Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Parke H. Davis, [...] Knute Rockne, and Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass. The popularity of college football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States {{for the first half of}} the 20th century. Bowl games, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for college teams. Boosted by fierce rivalries and colorful traditions, college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.|$|E

500|$|New {{formations}} {{and play}} sets {{continued to be}} developed. Emory Bellard, an assistant coach under Darrell Royal at the University of Texas, developed a three-back option style offense known as the wishbone. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense {{that depends on the}} quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including Bear Bryant at Alabama, Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma and Pepper Rodgers at UCLA; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes. [...] The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the spread offense, developed by professional and <b>college</b> <b>coaches</b> throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to [...] "spread" [...] the field both horizontally and vertically. [...] Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the most victorious programs, Michigan, Notre Dame, and Texas are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.|$|E
500|$|When Patrick was {{a highly}} {{recruited}} high school basketball player, John was restricted by NCAA rules from some normal behaviors regarding his son, such as giving his son's teammates a ride home from practice, talking with his son at a basketball camp or discussing his son's abilities with news media, because the interactions of <b>college</b> <b>coaches</b> with recruits are restricted. [...] The relevant NCAA rules for recruiting (Bylaw article 13) are quite extensive. Beilein had to follow recruiting rules when visiting his son at a basketball camp.
