40|$|This Article {{examines}} the current campaign finance jurisprudence in the United States, {{with a particular}} emphasis on the Court’s recognition of <b>compelling</b> state interests. Given the limited recognition of <b>compelling</b> state interests, this Article seeks to question the seemingly arbitrary rationale behind recognition and explore the implications of minimal acceptance of <b>compelling</b> state interests. Because the evolution of <b>compelling</b> state interest recognition has varied greatly, the Court’s recent insistence — {{that the state has}} merely one <b>compelling</b> interest — is troublesome. This Article provides a comprehensive review of the campaign finance jurisprudence, then reviews the decisions that created or argued for additional <b>compelling</b> state interests. Interests that were considered <b>compelling</b> prior to Citizens United, such as the anti-distortion interest, remain <b>compelling</b> and hold an important place in the US campaign finance landscape. This Article attempts to respond to the current Court’s trend and shed light on the history of <b>compelling</b> state interest recognition...|$|R

40|$|At present, it is {{difficult}} to discern what rules govern <b>compelled</b> subsidization and where the constitutional limits lie. The root cause of the current confusion is the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to provide a coherent account of the First Amendment harm of <b>compelled</b> subsidization. Part I of this Article describes the present state of the doctrine. It identifies a number of practical problems, especially the imprecisions in and conflicts between the Court 2 ̆ 7 s holdings that leave it unclear how lower courts should decide novel cases. Part II is a critical discussion of the two most common arguments for a First Amendment right against <b>compelled</b> subsidization: that <b>compelled</b> subsidization infringes on dissenters 2 ̆ 7 freedom of belief and that it restricts their freedom of expression. A comparison of <b>compelled</b> subsidization with the First Amendment interests at stake in <b>compelled</b> speech shows that neither argument withstands scrutiny and that this deficiency in theory is the cause of much of the confusion in practice. Part III argues {{that if there is a}} First Amendment right against <b>compelled</b> subsidization, it is grounded not in the liberty interests of dissenting individuals, but in <b>compelled</b> subsidization 2 ̆ 7 s potential harm to public political discourse. This brings a fresh perspective on the idea that there is a First Amendment interest in 2 ̆ 2 democratizing the influence of money on the electoral process, 2 ̆ 2 and suggests a new, more general test for <b>compelled</b> subsidization cases. Part IV briefly discusses what it would take to transpose the results from a reformed <b>compelled</b> subsidization doctrine into the register of campaign finance regulation...|$|R

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to <b>compel</b> public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.

40|$|Courts {{have faced}} {{a wave of}} <b>compelled</b> {{disclosure}} cases recently. By government mandate, tobacco manufacturers must include graphic warnings on their cigarette packages, doctors must show and describe ultrasound images of fetuses to women seeking to abort them, and crisis pregnancy centers must disclose {{that they do not}} provide contraception or abortion services. Although applying the same <b>compelled</b> speech doctrine to similar issues, appeals courts have reached very different results in challenges to these laws. Drawing from First Amendment theory, this Article first identifies why <b>compelled</b> disclosures undermine free speech values. It then applies those insights to the specific examples above. In doing so, it examines not only <b>compelled</b> text but the new phenomenon of <b>compelled</b> images, particularly <b>compelled</b> images designed to provoke an emotional response. The Article concludes that court decisions often have it backwards: it is mandatory abortion counseling laws that offend free speech principles, not laws requiring cigarette warnings or crisis pregnancy center disclosures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Compelled</b> {{commercial}} speech, including mandatory labeling and {{the disclosure}} of factually true information, should {{not be seen as}} a separate category of speech under the First Amendment. Rather, <b>compelled</b> commercial speech should be subject to the same level of protection as commercial speech generally. This means commercial speech compulsions, such as mandatory disclosures and labeling requirements, must be supported by a substantial government interest. The assertion of a consumer “right to know” does not constitute such an interest and cannot, by itself, justify <b>compelled</b> commercial speech. Allowing such a justification for <b>compelled</b> commercial speech would eviscerate any meaningful First Amendment protection against <b>compelled</b> commercial speech and, threaten core First Amendment values. Such protection against speech compulsions will not inhibit government efforts to protect consumers nor prevent consumers from obtaining desired information about products and services. A dynamic market discovery process, with only limited and targeted government interventions, is a more effective way to serve the consumer interest in more complete information about goods and services. Most existing <b>compelled</b> disclosure requirements are consistent with this approach to <b>compelled</b> commercial speech, but some new and proposed disclosure requirements, including those for genetically modified organisms, are likely unconstitutional...|$|R

The rule required that tobacco warnings include something new: all tobacco products now had to bear one of nine graphic images to accompany the text. Tobacco companies filed suit contesting {{the constitutionality of the}} rule, arguing that the government violated their right to free commercial speech by <b>compelling</b> disclosure of the graphic content. Yet First Amendment jurisprudence lacks a doctrinally consistent standard for reviewing such <b>compelled</b> disclosures. Courts’ analyses typically depend on whether the regulation <b>compels</b> or restricts speech, how far that regulation extends, and why the government chose to regulate in the first place. This Note seeks to articulate a coherent standard-—a disclosure-focused approach—-for reviewing <b>compelled</b> commercial speech under the First Amendment. Under this disclosure-focused approach, courts would adopt a lenient standard of review for <b>compelled</b> disclosures of factual, uncontroversial information while reserving more exacting scrutiny for restricted speech or <b>compelled</b> ideological disclosures. This approach centers on the structure and content of the regulation rather than the governmental motive. Accordingly, the disclosure-focused approach aligns with the goal of commercial speech protection—-namely, maximizing the information available to consumers...|$|R
