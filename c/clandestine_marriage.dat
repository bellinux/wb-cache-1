50|$|The {{scandal and}} abuses {{brought about by}} these <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriages</b> became so great that they became the object of special legislation. In 1753, Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act was passed, which required, under pain of annulment, that banns should be {{published}} or a licence obtained; that, in either case, the marriage should be solemnized in church by a recognised clergyman; {{and that in the}} case of minors, marriage by licence must be by the consent of parent or guardian; and that at least two witnesses must be present. Jewish and Quaker ceremonies were exempt. Clergymen conducting <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriages</b> were liable to transportation.|$|R

When she hears the news of her husband's death in Egypt, she enters a <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriage</b> with Mr. Hackwell, {{yielding}} to his advances even though she {{claims to be a}} chaste woman. The couple spends Lola's wealth extravagantly as Mr. Sinclair, who was entrusted with the bulk of Lola's wealth, sends them a monthly allowance intended for Lola. Mrs. Norval uses it to advance her family's social standing in the hopes of finding wealthier, more suitable matches for her daughters. She therefore embodies the idea of Manifest Destiny. She spends Lola's money as if it were hers, since she believes she belongs to the superior race. Lola's wealth corrupts her until she succumbs to brain fever.|$|E

In the Pinero farce three years later, Trewin was equally approving of Sim and his co-star Patricia Routledge.|$|E

40|$|According to medieval canon law, {{mutual consent}} was {{sufficient}} to create a valid marriage. A marriage contracted secretly could thus be perfectly valid. Such <b>marriages,</b> i. e. <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriages,</b> did however constitute {{one of the major}} problems in the marriage legislation of the medieval Catholic Church. This problem was particularly apparent at the local level and practically all synodal statutes in medieval Europe contain multiple prohibitions against such marriages. In this context, Swedish synodal statutes constitute an exception by the relatively modest place accorded to this problem. This article compares the references to <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriages</b> in Swedish and French synodal statutes, analyzes their differences and explores the Swedish legal tradition to determine possible explanations for them. Swedish secular laws contained detailed rules for the formation of marriage that guaranteed a certain publicity. This made <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriages,</b> in the sense of marriages contracted secretly without witnesses, relatively scarce. Swedish synodal statutes reflect this situation, shows the implications of the Swedish matrimonial tradition, and how canon law was adapted to the Swedish context...|$|R

When news arrives that Dr. Norval has been presumed dead, Mr. Hackwell sees this as an opportunity to enter into a <b>clandestine</b> <b>marriage</b> with Mrs. Norval.
