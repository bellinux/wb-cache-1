5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the <b>can</b> body. Each <b>seaming</b> head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some <b>seaming</b> <b>machines</b> have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the <b>seaming</b> operation, the <b>can</b> end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> the <b>can</b> is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|R

When the machinery is set up correctly and the incoming materials (cans, ends, tooling, etc.) comply to the set specifications, the result should be ideal first and second operation seams.|$|R

40|$|In {{the food}} industry, quality {{assurance}} is {{strongly associated with}} consumer safety {{and the risk of}} compromising the purity of products. Specifically, in the canning industries, rusty, dented or bulging cans may contain bacteria and cause foodborne illness. This article discusses the application of DMAIC and failure analysis {{to reduce the number of}} crushed cans in a canning industry. The methodology was of an applied nature, with an exploratory objective, a qualitative and quantitative approach and a case study method used. Through statistical analysis, it was found that the amount of dented packaging in the production process, which comprises the steps of filling, seaming and basketing, was high. The step with the highest number of crushed cans between three stages was seaming. This was followed by the application of FMEA failure analysis related to the use of an automated <b>seaming</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally, an action plan was roposed to solve the problem of cans crushed in the seaming step and the results demonstrate the improvements obtained before the target after 4 months (August-November 2015) ...|$|R

5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized sheet iron was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including sheet iron folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and <b>seaming</b> <b>machines,</b> did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the Tin, Sheet Iron, and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the <b>can</b> <b>seam</b> measurements (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R
