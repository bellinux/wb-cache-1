25|$|It dispelled so many {{myths about}} the {{coaching}} business -- {{that you had}} to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to give up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E
500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E

500|$|Stenson {{assessed}} that Steph [...] "really isn't all bad, {{more of a}} lovable rogue {{who just}} likes making mischief for attention." [...] She deemed her character [...] "very unpredictable", {{with a great deal}} of confidence. The LINC Online called her a [...] "beautiful blonde wild child with a penchant for arrogance and displays of egotism". Sarah Moolla of The People branded her [...] "superficial", the Daily Record Merle Brown referred to her as [...] "a true [...] female, and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a [...] "couldn't-care-less" [...] attitude. BBC America described Steph as a two-sided character. They observed that as well as a bitch, she could be [...] "dishonest, vain, jealous and small-minded", and wrote [...] "She causes trouble when she wants to and will happily lie and gossip to get her own way." [...] Conversely, they noted that for those on her good side, [...] "She <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> best friend, a confidante and sweet natured girl".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is [...] "the most old-school work" [...] on Femme Fatale, with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{considering}} the album's production [...] "polished, intriguing and – {{best of all}} – fun", exemplifying the piano breakdown in the song. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said he could [...] "completely hear this track blasting in a club, with Spears cooing 'I <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> treble' while the crowd screams back 'you can be my bass!'." [...] The Daily Collegians stated that the song is [...] "catchy", yet different from [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me", and added that [...] "the combined star power of Spears and Will.i.am would have surely made it a radio hit." [...] The Independent journalist Andy Gill noted that the album sounds more programmed than natural, but said that the song [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound thought that the song [...] "might {{as well be a}} B-side to 'The Time (Dirty Bit)' (otherwise known as the most annoying Black Eyed Peas song ever created)." [...] Both Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and About.com reviewer Bill Lamb selected it as a top song on Femme Fatale. Lamb further added that the song [...] "will leave you laughing as you sing along on the dance floor." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meyer and Duncan {{made their}} first three vintages at the Christian Brothers winery, and in 1975 bought the Franciscan Winery, selling it in 1978 {{to buy the}} Silver Oak winery near Oakville and buying up new land. The Silver Oak winery began {{production}} in 1981 and the 1982 harvest was considered by Meyer to be [...] "something special" [...] and was attempted to be replicated in later years. Growth of the company from 1977 onwards enabled Silver Oak to purchase further vineyards in the 1980s and early 1990s, {{becoming one of the}} most successful Cabernet Sauvignon brands. By the 1994 vintage, the concept changed and the Silver Oak Napa became a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, but still aged solely in American oak, a California take on the classic Bordeaux chateau-bottled red wine. Meyer was President of the American Vineyard Foundation in the 1990s, and also held several other important positions in the wine industry. He breathed new life into the flailing American Vineyard Foundation from the late 1980s; Wines and Vines stated that Meyer's most important contribution will be his influence in bringing growers and winemakers together to shape the very future of California wine." [...] He trained Daniel Baron extensively to replace himself as Silver Oak's chief winemaker. In the late 1990s, he was diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes and a degenerative brain disease. In January 2001 he sold his share of the company to Ray Duncan, citing health problems, [...] but continued as a consulting winemaker until his death in August 2002. Meyer once said [...] "Only one wine <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> best, and I felt that cabernet was what we did best in Napa and Sonoma".|$|E
