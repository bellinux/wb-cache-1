Public Prosecutor (2010) the Court of Appeal {{appeared}} to reject {{such an approach}} by declining to require that procedural laws must be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] {{before they can be}} regarded as law for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor <b>can</b> <b>such</b> a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it [...] "too vague a test of constitutionality" [...] and said: [...] "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making." [...] On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature. It held, obiter, that law might not encompass [...] legislation (that is, bills of attainder – legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation [...] "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".|$|E

A conceptual explanation of the distinction between the planar and higher-dimensional cases was given by John von Neumann: unlike the group SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, the group E(2) of Euclidean motions of the plane is solvable, which implies the existence of a finitely-additive measure on E(2) and R2 which is invariant under translations and rotations, and rules out paradoxical decompositions of non-negligible sets. Von Neumann then posed the following question: <b>can</b> <b>such</b> a paradoxical decomposition be constructed if one allowed a larger group of equivalences? ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} unusual {{elements}} of character dance in modern Highland dance competitions is the inclusion of the Cakewalk. The cakewalk is originally a dance performed by black slaves in the southern US imitating, in exaggerated style, the stately courtship ballroom dancing of slave owners. It is unique in competitive Highland Dance as it is the only dance always performed as a duo and is the only dance that originated outside the British Isles. Also unique is the inclusion of fanciful and often outrageous costumes upon which some of the judging of artistry is based. While costume contests do occasionally take place regarding the outfits worn for the other dances, the outfits for those dances are so carefully prescribed (differences are restricted primarily to choice of tartan, color of jackets or sashes, and choices such as lace sleeves and velvet vests instead of velvet jackets) that costume does not {{play a significant role in}} the dance competition or vary much across dancers. In contrast, while the cakewalk may be danced in traditional Scottish attire, dancers involved in the cakewalk often attempt to come up with the most creative duo costume they <b>can,</b> <b>such</b> as Frankstein and his bride or Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The cakewalk is generally only danced at very large scale competitions such as national or provincial championships and is generally restricted to the top level of competitive dancers known as [...] "premier" [...] (formerly [...] "open".) The Cakewalk is generally performed to [...] "Whistling Rufus" [...] Written in 1899 by Kerry Mills. The inclusion of the Cakewalk in competitive Highland Dance is credited to dancer, judge and examiner James L. McKenzie who introduced the dance to Scotland from the United States.|$|E
