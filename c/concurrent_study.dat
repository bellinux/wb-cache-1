40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature concerning Native American occupancy and use of the Yucca Mountain area and vicinity. It draws on a wide range of material, including early traveler reports, government documents, ethnographic and historical works, and local newspapers. The report complements two other <b>concurrent</b> <b>studies,</b> one focused on the cultural resources of Native American people in the study area and the other an ethnobotanical study of plant resources used by Native American people in the <b>study</b> area. Both <b>concurrent</b> <b>studies</b> are based on interviews with Native American people. The literature review was designed to contribute to the understanding of the presence of Native American people in the Yucca Mountain area. A review of the existing literature about the Yucca Mountain area and southern Nye County, supplemented by the broader literature about the Great Basin, has verified three aspects of the study design. First, the review has aided in assessing the completeness of the list of Native American ethnic groups that have traditional or historical ties to the site. Second, it has aided in the production of a chronology of Native American activities that occurred on or near the site during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Third, it has helped to identify the location of cultural resources, including burials and other archaeological sites, in the study area and vicinity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mammography {{has emerged}} as a {{reliable}} non-invasive technique for the early detection of breast cancer- the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among American women. The radiographic appearance of the female breast consists of radiolucent (dark) regions due to fat and radiodense (light) regions due to connective and epithelial tissue. The amount of radiodense tissue {{can be used as a}} marker for predicting breast cancer risk. This paper presents the development of an algorithm for estimating the percentage of radiodense tissue in a digitized mammogram. The technique involves determining a dynamic threshold for segmenting radiodense indications in mammograms. Both the mammographic image and the threshold are modeled as Gaussian random variables. This work is intended to support a <b>concurrent</b> <b>study</b> at the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) exploring the association between dietary patterns and breast cancer risk.

Hence, we hypothesize that TF and/or beta- 2 glycoprotein and ndash; I (beta 2 GPI) -induced TF might play an important role for the increased index of apoptosis in placenta, especially during early stages of fetal development.
