5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced <b>clams,</b> sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh <b>clams</b> may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned <b>clams</b> can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned <b>clams</b> can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked <b>clams</b> are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The <b>clams</b> can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, <b>clams,</b> ark <b>clams,</b> mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of <b>clams,</b> cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters consume over 100 {{different}} prey species. In {{most of its}} range, the sea otter's diet consists {{almost exclusively}} of marine benthic invertebrates, including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such as <b>clams</b> and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses. Where prey such as sea urchins, <b>clams,</b> and abalone are present {{in a range of}} sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo <b>clams</b> smaller than 3inches (7cm) across.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, <b>clams</b> and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of <b>clams</b> and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as <b>clams,</b> oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native <b>clams</b> (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native <b>clams</b> and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} recipe for clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned <b>clams</b> in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned <b>clams,</b> cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{fisheries}} {{production of}} Manila <b>clam</b> in Chiba Prefecture, which amounts {{to more than}} 90 ％ of the total <b>clam</b> production in Tokyo Bay, markedly declined to below 20, 000 metric tons (mt) in 1979, after reaching 70, 000 mt at its maximum in the late 1960 s. This is {{mainly because of the}} large-scale reclamation of the shallow tidal areas where <b>clam</b> fisheries were intensively operated. However, the <b>clam</b> production keeps gradual decreasing even after the cessation of the series of reclamation in 1979. The periodical monitoring of <b>clam</b> stocking density shows decreasing of <b>clam</b> production since 1985 seems {{to be associated with the}} poor occurrence of wild juvenile <b>clam.</b> In Kisarazu Area, which is the largest Manila <b>clam</b> producer in Tokyo Bay, production is stably maintained between 5, 000 and 6, 000 mt since late 1980 s, in spite of the stocking density of juvenile <b>clam</b> (4 - 11 mm in shell length) declining from 68 to 12 inds/m 2 during this period. It is probably due to 2, 000 - 3, 000 mt of the transplantation of the seed <b>clam</b> (> 20 mm) from other area in Tokyo Bay and other prefecture. On the contrary, in Northern Chiba Area, where the <b>clam</b> fisheries relies only upon wild <b>clam</b> stocks without any transplantation, the <b>clam</b> production has sharply declined from around 10, 000 mt in late 1970 s to 800 mt in 1999 reflecting directly the poor occurrence of wild juvenile <b>clam.</b> The cause of the substantial decline of the wild juvenile <b>clam</b> is still not known...|$|R

5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small <b>clams</b> climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E

5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for <b>clams.</b> It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and <b>clams,</b> an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
