40|$|Abstract Background Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped virus, bearing severe economic consequences to the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies on enveloped viruses {{have shown that}} many incorporated <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> associated with the virion's membranes that might play important roles in viral infectivity. In this study, we sought to proteomically profile the <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> incorporated into or associated with the virions of a highly virulent PRRSV strain GDBY 1, and to provide foundation for further investigations on the roles of incorporated/associated <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> on PRRSV's infectivity. Results In our experiment, sixty one <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometric approaches. The identified <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> could be grouped into eight functional categories including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, metabolism-associated proteins, calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins and other functional proteins. Among the identified proteins, four {{have not yet been}} reported in other studied envelope viruses, namely, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3 -monooxygenase/tryptophan 5 -monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin- 1 protein. The presence of five selected <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> (i. e., β-actin, Tubulin, Annexin A 2, heat shock protein Hsp 27, and calcium binding proteins S 100) in the highly purified PRRSV virions was validated by Western blot and immunogold labeling assays. Conclusions Taken together, the present study has demonstrated the incorporation of <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> in PRRSV virions, which provides valuable information for the further investigations for the effects of individual <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> on the viral replication, assembly, and pathogenesis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Poster SessionPeritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) is recognised as {{a therapy}} {{for patients with}} end stage renal failure. Continuous prolonged exposure of the peritoneal membrane to unphysiologic PD solutions results in the activation of the mesothelium, with increased synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory/fibrotic mediators, and increased deposition of matrix proteins. We have recently shown that emodin, a natural anthraquinone can abrogate elevated glucose-induced matrix synthesis in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). This study aims to investigate the modulatory role of emodin on HPMC morphology, matrix synthesis (fibronectin and collagen type I), and TGF-β 1 and IL- 1 β secretion after stimulation with either spent non-infected or infected conventional PD fluids. HPMC were characterized by their cobblestone, polygonal morphology, and positive staining for vimentin and cytokeratin. HPMC cultured with either spent non-infected or infected PD fluids for 48 h resulted in an elongated fibroblastic appearance. These transdifferentiated mesothelial cells were activated as demonstrated by their positive staining for smooth muscle actin.

While the sequence of the HCMV genome has been known for over a decade, the full set of viral and <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> that compose the HCMV virion are unknown. To approach this problem we have utilized gel-free two-dimensional capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS to identify and determine the relative abundances of viral and <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> in purified HCMV AD 169 virions and dense bodies. Analysis of the proteins from purified HCMV virion preparations has indicated that the particle contains significantly more viral proteins than previously known. In this study, we identified 71 HCMV-encoded proteins that included 12 proteins encoded by known viral open reading frames (ORFs) previously not associated with virions and 12 proteins from novel viral ORFs.

40|$|This thesis work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the assembly and budding of enveloped virus particles with focus {{on the fate of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins,</b> present in or near the plasma membrane (PM) where the budding occurs. It was previously shown that compact viruses, like alphaviruses, with a covering outer protein coat, did not contain any <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> in the envelope. However, <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> were found in purified retroviral preparations and these proteins were thought to be specifically incorporated into the viral envelopes. We asked whether <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> instead were randomly incorporated during viral budding at the PM and if selection of proteins occurred at all. Hence, we built up systems to metabolically label lipids and proteins in cells both before and during infection and production of virus particles, to isolate and purify PMs and released virus particles and to equalize the preparations to each other thus enabling direct comparable analyses of protein contents and amounts of proteins in the two samples. In this thesis we can, for the chosen model retroviruses Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Mo-MuLV) and Human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1), show that the bulk of the <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins,</b> present in or near the budding sites, are in a non-selective manner incorporated into assembling and budding particles. Only a few proteins were excluded from or concentrated into the purified particles, as compared to isolated PMs, which was opposite to the general idea. Some viruses, including Human herpesvirus 6 A (HHV- 6 A), have been associated with the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS). One theory for induction of the autoimmune reactions is that incorporated <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> are presented to immune system cells together with viral peptides, leading to misdirected immune reactions.
