2500|$|An {{oil well}} {{produces}} predominantly crude oil, with some natural gas dissolved in it. Because {{the pressure is}} lower at the surface than underground, some of the gas {{will come out of}} solution and be recovered (or burned) as associated gas or solution gas. A gas well produces predominantly natural gas. However, because the underground temperature and pressure are higher than at the surface, the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, and heptane in the gaseous state. At surface conditions these will condense out of the gas to form [...] "natural gas condensate", often shortened to condensate. Condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some volatile light <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E

Because <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is a globally traded commodity, natural and geopolitical events can affect its price. These fluctuations affect state revenues because {{a share of the}} royalty payments from companies that lease state or federal lands to produce <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> are distributed to the states. Because there are many varieties and grades of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> buyers and sellers often price their oil relative to another abundant, highly traded, and high quality <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> called a benchmark.

2500|$|For {{the benefit}} of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian {{producers}} created a new benchmark crude oil called Western Canadian Select, (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oils.</b> This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19–21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as [...] "conventional heavy oil" [...] by governments.

2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 {{percent by volume}} of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using fluid catalytic cracking to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E

UNICA disagreed with the assertion that indirect land-use changes can be accurately calculated with the current methodologies. Canadian officials also complained the standard could become an entry barrier to their Alberta oil sands, as producers will have to significantly reduce their emissions or purchase expensive credits from alternative energy producers in order for their non-conventional oil to be sold in California. They complained that the measure could be discriminating against Canadian oil sands crude as a high carbon intensity crude oil, while other heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> from other sources were not evaluated by CARB's studies.|$|E
