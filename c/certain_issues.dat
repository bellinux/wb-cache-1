5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates <b>certain</b> <b>issues</b> which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

50|$|The {{preliminary}} {{assumption is}} that voters do not come in predefined groups of pros and cons for or against a certain subject. Ballot analysis assumes that voters opt for a certain party or decide for the solution or option that comes closest to their own position. Cleavage separates the voters into advocates and adversaries on a <b>certain</b> <b>issue,</b> or voting for a certain party. If you imagine parties on a horizontal line for a <b>certain</b> <b>issue,</b> cleavage is the vertical line that divides the parties into supporters and opponents of the issue.|$|R

He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on <b>certain</b> <b>issues</b> in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E

Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on <b>certain</b> <b>issues</b> that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{accessibility}} {{is the foundation}} of a memory-based model (Scheufele, 2000). It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory (Tulving & Watkins, 1975; Hastie & Park, 1986; Iyengar, 1990). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) also argue that the formation of individuals' judgments directly correlates with [...] "the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind" [...] (p. 208). When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a <b>certain</b> <b>issue.</b> Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make <b>certain</b> <b>issue</b> to be easily accessed in individual’s memory when forming judgment about the issue.|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} m agents is to nd a common {{agreement}} about a <b>certain</b> <b>issue.</b> Consider {{this issue to}} be an n-dimensional vector of real num-bers, for example the allocation of a xed sum of money to n projects. Each agent has an opinion about the allocation, which he may revise. We model the process of opinion formation as a time-discrete dynamical sys-tem, in which every agent averages all opinions which are closed to his own opinion. Thus condence structures may change. Mathematical analysis shows that every starting opinion distribution converges to a stable distri-bution. The driving force of this convergence is self-condence. Further, we present some simulation results concerning m = 150 and n = 3, which give an insight into the dynamics of multidimensional opinion dynamics under bounded condence. 1 The Model Consider a group of m agents, each having an opinion about a <b>certain</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
