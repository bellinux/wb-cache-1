25|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} enables {{a variety of}} experimental sequences. Many <b>commercial</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is duty cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined m/z value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.|$|E
500|$|Artists of the sōsaku-hanga ("creative prints") {{movement}} {{took control}} of {{every aspect of the}} printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. [...] Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with <b>commercial</b> <b>mass</b> production. [...] The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. [...] The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. [...] Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). [...] These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of that work}} was to evaluate the influence of different soil mulching and doses of organic compost {{in the culture of}} the rocket. The experimental design was used in randomized blocks, in splitplot arrangement with four replications. The plot corresponded to the soil mulching (no-tillage with living mulch of Arachis pintoi, living mulch of native weed, straw mulch of native weed and conventional tillage without mulching). The plots represent the doses of organic compost (10, 20 and 30 t ha- 1 in the dry compost). The variables analyzed were yield, commercial fresh matter, and dry matter of the aerial part. The dose of 30 t ha- 1 provided the largest yield values and <b>commercial</b> fresh <b>mass</b> for the conventional system and straw mulch. The dose 20. 49 t ha- 1 increased yield and <b>commercial</b> fresh <b>mass</b> for A. pintoi mulch. The dose 20. 85 t ha- 1 showed greater increase in yield and <b>commercial</b> fresh <b>mass</b> for the live native weed.
