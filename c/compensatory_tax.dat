40|$|This study {{examined}} {{equity in the}} context of the allocation of park and recreation resources within a community. The contributions made by this study include: extending the original taxonomy of equity models proposed by Crompton and Wicks (1988); development of a theoretical framework for their original model; providing a current synthesis of equity based literature; advancing the Equity Implementation Model (Wicks & Crompton, 1989) by developing an instrument capable of measuring residents? perceptions and preferences of park and recreation resource allocation in their community; empirically confirming the legitimacy of alternate dimensions of equity through Structural Equation Modeling; applying information gained from using the instrument to determine the usefulness of selected variables in predicting equity preferences; and comparing data on equity preferences with those of prevailing perceptions to illustrate the utility of the instrument in guiding resource allocation decisions. Five of the original operationalizations of equity were validated (<b>Compensatory,</b> <b>Taxes</b> Paid, Direct Price, Efficiency and Advocacy). An additional operationalization, Professional Judgment, was included and also validated, while one of the original dimensions suggested by Crompton and Wicks, Equal Outcomes, could not be distinctively conceptually differentiated and so was discarded. The operationalizations of Equal Inputs and Equal Opportunity could not be differentiated to reflect distinctively different equity concepts. However, further efforts should be invested in operationalizing these two equity concepts, since they do appear to be conceptually different. Using confirmatory factor analysis, a model consisting of all seven operationalizations (<b>Compensatory,</b> <b>Taxes</b> Paid, Direct Price, Efficiency, Advocacy, Professional Judgment and Equality) was an acceptable fit and all paths were significant at the. 05 level, suggesting that the proposed 23 -item, seven-dimension scale, P&R-EQUITY, effectively measures seven facets of residents? perceptions of equity in the allocation of park and recreation resources. Two additional operationalizations (Demonstrated Use and Coproduction Opportunities) emerged during the research which suggested that Demonstrated Interest was inadequately operationalized, so future efforts could be focused on operationalizing those three. The scale developed in this study is intended to help officials make appropriate decisions when allocating park and recreation resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} finding {{solutions}} {{for improving the}} economic activities in Romania’s undeveloped areas, which still represent {{a major problem for}} this country’s economy. During 1999 and 2009, these areas were considered tax havens, due to some facilities accorded by the Government and the EU (headage <b>compensatory</b> allowances*, <b>tax</b> deductions, non-refundable funds). Many had the opportunity to invest in those regions, but no positive effect was to be seen. Tulcea County (Danube Delta area), coal mine regions, rural areas and the North-East area (Suceava and Botosani county) are considered to be Romania’s less favoured areas. * The objective of these schemes is to provide a reasonable level of income for farmers where natural production conditions are least favourable so as to conserve the countryside by the prevention of further depopulation of rural areas. Compensatory allowances are payable to farmers for the keeping of cattle, sheep and goats. (www. europa. eu...|$|R
40|$|Recovering {{revenue loss}} {{due to the}} {{reduction}} in import tariffs {{is a major concern}} of many developing economies. In an economy with free entry, which affects the product market competition, we show that, even if there is no other tax reform such as a profit tax reform, the market mechanism itself takes care of the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction if entry is sufficiently costly. A <b>compensatory</b> profit <b>tax</b> to compensate the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction is required for an intermediate level of entry cost. If the entry cost is very small, the loss of government revenue following a tariff reduction cannot be compensated even with a profit tax reform. Hence, the net effect of a tariff reduction on government revenue therefore depends on how much tariff and tax revenues are created by entry, which is affected by changes in both the tariff rate and the profit tax rate.

40|$|Economic and {{financial}} crisis in Benin since 1980 s led {{the government to}} embark on a process of economic reforms in 1991. These reforms sought to remedy the fiscal and trade imbalances in order to accelerate economic growth. Trade policy reform was given priority. Import bans and quotas were eliminated, import duties abolished and a <b>compensatory</b> <b>tax</b> on commodities sold in the domestic market instituted. This study analyzes the effects of the trade policy reforms using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and household survey data. Results show that these reforms are more beneficial to households in urban areas, but contribute to worsening poverty conditions of the most poor in rural areas. If liberalization policies target better strategies aimed at fighting poverty, or at least not deteriorating the situation, they need to be designed {{in a way that they}} do not worsen the poverty conditions of the most destitute in society.

40|$|On December 20, 2005, seven northeastern states {{signed the}} Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (2 ̆ 2 RGGI 2 ̆ 2), an {{agreement}} {{aimed at reducing}} greenhouse gas pollution from power plants. Once enacted by each state 2 ̆ 7 s legislature or rulemaking agencies, this agreement will establish a 2 ̆ 2 cap-and-trade 2 ̆ 2 program to cap greenhouse gas emissions within the region and allow power plants to trade emissions allocations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emission reductions projected by current Irish sustainable transport policy and to compare the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and the Smarter Travel scenario, as set out in the 2009 Irish Smarter Travel document. This Smarter Travel scenario projects a 44 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2020, compared with the BAU scenario. Both scenarios are quantified and monetised using the social cost of carbon (SCC) approach and penalty price approach for GHG emissions and the damage cost approach for air pollutants. Total net cost of the policy strategy over the period 2011 to 2020 is estimated to be on average ? 450 mn ($ 640 mn) per annum. Thus, using the SCC approach, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is 0. 67 : 1. Using the penalty price approach, the BCR is 1. 82 : 1. In addition, potential loss in revenue from fuel sales could be ? 1. 3 bn ($ 1. 85 bn) in 2020, which suggests that additional <b>compensatory</b> <b>tax</b> measures may need to be considered. For example, it was estimated that total excise increases of ? 0. 85 ($ 1. 20) per litre for petrol and ? 0. 92 ($ 1. 30) per litre for diesel may be required to compensate for the revenue shortfall...|$|E

5000|$|Tax-free {{shopping}} {{is a privilege}} enjoyed by all residents of United States jurisdictions without sales taxes, but through so-called [...] "remote" [...] sales—including sales to visiting out-of-state residents, sales via catalog, and sales via Internet—customers in a sales taxed jurisdiction may also make purchases in sales tax-free jurisdictions, notwithstanding the legal requirement to pay the equivalent (<b>compensatory)</b> use <b>tax</b> in their home state. Delaware is free of all sales taxes, excluding homes and cars (3% transfer tax for real estate, and a 2.75% tag fee for cars). For example, merchants in tax-free New Hampshire regularly advertise to residents of adjacent Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine the benefits of purchasing goods without sales tax, ignoring {{the fact that there}} is no general exemption from the use taxes when the goods are taken back home. Many purchasers are unaware of the obligation to pay the tax, or file the necessary return, or of the fact that it is not the duty of a merchant to collect it from them and pay it indirectly. However, it is the purchaser's obligation to pay it directly to the state, often in connection with filing their annual income tax return.|$|R
40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} this dissertation is a descriptive analysis and theoretical evaluation of the economic implications of {{the completion of the}} Uruguay Round of trade negotiations on South Africa's industrial and macro-economic performance. The study is an attempt to determine the impact of lower protection on the economy in general, which industrial sectors will gain/lose and how the anti-export bias inherent in South Africa's economy be influenced. A tariff is defined as a tax imposed on commodity imports. There are several types of tariffs, for instance ad valorem tariffs, specific tariffs and composite tariffs. The rationales for levying tariffs may be solely for raising revenue, in which case the home-produced product corresponding to the import would bear on equivalent <b>compensatory</b> <b>tax.</b> However, import duties are generally applied for the purpose of carrying out a particular economic policy, and in this context may be used to serve many functions, amongst others, the improvement of the terms of trade for the country levying the duty, strategic purposes and the protection of infant industries. The anti-export bias of 2, 16 for total manufacturing shows the severe bias in South African policy in favour of inward industrialisation if export promotion policies are excluded from the calculations. Even the inclusion of GEIS does not bring about policy neutrality in terms of the inward and outward orientation. GEIS reduces the anti-export bias by approximately 33 percent for manufacturing from 2, 16 to 1, 44. Summary Page xi Although the South African tariff structure is among the most complex in the world, the level of protection is not exceptionally high. The average statutory tariff in South Africa is 27, 5 per cent, which is approximately equal to the mean for a sample of 32 developing countries for which comparable data exist. The implications of the Uruguay Round for South Africa are clear cut: the country will, as a contracting party to the GATT, have to adhere to the commitments stemming from the Uruguay Round in order to benefit from the more market-oriented international trading environment. The rationale for the overall structure of South Africa's GATT offer is the desire to encourage the manufacture of potentially competitive, higher value-added products, which are either consumer products or capital goods. Beyond this, the relative neutrality of the offer is intended to encourage specialisation in fields in which South Africa has some comparative advantage. Although the GATT agreement will cause some casualties, notably in textiles, clothing and motor assembly, {{the economy as a whole}} will benefit from trade reform. The macro-economic success of trade reform should be evaluated in terms of how well the goals of reform have been attained and at what costs to the economy. Although some short term costs in terms of employment, balance of payments and income distribution could be of some concern in managing the policy changes facing South Africa, the overall findings indicate that the positive effects of the Marrakesh Agreement provide both constraints and opportunities for South Africa's effort to grow competitive industries...|$|E
40|$|Smokers {{not only}} choose {{the number of}} {{cigarettes}} to smoke in any given period {{on the basis of}} price, they also choose the intensity with which to smoke - that is, how much nicotine to inhale. The possibility that quantity-reducing tax policies may be mitigated, or even completely offset, by higher intensity has been raised recently by Adda and Cornaglia (2006). The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine this possibility in the context of a utility-maximizing model of smoking that is based on known toxicological patterns. After calibrating this model to re?ect observed behaviors, it is concluded that continuing smokers o¤set about one third of the quantity-reducing impact of higher <b>taxes.</b> <b>Compensatory</b> behavior thus reduces tax e¤ectiveness, but does not render it neutral.

40|$|Does Congress {{have the}} power under the United States Constitution to <b>tax</b> <b>compensatory</b> {{personal}} injury awards? Several months ago, the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals said 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 in Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service. The court theorized that Ms. Murphy’s compensatory damages award did not constitute “income,” as understood by the enactors of the 16 th Amendment, because the award merely made Ms. Murphy whole rather than increasing her wealth. This paper disputes virtually {{every aspect of the}} Murphy decision. The court made errors from the beginning in analyzing the statutory issues. While the court ultimately reached the correct preliminary conclusion – that Ms. Murphy’s award was statutorily subject to taxation – the court’s flawed analysis led it to consider the constitutionality of, and ultimately to hold unconstitutional, the wrong statute. While the court’s flawed statutory analysis may have been harmless, its flawed constitutional analysis was not harmless. The court of appeals ignored the Constitution’s original Article I grant to Congress of the power to impose taxes, as well as the first 100 years of judicial rulings recognizing Congress’s plenary power under Article I to tax both property transactions and income from human capital, such as wages. A proper review of the pre- 16 th Amendment law shows that Congress could tax Ms. Murphy’s award under its original Article I powers even if the award was not “income” under the 16 th Amendment. Moreover, there was no legitimate support in Murphy for the court’s conclusion that the enactors of the 16 th Amendment in 1913 did not intend for compensatory damages awards to be subject to taxation as “income. ” Instead of citing contemporaneous evidence of intent, the court relied on two 1918 administrative rulings that did not even purport to consider the meaning of the 16 th Amendment, and the court ignored earlier administrative positions, closer in time to the 16 th amendment, treating such awards as taxable. Viewed in context, the 1918 administrative rulings were an attempt to comprehend then-recent Supreme Court decisions interpreting the meaning of the early taxing acts – interpretations that have long since been undermined by Supreme Court judicial opinions. The court of appeals took these administrative rulings out of their historical and factual context in an attempt to attribute to the enactors of the 16 th amendment the conclusion it sought to reach – that Congress does not have the constitutional power to <b>tax</b> <b>compensatory</b> damages awards. The enactors of the 16 th Amendment had a limited objective: to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1895 decisions in Pollock v. Farmers Loan 2 ̆ 6 Trust, which held that Congress lacked the power to impose taxes on income generated by real and personal property without apportionment. It is folly to suggest that the enactors of the 16 th Amendment had a clear opinion about whether non-physical emotional distress damages would constitute “income. ” The enactors of the 16 th Amendment left it to the courts to determine the meaning of “income,” and it took decades after the enactment of the 16 th Amendment for the courts to develop a coherent definition of income. Modern courts recognize that any realized accession to one’s financial wealth constitutes income. By retroactively attributing early judicial determinations to the enactors of the 16 th Amendment, the court of appeals in Murphy seeks to return the law to the state that existed {{at the beginning of the}} century, when tax jurisprudence and the meaning of income were in their early development. The court of appeal’s approach threatens the integrity of the income tax system, which is the lifeblood of the American government. If not promptly overturned, the court of appeal’s decision in Murphy will add fuel to the existing tax protestor firestorm...|$|R
