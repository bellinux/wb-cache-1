40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{computer}} model of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) developed {{with the use of}} HYSYS software was presented. Chemical reactions of methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction were executed in HYSYS software which eliminated the need of creating a complex electrochemical model of these reactions. Obtained resutls were used for determining maximum cell voltage and limiting current density of the investigated fuel cell. An equivalent electrical circuit served for calculating cell voltage after taking ohmic losses and methanol crossover losses into account. A simulation of polarization curve for a cell supplied with 0. 5 mol/dm 3 methanol and pure oxygen operating at 70 ◦C was performed and validated with experimental data. The eﬀects of cathode gas humiditication and methanol concentration change in the range of 0. 5 mol/dm 3 – 3 mol/dm 3 on cell performance were investigated.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaTwo {{different}} types of tracking feeds are currently used {{in the majority of}} telemetry tracking antenna systems when autotrack operation is required. They are of the conical scanner or of the single channel monopulse family and they employ well known technologies. In broadband applications, these feeds all suffer from the same inherent degradation in efficiency caused by their inability to maintain a constant <b>crossover</b> <b>loss</b> value and by their failure to properly illuminate the reflector. In high dynamics situations they can also generate unwanted and sometimes detrimental modulation whenever on-axis tracking is not maintained. In addition, currently available versions of the conical scanner are not capable of high scan rates or of scan rate agility and they are ill-suited for use in tracking systems based on non-orthogonal axes positioners. This paper describes a new high efficiency tracking feed system based on proven conical scanner technology. Its design incorporates features such as variable crossover, steerable beam, high scan rates, scan rate agility as well as stable reference coordinate system. In addition to these features, this new feed is also capable of delivering, in all but one operational category, levels of performance superior to that achievable to date by any other implementation of the conical scanner or of the single channel monopulse technology...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} five years, global {{interest}} regarding the development of renewable energy technologies has significantly increased. The conventional electric power generation methods sourced from fossil fuels is now problematic, from both the supply and emission points of view. Fossil fuels are non-renewable limited resources that have taken millions of years to form; eventually they will be exhausted and the current cost of automotive fuel is evidence of them becoming diminished. The carbon dioxide emissions created through the energy conversion process are causing {{an increase in the}} overall atmospheric concentrations, which through global warming may have serious consequences for humanity. Natural sources of energy production can be derived from the Sun through the use of solar and wind generation methods. Converting these sources to electricity requires the technology of power electronics, the central area of research for this dissertation. Solar energy can most easily be harnessed through the photo-electric effect which creates DC electricity. However, the majority of electric loads and transmission require AC electricity. The inverter is the electronic device required for this power conversion. Wind turbines usually create variable voltage and frequency AC that is rectified to DC and then converted to grid type AC through an inverter. Voltage source inverters, their topologies and control are investigated within this dissertation. Voltage control methods are adopted for both stand-alone and grid connected techniques where control of active and reactive power is required. Current control techniques in the form of PI and hysteresis are applied to allow novel interfaces between generation sources to be achieved. Accurate control of the power electronics allows an enhancement in the power production from the renewable energy source. The power electronic device of the DC-DC converter, either buck or boost is controlled to allow the renewable resource to operate at its optimum power point. The control aspects and algorithms of these converters are central to this research. The solar algorithms of perturb and observe, and incremental conductance are developed with the latter being more favourable to changing levels of irradiation. The author draws a parallel between rapidly changing solar conditions with normally changing wind states. This analogy with an understanding of the mechanics of PMSG allows a novel wind MPPT algorithm to be developed which is simulated in PSIM. Methods to analyse the usefulness of the algorithm are developed and general conclusions are drawn. Another aim central to the research is the efficient combination of renewable energy sources into a single reliable power system. This forms the multi-function aspect of the research. The interconnection of the sources on the AC or DC sides is investigated for both stand-alone and grid connected topologies. A requirement of the stand-alone system is to provide power when no renewable resources are available causing some form of energy storage to be utilised. Conventional batteries are used, causing the VC-VSI to become bi-directional allowing charging. This is simulated in PSIM and demonstrated as part of the Denmark and Eco Beach projects. Many differing topologies of stand alone, grid connected and edge of grid systems are developed, simulated and some are demonstrated. While investigating the currently used topologies the author invents the novel complimentary hybrid system concept. This idea allows a single inverter to be used to feed energy from either the wind or solar resource. With careful engineering of the PV array and wind turbine characteristics only a small loss of energy is caused, deemed the <b>crossover</b> <b>loss.</b> This original concept is mathematically modelled, simulated and demonstrated with results presented from the Denmark project. The strength of this idea is from the quite complimentary nature of wind and solar resources, for only a small proportion of the year are high solar and strong wind conditions occurring simultaneously. Compared to a solar resource, the wind resource is much more complicated to model. An analysis of readily available wind source data is presented with a statistical analysis of the scaling methods; a novel box and whiskers plot is used to convey this information. New software is presented to allow a more accurate and digital model of a power curve to be recreated, allowing a more precise annual energy generation calculation. For various wind turbines a capacity factor analysis is presented with its disadvantages explained. To overcome these issues the concepts of economic efficiency and conversion efficiency are explained. These prevent some of the typical methods to enhance the standard capacity factor expression. The combination of these three methods allows selection of the most suitable wind turbine for a site. The concept of a mini-grid is an isolated power generation and distribution system, which can have its renewable energy sources, centralised or decentralised. The methods used to coalesce conventional generation with renewable energy technology forms another key piece of this research. A design methodology {{for the development of a}} hybrid power system is created with examples used from projects attributed to the author. The harmonising of the renewable energy sources with the conventional generation while providing a stable and robust grid is explained in detail with respect to the generator loading and control. The careful control of the renewable resource output is shown to allow a greater overall penetration of renewable energy into the network while continuing network stability. The concept of frequency shift control is presented, simulated and demonstrated with reference to the Eco Beach project. This project epitomises much of the research that has been presented in this dissertation. It combines centralised and decentralised inverters, with battery storage and the control of diesel generators. An overall controller dictates the optimum times to charge or draw from the battery based upon the local environmental and time of day variables. Finally, the monitoring aspects of this project are representative of a future smart grid where loads may be shed on demand through under frequency or direct control...|$|E

40|$|Designers of {{low-voltage}} dc-to-dc converters {{have two}} main concerns: reducing size and reducing losses. As {{a way of}} reducing size, designers are increasing switching frequencies. But {{the result has been}} reduced converter efficiency. To minimize losses, MOSFET manufacturers have generally focused on lowering on-resistance. But the results have not been optimal for dc-to-dc conversion designs, since gate charge and switching speed issues have been largely ignored. The dominant losses associated with MOSFETs were once conduction losses, but this is no longer the case. Vishay Siliconix’s new family of PWM optimized MOSFETs has been designed to give the highest efficiency available for a given on-resistance in switching applications such as dc-to-dc conversion. These new devices provide a very low gate charge per unit of on-resistance, in addition to fast switching times. The result is reduced gate drive and <b>crossover</b> <b>losses,</b> allowing designers of dc-to-dc converters to simultaneously reduce the design footprint and increase efficiency. MOSFET Losses A simplistic model of power loss in a MOSFET used in a dc-to-dc converter (Figure 1) can be calculated if we know the RMS, the current through the MOSFET, the duty cycle, the gate voltage, and the rDS(on) of the MOSFET. This model can then be used to compare the efficiency of designs using Vishay Siliconix’s new PWM optimized MOSFETs versus conventional and low-threshold power MOSFETs.

40|$|Mutations {{accumulate}} {{during all}} stages of growth, but only germ line mutations contribute to evolution. While meiosis contributes to evolution by reassortment of parental alleles, we show here that the process itself is inherently mutagenic. We have previously shown that the DNA synthesis associated with repair of a double-strand break is about 1000 -fold less accurate than S-phase synthesis. Since the process of meiosis involves many programmed DSBs, we reasoned that this repair might also be mutagenic. Indeed, in the early 1960 's Magni and Von Borstel observed elevated reversion of recessive alleles during meiosis, {{and found that the}} revertants {{were more likely to be}} associated with a crossover than non-revertants, a process that they called "the meiotic effect. " Here we use a forward mutation reporter (CAN 1 HIS 3) placed at either a meiotic recombination coldspot or hotspot near the MAT locus on Chromosome III. We find that the increased mutation rate at CAN 1 (6 to 21 -fold) correlates with the underlying recombination rate at the locus. Importantly, we show that the elevated mutation rate is fully dependent upon Spo 11, the protein that introduces the meiosis specific DSBs. To examine associated recombination we selected for random spores with or without a mutation in CAN 1. We find that the mutations isolated this way show an increased association with recombination (<b>crossovers,</b> <b>loss</b> of <b>crossover</b> interference and/or increased gene conversion tracts). Polζ appears to contribute about half of the mutations induced during meiosis, but is not the only source of mutations for the meiotic effect. We see no difference in either the spectrum or distribution of mutations between mitosis and meiosis.

The separator between {{the positive and negative}} electrodes strongly affects technical and economic performance. However, requirements for separators have not been reported in a general manner that enables quantitative evaluation of new systems such as nonaqueous flow batteries.

Three key transport characteristics are identified: area-specific resistance RΩ, crossover current density ix, and the coupling between <b>crossover</b> and capacity <b>loss</b> Ψ. Suggested maximum area-specific resistances are 0. 29 and 2. 3 Ω·cm[superscript 2] for aqueous and nonaqueous batteries, respectively.

In these designs, minimization of pathways in the membrane that can support the diffusive transport of product gases from the catalyst to the gas-collecting chamber was required to prevent supersaturation of hydrogen or oxygen gases at the Nafion/catalyst interface. Due to the small, thin membrane layer that was required, a small electrode width (< 300 μm) was also required to produce low resistive losses in the system. Alternatively, incorporation of a structured membrane that balances the gas transport and ionic transport allows the maximum electrode width to be increased to dimensions as large as a few millimeters.

40|$|Abstract Background Childhood {{intermittent}} exotropia [X(T) ] {{is a type}} of strabismus (squint) {{in which}} one eye deviates outward at times, usually when the child is tired. It may progress to a permanent squint, loss of stereovision and/or amblyopia (reduced vision). Treatment options for X(T) include eye patches, glasses, surgery and active monitoring. There is no consensus regarding how this condition should be managed, and even when surgery is the preferred option clinicians disagree as to the optimal timing. Reports on the natural history of X(T) are limited, and there is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence on the effectiveness or efficiency of surgery compared with active monitoring. The SamExo (Surgery versus Active Monitoring in Intermittent Exotropia) pilot study has been designed to test the feasibility of such a trial in the UK. Methods Design: an external pilot patient randomised controlled trial. Setting: four UK secondary ophthalmology care facilities at Newcastle NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust, Sunderland Eye Infirmary, Moorfields Eye Hospital and York NHS Trust. Participants: children aged between 6 months and 16 years referred with suspected and subsequently diagnosed X(T). Recruitment target is a total of 144 children over a 9 -month period, with 120 retained by 9 -month outcome visit. Randomisation: permuted blocks stratified by collaborating centre, age and severity of X(T). Interventions: initial clinical assessment; randomisation (eye muscle surgery or active monitoring); 3 -, 6 - and 9 -month (primary outcome) clinical assessments; participant/proxy completed questionnaire covering time and travel costs, health services use and quality of life (Intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire); qualitative interviews with parents to establish reasons for agreeing or declining participation in the pilot trial. Outcomes: recruitment and retention rates; nature and extent of participation bias; nature and extent of biases arising from <b>crossover</b> or <b>loss</b> to follow-up; reasons for agreeing/declining participation; variability of cure rates (to inform power calculations for a definitive RCT); completion rates of outcome measures.

This ring of magnets is based on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) design. R, in cored cables is significantly larger than the contact resistance between adjacent strands R,. The latter, however, dominates the voltage profile when the interstrand contact resistance is measured via the usual VI technique. This makes the extraction of the magnitude of R, out of the voltage profile very difficult. Knowledge of R, is important to predict ac losses, because if R, and R, were equal, perpendicular field induced losses due to R, would be around 50 times greater than those induced by R,. Because {{of the importance of the}} crossover resistance, we have developed'a novel measurement technique for R, in cored Nb-Ti Rutherford cables.

40|$|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) are a {{promising}} {{source of energy}} due to their potentially high energy density, facilitated fuel delivery and storage, and precluded fuel processing. However, DMFCs have several challenges which need to be resolved before they can replace existing energy sources. Some of the challenges include lower power density, relatively high cost, and uncertain reliability. These issues are all promoted, at least in part, by the methanol crossover phenomenon, wherein membrane permeability allows the undesirable species transport of methanol from anode to cathode. This phenomenon also causes the requirement of dilute fuel mixtures, which is undesirable from an energy density viewpoint. 	Steady flow polarization curves were first analyzed at various concentrations. An optimal concentration range was found wherein both methanol <b>crossover</b> and concentration <b>losses</b> were effectively minimized. During the study of transient phenomena, the fuel was first temporarily discontinued. It was found that a significant cell potential enhancement occurred due to anodic fuel concentration reduction and thus depleting the reactant crossover. The percentage voltage increase was considerably greater at higher concentrations. Based on the fuel discontinuation, a hydraulic pulsing operation was developed and tested. During some of these continuous pulsing schemes, fuel discontinuation {{did not result in}} an instantaneous cell potential enhancement mainly due to the internal inertia of the membrane. Nonetheless, a significant cell potential and fuel efficiency enhancement was observed. In addition, the pulse of both fuel and current density resulted in a significant power density increase. M. S.

Direct numerical simulations and low order modeling simulations {{of the flow}} are performed. The kinetic energy E of the turbulent flow and the order parameter M, {{a measure of the}} spatially organised modulation of turbulence, are sampled and processed in view analytical results from the phenomenology of phase transitions. The first <b>crossover</b> concerns the <b>loss</b> of spatial organisation of turbulence in the flow. In the band phase, the order parameter M decreases continuously with the Reynolds number R toward a small value, while its response function χ_M displays a maximum at the crossover. In the uniform phase, the order parameter M and its variance σ decrease toward zero following mean field field scalings M,σ∝ 1 /√(L_xL_z(R-R_c)) as R is increased. The kinetic energy E is an affine function of R except in a small range where a sharp increase is detected, which corresponds to the second crossover. In this range, spatial and temporal coexistence of the uniform turbulence phase and laminar-turbulent bands phase is observed. This sharp increase is concomitant with a maximum of the response function of the kinetic energy. The finite size analysis reveals that the jump does not steepen and that the maximum of response function of E saturates as size is increased. The first crossover is formally identical to a critical phenomenon in condensed matter. The second crossover is in agreement with a first order phase transition smeared by finite noise. The analytical analysis of this phenomenon assuming a non interacting gas of fronts between domain of the two phases provides a scaling of the response function consistent with that of E.
