5|$|As abandoned, Utah <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> berth. There was {{no further}} attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row, {{she had no}} {{military}} value. She was formally placed out of commission on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November. Utah received one battle star for her brief service during World War II. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water; the men killed when Utah sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a war grave.|$|E

He put his second {{lieutenant}} James Gordon in command and gave him a crew of seven men and two boys. Shortly thereafter, a French privateer of one gun and 60 men captured Gordon and his sloop.

25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E

Ms. Spears, in all prior circumstances, had indicated she had, but at the time she was going through this application she did answer 'no.' It had not been a full five years, but four years and eleven months since the surgery [...] and even if she had answered in the affirmative, our contention is that it makes no difference".|$|E

500|$|In August 2017, Swift won a trial against David Mueller, {{a former}} morning show {{personality}} for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years prior Swift had informed Mueller's bosses {{that he had}} assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for making him lose his job. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault. The jury rejected Mueller's claims and {{ruled in favor of}} Swift. The singer thereafter <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> social media accounts, and released [...] "Look What You Made Me Do" [...] as the lead single of her sixth album Reputation. The song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its music video gained over 43.2 million views during its first day on YouTube, breaking the record for the most-viewed music video within 24 hours. In October, Swift released the album's second single, [...] "...Ready for It?", which reached number three in Australia and number four in the US. Reputation was released on November 10.|$|E
500|$|On 26 April 2008, Winehouse was cautioned {{after she}} {{admitted}} to police she slapped a 38-year-old {{man in the}} face, a [...] "common assault" [...] offence, her first of two. She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was [...] "in no fit state" [...] to be interviewed. Ten days later, Winehouse was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail {{a few hours later}} because they could not confirm, from the video, what she was smoking. The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug. Some members of Parliament reacted negatively. Two London residents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to Winehouse. One of the pair was sentenced to two years in prison on 13 December 2008, while the other received a two-year community order.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1939, Kahlo {{sailed to}} Paris {{to follow up}} on André Breton's {{invitation}} to stage an exhibition of her work. When she arrived, it turned out that he had not <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> paintings from the customs and no longer even owned a gallery. With the aid of Marcel Duchamp, she was able to arrange for the Renou et Colle Gallery to host the exhibition. Further problems arose when the gallery refused to show all but two of Kahlo's paintings, considering them too shocking for audiences, and Breton insisted that they be shown alongside photographs by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, pre-Columbian sculptures, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Mexican portraits, and what she considered [...] "junk": sugar skulls, toys, and other items he had bought from Mexican markets.|$|E
2500|$|Coward {{received}} {{no fewer than}} 30 telegrams from Lawrence about the play. She first {{said that she had}} read the play and there was [...] "nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed." [...] Coward [...] "wired back curtly that the only thing {{that was going to be}} fixed was her performance." [...] Lawrence was indecisive about what to do about her previous commitment to André Charlot. Coward finally responded that he planned to cast the play with another actress. By the time he returned to London, he found Lawrence not only had <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> schedule but was staying at Edward Molyneux's villa in Cap-d'Ail in southeastern France learning her lines. Coward joined her, and the two began rehearsing the scenes they shared. At the end of July they returned to London where Coward began to direct the production. Coward played the part of Elyot Chase himself, Adrianne Allen was his bride Sybil, Lawrence played Amanda Prynne, and Laurence Olivier was her new husband Victor. Coward wrote Sybil and Victor as minor characters, [...] "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again". He later insisted, however, that they must be credible new spouses for the lead characters: [...] "We've got to have two people as attractive as Larry and Adrianne were in the first place, if we can find them." ...|$|E
