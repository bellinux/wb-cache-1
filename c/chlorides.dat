5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{frequently}} used in chemical analysis to prepare ("digest") samples for analysis. Concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolves many metals and forms oxidized metal <b>chlorides</b> and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with basic compounds such as calcium carbonate or copper(II) oxide, forming the dissolved <b>chlorides</b> {{that can be}} analyzed.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>chlorides</b> of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular <b>chlorides,</b> as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Silver chloride is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for chlorine.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the <b>chlorides</b> (MCl4). The <b>chlorides</b> of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we are {{interested}} in the eutectic processing of <b>chloride</b> compounds and decided to focus on ammonium based compounds that can provide sufficient insight in the fundamental chemistry. 10 types of ammonium based <b>chloride</b> compounds namely ammonium <b>chloride,</b> methanaminium <b>chloride,</b> dimethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> trimethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> tetramethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> dodecyltrimethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> hexadecyltrimethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> phenyltrimethylammonium <b>chloride,</b> benzyltrimethylammonium <b>chloride</b> and (vinylbenzyl) trimethylammonium <b>chloride</b> were used in this study. This research led to a hypothesis that the ammonium based <b>chloride</b> compounds could be reacted with urea through complexation reaction giving eutectic mixtures. However, functional groups have plays an important role to influence melting points of these eutectic mixtures. This is regarded to be a motivating finding that will be important for the most future research work involving complexation reaction for the production of eutectic mixtures...|$|R

5|$|Hydrochloric acid can {{therefore}} be used to prepare salts called <b>chlorides.</b> Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, since it is completely dissociated in water.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{hydrated}} metal <b>chlorides,</b> hydrated iron(III) chloride {{can be converted}} to the anhydrous salt by refluxing with thionyl chloride. Conversion of the hydrate to anhydrous iron(III) chloride is not accomplished by heating, as HCl and iron oxychlorides are produced.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary <b>chlorides.</b> The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the highly unstable XeCl2 and XeCl4); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than chlorine's (oxygen and fluorine) so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not <b>chlorides</b> but rather oxides or fluorides of chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Thionyl <b>chloride</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with sulfuryl <b>chloride,</b> SO2Cl2, but {{the properties of}} these compounds differ significantly. Sulfuryl <b>chloride</b> {{is a source of}} chlorine whereas thionyl <b>chloride</b> is a source of <b>chloride</b> ions.|$|R

5|$|Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable <b>{{chloride}}s.</b> A notable {{example is}} titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), {{which is used}} as a catalyst for production of polyolefins (see Ziegler-Natta catalyst) and a reducing agent in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous <b>chlorides.</b> Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} is also {{a popular}} source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt, which is stable up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt. It will convert electron-deficient aryl <b>chlorides</b> to aryl fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
50|$|Generally, the sodium, <b>chloride,</b> {{potassium}} and lactate {{come from}} NaCl (sodium <b>chloride),</b> NaC3H5O3 (sodium lactate), CaCl2 (calcium <b>chloride),</b> and KCl (potassium <b>chloride).</b>|$|R
25|$|They {{are usually}} {{manufactured}} with saturated potassium <b>chloride</b> electrolyte, {{but can be}} used with lower concentrations such as 1 mol/kg potassium <b>chloride.</b> As noted above, changing the electrolyte concentration changes the electrode potential. Silver <b>chloride</b> is slightly soluble in strong potassium <b>chloride</b> solutions, so it is sometimes recommended the potassium <b>chloride</b> be saturated with silver <b>chloride</b> to avoid stripping the silver <b>chloride</b> off the silver wire.|$|R

5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium <b>chlorides,</b> at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium was {{reportedly}} first detected in 1966 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded 242Pu with accelerated 22Ne ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to <b>chlorides</b> by interaction with ZrCl4.|$|E
5|$|ZnO reacts {{slowly with}} fatty acids in oils {{to produce the}} {{corresponding}} carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement-like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy <b>chlorides.</b> This cement was used in dentistry.|$|E
40|$|Rat {{proximal}} convoluted tubules were perfused in vivo {{to examine}} the active and passive components of <b>chloride</b> absorption. <b>Chloride</b> flux was a linear function of the transepithelial electrochemical driving force, yielding a permeability coefficient of 20. 6 X 10 (- 5) cm/s. In {{the absence of an}} electrochemical driving force, <b>chloride</b> absorption persisted at the rate of 131 peq/mm X min, thus demonstrating active absorption of <b>chloride.</b> Addition of luminal cyanide to tubules absorbing <b>chloride</b> inhibited net <b>chloride</b> absorption. In tubules perfused with a low luminal <b>chloride</b> concentration in which there was net <b>chloride</b> secretion, addition of luminal cyanide increased the magnitude of net <b>chloride</b> secretion. These studies demonstrate that transepithelial <b>chloride</b> transport involves two components: a passive paracellular flux and an active transcellular flux. Cyanide affects net <b>chloride</b> flux by inhibiting active transcellular <b>chloride</b> absorption...|$|R
50|$|Some low-oxidation state {{transition}} metals have halides which dissolve well in water, such as ferrous <b>chloride,</b> nickelous <b>chloride,</b> and cupric <b>chloride.</b> Metal cations {{with a high}} oxidation state tend to undergo hydrolysis instead, e.g. ferric <b>chloride,</b> aluminium <b>chloride,</b> and titanium tetrachloride.|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} between thermograms {{can be seen}} in the example of four different chloro-polymers: (a) polyvinyl <b>chloride,</b> (b) chlorinated polyvinyl <b>chloride,</b> (c) chlorinated rubber, and (d) polyvinylidene <b>chloride.</b> There are two stages of degradation in these four polymers. The first stage is the loss of hydrogen <b>chloride,</b> and is complete around 250 °C. This first step occurs at lower temperatures for the polymers containing more chlorine (chlorinated polyvinyl <b>chloride,</b> chlorinated rubber, and polyvinylidene <b>chloride),</b> implying that these <b>chloride</b> groupings are less stable than in polyvinyl <b>chloride.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting <b>chlorides</b> were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the <b>chlorides</b> of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the very unstable XeBr2); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, fluorides, or <b>chlorides</b> of bromine.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium <b>chlorides</b> also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
