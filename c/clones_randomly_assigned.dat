40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Research Station of Brawijaya University from April to August 2009. An augmented randomized complete block design with seven blocks was utilized, seven parental clones as standard treatments and seven half-sib families as augmented treatments. Each block consisted of seven parental <b>clones</b> plus one <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> family of half-sibs. In addition, the first block contained 29 accessions, the 2 nd block had 120, the 3 rd block had 194, the 4 th block had 45, the 5 th block had 28, the 6 th block had 186, and the 7 th block had 108. Ten cuttings of each parental was planted in each block, along with a single plant of each accession. There were five improved clones identified with high protein content and high yield, ranging from 6. 00 - 8. 21 % dwb and 1. 95 to 2. 73 kg/plant, respectively. Broad-sense heritability and genetic advance of storage root weight, storage root number, percentage dry matter and protein content were high, whereas vegetative biomass and harvest index were low. The results showed that storage root weight, storage root number, percentage dry matter and protein content {{could be used as}} the basis for a crop improvement program in sweet potato...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{optimize}} {{treatment for}} younger patients with {{acute myeloid leukemia}} and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome by comparing induction options {{and the number of}} consolidation courses and whether consolidation should include transplantation. Patients and Methods: We <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> 1, 658 patients younger than age 60 years to receive mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide versus cytarabine/daunorubicin/etoposide and subsequently 1, 193 patients to daunorubicin/cytarabine/thioguanine (DAT) where the cytarabine dose was standard (S-DAT) versus double the standard dose (H-DAT). Patients in this randomization were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to all-trans-retinoic acid or not. In consolidation, 992 patients were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> between a total of four courses versus five courses, and 324 patients who were not good risk were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to transplantation or chemotherapy as the final course. Results: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 74...|$|R

A crossover clinical trial is a repeated-measures design in which each patient is <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to a sequence of treatments, including at least two treatments (of which one may be a standard treatment or a placebo): Thus each patient crosses over from one treatment to another.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Both {{gemcitabine}} (GEM) and fluoropyrimidines {{are valuable}} treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. This open-label {{study was designed}} to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to GEM alone or GEM plus capecitabine (GEM-CAP). Patients and Methods Patients with previously untreated histologically or cytologically proven locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas with a performance status ≤ 2 were recruited. Patients were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to GEM or GEM-CAP. The primary outcome measure was survival. Meta-analysis of published studies was also conducted. Results Between May 2002 and January 2005, 533 patients were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to GEM (n = 266) and GEM-CAP (n = 267) arms.

40|$|No {{prospective}} randomized {{trial has}} specifically examined the long-term outcomes of clopidogrel use {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to determine {{the risks and benefits}} of long-term clopidogrel administration in patients with diabetic nephropathy, {{the most common form of}} chronic kidney disease. We performed a post hoc analysis of the CHARISMA trial, which <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> patients without active acute coronary syndrome, but with established atherosclerotic disease (symptomatic) or multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (asymptomatic), to clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin. All CHARISMA patients (n = 15, 603) were separated into the 3 groups: nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients without nephropathy, and diabetic patients with nephropathy. Within each group, outcomes of patients <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to clopidogrel were compared with those of patients <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to placebo. Outcomes in the prespecified CHARISMA subgroups of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were also compared with respect to study drug assignment and nephropathy status. Patients with nephropathy who received clopidogrel had no difference in bleeding, but experienced significantly increased cardiovascular (CV) and overall mortality compared with those <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to placebo. There were no differences in bleeding, overall mortality, or CV mortality for nondiabetic or diabetic patients without nephropathy who received clopidogrel versus placebo. In the asymptomatic cohort, patients with nephropathy <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to clopidogrel had significantly increased overall and CV mortality compared with placebo, whereas asymptomatic patients without nephropathy <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to clopidogrel had no significant mortality difference compared with placebo. In conclusion, this post hoc analysis suggested that clopidogrel may be harmful in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Additional studies are needed to investigate this possible interaction...|$|R
