Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the concept of}} “port community” has been adopted by the {{maritime}} transport industry {{in order to achieve}} a higher degree of coordination and cooperation amongst organizations involved in the transfer of goods through the port area. The business processes of the port <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> chain form a complicated process which involves several process steps, multiple actors, and numerous information exchanges. One of the widely used applications of ICT in ports is the Port Community System (PCS) which is implemented in ports in order to reduce paperwork and to facilitate the information flow related to port operations and cargo clearance. However, existing PCSs are limited in functionalities that facilitate the management and coordination of material, financial, and information flows within the port <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> chain. This research programme addresses the use of agent technology to introduce business process management functionalities, which are vital for port communities, aiming to the enhancement of the performance of the port <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The investigation begins with an examination of the current state in view of the business perspective and the technical perspective. The business perspective focuses on understanding the nature of the port community, its main characteristics, and its problems. Accordingly, a number of requirements are identified as essential amendments to information systems in seaports. On the other hand, the technical perspective focuses on technologies that are convenient for solving problems in business process management within port communities. The research focuses on three technologies; the workflow technology, agent technology, and service orientation. An analysis of information systems across port communities enables an examination of the current PCSs with regard to their coordination and workflow management capabilities. The most important finding of this analysis is that the performance of the business processes, and in particular the performance of the port <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> chain, is not in the scope of the examined PCSs. Accordingly, the Agent-Based Middleware for Port Community Management (ABMPCM) is proposed as an approach for providing essential functionalities that would facilitate collaborative planning and business process management. As a core component of the ABMPCM, the Collaborative Planning Facility (CPF) is described in further details. A CPF prototype has been developed as an agent-based system for the domain of inland transport of containers to demonstrate its practical effectiveness. To evaluate the practical application of the CPF, a simulation environment is introduced in order to facilitate the evaluation process. The research started with the definition of a multi-agent simulation framework for port <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Then, a prototype has been implemented and employed for the evaluation of the CPF. The results of the simulation experiments demonstrate that our agent-based approach effectively enhances the performance of business process in the port community...|$|E

Of 7, 500 anonymous postal questionnaires mailed out, 2, 065 responses were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. Those who reported a water advisory (p < 0. 001) or living {{in the area for}} £ 10 years (p = 0. 01) were more likely to choose bottled water. Those who reported tap water was not safe to drink were more likely to choose bottled water, an effect greater for those who had no aesthetic complaints (p ≤ 0. 001), while those with aesthetic complaints were more likely to choose bottled water if they believed the water was safe (p < 0. 001). Respondents who treated their water and did not use a <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> were more likely to choose bottled water (p < 0. 001), while those who did not treat their water were more likely to choose bottled water regardless of whether a <b>community</b> <b>supply</b> was used (p < 0. 001). A similar pattern of risk factors was associated with a decreased likelihood of consuming tap water daily; however, the use of a community water supply was not significant.

40|$|The {{building}} {{sector is}} responsible {{for more than one}} third of end energy consumption. The larger part of energy used for heating is won from highly exergetic fuels (e. g. coal, gas and electricity). Since living spaces are usually heated up to around 20 °C, low exergetic fuels are sufficient. Economically viable energy sources with low exergy share already exist for this application. Main target of the work carried out is to demonstrate advantages of exergy assessment for increased efficiency of <b>community</b> <b>supply.</b> For this reason different supply scenarios, based on fossil and renewable energy sources, are investigated. The different renewable energy supply units are regarded individually or in two or three-way combinations. In this study on one hand renewable and fossil-based supply are compared {{and on the other hand}} benefits by merging of several renewable energy suppliers for a small building group with a high energy standard are identified. For evaluation and identification of the best supply solution, the exergetic assessment method is applied. Additionally simplified aspects of operational management are regarded to compare the different supply solutions. The evaluation of the scenarios clearly shows that the combination of innovative supply strategies and exergetic assessment leads to an "holistic understanding" of the energy conversion chain and offers prospects for optimized <b>community</b> <b>supply.</b> Additional economic considerations and an analysis of emissions should be included in the evaluation.
