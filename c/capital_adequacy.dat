5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E

25|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{monetary}} policy {{have proven to}} be particularly sensitive, and the BIS therefore has two specific goals: to regulate <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> and make reserve requirements transparent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> policy {{applies to}} equity and capital assets. These can be overvalued in many {{circumstances}} {{because they do}} not always reflect current market conditions or adequately assess the risk of every trading position. Accordingly, the Basel standards require the capital/asset ratio of internationally active commercial banks to be above a prescribed minimum international standard, to improve the resilience of the banking sector.|$|E
25|$|By 2010, banking in India was {{generally}} fairly mature {{in terms of}} supply, product range and reach-even though reach in rural India still remains a challenge {{for the private sector}} and foreign banks. In terms of quality of assets and <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy,</b> Indian banks are considered to have clean, strong and transparent balance sheets relative to other banks in comparable economies in its region. The Reserve Bank of India is an autonomous body, with minimal pressure from the government.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007, which resulted from insufficient consumer financial {{protection in the}} US, conflicts {{of interest in the}} credit rating agency industry, and defective transparency requirements in derivatives markets, triggered a massive rise in corporate insolvencies. Contemporary debate, particularly in the banking sector, has shifted to prevention of insolvencies, by scrutinising excessive pay, conflicts of interest among financial services institutions, <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy,</b> and the causes of excessive risk taking. The Banking Act 2009 created a special insolvency regime for banks, called the special resolution regime, envisaging that banks will be taken over by the government in extreme circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The BIS {{hosts the}} Secretariat of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{and with it}} has {{played a central role}} in {{establishing}} the Basel Capital Accords of 1988, Basel II framework in 2004 and more recently Basel III framework. There remain significant differences between United States, European Union, and United Nations officials regarding the degree of <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> and reserve controls that global banking now requires. Put extremely simply, the United States, as of 2006, favoured strong strict central controls in the spirit of the original 1988 accords, while the EU was more inclined to a distributed system managed collectively with a committee able to approve some exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E
25|$|The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and Financial Sector Reform Programme (FSRP) {{were formed}} in 1990, upon {{contracts}} with the World Bank. These programs sought to remove government distortions and lessen the financial repression. Policies made use of the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which stated that removing distortions augments efficiency in the credit market and increases competition. The policies therefore involved banks providing loans on a commercial basis, enhancing bank efficiency and limiting government control to monetary policy only. FSRP forced banks to have a minimum <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy,</b> to systematically classify loans and to implement modern computerised systems, including those that handle accounting. It forced the central bank to free up interest rates, revise financial laws and increase supervision in the credit market. The government also developed the capital market, which was also performing poorly.|$|E
25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating part of {{the company}} may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five years}} from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> took a backseat.|$|E

[...] Chemical's level of capital {{at the end of}} 1995 remained strong, with <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements.

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other <b>capital</b> <b>adequacy</b> requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must {{bear the burden of}} financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E
