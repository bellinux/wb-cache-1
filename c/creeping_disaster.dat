40|$|The {{desertification}} {{process is}} a <b>creeping</b> <b>disaster,</b> consuming the marginal lands. It is imperative to map all the dry-land {{areas of the country}} for Desertification Status Mapping. Thus a suitable data set is required for the purpose which holds desired application potential at 1 : 500, 000 scale for preparing large area Nationwide Desertification Status Maps. Hence the current exercise has been used to compare DSM prepared AWiFS with LISS III and WiFS data for a selected area around Sambhar lake in Rajasthan which represents marginal land, prone to desertification. The present paper gives the details of analysis and the results obtained while evaluating IRS-P 6, Resourcesat-AWiFS data. 1...|$|E
40|$|Drought {{is often}} {{referred}} a <b>creeping</b> <b>disaster</b> as {{it takes time to}} mature, impactsmay linger on for a considerably longer time period even after the termination ofthe event. Pakistan is climatically an arid to semi-arid country frequently in thegrip of meteorological droughts. Since Pakistan has an agro-based economy, thusin drought years its economy cripples. The response of the government to thisrecurrently occurring disaster, has been reactive. This research delineates thepattern of meteorological droughts in Pakistan for the time period 1980 - 2010 andalso defines droughts in the perspective of Pakistanâ€™s climatic conditions. Droughtmapping has been a neglected area in Pakistan. This paper offers map showing thespatial pattern of meteorological droughts in Pakistan and reveals that Sindh andBalochistan are the most arid parts of the country and have a high probability ofextreme meteorological drough...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural drought is a <b>creeping</b> <b>disaster</b> that overshadows the {{vegetative}} cover {{in general and}} cropland specifically in Iraq, a country that was well known for its agricultural production and fertile soil. In the recent years, the arable lands in Iraq experienced increasing land degradation that led to desertification, economic losses, food insecurity, and deteriorating environment. Remote sensing is employed {{in this study and}} four different indices are utilized, each of which is derived from MODIS satellite mission products. Agricultural drought maps are produced from 2003 to 2015 after masking the vegetation cover. Year 2008 was found the most severe drought year during the study period, where drought covered 37 % of the vegetated land. This part of the study demonstrated the capability of remote sensing in fulfilling the need of an early warning system for agricultural drought over such a data-scarce region. This study also aims to monitor hydrological drought. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived monthly Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) is the hydrological drought indicator, that is used to calculate the deficit. Severity of drought events are calculated by integrating monthly water deficit over the drought period. In addition, drought recovery time is assessed depending on the estimated deficit. Major drought events are classified into several levels of severity by applying a drought monograph approach. The results demonstrated that GRACE TWS is a reliable indicator for drought assessment over Iraq, and provides useful information for decision makers which can be utilized in developing drought adaptation and mitigation strategies...|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods to}} visualize, map and graph European drought events since the 1970 s are now {{available}} through the European Drought Observatory (EDO). Monitoring drought is a task that requires the combination of various data sources and indicators {{in order to provide}} a comprehensive picture of this complex natural event and its manifold impacts. The monitoring of rainfall and temperature for periods over 40 years, combined with soil moisture modelling gives insight {{in the development of a}} <b>creeping</b> drought <b>disaster.</b> The further combination of such information with satellite observations measuring vegetation response allows identifying actual and potential damage to the vegetation canopy. In order to give the audience a quick insight in the development of a drought disaster the EDO team developed a Combined Drought Indicator showing the progression of a rainfall deficit through the hydrological cycle. This index will be presented using animated maps allowing visualizing the temporal and spatial development of recent drought events in Europe with a specific view on irrigated areas. JRC.
