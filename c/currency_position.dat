40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three new}} empirical {{findings on the}} role of currencies in global stock and bond portfolios. First, while currency risk hedging significantly reduces portfolio risk, both in-sample and out-of-sample, currency hedging only yields significant improvements in the risk-return tradeoff for fixed income portfolios. For global equity portfolios the Sharpe ratio often decreases when hedging currency risk. Second, speculative <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> lead to economically large and statistically significant improvements in portfolio Sharpe ratios. This holds in-sample for all passive and active portfolio strategies and home currencies that we consider. The significance of the benefits of dynamic speculative <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> in global equity portfolios survives the out-of sample tests for several home currencies. Our speculative currency portfolio differs from thesimplecarry,asitisamean-varianceoptimal portfolio, and hence takes the correlations between the different currencies into account.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the stability of the Croatian banking sector. After the banking crisis of 1998, the Croatian banking system underwent a deep transformation process; foreign investors gained a dominating market share of more than 90 % of total assets, with Austrian banks holding 43 % thereof. Compared to other Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), the degree of banking intermediation is relatively high in Croatia. In recent years, lending to the private sector and in particular to households has risen whereas lending to the general government has declined. Foreign currencies continue {{to play an important role}} in the Croatian banking sector, in particular on the liabilities side of banks balance sheets. While maintaining a large negative net foreign <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> on their balance sheets (with an increasing portion of net liabilities to nonresidents), Croatian banks overall net foreign <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> seems to be marginally positive. Still, foreign currency(-indexed) lending represents a credit risk as it entails an indirect exchange rate risk.

This paper uses a simple Fisherian model of the ‘overborrowing syndrome’ to compare the Asian crises of 1997 with earlier overborrowing episodes in Mexico and Chile. While important similarities exist, the crises in South East Asia have been exacerbated by the unhedged foreign exchange positions of Asian banks. These open <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> not only imposed significant additional losses on the banks following devaluation, they also magnified the scale of overborrowing during the cycle’s initial boom phase. Failure to limit the exposure of banks to foreign exchange risk therefore increased the magnitude of the boom - bust overborrowing cycle both ex ante and ex post. The paper highlights the importance of effective regulation and supervision of capital markets, with a focus on limiting the speculative <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> of banks, especially those that form the core of the domestic payments system and therefore enjoy a (possibly implicit) public guarantee. Improving the institutional infrastructure of financial supervision is the only effective way of mitigating the macroeconomic costs of overborrowing. JEL Classification: O 16, F 32, F 34, E 44.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the theoretical literature that analyses the link between international asset trade and international risk sharing. Despite the massive increase in cross-border asset trade since the 1990 's, consumption risk sharing across countries remains limited. In standard international business cycle models, efficient risk sharing requires that consumption should be higher {{in the country where}} it is cheaper to consume, implying a high positive correlation between relative consumption and real exchange rate, which is strongly rejected in the data. Recent contributions show {{that it is possible to}} account for this so-called 'consumption-real exchange rate anomaly' in models with goods and financial market frictions where international asset trade is restricted to a single non-contingent bond. Chapter 1 analyses whether this class of models can account for the anomaly under a richer asset market structure where agents can trade in domestic and foreign currency bonds. Even such a small departure from the single bond economy implies too much risk sharing compared to the data although the number of assets that can be traded is less than the number of shocks affecting each economy. Introducing demand shocks alongside sector-specific productivity shocks can improve the performance of the model only under specific parameter and monetary policy settings. Chapter 2 extends this analysis to study the implications of international trade in equities, portfolio transaction costs and recursive utility. Chapter 3 studies the interaction between monetary policy and foreign <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> in more detail. Different monetary policy regimes can lead to different foreign <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> by changing the cyclical properties of the nominal ex- change rate. These external positions, in turn, affect the cross-border transmission of monetary policy shocks via a valuation channel. The way export prices are set has important implications for optimal foreign <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> and the valuation channel when prices are sticky and financial markets are incomplete. Chapter 4 compares the international transmission of uncertainty shocks under alternative asset markets with an emphasis on the behaviour of net foreign assets, exchange rate and currency risk premium and shows that a model with restricted asset trade performs better than a model with complete financial integration in matching certain aspects of the data regarding the dynamics of these variables in response to increased macroeconomic uncertainty.

40|$|Rapid {{credit growth}} in the EU new Member States, acceding and {{candidate}} countries has {{raised the issue of}} financial stability in the region. This rapid credit growth has been accompanied by the deterioration in the current account balance and the large-scale distribution of foreign currency loans. In {{the first part of this}} study, we analyse the overall stability of the banking sector vis-à-vis the very rapid credit growth. Given the high share of foreign currency loans, we examine the exposure to exchange rate risk. We identify that the main vulnerability for the banking system stems from the open <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> held by fi nal borrowers (households and businesses). These economic agents are generally not hedged against exchange rate risk. In the event of a depreciation in the national currency, the banking system would therefore be exposed to an increase in payment defaults on foreign currency loans. We consider this to be “indirect” credit risk for the banking system. In the second part, we explore the likelihood of a currency crisis. We estimate an econometric model for the link between credit growth and the current account balance showing a significant negative relationship in these countries, i. e. a 1 -percentage-point increase in credit flow as a percentage of GDP deteriorates the current account-to-GDP ratio by 0. 5 percentage point. Consequently, excessively high credit growth would contribute to deteriorate the current account beyond a sustainable level and would increase the likelihood of a currency crisis. Currently, external vulnerability remains contained in the countries under review, though it has increased in most of them since 2000. Lastly, we implement causality tests to evaluate the nature of credit growth. When the causality detected indicates that credit growth fuels domestic demand, and not the opposite, this could be interpreted as a potential risk for the system insofar as strong credit growth may lead to excessive demand beyond that related to a simple catching-up process. For countries where this test is significant, a causal relationship from credit growth to domestic demand has been detected in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Poland. The causality detected in Croatia and Romania is heading in the opposite direction. credit growth, new Member States, monetary approach to the balance of payments, currency crisis, banking crisis. ...|$|E
