However, we still lack {{a clear understanding of}} the functional role earthworms play in terrestrial ecosystems, partly because easy-to-use methods to quantify their activities are missing. In this study, we tested whether earthworms and their casts can be dual-labelled with 15 N and 13 C stable isotopes by cultivating them in soil substrate amended with 15 N ammonium nitrate and 13 C-glucose. Additionally, we also wanted to know whether (i) earthworms from different functional groups (soil-feeders vs. litter-feeders) and their casts would differ in their incorporation of stable isotopes, (ii) if enrichment levels are higher if the same amount of isotopes is applied in one dose or in staggered doses, and (iii) if isotopic enrichment in casts changes when they are stored in a <b>conditioning</b> <b>cabinet</b> or in a pot filled with soil placed in a greenhouse. Our findings show the feasibility of dual-labelling tissues and casts of both litter-feeding (Lumbricus terrestris) and soil-feeding (Aporrectodea caliginosa) earthworms using the same method. The advantage of this method is that earthworms and their casts can be labelled under realistic conditions by cultivating them for only four days in soil that received a one-time addition of commercially available stable isotopes instead of offering labelled plant material. In earthworms, the isotopic enrichment remained at a stable level for at least 21 days; labelled casts could be stored for at least 105 days without significantly decreasing their isotopic signals. This simple and efficient method opens new avenues for studying the role of these important ecosystem engineers in nutrient cycling and their functional relationships with other organisms...|$|E
40|$|Seeds {{of double}} low oilseed rape variety Mango (Brassica napus, var. oleifera) were {{subjected}} to a 7 -day germination at 25 °C and 95 % moisture content in darkness in a <b>conditioning</b> <b>cabinet.</b> The effects of the germination process on the superoxide dismutase-like activity (SOD-like activity), thiamine (vitamin B 1) and riboflavin (vitamin B 2) and minerals, such as Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe and Mn, were studied. Correlations between individual mineral contents, vitamin B 1 and B 2 contents, {{and the ability of}} phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extracts from germinated rapeseed to scavenge superoxide anion radicals in vitro were also investigated. SOD-like activity showed a gradual increase after the second day of germination, reaching a maximum level on the sixth day, and remained almost constant up {{to the end of the}} germination period. During germination, thiamine underwent a progressive decrease up to the sixth day, reaching a constant level between the sixth and the seventh day. In contrast, riboflavin content increased throughout the germination period up to the fifth day, and after that a constant level was observed. Levels of Ca and Mg were almost constant up to the fourth day and after that an increase of these minerals was observed. Cu and Mn increased during the germination process, and retentions of 33 % and 22 %, respectively, were observed at the end of germination. Fe content dropped after 1 day of germination and from there onward it started to increase gradually and an 18 % retention was observed in 7 -day germinated seeds. Positive correlations between SOD-like activity and riboflavin (r = 0. 87), Cu (r = 0. 74) and Mn (r = 0. 87) were found during rapeseed germinationPolish-Spanish (PAN – CFIC) collaboration 2005 PL- 0018 and it was funded in parts by the Spanish Commission of Science and Technology AGL 2002 - 02905 /ALI and AGL 2004 - 00886 /ALI, and statutory funds of the Department of Food Technology of the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
