It attempts to construct an understanding of Dickens in which <b>comic</b> <b>modes</b> are as vital as the dramatic {{to our understanding of}} Dickens's methods, themes and purposes. It adopts an inclusive approach to methodology in recognition of the wide-ranging nature of Dickensian comedy, deploying theorisations of the comic {{in the context of a}} Marxist approach to nineteenth-century modernity. It asserts {{the importance}} of the tradition of comic quixotic fiction in which Dickens can be seen to have written. It demonstrates that Dickens developed an individual response to the nature of emergent modernity that can be distinguished by contrast with other theorisations of the comic from the period. It examines distinctive Dickensian comic formulations of comic characterisation and the equally distinctive nature of Dickensian comic language and satire.

Multimodal texts, like comics, require that we expand our {{conception}} of literacy beyond reading and writing to include, for example, the kind of visual literacy that prepares students to “read” texts that employ images, symbols, graphs, diagrams, etc. Researchers are discovering that, despite an entrenched cultural bias against comics, the literacy skills required to read them are often as sophisticated as those employed in reading school-based texts.

40|$|With an {{ever-increasing}} variety of comics being produced, {{it was inevitable}} that someone try to create poetry comics. However, most attempts at merging comics with poetry have ended in texts that fail to engage the hybrid nature of comics in a satisfactory manner.

The strict language constructions of poetry, if explicitly maintained, will at best result in an illustrated poem. This paper argues that {{there is a way to}} create true poetry comics by realizing the segmentivity of poetry and merging that with the <b>comic’s</b> <b>modes</b> of panel and frames.

40|$|Critical {{studies on}} the comic drama of the seventeenth-century French playwright, Jean-Baptiste Poquelin de Moliere (1622 - 1673), center {{attention}} on biography, production, stylistics, and thematic development. Because {{of the diversity of}} themes, and because of the considerable productivity of this dramatist, the analyses of the style and substance of these comedies have often been focused on the use of themes or techniques employed in a single comedy or associated with one single sort of comedy. This thesis, "Farce, critique sociale, et ccm 6 die morale chez Moliere," proposes to deepen, in two ways, our appreciation of Moliere's combined use of themes and techniques that, in turn, create three sorts of <b>comic</b> <b>modes.</b> First, through a close reading of three of Moliere's major plays (Le medecin malgre lul, Les Precieuses ridicules, and Misanthrope), this thesis attempts to describe the techniques that develop and elucidate a particular comic focus, and thereby enhances our awareness of Moliere's recognition of the necessary relationship between theme and technique in the creation of comedy. The description of this use of comic techniques and the subsequent development of themes encourage classification of these representative plays into three sorts: farce, social comedy, and moral comedy. Such a classification thus expands the narrow perspective of criticism, and encourages a study of the necessary relationship between theme and technique and, perhaps, will suggest future study of the development of Moliere's comic artistry.

40|$|The {{assemblage}} of comics, Deleuzian metaphysics and middle-aged {{men in the}} context of psychosocial research is an experiment in the sense that Deleuze advocates for the furtherance of thought. The works of Deleuze and Deleuze and Guattari can allow us, it is suggested, to bring together theoretical problems in comics theory with theoretical problems in psychosocial research and provide us with new insights as to how we might look at visual data qualitatively from participants who agreed to recount episodes of their relationships in graphic narrative form. Both psychosocial qualitative research and comics theory are new and fast moving fields which offer scope for creative thinking. It is argued in this thesis that the ‘affective’ and ‘visual’ turns, which are having an important impact in the social sciences, corresponds to the expressive function of comics, specially in the autobiographical, memoir and confessional genre. Having set the theoretical lens with the work of Deleuze and Guattari and some of their commentators, examples from commercially published works are examined in order to relate theory to empirical examination, prior to considering the work submitted by participants.

40|$|This practice-based {{research}} {{uses the}} context of the documentary assertions around the Indian nuclear project to examine how <b>comic</b> <b>modes</b> and irony can be employed to undermine authoritarian knowledge claims that make use of the epistephilic dimensions of the documentary form. An analysis of the pro-nuclear assertions in the documentary narratives of two state institutions in India, Films Division and Vigyan Prasar, was done as part of this enquiry. The diverse ways in which Indian anti-nuclear films engage with these narratives in humorous and ironic ways was also studied. The insights gained from this analysis contributed to the production and circulation of a film I made titled Nuclear Hallucinations, which is centred around the Kudankulam anti-nuclear movement in South India. Through its processes, the research develops a specific configuration of the vantage point of what I call tamasha in order to unsettle the certainty of pro-nuclear knowledge claims in documentary. Nuclear Hallucinations experiments with the use of satirical impersonations, irony, hallucinatory voice-overs and comic appropriation of pronuclear arguments to arrive at strategies that can elicit a response from the realm of tamasha. These experiments are informed by a framework that treats film as a process that goes beyond the limits of the edited film; the sites of engagement created during the production and circulation phases of the film are treated with equal importance. The research argues that the interventions created by the vantage point of tamasha offer new ways to resist the epistemological violence of documentary narratives that privilege the documentary form’s ability to authorize assured knowledge claims...|$|R

It sketches some possible inter-relations amongst the types of reasons given and raises various methodological worries about how the argument for tragedy’s superiority typically proceeds.

40|$|Through {{her poetry}} and essays Constance Naden (1858 - 1889) sought {{to create an}} {{interdisciplinary}} philosophy predicated upon finding unity in diversity. By providing close-readings of Naden’s poetry, essays, and unpublished notebooks, and thus considering the full breadth of her intellectual pursuits, this thesis demonstrates the extent of her secular world-scheme which attempted to synthesise science, philosophy, and poetry. I begin with an intellectual biography that situates Naden’s scientific education, philosophical ideas, and poetic output in their nineteenth-century contexts. This creates a framework for understanding the trajectory of Naden’s endeavours as scientist, philosopher, and poet. The subsequent chapters demonstrate how these three strands of her life were fundamentally intertwined. Chapter Two focuses upon Naden’s engagement with scientific ideas and the scientific imagination, specifically examining the importance of light as it manifests {{in the study of}} botany, astronomy, physics, and physiology. Chapter Three turns to Naden as philosopher, teasing out the details of her childhood faith (newly demonstrated by the notebooks) and analysing the development of her relationship with the freethought movement and wider philosophical discourses.

40|$|Early in his {{landmark}} ecocritical book The Comedy of Survival, Joseph Meeker develops {{an intriguing}} hypothesis about human behaviour. He remarks the species Homo sapiens tend {{to behave like}} an invasive or pioneering organism, entering a bio-geographical region and aggressively outcompeting all other species for space and resources. Moreover, he suggests, human cultural traditions, {{at least in the}} West, have reinforced such behaviour, continually insisting that the impulses he describes are both necessary and right. While Meeker's work goes on to assess a number of literary works in both the tragic and <b>comic</b> <b>modes,</b> his work never fully explores this hypothesis in the context of human pioneers; that is, there is no ~xploration o(how these themes manifest themselves within our culture and what role they might play in the culture of specific pioneering groups.

It explores Meeker's work within three main areas: first, Chapter Two situates his book historically within the field of ecocriticism, showing what came before and the explosion of ecocritical inquiry that followed its release. This chapter also delves into the rift between the natural sciences and humanities, arguing that a move towards deeper interdisciplinarity is r:tecessary for the future. Chapter Three examines the biological and ecological ground on which Meeker rests his hypothesis through exploring evolutionary biology as well as invasive and pioneer species behaviour. Lastly, Chapter Four examines how these ecological principles are manifested in the writings of early Canadian settlers, suggesting that Meeker's hypothesis indeed finds itself on stable footing...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 95 - 103). In {{an increasingly}} globalized society, diverse religious groups interact as never before. This interaction has proven disastrous among {{groups who are}} polarized in their absolutist ideologies and produce isolated extremist sects fuelled by nationalism and ethnic alliances. Humor has been proven {{to be an effective}} tool in mediation and conflict resolution, but difficulties arise in utilizing humor to mediate among Jewish, Christian, and Islamic fundamentalist groups who, along with mainstream religion, have eliminated humor from their doctrines and denigrated its spiritual value. Modern monotheistic religion is largely divorced from the idea that laughter is as valid an expression of the sacred as solemnity. Yet, humor is as intrinsic to the religious experience as it is to the human experience. This study draws from a broad base of scientific and literary humor theory, anthropology, history, religious studies, psychology, and sociology, that is presented in a three-prong approach to uncover the humor in the Judeo-Christian Bible and the Islamic Quran and Hadith, along with comedic religious practices. The works of theologians Conrad Hyers and John Morreall delineate the tragic vision and comic vision as worldviews, which inform modern religious ideologies and societal values, have been greatly utilized. Aristotle's Poetics is foundational to Hyers' and Morreall's studies, as it is herein, with particular attention to Aristotle's bifurcation of tragedy and comedy, the tragic hero and comic characters, and a discussion of katharsis. A further consideration of katharsis is offered with regard to modern psychological catharsis and post-Christian implications regarding conversion. Also foundational to this study are the psycho-sociological studies of Vassilis Saroglou on the effects of religiousness on humor. Religious and anthropological studies examine the religio-aesthetic impulse and the evolution of religion from pre-historic shamanism to the emergence of monotheism, including the development the High God/Sky God and the Trickster. These archetypal deities are further analyzed with regard to the tragic and <b>comic</b> <b>modes</b> and dualism. The culmination of this research provides a framework to recognize and deconstruct the instances of humor, comedy and tricksterism within the Judeo-Christian Bible, as well as the Islamic Quran and Hadith. The conclusion posits that humor is both intratextual and intertextual and can, therefore, provide an effective means to bridge communication and understanding between diverse religious groups including fundamentalists. The increasing number of comedy acts focused on dispelling religious stereotypes and creating interfaith alliances provides hope that this process has begun to occur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{begins by}} {{exploring}} the Fall of Adam and Eve, from Milton’s portrayal in Paradise Lost, {{in order to}} judge when comedy become a possibility for the human race. The three major theories of comedy are then traced: superiority theory, incongruity theory, and relief theory. It also discusses some complexities within comedy theory such as black comedy, as well as giving examples of some modern theories of comedy and which show comedy to be fundamental to human life and how it may serve a role in sustaining life. Slavoj Žižek’s belief that comedy is the best means of representing atrocities is described and used to support the appropriateness of comedy in discussing the Fall. Milton’s own awareness of comic conventions is then explored to see to what degree he intentionally included comedy in Paradise Lost. Biographical references, as well as stylistic choices by Milton, are used as evidence {{for the existence of}} his use of comedy. It will show that Milton’s characterisation, as well as narrative choices, suggest that he has adopted an intentional <b>comic</b> <b>mode,</b> which extends beyond his accepted use of satire, the mock-heroic, or the grotesque, which are ideas already widely represented in criticism. The challenges of identifying the true hero of Paradise Lost are explored with reference to Northrop Frye’s theory of heroes and genre. Finally through the comparison of Milton with Beckett generally, and specifically through comparing Paradise Lost to All That Fall, many similarities between the philosophy of Beckett and Milton are exposed. A detailed exploration is made between the similar topics in both texts such as isolation, companionship, sex, temptation, death, hopelessness, fallenness, original sin, reproduction, knowledge, and cowardice. In conclusion, Miltonic comedy is shown to be dark and further areas of research are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims {{to explore}} philistinism as a German {{literary}} topos, {{in the nineteenth}} century. It begins with {{an examination of the}} extra-literary metaphorical usage of key words like Philister and proceeds to a summary of its impact on writers in the period. By so doing, I have tried to present an image of the developing tradition of the literary depiction of philistines. The main part of the thesis is devoted to three writers - Richendorff, Keller, Fontane - whose work presents us with contrasting responses to the problem of philistinism. Unlike previous investigations, my approach is not only through explicit linguistic and visual markers, but also implicit depictions of philistines {{in the work of the}} three writers. To achieve this, attention is focussed on tone and literary devices, <b>comic</b> <b>mode,</b> irony, metaphor. I aim thereby to show the function of philistinism in these writings, an analysis not previously attempted. Eichendorff's work is shown to be imbued with a fundamental antithesis between the lives of Dichter and Philister, so comprehensive as to include eschatological implications. In Keller we notice a questioning of such a dichotomy, an unwillingness to acquiesce in its distinctions and an emphasis on society in determining the worth of his characters. Fontane's work represents the most radical reassessment of the Romantic position and displays a clear shift from categorical thinking to a pervasive ambivalence. Whilst philistinism is an issue for all three writers, the differences in their approach and consequent portrayals are revealing: my Epilogue suggests that their different modes of presentation reflect changes of ethos from Romanticism to realism, which in turn reflect changes in social values over the course of the nineteenth century. The interest of the present thesis is its demonstration that such changes can, in German literary culture, be so precisely observed in the changing treatment of the topos of philistinism. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} of novels into plays and films. {{has become so}} commonplace a practice {{during the twentieth century}} that the critical problem involved in the Change of one literary form into another tends to be minimized. More often than not, a play is judged {{by the standards of the}} novel from which it was drawn. The fallacy in this approach becomes obvious, however, when it is considered that the two types are ultimately antagonistic: the fundamental appeal of drama to the sense of perception and of the novel to the power of conception. has brought into existence literary forms which in their totality are incompatible. Thus an aesthetically satisfying, translation from one form into the other can only result if the writer carefully modifies his materials according to the requirements of the genre in which he has chosen to work. The critical issue posed by the generic distinctions between novel and play is essentially timeless; when considered in the historical context of the period in which. it first arose to prominence, it illuminates the impact of the major eighteenth century novels upon the later English drama. In fact, the outstanding plays performed after 1760 depend less on earlier dramatic traditions than on the more vital traditions originating with the new and immensely popular prose fiction of Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne. Almost immediately after its first publication, Richardson's Pamela was adapted for the stage, and within twenty-five years, his novels had supplanted the earlier drama as the primary source. for the most popular plays. In addition to plots, characters, and themes, Richardson's development in Pamela) Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison of the bourgeois Court of Love, with its elaborate rituals of courtship and marriage, provided the dramatists with precisely the vehicle they needed for expression of the increasingly popular doctrines of benevolence. The plays of William Whitehead, Frances Sheridan, Elizabeth Griffith, and Hugh Kelly, often called "sentimental" drama are more properly defined as Richardsonian ritual comedy, and during the 1760 's this <b>comic</b> <b>mode</b> predominated on the English stage. But very soon it was challenged for supremacy by another mode deriving from the comic novels of Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne. A comic novel tradition in drama emerged primarily from the plays of Arthur Murphy, George Colman, and Samuel Foote to receive its consummate expression in the comedies of Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. In defining the function of literature, Goldsmith turned to Fieldlng. for the ethical structure that informs his comedy. and satire, while Sheridan went first to. Smollett for the inspiration of The Rivals, and then for the greatest play of the peribd, The Sdhobl for Scandal (1777), he transformed Tom Jones into the most perfect dramatic version of any eighteenth century novel. Goldsmith and Sheridan together brought the comic novel tradition in drama to the fore, and the ensuing conflict between 'laughing' and 'weeping' comedy is rightly seen as a new statement of the antagonism existing between Pamela and Fielding's Shamela and Joseph Andrews, or between Clarissn and Tom Jones. After The School for Scandal, the comic hovel tradition retained its position of dominance on the stage in the plays of Richard Cumberland, Hannah Cowley, Thomas Holcroft, and Frederick Reynolds, among others, but in. the fourth quarter of the century it was considerably modified by infusions of pathos largely inspired by Sterne, and by the increasingly popular <b>comic</b> <b>mode</b> known as amiable humor. During' the last decade of the century, audience demand for spectacle, melodrama, and the thrills of Gothicism caused the dramatic traditions of Richardson and the comic novelists to dissipate. Nevertheless, the dependence of the drama upon other literary types continued, becoming even more widespread during the nineteenth century, and not until the artistic integrity of the form was asserted in the plays of Pinero and Shaw did, the drama emerge from its long period of obeisance to prose fiction. ...|$|E
50|$|Toland {{was famous}} for {{distinguishing}} exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke's Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox presented an analysis of Toland's 'exoteric strategy' of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland's philosophy and theology {{had little to do}} with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland's practices to Shaftesbury's conception of a <b>comic</b> or 'derisory' <b>mode</b> of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.|$|R
50|$|A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle {{is a long}} poem by Hugh MacDiarmid {{written in}} Scots and {{published}} in 1926. It is composed {{as a form of}} monologue with influences from stream of consciousness genres of writing. A poem of extremes, it ranges between <b>comic</b> and serious <b>modes</b> and examines a wide range of cultural, sexual, political, scientific, existential, metaphysical and cosmic themes, ultimately unified through one consistent central thread, the poet's affectively charged contemplation, looking askance at the condition of Scotland. It also includes extended and complex responses to figures from European and Russian literature, in particular Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, as well as referencing topical events and personalities of the mid-1920s such as Isadora Duncan or the UK General Strike of 1926. It {{is one of the major}} modernist literary works of the 20th century.|$|R
