The 'assembly line diagnostic link' (ALDL) protocol broadcasts at 160 bit/s Implemented on California vehicles for the 1980 model year, {{and the rest of}} the United States in 1981. Most owners can read DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Code(s)) by commanding the ECM (Engine Control Module) to flash the CEL (<b>Check</b> <b>Engine</b> Lamp) or MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on and off. [...] A PC based Software package called WinALDL will listen to the CLCC (Closed Loop Carburetor Control) and early CLC EFI datastreams over a fairly easy to construct interface cable that converts the 160 baud TTL serial data being transmitted by the ECM to RS232 or USB serial data [...] but there is not much information transmitted by these early ECMs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{a decade}} of {{intensive}} research on general techniques for reducing the complexity of model checking, scalability remains the chief obstacle to its widespread adoption. Past experience has shown that domain-specific information can often be leveraged to obtain state-space reductions that go beyond general purpose reductions by customizing existing model checker implementations or by building new model-checking engines dedicated to a particular domain. Unfortunately, these strategies limit the dissemination of model checking across a number of domains since it is often infeasible for domain experts {{to build their own}} dedicated model checkers or to modify existing model <b>checking</b> <b>engines.</b> To enable researchers to more easily tailor a model <b>checking</b> <b>engine</b> to a particular software-related domain, we have constructed an extensible and highly explicit-state software model checking framework called Bogor. In this paper, we describe our experience in customizing Bogor to check design models of avionics systems built using real-time CORBA component-based middleware. This includes modeling the semantics of a real-time CORBA event channel as a Bogor abstract data type, implementing a customized distributed state-space exploration algorithm that leverages the quasi-cyclic nature of periodic real-time computation, and encapsulating the Bogor <b>checking</b> <b>engine</b> in a robust full-featured development environment called Cadena that we have built for designing, analyzing, synthesizing, and implementing systems using the CORBA Component Model. ...|$|R

To overcome limitations of existing tools which tend to be monolithic and non-extensible, we have developed an extensible and customizable model checking framework called Bogor. In this tool paper, we summarize (a) Bogor’s direct support for modeling object-oriented designs and implementations, (b) its facilities for extending and customizing its modeling language and algorithms to create domain-specific model <b>checking</b> <b>engines,</b> and (c) pedagogical materials that we have developed to describe the construction of model checking tools built on top of the Bogor infrastructure...|$|R
