In the mid-1990s there were scattered reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks among US children. While HA-MRSA rates stabilized between 1998 and 2008, CA-MRSA rates continued to rise. A report released by the University of Chicago Children's Hospital comparing two time periods (1993-1995 and 1995-1997) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to MRSA among children in the United States.

Nosocomial transmission capacities (RA) of these different MRSA types have never been quantified. Using two large datasets from MRSA outbreaks in Dutch hospitals (dataset 1, the UMC Utrecht for 144 months; dataset 2, 51 hospitals for six months) and a recently developed mathematical model, we determined the genotype-specific RA for ST 398 and non-ST 398 isolates (categorized as HA-MRSA), using observational data, the detection rate of MRSA carriage and the discharge rate from hospital as the input. After detection of 42 MRSA index cases in dataset 1 (all non-ST 398 MRSA) 5076 people were screened, yielding 30 secondary cases. In dataset 2, 75 index cases (51 non-ST 398 MRSA and 24 ST 398) resulted in 7892 screened individuals and 56 and three secondary cases for non-ST 398 MRSA and ST 398, respectively.
