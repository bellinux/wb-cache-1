5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate).

5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> it by applying a scaling factor to {{the components of the}} prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
5|$|According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, {{the term}} yoga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In {{the context of}} the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is {{considered}} by traditional commentators as the correct etymology. In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).|$|E

To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|The {{first public}} {{controversy}} regarding Zwingli's preaching broke {{out during the}} season of Lent in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the Wurstessen in Christoph Froschauer's workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came {{to be referred to}} as the Affair of the Sausages, is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland. Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Zurich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossmünster and city council and repeating the traditional position.|$|E
