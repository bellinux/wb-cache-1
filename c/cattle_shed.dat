25|$|The rear {{battalion}} was the 4th Sikh Infantry, {{which reached}} Candeapar {{in the early}} hours of 19 December, and not to be bogged down by the absence of the Borim bridge (already blown up), went across the Zuari river in their military tankers and then waded across a small creek, in chest high water, to reach a small dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in Raia, presently under survey No.44/5 of Raia Village, from where there exists a connecting road to Margão (Old Portuguese Planta 4489 & 4493). At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took some rest in a <b>cattle</b> <b>shed</b> on the small dock, and sprawled on the ground and in the balcony of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E
2500|$|The Ekwendeni Hospital sees 21,000 out-patients annually, {{of which}} one-third are admitted. [...] It offers 183 beds and medical relief for {{an area of}} 45,000 with a larger {{referral}} area of 120,000 people. [...] The types of specialties that the hospital provides are nutrition, ophthalmology, dental surgery, and laboratory work. [...] The most commonly seen diseases are HIV, TB, and malaria. [...] To accommodate the TB cases, there is a 24-bed TB ward that serves these patients exclusively. In their lab, doctors and staff research and conduct 27,000 tests each year. The EMMS has focused on purchasing necessary equipment, constructing new space, and providing funds for the hospital staff and training. [...] The equipment that the EMMS has purchased includes a baby resuscitation equipment, a defibrillator, ECG machine, an anaesthetic machine, and an oxygen concentrator. [...] There are three nurseries that have the capability of serving premature babies. [...] It has {{also contributed to the}} construction of a <b>cattle</b> <b>shed</b> to provide food and income for the hospital’s Orphan care Programme.
