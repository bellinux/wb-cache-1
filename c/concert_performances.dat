5|$|The 1975 {{tour with}} the Revue {{provided}} the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.

5|$|Dickinson {{remained}} in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—Head On and Shock Tactics. However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who {{went out of business}} and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden. The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their <b>concert</b> <b>performances.</b> The band's last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.|$|E

5000|$|In June 1929, The Nose {{was given}} a <b>concert</b> <b>performance,</b> against Shostakovich's own wishes: [...] "The Nose loses all meaning if it is seen just as a musical composition. For the music springs only from the action...It is {{clear to me that}} a <b>concert</b> <b>performance</b> of The Nose will destroy it." [...] Indeed, the <b>concert</b> <b>performance</b> caused bewilderment, and was ferociously {{attacked}} by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM).|$|R

5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent <b>concert</b> <b>performances.</b> After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
5|$|In May 1998, Minogue {{confirmed}} the Intimate and Live concert tour, which commenced on 2 June at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia that same year. She initially wanted {{to finish the}} tour in Melbourne on 4 July, but due to high demand in England, the singer hosted three additional <b>concert</b> <b>performances.</b> The tour attracted positive reviews from spectators and publications, praising {{the idea of a}} smaller venue show, alongside compliments towards her vocal performance and stage presence. Each concert had drawn in approximately 2,000 audience members in Australia, and was deemed a commercial success by the Australian media. To complete the tour's promotion, an accompanying live album and DVD were released on 30 November and 23 July 2003, and was shot at Capitol Theatre, Sydney.|$|E

5|$|To {{promote the}} single, four {{different}} music videos were shot. The first of these—which had Caleb Deschanel as cameraman—features {{the group at}} a fire station, sliding down its pole, and roaming the streets of Los Angeles in a fashion comparable to The Monkees. The second features the group during vocal rehearsals at United Western Recorders. The third contains footage recorded during the making of The Beach Boys in London, a documentary by Peter Whitehead of their <b>concert</b> <b>performances.</b> The fourth clip is an alternative edit of the third. Brian also made a rare television appearance on local station KHJ-TV for its Teen Rock and Roll Dance Program, introducing the song to the show's in-studio audience and presenting an exclusive preview of the completed record.|$|E
5|$|Pre-{{production}} for U2 3D officially {{started in}} early 2004, {{and the production}} was handled by 3ality Digital, a company formed from Schklair's Colbalt Entertainment and his partnership with the Modells and the Shapiros. Midway through the year, Bono agreed to let the 3ality Digital crew record test footage, which was accomplished using a single 3D camera at one of U2's Vertigo Tour concerts in Anaheim, California in March 2005. U2 were dissatisfied with their 1988 rockumentary feature film, Rattle and Hum, which mixed backstage footage and interviews with <b>concert</b> <b>performances.</b> The filmmakers decided that U2 3D would only have concert footage. The producers originally wanted to shoot in Los Angeles where all the filming equipment was located, but Owens and the band decided they needed a more enthusiastic audience. U2 ultimately chose to film in five cities in Latin America from February to March 2006, believing their absence from the region for eight years would foster an energetic atmosphere. The {{only one of the}} eight Latin American shows that was not shot was the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The project enabled U2 to share the outdoor stadium concerts with audiences in the US, where the band only performed at indoor arenas on the Vertigo Tour.|$|E
