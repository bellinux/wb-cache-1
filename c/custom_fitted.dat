25|$|The {{magnetic}} mini-mover procedure (3MP) is {{a technique}} used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum {{with the rest of}} the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a <b>custom</b> <b>fitted</b> brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique's main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively.|$|E
25|$|The race to win {{the prize}} {{required}} time-saving design compromises, Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design. This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him awake at various times during the flight. The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although <b>custom</b> <b>fitted</b> to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.|$|E
