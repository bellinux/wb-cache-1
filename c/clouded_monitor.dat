50|$|Hindhede Nature Park is a park located next to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, in Singapore. A short trail {{leads into}} the park {{starting}} from the visitor centre and looping to the Hindhede Quarry 90 metres away. Animals {{that can be found}} in the park include the Banded Woodpecker, <b>Clouded</b> <b>Monitor</b> Lizard, Greater Racket-tailed Drongo and Plaintain Squirrel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>clouded</b> <b>monitor</b> (Varanus nebulosus) is {{a species}} of monitor lizard, native to Burma, Thailand and Indochina to West Malaysia, Singapore, Java, and Sumatra. They are {{excellent}} tree climbers. It belongs to the subgenus Empagusia along with the Bengal monitor, the Dumeril's monitor and other monitor lizards. It had previously been listed as a subspecies of Varanus bengalensis by some herpetologists. It is a diurnal monitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clouded</b> <b>monitors</b> can, on occasion, {{grow up to}} 1.5 metres long.|$|R
50|$|Bengal {{monitors}} {{are usually}} solitary and usually {{found on the}} ground, although the young are often seen on trees. V. b. nebulosus has a greater propensity for tree climbing. The two sympatric species Bengal and Yellow Monitor partially separated their habitat as Bengal Monitor prefers Forest over agricultural areas. Bengal monitors shelter in burrows they dig or crevices in rocks and buildings, whilst <b>clouded</b> <b>monitors</b> prefer tree hollows. Both races will make use of abandoned termite mounds. Bengal monitors, like other varanids, show true sleep at night and are diurnal, becoming active around 6 AM and bask in the morning sun. During winter, in the colder parts of their distribution range, they may take shelter and go {{through a period of}} reduced metabolic activity. They are not territorial, and may change their range seasonally in response to food availability.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{seasonal}} folivore and frugivore, the proboscis monkey eats primarily fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects {{to a lesser}} extent. At least 55 different plant species are consumed, [...] "with a marked preference for Eugenia sp., Ganua motleyana and Lophopetalum javanicum". Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being {{a seasonal}} eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Proboscis monkeys' daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant. [...] Occasionally, they chew their cud to allow more efficient digestion and food intake. [...] As night approaches, the monkeys move back near the river and forage again. Predators of the proboscis monkey include crocodiles, <b>clouded</b> leopards, eagles, <b>monitor</b> lizards and pythons. Monkeys will cross rivers at narrows or cross arboreally if possible. This may serve as predator avoidance.|$|R
50|$|The species {{ranges from}} Iran to Java, {{among the most}} widely {{distributed}} of varanid lizards. It is found in river valleys in eastern Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Burma. The subspecies Varanus bengalensis nebulosus, the <b>clouded</b> <b>monitor,</b> occurs in southern Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and the Sunda Islands. They have not been confirmed on Sumatra, and {{have been found to}} be absent from the Andaman Islands.|$|E
