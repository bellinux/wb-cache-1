40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the different combustion regimes in a classical turbulent <b>combustion</b> <b>diagram</b> (Reynolds vs Damköhler), in order to qualify the turbulent flames that are obtained at the bluff-body experimental apparatus of the Combustion and Turbulence Laboratory at PUC–Rio. Additionally, the purpose is to estimate the influence of different fuel types (e. g. natural gas and hydrogen) on the combustion regimes. The velocity of the fuel (oxidizer) stream was varied between 0. 4 and 50. 0 m/s (1. 2 and 11. 7 m/s) in order to get representative experimental results for each flame regime within the diagram. Instantaneous and time-averaged flames thickness were obtained from the images captured via Planar Laser induced Fluorescence of the Hydroxyl Radical (PLIF-OH). Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models were employed to determine the turbulence characteristics of the flow field, in terms of the dimensionless Reynolds and Damköhler numbers. The determination of the Damköhler number also required the construction of specific flamelets libraries. The experiment allowed to investigate several combustion regimes, including the laminar flame regime, the flamelet regime and the unsteady effects regime, each of which was obtained for a large range of Reynolds and Damköhler numbers. The comparison of the combustion regimes actually obtained experimentally with those estimated by using the classical regime diagram evidences the shortcomings of such a simplified approach...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{procedures}} {{to describe the}} dispersion, evaporation and combustion of a polydisperse liquid fuel in a turbulent oxidizer are presented. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) allows one to describe accurately {{the evolution of the}} fully compressible gas-phase coupled with a Lagrangian description in order to describe two-phase flows. Standard coupling is used for the Eulerian/Lagrangian system while some practical issues related to the reactive source terms are addressed by suggesting a fast single-step Arrhenius law allowing one to capture the main fundamental properties of the flame whatever the local equivalence ratio. Then some basic {{procedures to}} describe spray preferential segregation in a turbulent reactor are described. Eventually spray combustion is addressed by first demonstrating the complex interactions caused by the presence of an evaporating liquid phase: definition of various equivalence ratios, apparition of flame instabilities for a unit Lewis number, etc. Then a history of the development of the existing spray <b>combustion</b> <b>diagrams</b> is presented to display the possible flame structures and combustion regimes encountered in spray combustion...|$|R
40|$|Research into novel {{internal}} combustion engines requires {{consideration of the}} diversity in future fuels that may contain significant quantities of bio-components {{in an attempt to}} reduce CO 2 emissions from vehicles and contribute to energy sustainability. However, most biofuels have different chemical and physical properties to those of typical hydrocarbons; these can lead to different mechanisms of mixture preparation and combustion. The current paper presents results from an optical study of combustion in a direct-injection spark-ignition research engine with gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol fuels injected from a centrally located multi-hole injector. Methane was also employed by injecting it into the inlet plenum of the engine to provide a benchmark case for well-mixed ‘homogeneous’ charge preparation. Crank-angle resolved flame chemiluminescence images were acquired and post-processed for a series of consecutive cycles for each fuel, in order to calculate in-cylinder rates of flame growth and motion. In-cylinder pressure traces were used for heat release analysis and for comparison with the image-processing results. All tests were performed at 1500 RPM with 0. 5 bar intake plenum pressure. Stoichiometric (ϕ = 1. 0) and lean (ϕ = 0. 83) conditions were considered. The combustion characteristics were analysed with respect to laminar and turbulent burning velocities obtained from combustion bombs in the literature and from traditional <b>combustion</b> <b>diagrams</b> in order to bring all data into the context of current theories and allow insights by making comparisons were appropriate...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{dedicated}} to Norbert Peters, follows his lead in developing theoretical {{understanding of the}} complex flow-turbulence interactions occurring in the propagation of premixed flames. The work {{is based on the}} asymptotic hydrodynamic model of premixed flames, where the flame is modeled by a surface that separates unburned and burned gases and propagates relative to the incoming flow at a speed that depends locally on the flame stretch rate. As such the work may be categorized as corresponding to the “flamelet regime”, based on the turbulent <b>combustion</b> regimes <b>diagram.</b> The results at the present are limited to mixtures corresponding to positive Markstein lengths, and to “two-dimensional turbulent flows”. In this parametric study, the different factors affecting the turbulent flame speed have been examined and scaling laws for the turbulent flame speed are proposed for low-to-moderate turbulence intensities that highlight the dependence on physically measurable quantities. Comparison to various empirical correlations suggested in the literature is presented. The results, devoid of turbulence-modeling assumptions and/or ad-hoc coefficients, can help explaining the influence of varying the system parameters individually and collectively, and formulating physically-based small-scale models for large-scale numerical simulations of turbulent flames...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{congested}} gas explosions {{studies have}} focused on quantifying global flame acceleration and maximum overpressure through obstacle groupings rather than detailed analysis of the flame propagation through the individual elements of the congested region. Fundamental data of the turbulent flow and combustion parameters would aid better understanding of gas explosion phenomena and mechanisms in the presence of obstacles in addition to the traditional flame speeds and overpressures that are usually reported. In this work we report near stoichiometric methane/air explosion tests in an elongated vented cylindrical vessel 162 mm internal diameter with an overall length-to-diameter, L/D of 27. 7. Single and double obstacles (both hole and flat-bar types) of 20 - 40 % blockage ratios, BR with variable obstacle scale were used. The spacing between the obstacles was systematically varied from 0. 5 m to 2. 75 m. Turbulence parameters were estimated from pressure differential measurements and geometrical obstacle dimensions. This enabled the calculation of the explosions induced gas velocities, rms turbulent velocity, turbulent Reynolds number and Karlovitz number. This allowed the current data to be plotted on a premixed turbulent <b>combustion</b> regimes <b>diagram.</b> The bulk of the data fell in the thickened-wrinkled flames regime. The influence of the calculated Karlovitz number on the measured overpressures was analysed and was related to obstacle separation distance and obstacle scale characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Flame instabilities play a {{dominant}} role in accelerating the burning front {{to a large}} fraction {{of the speed of}} sound in a Type Ia supernova. We present a three-dimensional numerical simulation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable carbon flame, following its evolution through the transition to turbulence. A low Mach number hydrodynamics method is used, freeing us from the harsh time step restrictions imposed by sound waves. We fully resolve the thermal structure of the flame and its reaction zone, eliminating the need for a flame model. A single density is considered, 1. 5 x 107 gm/cc, and half carbon/half oxygen fuel [...] conditions under which the flame propagated in the flamelet regime in our related two-dimensional study. We compare to a corresponding two-dimensional simulation, and show that while fire-polishing keeps the small features suppressed in two dimensions, turbulence wrinkles the flame on far smaller scales in the three-dimensional case, suggesting that the transition to the distributed burning regime occurs at higher densities in three dimensions. Detailed turbulence diagnostics are provided. We show that the turbulence follows a Kolmogorov spectrum and is highly anisotropic on the large scales, with a much larger integral scale in the direction of gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it becomes more isotropic as it cascades down to small scales. Based on the turbulent statistics and the flame properties of our simulation, we compute the Gibson scale. We show the progress of the turbulent flame through a classic <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagram,</b> indicating that the flame just enters the distributed burning regime near the end of our simulation...|$|R
40|$|Miniature glow {{ignition}} {{internal combustion}} (IC) piston engines are an off-the-shelf technology that could dramatically increase the endurance of miniature electric power supplies {{and the range}} and endurance of small unmanned air vehicles provided their overall thermodynamic efficiencies can be increased to 15 % or better. This thesis presents the first comprehensive analysis of small (reliable measurements of engine performance and losses in these small engines. Methodologies are also developed for measuring volumetric, heat transfer, exhaust, mechanical, and combustion losses. These instruments and techniques are used to investigate the performance of seven single-cylinder, two-stroke, glow fueled engines {{ranging in size from}} 15 to 450 g (0. 16 to 7. 5 cm 3 displacement). Scaling rules for power output, overall efficiency, and normalized power are developed from the data. These will be useful to developers of micro-air vehicles and miniature power systems. The data show that the minimum length scale of a thermodynamically viable piston engine based on present technology is approximately 3 mm. Incomplete combustion is the most important challenge as it accounts for 60 - 70 % of total energy losses. Combustion losses are followed in order of importance by heat transfer, sensible enthalpy, and friction. A net heat release analysis based on in-cylinder pressure measurements suggest that a two-stage combustion process occurs at low engine speeds and equivalence ratios close to 1. Different theories based on burning mode and reaction kinetics are proposed to explain the observed results. High speed imaging of the combustion chamber suggests that a turbulent premixed flame with its origin {{in the vicinity of the}} glow plug is the primary driver of combustion. Placing miniature IC engines on a turbulent <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagram</b> shows that they operate in the 'flamelet in eddy' regime whereas conventional-scale engines operate mostly in the 'wrinkled laminar flame sheet' regime. Taken together, the results show that the combustion process is the key obstacle to realizing the potential of small IC engines. Overcoming this obstacle will require new diagnostic techniques, measurements, combustion models, and high temperature materials...|$|R
40|$|An {{a priori}} {{model for the}} {{effective}} species Lewis numbers in premixed turbulent flames is presented. This a priori analysis is performed using data {{from a series of}} direct numerical simulations (DNS) of lean (ϕ= 0. 4) premixed turbulent hydrogen flames, with Karlovitz number ranging from 10 to 1562 (Aspden et al., 2011). The conditional mean profiles of various species mass fraction versus temperature are evaluated from the DNS and compared to unstretched laminar premixed flame profiles. The turbulent flame structure is found to be different from the laminar flame structure. However, the turbulent flame can still be mapped onto a laminar flame with an appropriate change in the Lewis numbers of the different species. A transition from “laminar” Lewis numbers to unity Lewis numbers as the Karlovitz number increases is clearly captured. A model for those effective Lewis numbers with respect to the turbulent Reynolds number is developed. This model is derived from a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) formulation of the reactive scalar and temperature balance equations. The dependency of the effective Lewis numbers on the Karlovitz number instead of the Reynolds number is discussed in this paper. Unfortunately, given that the ratio of the integral length to the laminar flame thickness is fixed throughout this series of DNS, a change in the Karlovitz number is equivalent to a change in the Reynolds number. Incorporating these effective Lewis numbers in simulations of turbulent flames would have several impacts. First, the associated laminar flame speed and laminar flame thickness vary by a factor of two through the range of obtained effective Lewis numbers. Second, the turbulent premixed <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagram</b> changes because a unique pair of laminar flame speed and laminar flame thickness cannot be used, and a dependency on the effective Lewis numbers has to be introduced. Finally, a turbulent flame speed model that takes into account these effective Lewis numbers is proposed...|$|R
40|$|A laminar {{toroidal}} vortex is {{interacted with}} a laminar premixed flame {{in order to}} isolate and to visualize some of the fundamental physics of turbulent combustion. Localized quenching of the flame was observed using planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of superequilibrium OH molecules in the counterflow flamefront region near the vortex leading edge. A quenching limit curve was measured {{as a function of}} vortex size and strength. In {{the second part of the}} study, the measurements are combined with concepts proposed by Poinsot, Veynante, and Candel in order to infer the thin flame limit, namely, the onset of distributed reactions, on a classical premixed turbulent <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagram.</b> The measured thin flame limit indicates when laminar flamelet theories become invalid, since quenching allows hot products and reactants to coexist. Results are compared with the Klimov-Williams criterion. Vortex core diameters were as small as the flame thickness in some cases. The main conclusion is that small vortices are less effective at quenching a flame than was previously believed; therefore the inferred regime within which thin flame theories are valid extends to a turbulence intensity that is more than an order of magnitude larger than that which was previously predicted. Results also indicate that micromixing models, which assume that the smallest eddies exert the largest strain on a flame, are not realistic. Measured trends are in agreement with direct numerical simulations of Poinsot et al., but absolute values differ. The measured vortex Karlovitz number that is required to quench a flame is not constant but decreases by a factor of four as vortex size increases from one to five flame thicknesses. Thin-film pyrometry was used to quantify the radiative heat losses; quenching occurs when the products cool to approximately 1300 K, which is in agreement with stretched laminar flame calculations that include detailed chemistry. The quenching Karlovitz number for propane-air flames differs from that of methane-air flames, indicating the importance of detailed chemistry and transport properties. Flame curvature was observed to cause enhancement (or reduction) of the local reaction rate, depending on the Lewis number, in a manner that is consistent with stretched flame theory...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The GDI engine {{has a number of}} practical advantages over the more traditional port-fuel injection strategy, however a number of challenges remain the subject of continued research in an attempt to fully exploit the advantages of the GDI engine. These include complex in-cylinder flow fields and fuel-air mixing strategies, and significant temporal variation, both through an engine cycle and on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Despite advances in experimental techniques, the relative difficulty and cost of taking detailed measurements remains high, thus computational techniques {{are an integral part of}} research activities. The research work presented in this thesis has focused on the use of detailed 3 D-CFD techniques for investigating physical phenomena of the in-cylinder flow field and fuel injection process in a single cylinder GDI engine with early injection event. A detailed validation of the numerical predictions of the in-cylinder flow field using both the RANS RNG k-ε turbulence model and the Smagorinsky LES SGS turbulence model was completed with both models showing good agreement against available experimental results. A detailed validation of the numerical predictions of the fuel injection process using a Lagrangian DDM and both RANS RNG k-ε turbulence model and Smagorinsky LES SGS turbulence model was completed with both models showing excellent agreement against experimental data. The model was then used to investigate the in-cylinder flow field and fuel injection process including research into: the three dimensional nature of the flow field; intake valve jet flapping, characterisation, causality and CCV, and whether it could account for CCV of the mixture field at spark timing; the anisotropic characteristics of the flow field using both the fluctuating velocity and turbulence intensity, including the increase in anisotropy due to the fuel injection event; the use of POD for quantitatively analysing the in-cylinder flow field; investigations into the intake valve, cylinder liner and piston crown spray plume impingement processes, including the use of a multi-component fuel surrogate and CCV of the formed liquid film; characterisation and CCV of the mixture field though the intake and compression strokes up to spark timing. Finally, the predicted turbulence characteristics were used to evaluate the resultant premixed turbulent combustion event using <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Stringent {{emission}} regulations require {{gas engine}} manufacturers {{to move towards}} ultra-lean operation to reduce the peak combustion temperature and thereby minimizing NOx formation. For heavy-duty gas engines, pre-chamber hot jet ignition is a common practice, which has advantages over traditional spark ignition. An experiment was developed to understand the ignition mechanisms of premixed CH 4 /air and H 2 /air mixtures by a turbulent hot jet generated by pre-chamber combustion. Simultaneous high-speed Schlieren, OH* chemiluminescence, particle image velocimetry, and infrared diagnostics were applied to visualize the jet penetration and ignition processes inside the main combustion chamber. Results illustrate the existence of two ignition mechanisms: jet ignition and flame ignition. The former produces a jet comprising of only hot combustion products from pre-chamber combustion. The latter produces a jet full of wrinkled turbulent flames and active radicals. A parametric study was performed to understand the effects of pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio along with geometric factors such as orifice diameter and pre-chamber spark position on the ignition mechanisms and probability. A global Damköhler number was defined to remove the parametric dependency. The limiting Damköhler number, separating these two ignition mechanisms, was presented on a turbulent <b>combustion</b> regime <b>diagram.</b> ^ Ignition of ultra-lean H 2 /air mixtures using supersonic hot jets was also explored. Results showed that a supersonic jet could ignite leaner mixtures than a subsonic jet, e. g., the lean flammability limit of H 2 /air extended to 2 ̆ 6 phis; = 0. 22 from 2 ̆ 6 phis; = 0. 31. High-speed OH* and infrared imaging of supersonic jets indicated a high-temperature zone downstream of the shock structures. Detailed numerical simulations were carried out to understand the fundamental mechanism why supersonic jets could extend the lean flammability limit. ^ To quantify the flow field of a turbulent hot jet, a novel, inexpensive, two-camera Schlieren technique was developed. A detailed statistical assessment of seedless velocity measurement using Schlieren Image Velocimetry (SIV) was explored using open source Robust Phase Correlation (RPC) algorithm. An axisymmetric high-speed (jet exit velocities 304 m/s (Mach = 0. 3) and 611 m/s (Mach = 0. 6)) turbulent helium jet was analyzed in the near and intermediate region (0 ≤ x/d ≤ 20) for two different Reynolds numbers, Re d= 11, 000 and Red= 22, 000 using four techniques. They were Schlieren with a horizontal knife-edge, Schlieren with a vertical knife-edge, shadowgraph technique, and the traditional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The measured velocities using the four techniques were compared. The velocity field obtained using horizontal knife-edge Schlieren with 40...|$|R
