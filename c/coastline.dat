50|$|The {{municipalities}} of Frogn and Vestby have <b>coastlines</b> along the Oslofjord. Ås and Oppegård have <b>coastlines</b> along the Bunnefjord (a {{part of the}} Oslofjord that extends south-east), and Nesodden has <b>coastlines</b> along both fjords.|$|R

50|$|The Channel Islands (including Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark) and the Isle of Man are {{not part}} of the UK; they are self-governing Crown {{dependencies}} therefore their <b>coastlines</b> are not <b>coastlines</b> of the United Kingdom.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, careful {{considerations}} {{are needed for}} 2 -D EM FEM modeling on the seafloor and {{in the vicinity of}} <b>coastlines.</b> The determination of bathymetry near <b>coastlines</b> by numerical meshes is particularly critical because deflected electric currents can concentrate at the shore. We recommend avoiding rectangular grids to determine bathymetry, in which zigzag electric currents occur along bathymetry, especially in the vicinity of <b>coastlines,</b> in order to determine conductivity structures beneath coastal regions. It was found difficult, or very expensive, to achieve the same accuracy as by triangular grids by rectangular grids near <b>coastlines.</b> Without any tests of accuracy, the indiscriminate use of rectangular elements may cause critical errors in estimating theoretical EM response functions near <b>coastlines.</b> In addition, a differentiation method with a more precise extrapolation should be applied as well when seafloor EM observations are to be modeled accurately.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{geometry}} of <b>coastlines,</b> {{based on an}} empirical study by Lewis Richardson, {{is presented as a}} way of introducing the subject of fractals developed by Benoit Mandelbrot. It is shown how the statistically self-similar nature of <b>coastlines</b> can be generalized to an interesting class of point sets, curves and surfaces with the same property. Brownian and fractional Brownian motion are introduced as ways of generating statistically self-similar curves with the appearance of <b>coastlines</b> and mountain ranges...|$|R
5|$|Loop Head is the {{headland}} {{at which}} County Clare {{comes to a}} point {{on the west coast}} of Ireland, with the Atlantic on the north, and further inland on the south, the Shannon estuary. Hag's Head is another headland further up Clare's north/western <b>coastline,</b> with the Cliffs of Moher along the <b>coastline</b> north of the point.|$|E

40|$|Matching aerial {{images with}} map data is an {{important}} task in several remote sensing applications such as autonomous navigation, cartography, oceanography. The unique and distinctive shapes of <b>coastlines</b> can be effectively utilized to solve this problem. In this study a completely automatic scheme is proposed to detect <b>coastlines</b> using multiresolution texture analysis and to match the detected <b>coastlines</b> to a map database. A shape matching method using dynamic programming is used and tested on the satellite images of the western coast of Turkey. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "oystercatcher" [...] is {{something}} of a misnomer for this species, because they seldom eat oysters, which are found mainly on rocky <b>coastlines.</b> [...] Pied oystercatchers frequent sandy <b>coastlines,</b> where they feed mainly on bivalve molluscs, which are prised apart with their specially adapted bill.|$|R

5|$|September 13–September 14, 1944– The 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane {{parallels}} the <b>coastline</b> as a Category2 hurricane, {{with a minimum}} pressure of 965mbar occurring in Cape May. The hurricane causes severe flooding, a storm surge of up to 9.6feet (2.9m), and intense waves of up to 40feet (12m) in height. Along the entire <b>coastline,</b> strong winds gusting to 125mph (201km/h) destroys hundreds of homes and damages thousands, while the ferocious waves wash away fishing piers and boardwalks along the <b>coastline.</b> In all, the hurricane causes $25million (1944USD, $306million 2008USD) in damage and 9deaths in the state.|$|E
