5000|$|The Commission {{concluded}} that the Government of the Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide. Arguably, two elements of genocide might be deduced from the gross {{violations of human rights}} perpetrated by Government forces and the militias under their control. These two elements are, first, the actus reus consisting of killing, or causing serious bodily or mental harm, or deliberately inflicting conditions of life likely to bring about physical destruction; and, second, {{on the basis of a}} subjective standard, the existence of a protected group being targeted by the authors of criminal conduct. However, the crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing, at least as far as the <b>central</b> <b>Government</b> <b>authorities</b> are concerned. Generally speaking the policy of attacking, killing and forcibly displacing members of some tribes does not evince a specific intent to annihilate, in whole or in part, a group distinguished on racial, ethnic, national or religious grounds. Rather, it would seem that those who planned and organized attacks on villages pursued the intent to drive the victims from their homes, primarily for purposes of counter-insurgency warfare.|$|E

It has recommended that the entire extraction in all cases, where leases are operated without mandatory environmental clearances, be treated as illegal and the market value — domestic or export — recovered from the defaulting miners. The Commission’s earlier reports on Goa and Karnataka had brought to light rampant corruption and illegal mining and export in both States and put the Central government as well as State officials in the dock. In the Odisha report too, the Commission said action must be taken against State and Central government officers who allowed the illegal mining for years in violation of various laws. The Commission, which has been told to wind up before it reports on illegal mining in Chhattisgarh, has warned {{that there was an}} absolute lack of monitoring in Odisha and miners were fearlessly violating provisions of the law as if they did not exist. It also warned that the practice of merely asking violators to plant more trees than was normally required is not a legitimate alternative to prosecution under the penal provisions of the Forest Conservation Act which attract punishment that includes imprisonment. This practice — which has no legal backing — has rendered the Act toothless and ineffective. http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/half-of-odishas-iron-ore-mines-lack-clearance-panel/article5498482.ece The Central Government has been asked by the Supreme Court to submit the Justice Shah Commission report on illegal mining in Odisha and Jharkhand to it by January 27.|$|E
5000|$|Yawar Fiesta rectifies several basic {{customs of}} the {{traditional}} indigenous novel. At the same time, more than revealing the oppression and distress of the Indians, this novel seeks to underscore the power and dignity that the Quechua people have preserved {{in spite of the}} exploitation and contempt of white people. It {{is the story of the}} triumph of these people in their decision to preserve their cultural identity and aspects of their social organization. The victory of the Ayllus against the <b>central</b> <b>government</b> <b>authorities,</b> landowners and [...] "fortified" [...] mestizos is a very unusual episode within the indigenous standard. Moreover, Yawar Fiesta starts treating an issue that will take its full shape much later: the se√±ores that still oppress the indigenous people have been reclaimed by their culture and in this sense they feel closer to their servants than men of the coast. Don Julian is the antecedent of Don Aparicio (Diamantes y pedernales) and Don Bruno (Todas las sangres). From this it follows that Yawar Fiesta examines the possibility of understanding the Andean world, although internally conflicted, as a whole. Opposing it, with all its contradictions, is the Westernized socio-cultural system of the Peruvian coast. In this way the constructing of a sequence begins with expansions and contrasts that will only end with 'El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo' (The fox from above and the fox from below). Arguedas was well aware of the need for this process of contextualization: [...] "we can only know the Indian people" [...] he said, [...] "the people that also know, with the same profundity as the people or social groups that have determined what the Indian is at the moment." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} the interlinked usages of {{the concepts}} of ‘governance’ and ‘sustainable development’ {{over the past two}} decades of French urban policies. It shows that the importance of ‘sustainable development’ procedural principles has significantly declined in public agendas alongside the rise to prominence of climate change issues. Based on a study of the urban policies developed by central French government authorities since the 1990 s, it identifies two main phases. In the 1990 s and early 2000 s, ‘sustainable development’ and ‘governance’ slogans were extensively mobilized in urban policies for the purposes of modernizing public action. In a context of economic, social and institutional transformations, these urban policies aimed at constructing local dynamics of collective action and encouraged the emergence of projects relying on incremental and deliberative practices. As of the mid- 2000 s, this dynamic weakened and climate change replaced sustainable development as a reference in urban policies. This shift occurred in the context of a neo-managerial restructuring, with <b>central</b> <b>government</b> <b>authorities</b> regaining influence over cities and urban policies being redefined around quantitative and technical objectives...|$|E
