5000|$|Typically, {{the bolt}} {{consists}} of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or [...] "lugs", which serve to lock the bolt in place. The operation can be done via a rotating bolt, a lever, <b>cam-action,</b> locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight-pull designs have seen {{a great deal of}} use, though manual turn-bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt-designs when talking about a specific weapon's type of action. However, both straight-pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to a rotating bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or bolt guide rib into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in [...]22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is a rotating bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin-Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee-Enfield has a lug and guide rib, which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.|$|E
