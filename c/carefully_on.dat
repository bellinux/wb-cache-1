25|$|According to Allameh Muzaffar, Allah gives humans {{the faculty}} of reason and argument. Also, Allah orders humans to spend time {{thinking}} <b>carefully</b> <b>on</b> creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. Allah does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also Allah blames them for such actions.|$|E

After being briefed on a search warrant they were told would be executed outside the city, but with few details beyond that, they went to wait near Lazarus' home in Simi Valley and that city's Metrolink station, where Lazarus commuted to the city.|$|E
500|$|Barnes played <b>carefully</b> <b>on</b> {{the still}} suspect pitch the {{following}} day and {{late in the afternoon}} Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. [...] "Lots of people have asked me whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." [...] He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that [...] "it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".|$|E

2500|$|Although Marshall {{agreed that}} a formal hearing was not required, he did believe that {{fairness}} required the Board {{to notify the}} inmates sufficiently far in advance {{to allow them to}} prepare their cases and retain counsel if they so desire. [...] Marshall also believed that fundamental fairness required the Board to state the evidence on which it had relied in denying parole. [...] This requirement would focus the Board more <b>carefully</b> <b>on</b> the statutory criteria and promote a more careful consideration of the evidence, {{while at the same time}} affording the inmates to contest factual inaccuracies in the record. [...] The marginal increased burden on the Board was slight in comparison to the increased fairness these features would provide.|$|E
