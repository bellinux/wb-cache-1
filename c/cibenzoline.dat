40|$|<b>Cibenzoline,</b> a new {{antiarrhythmic}} agent, {{was tested}} in 26 {{patients who had}} symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (24 patients) or premature ventricular complexes (2 patients) unresponsive to conventional drugs. <b>Cibenzoline</b> was given orally every 8 hours to maximal doses of 65 mg in 2 patients, 81. 25 mg in 22 patients and 97. 5 mg in 2 patients. <b>Cibenzoline</b> abolished spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia in 8 of 16 patients with ventricular tachycardia during a 72 hour control electrocardiographic recording, and 7 of 22 patients had greater than 83 % decrease in premature ventricular complexes compared with control. The PR interval increased 14 % (p < 0. 001), QRS duration increased 17 % (p < 0. 001), QT interval did not change and mean ejection fraction in 10 patients did not change. Electrophysiologic studies were performed on 10 patients in the control period and during maximal <b>cibenzoline</b> dosage. <b>Cibenzoline</b> did not affect electrophysiologic properties of the atrium or atrioventricular (AV) node. It prolonged the ventricular effective (223 ± 16 to 241 ± 22 ms, p < 0. 02) and functional (247 ± 18 to 264 ± 25 ms, p < 0. 02) refractory periods. At control electrophysiologic studies, ventricular tachycardia was induced in 9 of 10 patients (mean cycle length 210 ± 31 ms). <b>Cibenzoline</b> therapy prevented ventricular tachycardia induction in two patients, {{and in the other}} seven patients the mean ventricular tachycardia cycle length increased from 210 to 260 ms. The one patient with no ventricular arrhythmia induced during the control study still had no arrhythmia induced while receiving <b>cibenzoline.</b> Among six patients receiving <b>cibenzoline</b> during follow-up, one patient died of recurrent myocardial infarction, two patients stopped taking <b>cibenzoline</b> because of recurrent veutricular tachycardia and three patients have continued taking <b>cibenzoline</b> for 10 ± 4 months with control of symptomatic arrhythmias.

In voltage-clamp experiments with isolated cardiac myocytes of guinea-pig, <b>cibenzoline</b> caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the Ca 2 + current, with an IC 50 of 14 microM. Inhibition of the Ca 2 + current by <b>cibenzoline</b> (2 microM) was dependent upon stimulation frequency, {{with a greater}} block occurring at 2 Hz (approximately 50 %) than at 0. 2 Hz (approximately 15 %).

In the present study, we investigated if this drug inhibited gastric H+,K+-ATPase activity in vitro. <b>Cibenzoline</b> inhibited H+,K+-ATPase activity of permeabilized leaky hog gastric vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 : 201 [*]μM), whereas no effect was shown on Na+,K+-ATPase activity of dog kidney (IC 50 : > 1000 [*]μM). Similarly, <b>cibenzoline</b> inhibited H+,K+-ATPase activity of HEK- 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) co-transfected with rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunit cDNAs (IC 50 : 183 [*]μM). In leaky gastric vesicles, inhibition of H+,K+-ATPase activity by <b>cibenzoline</b> was attenuated by the addition of K+ (0. 5 [*]–[*] 5 [*]mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the H+,K+-ATPase activity shows that <b>cibenzoline</b> increases Km value for K+ without affecting Vmax, indicating that this drug inhibits H+,K+-ATPase activity competitively with respect to K+.

40|$|AbstractWe {{reviewed}} {{the natural history}} of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The effect of medical treatments on natural history, left ventricular (LV) functions and LV remodeling was also evaluated. Sudden cardiac death and end-stage heart failure are the most serious complications of HCM. Age < 30 years and a family history of sudden premature death are risk factors for sudden cardiac death in HCM patients. End-stage heart failure is not a specific additional phenomenon observed in patients with HCM, but is the natural course of the disease in most of those patients. After the occurrence of heart failure, the progression to cardiac death is very rapid. Young age at diagnosis, a family history of HCM, and greater wall thickness are associated with a greater likelihood of developing end-stage heart failure. Neither beta-blockers nor calcium antagonists can prevent this transition. The class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, disopyramide and <b>cibenzoline</b> are useful for the reduction of LV pressure gradient. Unlike disopyramide, <b>cibenzoline</b> has little anticholinergic activity; therefore, this drug can be easily adapted to long-term use. In addition to the reduction in LV pressure gradient, <b>cibenzoline</b> can improve LV diastolic dysfunction, and induce regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with HCM. A decrease in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration through the activation of the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger associated with <b>cibenzoline</b> therapy is likely to be closely related with the improvement in HCM-related disorders. It is possible that <b>cibenzoline</b> can prevent the progression from typical HCM to end-stage heart failure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn 84 -year-old {{woman was}} {{urgently}} referred to our hospital owing to persistent malaise and chest pain. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed following transthoracic echocardiography, emergency coronary angiography, and left ventriculography. A left ventricular pressure tracing during cardiac catheterization revealed a 72 mmHg-intraventricular pressure gradient (LVPG). Although β-blockers are effective at reducing LVPG in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, such treatment was contraindicated {{in our patient}} owing to her history of bronchial asthma. Therefore, we administered intravenous <b>cibenzoline</b> succinate to attenuate her LVPG. The LVPG decreased to 18 mmHg within 10 min after intravenous <b>cibenzoline</b> succinate administration. During her subsequent hospitalization, the patient showed excellent functional recovery, without any complications. Left ventriculography, performed 21 days after admission, showed normal wall motion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 68 %. <Learning objective: The prognosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally good, however, fatal complications have been reported. Our case demonstrated a LVPG of 72 mmHg, and β-blockers were contraindicated because of bronchial asthma.

40|$|<b>Cibenzoline,</b> a {{new class}} I {{antiarrhythmic}} drug, was administered to 24 patients with frequent (> 30 /h) premature ventricular complexes. Three patients discontinued the medication because of epigastric distress before repeat ambulatory electrocardiography. Of the remaining 21 patients, 13 responded to 130 mg twice daily by more than 75 % suppression of premature ventricular complex frequency and 6 additional patients responded to 160 mg twice daily during an open-label titration phase. Events of ventricular tachycardia (≥ 3 beats) were totally suppressed in 9 of 10 patients and markedly diminished in the 1 remaining patient. During a doubleblind placebo-controlled crossover phase in 16 patients (21 patients minus 2 nonresponders and 3 who developed side effects), <b>cibenzoline</b> suppressed the number of premature ventricular complexes per 24 hours (4, 075 ± 868 to 1, 758 ± 1, 089, p = 0. 02), the number of events of ventricular tachycardia (31 ± 30 to 2 ± 0, p = 0. 01) {{and the number of}} premature ventricular complex pairs (61 ± 28 to 25 ± 21, p = 0. 01). <b>Cibenzoline</b> plasma concentration was 59 to 421 ng/ml in responders and higher (387, 758 and 852 ng/ml, respectively) in the three subjects with side effects (right bundle branch block in one, hypotension in one, gastrointestinal upset and central nervous system complaints in one). <b>Cibenzoline</b> plasma concentration correlated with PR interval (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 0106) and corrected QT interval (r = 0. 58, p = 0. 0054).

40|$|Methods from {{nonlinear}} dynamics {{were applied}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that the dynamics of sustained atrial fibrillation (AF) is modified by the class Ic drug <b>cibenzoline</b> during pharmacological conversion. The experiments were performed in conscious goats in which sustained AF was induced by continuous maintenance of AF via programmed electrical stimulation. Data were collected from electrophysiological experiments in five goats to terminate sustained AF by continuous infusion of <b>cibenzoline.</b> Sets of five unipolar epicardial electrograms of one minute duration were recorded from the left and right atrial free wall during sustained AF (control), and at three episodes during infusion of <b>cibenzoline,</b> when the mean AF interval had been prolonged to 25 %, 50 % and 85 % with respect to control. Ventricular far-field potentials were removed from atrial electrograms by a coherent averaging procedure. Using the Grassberger-Procaccia method, the dynamics of the local atrial electrograms was investigated by estimating the (coarse-grained) correlation dimension and correlation entropy from the correlation integral. The results were related to a recently proposed classification (types I-III) of AF based on the degree of complexity of atrial activation patterns. The coarse-grained correlation dimension D-cg and entropy K-cg indicated that sustained AF corresponded to type Il. During drug administration the coarse-grained parameters were not significantly different from control. Scaling regions in the correlation integral were observed after infusion of <b>cibenzoline</b> (3 out of 5 goats) suggesting that the drug introduced low-dimensional features (type I) in the dynamics of AF (correlation dimension D ranging from 2. 8 to 4. 4 and correlation entropy K from 1. 6 to 6. 2 nats/s). Sinus rhythm recorded shortly after cardioversion was very regular (D< 2 and K< 3 nats/s). The hypothesis that the electrograms during AF and sinus rhythm were generated by a static transformation of a linear Gaussian random process was rejected using a test for time reversibility. The nonlinear analysis revealed that <b>cibenzoline</b> does not significantly alter the dynamics of sustained AF during pharmacological conversion other than a slowing down of the atrial activation and a somewhat increasing global organization of the atrial activation pattern. The sudden change in the dynamical behavior at cardioversion suggests a mechanism that is reminiscent of a bifurcation...|$|E

For the purpose of terminating tachycardia, 10 mg of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was rapidly injected. About 20 sec later, atrioventricular block and ventricular standstill occurred. She presented loss of consciousness and convulsion, and chest compression was performed. About 30 sec later, the QRS complex reappeared, and she became alert.

40|$|<b>Cibenzoline</b> succinate (<b>Cibenzoline,</b> CZ) {{may cause}} {{hypoglycemia}} {{as a side}} effect.

He was prescribed CZ as medication to be taken as needed for palpitations related to atrial fibrillation attacks. Approximately 9 months later, he was brought to our hospital by ambulance due to chest oppression and general fatigue. He developed hypoglycemic coma on the third hospital day. The high serum concentration of immunoreactive insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity suggested enhanced insulin secretion. The toxic plasma concentration of CZ (2, 140 ng/ml) indicated that his hypoglycemic coma was induced by CZ.

The effects {{of a range of}} concentrations of three new antiarrhythmic drugs, melperone, <b>cibenzoline</b> and alinidine were compared, the lower concentrations studied corresponding to clinical levels. At low concentrations the effects of melperone, inducing bradycardia and lengthening ERP, could be attributed to prolongation of action potential duration (APD) in the sinus node and atrial and ventricular tissues. The slope of slow diastolic depolarization was not altered, nor was there any change in A-H or H-P conduction time, or in maximum rate of depolarization (MRD). At higher concentrations melperone had a substantial class 1 action, but there was no negative inotropic effect, or other evidence of restriction of slow inward current. <b>Cibenzoline</b> was primarily a class 1 agent but also lengthened APD to some extent in the SA node and in atrial and ventricular muscle, but not in Purkinje fibres. APD thus became more uniform along the ventricular conducting pathway. <b>Cibenzoline</b> also depressed contractions and increased A-H conduction time, implying restriction of slow inward current. The bradycardia could thus be attributed to a slowing of both depolarization and repolarization in the SA node, without any change in slope of the slow diastolic depolarization.

Systolic ejection murmur, Levine IV/VI, was heard {{at the left}} sternal border and atrial gallop was auscultated at apex. Echocardiogram demonstrated diffuse hypertrophy of the left ventricular walls extending to the apex. The left ventricular walls increased symmetrically; the septal and the posterior wall measured approximately 26 mm and 30 mm in thickness, respectively. Apical two-chamber views revealed a narrow outflow of the left ventricular cavity at apex with a distinct convergence zone, where color flow Doppler imaging showed turbulent jet flow from mid to late systole. The leukocyte α-galactosidase A activity was lower than normal. Percutaneous endomyocardial biopsy showed specific change for Fabry's disease by electron microscopy.

40|$|A 77 -year-old {{woman with}} hypertrophic obstructive {{cardiomyopathy}} {{was admitted to}} the hospital in March 2005 with a chief complaint of chest discomfort, and a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was seen. After starting apical dual chamber (DDD) pacing and oral <b>cibenzoline</b> 300  mg/day to relieve the stenosis, the pressure gradient and subjective symptoms disappeared. The patient was then followed as an outpatient. In January 2008, <b>cibenzoline</b> was discontinued because the patient experienced a hypoglycemic attack. Plain chest radiographs showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio from May 2009 and ventricular remodeling was suspected, although there were no changes in chest symptoms. Therefore, pacing off was considered. Acute changes in the LVOT gradient were evaluated with echocardiography before and after pacing on–off, but no changes were seen, so the course was observed in the pacing-off state. The LVOT gradient gradually increased again from 7 months after pacing off, and the pressure gradient decreased again after pacing was restarted. On the electrocardiogram, a deep negative T wave was seen in V 4 – 6 immediately after pacing off, but with time, it became positive, similar to before an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was inserted.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of drugs {{used to treat}} inducible monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been assessed by investigating their ability to suppress inducibility, but the mechanism of the drug action remains to be determined. OBJECTIVES: To determine electrophysiological variables that predict inducibility, divided doses of class I antiarrhythmic drugs were given and their effects were analysed, particularly {{the ability of the}} final dose to suppress inducibility. METHODS: The excitable gap was estimated by the zone of entrainment, which was defined as the difference between the cycle length of VT and the longest paced cycle length that interrupted VT during entrainment of VT with rapid pacing at paced cycle lengths in decrements of 10 ms. The cycle length of VT, the block cycle length, and the zone of entrainment were measured in the drug free state and after intermediate and final doses of procainamide, disopyramide, <b>cibenzoline,</b> and mexiletine. RESULTS: Sustained monomorphic VT with a mean (SD) cycle length of 285 (43) ms was induced in 8 patients. It was entrained and interrupted at the block cycle length of 231 (31) ms. The width of the zone of entrainment was 54 (23) ms. In 8 studies VT was not inducible at final doses of procainamide in 4, <b>cibenzoline</b> in 1, and mexiletine in 3. In another 10 studies (procainamide in 4, disopyramide in 1, <b>cibenzoline</b> in 2, and mexiletine in 3), VT remained inducible at the intermediate dose and at the final dose. The cycle length of VT was prolonged to a similar degree in studies of effective and ineffective drugs, but the cycle length that blocked VT was longer at the intermediate dose of the effective drugs. Consequently, the width of the zone of entrainment was significantly narrowed at the intermediate dose of effective drugs and the width of the zone of entrainment was narrower than when ineffective drugs were given (22 (13) ms v 76 (18) or 75 (37) ms at the intermediate and final doses respectively (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Drugs that narrowed the zone of entrainment were associated with non-inducibility of VT after the final dose of the drug was given.

40|$|Background: Class I {{antiarrhythmic}} {{drugs can}} promote {{the organization of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) and sometimes converts AF into atrial flutter (AFL) concomitant with difficulty of rate control. We studied the usefulness of Bepridil, which exhibits a class III-like effect, for class I drug-induced AFL in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: The study population consisted of 17 consecutive patients (15 men, mean age 65 ± 8 years) with AFL converted from paroxysmal AF following oral treatment of class IA or IC antiarrhythmic agents including pilsicainide (n = 8), <b>cibenzoline</b> (n = 5), flecainide (n = 2), aprindine (n = 1), and propafenone with <b>cibenzoline</b> (n = 1). After the occurrence of AFL, class I drug was replaced by bepridil with a dose of 100 – 200 mg per day in all patients. Results: After the treatment with bepridil, 15 (88 %) out of the 17 patients restored sinus rhythm after 1 to 68 days (average of 21 days). In 12 (80 %) of the 15 patients, sinus rhythm was maintained {{for an average of}} 23. 6 months (range of 1 to 62 months) follow-up period. Although torsade de pointes was not recognized, a marked QT prolongation (0. 60 sec) was observed in one patient during the administration of bepridil at a daily dose of 200 mg. In this patient, QT interval was normalized (0. 45 sec) after reduction of bepridil to 150 mg daily. Conclusion: Bepridil treatment may be safe and effective for class I drug-induced AFL in patients with paroxysmal AF to restore and maintain sinus rhythm as an alternative therapy for catheter ablation. However, the QT interval must be carefully monitored during this medication...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{modality}} and morbidity of asymptomatic ST segment elevation in leads V 1 to V 3 with right bundle branch block (Brugada-type ST shift).  METHODS— 8612 Japanese subjects (5987  men and 2625  women, mean age 49. 2  years) who underwent a health check up in 1997  were investigated. Those with Brugada-type ST shift underwent the following further examinations over a two year period {{after the initial}} check up: ECG, echocardiogram, 24  hour Holter monitoring, treadmill exercise testing, signal averaged ECG, and slow kinetic sodium channel blocker loading test (<b>cibenzoline,</b> 1. 4  mg/kg).  RESULTS—Asymptomatic Brugada-type ST shift was found in 12  of 8612  (0. 14 %) subjects. Eleven of these 12  subjects were followed up. Follow up ECG exhibited persistent Brugada-type ST shift in seven of 11  (63. 6 %) subjects.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{antiarrhythmic}} drug flecainide on levcromakalim-induced hyperpolarization, macroscopic and unitary K+ currents in pig urethra were investigated using patch-clamp techniques. The effects of flecainide were also examined on currents in inside-out patches of COS 7 cells expressing carboxy terminus truncated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir 6. 2) subunits (i. e. Kir 6. 2 ΔC 36) which form ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels). In current-clamp mode, application of flecainide (⩾ 100 [*]μM) caused a significant depolarization after the membrane potential had been hyperpolarized by levcromakalim. In voltage-clamp experiments, the levcromakalim-induced outward current was suppressed by 300 [*]μM flecainide in quasi-physiological K+ conditions (Ki= 51 [*]μM). In contrast, approximately 20 % of the levcromakalim-induced inward current still remained even after application of 300 [*]μM flecainide in symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions (Ki= 51 [*]μM). In contrast, approximately 20 % of the levcromakalim-induced inwar= 126 [*]μM). In cell-attached configuration, the channel activity of the levcromakalim-induced KATP channels was reversibly inhibited by flecainide (⩾ 30 [*]μM) at − 50 [*]mV. Their activity was also suppressed by either disopyramide or <b>cibenzoline.</b> Flecainide reversibly inhibited the channel activity of Kir 6. 2 ΔC 36 expressed in COS 7 cells using inside-out configuration. Inhibitory effects of flecainide on the levcromakalim-induced currents became more potent when the value of external pH increased, although this slightly reduced the proportion of drug molecules carrying a positive charge. These results suggest that flecainide inhibits channel activity through blocking the pore site of the KATP channel in pig urethra...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ZD 6169, a novel K+ channel opener, on both {{membrane}} and unitary currents in pig urethra were investigated using patch-clamp techniques. Its effect was also examined on currents in inside-out patches of COS 7 cells expressing carboxy terminus truncated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir 6. 2) subunits (Kir 6. 2 ΔC 36) which form ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels). In current-clamp mode, ZD 6169 (⩽ 10 [*]μM) induced a concentration-dependent membrane hyperpolarization. Higher concentrations (⩾ 30 [*]μM) caused a transient membrane hyperpolarization, {{followed by a}} gradual membrane depolarization. On removal of ZD 6169, an after hyperpolarization was observed. In conventional voltage-clamp configuration, at − 50 [*]mV in symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions, ZD 6169 (100 [*]μM) caused a transient inward current which gradually decayed. Removal of ZD 6169 evoked a much larger amplitude K+ current with a similar time course. ZD 6169 produced an inward glibenclamide-sensitive K+ current, demonstrating a bell-shaped concentration-response relationship. In cell-attached configuration in symmetrical 140 [*]mM K+ conditions, ZD 6169 (⩽ 30 [*]μM) activated an KATP channel which was reversibly suppressed by application of glibenclamide. In contrast, ZD 6169 (100 [*]μM) inhibited {{the activity of the}} levcromakalim-induced KATP channels. ZD 6169 (100 [*]μM) had no significant effect on the channel activity of Kir 6. 2 ΔC 36 in inside-out configuration, although <b>cibenzoline</b> greatly suppressed the channel activity. These results demonstrate that ZD 6169 possesses a dual effect on the activity of the KATP channel; activating at low concentration and inhibiting at higher concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{assessment}} of proarrhythmic risks of drugs remains challenging. To evaluate {{the suitability of}} rat engineered heart tissue (EHT) for detecting proarrhythmic effects. We monitored drug effects on spontaneous con-tractile activity and, in selected cases, on action potentials (sharp microelectrode) and Ca 2 ? transients (Fura- 2) and contraction under electrical pacing. The Ito-blocker inhib-itor 4 -aminopyridine increased action potential duration and T 2 and caused aftercontractions, which were abolished by inhibitors of ryanodine receptors (RyR 2; JTV- 519) or sodium calcium exchanger (NCX; SEA 0400). 77 Drugs were then tested at 1 - 10 - 1009 free therapeutic plasma concentrations (FTPC) : Inhibitors of IKr, IKs, Ito, antiar-rhythmics (8), drugs withdrawn from market for torsades des pointes arrhythmias (TdP, 5), drugs with measurable (7) or isolated TdP incidence (13), drugs considered safe (14), 28 new chemical entities (NCE). Inhibitors of IKr or IKs had no effect alone, but substantially prolonged relax-ation time (T 2) when combined at high concentration. 15 / 33 drugs associated with TdP and 6 / 14 drugs considered non-torsadogenic (<b>cibenzoline,</b> diltiazem, ebastine, keto-conazole, moxifloxacin, and phenytoin) induced concen-tration-dependent T 2 prolongations (10 - 1009 FTPC). Bepridil, desipramine, imipramine, thioridazine, and erythromycin induced irregular beating. Three NCE pro-longed T 2, one reduced force. Drugs inhibiting repolari-zation prolong relaxation in rat EHTs and cause aftercontractions involving RyR 2 and NCX. Insensitivity to IKr inhibitors makes rat EHTs unsuitable as general proarrhythmia screen, but favors detection of effects on Ito, IKs? Ito or IKs? IKr. Screening a large panel of drugs suggests that effects on these currents, in addition to IKr, are more common than anticipated...|$|E
40|$|Amiodarone is {{a widely}} used {{anti-arrhythmic}} drug that inhibits diverse ion channels, including the Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX), L-type Ca(2 +) channels, and Na(+) channels. Here, we report that subtoxic doses of amiodarone and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) synergistically induced apoptosis of various glioma cells. Treatment of U 251 MG glioma cells with amiodarone increased intracellular Ca(2 +) levels and enhanced {{the expression of the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducible transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). This upregulation of CHOP was followed by marked upregulation of the TRAIL receptor, DR 5. Suppression of DRS expression by small interfering (si) RNAs almost completely blocked amiodarone/TRAIL-induced apoptosis in U 251 MG glioma cells, demonstrating that DR 5 is critical to this cell death. siRNA-mediated CHOP suppression reduced amiodarone-induced DR 5 upregulation and attenuated the cell death induced by amiodarone plus TRAIL. In addition, omitting Ca(2 +) from the external medium using ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid markedly inhibited this cell death, reducing the protein levels of CHOP and DRS. These results suggest that amiodarone-induced influx of Ca(2 +) {{plays an important role in}} sensitizing U 251 MG cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through CHOP-mediated DR 5 upregulation. Furthermore, subtoxic doses of bepridil and <b>cibenzoline,</b> two other anti-arrhythmic drugs with NCX-inhibitor activity, also sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, via the upregulation of both CHOP and DR 5. Notably, amiodarone/TRAIL cotreatment did not induce cell death in astrocytes, nor did it affect the expression of CHOP or DR 5 in these cells. These results collectively suggest that a combined regimen of amiodarone plus TRAIL may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for safely and selectively treating resistant gliomasclos...|$|E
40|$|Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) is {{a disorder}} of the heart's electrical activity that infrequently causes severe ventricular arrhythmias {{such as a}} type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation, which can be fatal. There have been no previous reports on the time-to-onset for LQTS based on data from spontaneous reporting systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the time-to-onset of LQTS according to drug treatment. We analyzed the association between 113 drugs in 37 therapeutic categories and LQTS including TdP using data obtained from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. For signal detection, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Furthermore, we analyzed the time-to-onset data and assessed the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter. The RORs (95 % confidence interval) for bepridil, amiodarone, pilsicainide, nilotinib, disopyramide, arsenic trioxide, clarithromycin, <b>cibenzoline,</b> donepezil, famotidine, sulpiride, and nifekalant were 174. 4 (148. 6 - 204. 6), 17. 3 (14. 7 - 20. 4), 52. 0 (43. 4 - 62. 4), 13. 9 (11. 5 - 16. 7), 69. 3 (55. 3 - 86. 8), 54. 2 (43. 2 - 68. 0), 4. 7 (3. 8 - 5. 8), 19. 9 (15. 9 - 25. 0), 8. 1 (6. 5 - 10. 1), 3. 2 (2. 5 - 4. 1), 7. 1 (5. 5 - 9. 2), and 254. 8 (168. 5 - 385. 4), respectively. The medians and quartiles of time-to-onset for aprindine (oral) and bepridil were 20. 0 (11. 0 - 35. 8) and 18. 0 (6. 0 - 43. 0) days, respectively. The lower 95 % confidence interval of the shape parameter β of bepridil was over 1 and the hazard was considered to increase over time. Our study indicated that the pattern of LQTS onset might differ among drugs. Based on these results, careful long-term observation is recommended, especially for specific drugs such as bepridil and aprindine. This information may be useful for the prevention of sudden death following LQTS and for efficient therapeutic planning...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMethods and resultsThis study {{included}} 68 patients (47 men, 21 women, mean age 69 years) in whom atrial fibrillation (AF) recurred immediately after electrical cardioversion (EC) was performed with no antiarrhythmic drugs. After administration of <b>cibenzoline</b> (Cib, 70 mg) or pilsicainide (Pil, 50 mg) on a randomized basis, all patients again underwent EC {{at the same}} energy as that prior to administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. We compared the efficacy of Cib (n= 35) and Pil (n= 33), and examined factors affecting successful cardioversion in patients treated with Cib. These patients were divided into a successful group (Group A) and an unsuccessful group (Group B). The success rate of EC at the same energy after intravenous Cib administration (77 %) was significantly greater than that after intravenous Pil administration (42 %) (p< 0. 01). In patients treated with Cib, AF duration was significantly greater in Group B (55. 8 ± 48. 2 h) than in Group A (29. 1 ± 17. 0 h) (p< 0. 05). Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during AF and the ratio of ANP level during AF to that during sinus rhythm were also significantly greater in Group A (110. 9 ± 69. 7 pg/ml and 3. 9 ± 2. 8, respectively) than in Group B (58. 2 ± 36. 1 pg/ml and 1. 8 ± 0. 9, respectively) (both, p< 0. 05). In patients treated with Pil, AF duration was also significantly greater in Group B (59. 7 ± 44. 6 h) than in Group A (19. 6 ± 21. 7 h) (p< 0. 05), and the ratio of ANP level during AF to that during sinus rhythm was significantly greater in Group A (3. 5 ± 2. 6) than in Group B (1. 7 ± 0. 9) (p< 0. 05). ConclusionsIn patients with AF previously refractory to conventional EC, intravenous Cib administration was more effective in restoring sinus rhythm with EC than intravenous Pil administration. The capacity of ANP secretion during AF tachycardia may be a predictive indicator {{for the prevention of}} AF recurrence in electrically remodeled atria...|$|E
