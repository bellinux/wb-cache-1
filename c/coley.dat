5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, <b>coley</b> and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and <b>coley</b> can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Less formally, Southcote is {{bordered by}} the {{settlements}} of Horncastle and Fords Farm to the west, Tilehurst {{to the north}}, West Reading to the north east, <b>Coley</b> to the east, Whitley to the south-east and Pingewood to the south.|$|E
5|$|Southcote's main {{thoroughfare}} is Southcote Lane which runs east–west through the area, connecting Southcote to Fords Farm (to the west) and <b>Coley</b> (to the east). Southcote is centred around Coronation Square, {{an area of}} open grassland surrounded by community facilities and commercial premises.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{specialized}} {{medical doctors}} in Germany apply <b>Coley's</b> toxins to patients. They {{can do so}} legally because, in Germany, unapproved medications may be produced, although {{they may not be}} sold or given away. Physicians can go to special laboratories and produce <b>Coley's</b> toxins there using their own hands. <b>Coley's</b> toxins may still be applied by a licensed medical doctor, because in Germany there is [...] "Therapiefreiheit" [...] ("therapy freedom"), the legal right to apply whichever therapy a physician considers to be appropriate in the light of their medical knowledge. For example, Dr Josef Issels used several unconventional and controversial treatments, including <b>Coley's</b> toxins, for cancer patients {{in the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coley's</b> Snack Foods. <b>Coley's</b> Snack Foods sales {{a variety}} of bagged snacks with a Bible page in every bag. The company uses prison labor for the {{dismantling}} of Bibles to put in their popular products, and some Murfreesboro residents have managed to assemble an entire Bible from eating numerous bags of the snacks. <b>Coley's</b> also branched out into the Christian film industry, with several movies re-dubbed and edited so that the dialogue presents an evangelical message, {{as well as the}} private prison industry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{so-called}} <b>Coley's</b> Toxins {{were used}} against {{different types of}} cancer from the year 1893 through the year 1963. From 1923 on, Parke-Davis was {{the only source of}} <b>Coley's</b> Toxins in the United States. In the wake of the thalidomide controversy and the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962, <b>Coley's</b> Toxins were assigned [...] "new drug" [...] status by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it illegal to prescribe them outside of clinical trials. Since then, several small clinical trials have been conducted with mixed results.|$|R
5|$|In 1908 Reading Central Goods {{railway station}} was {{opened on the}} <b>Coley</b> branch line {{diverting}} at Southcote Junction. During the first few decades of the 20th century, however, most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped. An Ordnance Survey map of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural (farms and nurseries) {{with a number of}} gravel pits and smithies. The 1930s saw the construction of the Southcote Park Estate, a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of <b>Coley</b> Park. An Ordnance Survey map of 1938 shows greater provision for the population (as opposed to industry); some of the gravel pits no longer existed and Presentation College, a boys' school, had opened in two large Victorian buildings—Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall, the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s. By the advent of World War II, Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing. Following the war, Denton's Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950, and featured a performance by three Alsatians—Rocky, Lindy and Irma—to recognise their work in the war. Denton's Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events, and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park.|$|E
5|$|The Shirelles' {{story was}} shown in Baby It's You!, a musical revue written by Floyd Mutrux and Colin Escott, which follows the story of Greenberg and Scepter Records. The revue played on Broadway for 148 performances, opening at the Broadhurst Theatre on April 27, 2011 and closing on September 4 of the same year.The use of their likenesses without {{permission}} led to Lee, {{as well as the}} estates of <b>Coley</b> and Harris, to sue Warner Bros.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} National Health Service (NHS) {{hospital in}} Reading is the Royal Berkshire Hospital, founded in 1839 and much enlarged and rebuilt since. A second major NHS general hospital, the Battle Hospital, closed in 2005. Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust runs a NHS hospital, Prospect Park Hospital, which specialises {{in the provision}} of care for people with mental health and learning disabilities. Reading has three private hospitals: the Berkshire Independent Hospital in <b>Coley</b> Park, the Dunedin Hospital situated on the main A4 Bath Road, and the Circle Hospital at Kennet Island.|$|E
5000|$|According to Cancer Research UK, [...] "available {{scientific}} evidence does not currently support claims that <b>Coley's</b> toxins can treat or prevent cancer". People with cancer who take <b>Coley's</b> toxins alongside conventional cancer treatments, or {{who use it}} as a substitute for those treatments, risk seriously harming their health.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coley's</b> {{vaccine is}} not a vaccine in the usual sense, namely that it {{prevents}} an infection. Rather than that, it triggers infection-like reactions. However, <b>Coley's</b> vaccine may work like many ordinary vaccines: it induces an immune response, in this case against the cancer. In this sense, it predates current attempts to develop cancer vaccines.|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} rationales proposed for how <b>Coley's</b> toxins affect the patient.|$|R
5|$|The {{first edition}} of Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It was the first book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career as a rock critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron <b>Coley,</b> helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E
25|$|The woman rides {{her horse}} hard. When it dies of exhaustion, <b>Coley</b> gives his horse {{to the woman}} and Gashade allows <b>Coley</b> to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue so Gashade tells <b>Coley</b> to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without <b>Coley.</b> She and Spear demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells <b>Coley</b> he will come back for him soon.|$|E

Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. <b>Coley,</b> apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them.|$|E
