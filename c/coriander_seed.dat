40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the effect of diets containing different levels of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> on performance and egg quality of Lohmann Brown laying hens. A total of 96 Lohmann Brown laying hens of 43 weeks of age were randomly allocated into 16 experimental units by assigning a completely randomized design with 4 treatments and 4 replications that kept for 6 weeks. The treatment diets were R 0 : diet with 0 % supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> powder (control), R 1 : diet with supplementation of 1 % <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> powder, R 2 : diet with supplementation of 2 % <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> powder, and R 3 : diet with supplementation of 3 % <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> powder. The results showed that supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> in diets did not affect egg weight, egg production, and egg mass. Supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> 2 %- 3 % significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. Supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> 1 %- 3 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased yellowness in yolk color without affecting other quality parameters. It can be concluded that supplementation of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> at the levels of 2 %- 3 % decreased feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and increased yolk color, however, the supplementation at all levels in diets did not affect egg weight, egg production, and egg mass...|$|R

25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, <b>coriander</b> <b>seed,</b> fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E

2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, manna is {{described}} twice: once in [...] {{with the full}} narrative surrounding it, and once again in [...] {{as a part of}} a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna {{is described}} as being [...] "a fine, flake-like thing" [...] like the frost on the ground. It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in size, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a <b>coriander</b> <b>seed</b> that is white. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium, adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna [...] "bred worms and stank": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23-24 states:This is what the Lord commanded: [...] "Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning." [...] So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.In the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Coriandrum sativum L. {{has been}} {{recommended}} for relief of insomnia in Iranian traditional medicine. However, no pharmacological studies have yet evaluated its sedative effects. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if extracts and essential oil of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> have sedative-hypnotic activity. Methods: The aqueous or hydro-alcoholic extracts or essential oil of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> (100, 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered to male albino mice, 30 minutes before pentobarbital injection (40 mg/kg). Latency to sleep and sleep duration were recorded. Results: Aqueous extract prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleeping time at 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg. Hydro-alcoholic extract at doses of 400 and 600 mg/kg increased pentobarbitalinduced sleeping time compared to saline-treated group. The essential oil increased pentobarbital-induced sleeping time only at 600 mg/kg. Conclusion: The extracts and essential oil of <b>coriander</b> <b>seeds</b> possess sedative-hypnotic activity. However, it is strongly suggested that the major active component(s) responsible for the hypnotic effect is mainly present in the aqueous extract...|$|R
