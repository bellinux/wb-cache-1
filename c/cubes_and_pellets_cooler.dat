Agricultural Research Service agronomist Paul Adler is providing complete cost-benefit breakdowns for using switch-grass pellets instead of fuel oil to heat homes and businesses in the Northeast. “There {{have been a lot}} of studies on bioenergy potential,” says Adler, who works at the ARS Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit in University Park, Pennsylvania. “Most of them are focusing on transportation, but we still need a viable, commercial, bio-based fuel substitute for petroleum. In the meantime, our studies suggest that we already have opportunities to use homegrown feed-stocks for producing heat, and that we can save money, reduce petroleum use, and cut greenhouse gas production in the process. ” Adler and others conducted a life-cycle assessment comparing costs of energy generation from coal, natural gas, fuel oil, and switch-grass in the form of energy-dense <b>cubes,</b> briquettes, <b>and</b> <b>pellets.</b> His research partners included ARS technician Fred McNeal, Pennsylvania State University graduate student Tom Wilson, Wilson’s advisor David Abler, and Drexel University assistant professor Sabrina Spatari. The researchers calculated the economic outlays associated with switch-grass production throughout the supply chain and the amounts of greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane— emitted during switch-grass production, densification, and conversion to heat and power. This included the first life-cycle inventory of switch-grass seed production and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with it, which the team developed using real-world information from a Pennsylvania producer...|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} {{analysis of a}} non-woody biomass pelleting process was performed for conditions in the Republic of Ireland. The analysis considered the establishment, harvest, storage and drying costs of the feedstock’s on-farm, together with transportation costs to the processing plant and {{the costs associated with}} the <b>pelleting</b> process. Capital <b>and</b> operating costs of the pelleting process were estimated at several plant capacities – 6 t / h, 8 t / h and 10 t / h. The pellet production cost for the base case scenario of 8 t / h was 102 / t of pellets produced. By decreasing production capacity to 6 t / h an increase in the production cost of 10 / t was experienced while increasing capacity to 10 t / h resulted in a decrease of 6 / t in the production cost of pellets. The cost of the raw material is the largest cost component (66 %) of the total pellet production cost. Other major cost factors include <b>pelleting</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> plant (11 %), straw grinding plant (10 %) and personnel costs (9 %). Considering current energy prices the equivalent energy cost of 7 / GJ (excluding profit margins) the potential production of non-woody biomass pellets competes favourably with oil and gas and was found to be economically viable...|$|R

The aim was to develop alfalfa products that could cater to diverse demands of the market as well as improve their quality. A novel process of fractionation (separation of leaves and stems) was explored to improve dehydrated <b>and</b> sun-cured alfalfa <b>pellet</b> <b>and</b> <b>cube</b> quality. Fractionation <b>and</b> dehydration of alfalfa was achieved by modifying a small-scale industrial three-pass rotary drum dryer. Fractionated leaves and stems were later combined in different proportions and densified to form <b>pellets</b> <b>and</b> <b>cubes.</b> Various physical characteristics such as density, hardness, durability <b>and</b> colour of <b>pellets</b> <b>and</b> <b>cubes</b> were determined. Regression equations were derived by considering these physical characteristics as dependent variables, while leaf content, grind size (for pellets), chop pre-heat temperature (for cubes), moisture content, applied pressure, die temperature and holding time were the independent variables. Studies were also conducted to determine volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during industrial drying of alfalfa crops as a function of drying temperature, time and specific plant fractions (leaf, stem or flower) ...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis uses process {{modelling}} to investigate energy efficiency {{measures in the}} grate-kiln process for iron ore production; specifically, how waste heat contained in flue gas could be recirculated {{in order to achieve}} a decrease in specific fuel consumption. Consequently, fossil carbon emissions would be reduced as the grate-kiln units are fired with coal or oil. The implementation of flue gas recirculation is simulated with a process model in EBSILON Professional 10. 0. Process concepts which make use of available waste heat are developed and their impact on fuel usage, <b>pellet</b> temperature profiles <b>and</b> the magnetite oxidation process is evaluated. Aside from partial flue gas recirculation, a heat recovery concept is investigated. Both concepts are applied to decrease the fuel consumption by increasing the temperature and oxidation on the grate and to recover heat at a high temperature. To minimize the effect of recirculation and heat recovery on the pellet heat treatment process, concepts that use intercooling before the grate are also evaluated. The implementation of heat recovery affects the performance of the <b>pellet</b> <b>cooler.</b> The cooler’s operation is studied in detail with a cooler model developed in MATLAB. The cooler model is evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis is made to determine which parameters have a crucial impact on the <b>pellet</b> <b>cooling.</b> The results indicate that waste heat utilization can reduce the fuel consumption by up to 30 % if a heat exchanger is used. It was revealed that increased temperature into the cooler’s hottest section elevates the temperature levels on the grate, which lowers the fuel usage. Direct flue gas recirculation lowers the oxygen content in the air passing the kiln and grate, which has a negative impact on the oxidation process and the overall heat balance. The cooler model showed that to maintain adequate <b>pellet</b> <b>cooling,</b> the mass flow through cooler zones C 3 and C 4 should be increased by 70 %, or the area of the C 3 and C 4 sections should be increased by 40 % when heat recovery is used. The direct flue gas recirculation concepts requires a 40 % and 25 % increase for the two measures, respectively. The thesis recommends three process designs, based on indirect heat recovery from the flue gases...|$|R

High concentration of iodide and long incubation times were the conditions for optimal iodide enrichment and high-protein hydrolysates.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of feed processing (pelleting) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality in male broilers. Pelleted feed was compared to mash feed with the same specification. In addition, the effect of feed texture (feed particle size) on bodyweight, feed conversion and mortality, by using crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> <b>and</b> mash was evaluated. Six thousand day-old Ross 788 male broiler chickens, originating from a specific broiler breeder flock (37 weeks old) were divided into three treatment groups of 2000 birds by systematic random sampling. The experiment was an 8 x 3 block design, with 250 broilers randomly and equally assigned to each pen. The birds were kept in a controlled environmental house and vaccinated against NCD, IB, IBD and Pneumovirus. The experiment {{was carried out}} at 1517 m above sea level, on the Highveld of South Africa. At this altitude and together {{with the fact that}} the experiment was carried out during winter (June and July 1997), no inducing methods were necessary. Mortalities were recorded daily and post mortems were done on all dead chickens and the cause of death recorded. Dead chickens were weighed individually and the weight recorded. Bacteriology was done on all the chickens that died from infectious causes to identify the specific bacteria. The bodyweight per pen was determined by weighing all the chickens per pen on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 and weighing at least 20 % of the chickens per pen on day 4, 11, 18, 25, 32 and 39. The feed conversion and mortality corrected feed conversion were determined on day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. The mean live mass in kg, the percentage survivors, the feed conversion and age in days were used to calculate the production efficiency factor for each treatment group at 42 days of age. Chickens on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> had the highest bodyweight (2304, 0 g) at 42 days of age. They were followed by the chickens on the mash diet (2054, 1 g) and the lowest bodyweight was recorded on the ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> (1993, 5 g). The difference in bodyweight for the three treatment groups was significant (p# 0, 05). The pelleting process therefore did not result in better bodyweight, but the bodyweight were determined by the particle size of the feed (feed texture). The percentage weight gain per week, decreased from week one to week six. During the first week and to a lesser extent during the second week, there was a big difference in percentage weight gain between treatment groups. The chickens on the crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> grew the fastest (230, 1 % during week one and 159 % during week two). The weight gain for the chickens on the all-mash diet was 187, 7 % for week one and 153, 1 % for week two. The slowest weight gain was in the chickens on the ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> (179, 7 % during week one and 143, 5 % during week two). The weekly weight gain in the three treatment groups from week three to week six was similar. The difference in weight gain over the first two weeks, was probably due to the difference in feed texture, because the chickens on the crumbles grew the fastest and the chickens on the ground crumbles the slowest. Eleven percent of the crumbles and 5 % of the pellets were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the mash 25, 0 % and in the ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> 41, 5 % of the particles were smaller than 0, 6 mm. In the crumbles 44 % <b>and</b> in the <b>pellets</b> 76, 7 % particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. In the mash 7, 5 % and in the ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> 3, 5 % of the particles were greater than 3, 6 mm. The best FC (1, 900) and mortality corrected FC (1, 852) were achieved on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets.</b> It differed significantly (p# 0, 05) from the FC (1, 946) and mortality corrected FC (1, 921) of chickens on ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> as well as the FC (1, 963) and mortality corrected FC (1, 945) of chickens on mash. There was no significant (p> 0, 05) difference in the FC and mortality corrected FC in the ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> <b>and</b> mash rations. The pelleting process on its own, did not significantly improve feed efficiency. Grinding of crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> abolished the feed efficiency responses observed when the physical form was preserved. Particle size (feed texture) was therefore the most important factor determining feed efficiency. Mortality was the highest in chickens on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> (6, 57 %), followed by 4, 03 % in chickens on ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> <b>and</b> 2, 85 % in chickens on mash. These differences in mortality were significant (p# 0, 05). The higher mortality on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> was mainly caused by ascites (2, 11 %) and SDS (1, 39 %), which caused 3, 5 % of the mortality. The most important cause of mortality in the group receiving ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> was SDS (1, 01 %). Although the total mortality in the chickens on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> was the highest, the better bodyweight and FC in this group resulted in the highest PEF (269, 8) at 42 days. The chickens on mash had a PEF of 242, 4 and in the chickens on ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> it was 233, 6. The better results on crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets</b> are further accentuated by the net return per 2000 day-old chickens placed of R 1694. 70 when compared to the chickens on ground crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> <b>and</b> R 1196. 36 when compared to the chickens on mash. This study therefore, showed that particle size (feed texture), played the most important role in determining bodyweight and feed efficiency in broilers. To ensure the heaviest bodyweight and most efficient feed conversion on any given feed specification, it is of utmost importance that broilers receive feed as intact crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets,</b> with minimum damage to the crumbles <b>and</b> <b>pellets.</b> Dissertation (MMedVet (Altil)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
