5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds,</b> then still a novelty.|$|E
25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the {{key benefit}} of raising money by selling <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> is a reduced cash {{interest}} payment. The advantage for companies of issuing <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the potential impact of}} capital supply on security issuance. We focus on the role of <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrageurs as suppliers of capital to <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> issuers. We estimate a simultaneous equations model of demand and supply of <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> capital, linking the time series of aggregate <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> issuance to measures of capital supply: <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage hedge fund flows, returns, and a proxy for arbitrageurs' use of leverage. We find that issuance is positively and significantly related to increases in all three supply measures. To provide further interpretation, we use the September/October 2008 short-selling ban as a natural experiment to examine the impact of an exogenous shock to the supply of capital from arbitrageurs. Results from both empirical approaches provide evidence that the supply of capital from <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrageurs impacts issuance. The Author 2010.

25|$|Vanilla <b>{{convertible}}</b> <b>bonds</b> are {{the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.|$|E

For comparison the risk profile of <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage hedge fund indices at both monthly and daily frequencies is also examined. Results indicate that <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage is {{positively related to}} default and term structure risk factors. These risk factors are augmented with the simulated <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage portfolio, mimicking a passive investment in <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage, to assess the risk and return of individual hedge funds. We provide estimates {{of the performance of}} two hedge fund indices (an equally weighted and value weighted index) and a sample of <b>convertible</b> <b>bond</b> arbitrage hedge funds using a factor model methodology. Lagged and contemporaneous observations of the risk factors are specified, controlling for illiquidity in the securities held by funds. Our results cover two time periods. Initially we find evidence of abnormal risk adjusted returns in the individual hedge fund data and the equally weighted hedge fund index and no evidence of abnormal risk adjusted returns in the value weighted hedge fund index. When we examine performance during the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008 we find evidence of negative abnormal returns amongst individual hedge funds and the hedge fund indices.

25|$|To {{determine}} a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes {{the accounts of}} the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S's ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody's reflect expected investor losses {{in the case of}} default. For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process and criteria for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and <b>convertible</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.|$|E

This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved. At the time, making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk's office, and on the day it was due the brokers gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk's office, smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game.
