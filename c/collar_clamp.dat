30|$|The lower {{number of}} adverse events between circumcised clients may provide a {{reassurance}} to the potential circumcision clients to seek for SMC services (Kigozi et al. 2008). Use of devices for SMC scale-up including elastic collar compression (PrePex) and <b>collar</b> <b>clamp</b> (ShangRing) have been piloted in Uganda. PrePex device has been assessed for safety in “An Active AE surveillance phase” on 1000 clients and more than 1600 clients in the passive phase as per the WHO guidelines. The AE rate in the PrePex device clients was 1.1  % (0.55, 1.97) during the Surveillance phase and 1.6  % (0.76, 2.90) (Galukande et al. 2014) and 2.6  % (1.18, 4.88) (Kigozi et al. 2014) compared to 2.9  % (2.3, 3.6) observed among clients receiving the surgical method (Kigozi et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|A pair of spaced collars {{are mounted}} {{at right angles}} on a clamp body by {{retaining}} rings which enable the collars to rotate {{with respect to the}} clamp body. Mounting posts extend through aligned holes in the <b>collars</b> and <b>clamp</b> body. Each <b>collar</b> can be <b>clamped</b> onto the inserted post while the clamp body remains free to rotate about the post and <b>collar.</b> The <b>clamp</b> body is selectively clamped onto each post...|$|R
40|$|Inspection {{tool for}} tubing {{consists}} of metal casing housing elastic <b>collar.</b> <b>Collar</b> is <b>clamped</b> around weld site under test. Leakage through weld is contained within chamber and is bled to detector via tubing attached to fitting. Tool, {{originally designed to}} detect fluid leakage in tubing, {{can be used to}} detect gas leaks...|$|R
40|$|DE 102005056846 A 1 UPAB: 20070706 NOVELTY - Linear drive has an {{actuator}} {{which can be}} filled with a medium and the <b>clamping</b> <b>collar</b> (2, 3) as well as bellows (1) are manufactured one piece under application of a generative manufacturing method. The <b>clamping</b> <b>collars</b> as well as bellows are manufactured from a uniform material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the method {{for the production of}} linear drive. USE - For industrial, automated handling of workpieces, devices or plant component in order to position and transport along a linear axis. ADVANTAGE - Enables a simple and economical production of linear drive, multi functional applicability and lesser assembly expenditure...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} suits {{were made}} of waterproofed canvas invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century, most suits consisted of a solid sheet of rubber between layers of tan twill. Their thick vulcanized rubber <b>collar</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the corselet making the joint waterproof. The inner collar (bib) was made of the same material as the suit and pulled up inside the corselet and around the diver's neck. The wrist cuffs are also made of vulcanized rubber.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{discusses the}} design, analysis, manufacturing {{and testing of}} the One-Ride human powered vehicle which was entered into the 2015 ASME West Coast HPVC Competition. The goal of the vehicle is to entice people to switch from gas powered vehicles to the One-Ride for trips of up to 20 miles round trip. The One-Ride design features fully adjustable seating and steering positions and was designed to fit anyone between the heights of 52 ̆ 722 ̆ 2  and 62 ̆ 742 ̆ 2  comfortably. The seat is adjusted using metal sliders, manufactured in the SCU machine shop, which fit into brackets attached to the frame. The bike features telescopic steering which is adjusted by the loosening and tightening of <b>collar</b> <b>clamps.</b> To increase the strength and safety of the frame, the welding and heat treatment were contracted to industry professionals. The frame was welded by Chavez Welding and heat treated by Byington Steel Treating. Deformation in the seat frame during heat treatment prevented full adjustability of the seat, however was secured in its middle position for testing. The wheelbase of the bike is 73. 33 in and has an overall height of 50. 77 in.. Slop in the steering caused instability at low speeds, which prevented the bike from being ridden in the ASME HPVC Competition. Design solutions to both of these problems have been identified. At the completion of senior design, the manufacturing is still ongoing...|$|R
50|$|Although clamp-type collars {{work very}} well under {{relatively}} constant loads, shock loads can cause the collar to shift its position on the shaft. This {{is due to the}} very high forces that can be created by a relatively small mass during impact, compared to a statically or gradually applied load. As an option for applications with this type of loading, an undercut can be made on the shaft and a <b>clamp</b> <b>collar</b> can be used to create a positive stop that is more resistant to shock loads.|$|R
50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen lift frame and hydraulics. When vertical, the rocket was {{suspended}} above the firing stand, which {{was raised to}} touch the rocket fins. <b>Clamping</b> <b>collars</b> were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section extendable ladder, the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{innovative}} and useful of the collars is the two-piece <b>clamping</b> <b>collar.</b> Two-piece clamp-style shaft collars can be disassembled or installed in position without having to remove other components from the shaft. The two-piece design provides greater clamping force than a single piece clamp {{because all of the}} force is transferred directly into clamping the shaft. In single piece designs, the non-tightened side provides negative force as it must hold the collar open to allow it to be placed onto the shaft. The single tightener must work against this force as well as provide clamping force of its own.|$|R
50|$|The {{base plate}} is very heavy and is fitted with four {{carrying}} handles. The sight bracket fits the standard mortar sight. The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the barrel <b>clamping</b> <b>collar</b> is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm short mortar. After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this firing plunger.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, {{captured}} Italian frogmen's rebreathers influenced improved {{designs for}} British rebreathers. Many British frogmen's breathing sets used aircrew breathing oxygen cylinders salvaged from shot-down German Luftwaffe aircraft. The earliest of these breathing sets {{may have been}} modified Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus; their fullface masks were the type intended for the Siebe Gorman Salvus, but in later operations different designs were used, leading to a fullface mask with one big face window, at first circular or oval and later rectangular (mostly flat, but the sides curved back to allow better vision sideways). Early British frogman's rebreathers had rectangular counterlungs on the chest like Italian frogman's rebreathers, but later designs had a square recess {{in the top of}} the counterlung so it could extend further up toward the shoulders. In front they had a rubber <b>collar</b> that was <b>clamped</b> around the absorbent canister. Some British armed forces divers used bulky thick diving suits called Sladen suits; one version of it had a flip-up single faceplate for both eyes to let the user get binoculars to his eyes when on the surface.|$|R
