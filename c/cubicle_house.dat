50|$|Howell Homeplace, {{also known}} as the William Brinkley Howell Homeplace, is a {{historic}} home located near Tarboro, Edgecombe County, North Carolina. The frame dwelling dates to the mid-19th century, and is a two-story <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> sheathed in weatherboard with a hipped roof. The vernacular Greek Revival interior features extraordinary painted decoration in the entrance and stairhalls. The decoration is attributed to Edward Zoeller, a Bavarian fresco painter, who also decorated the Redmond-Shackelford House. Also on the property is a contributing outbuilding.|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} dairy cattle are housed year-round indoors, mostly in <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems, however, pasture {{provides}} certain health and behavioral benefits for cows. In <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems, cows are restricted in {{their abilities to}} choose their own lying position and when they get up, the neck rail makes it impossible to make a step forward. Nowadays the free range housing systems, which may combine the advantages of the pasture and the <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems, are getting more popular. Cattle spend more than half their lives lying down when kept in the pasture, but when cow-lying-time is reduced, stress and health risks are threatening. Because lying time is so important, the goal {{of this study was to}} determine how dairy cattle in the pasture lie in relation to each other and how they stand up. It is an argument to change the housing system, if this behaviour is not possible in <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems. The aim of this study is to determine how cows are positioned in relation to each other when lying in the pasture; looking at whether the cows lie with their cranial sides together or not and determining at which angle the body axis of the cows are. The second aim of this study, is to see if cows make a step forward during or directly after rising or not. The data collection was done in Uruguay on a pasture based dairy farm. Four herds were observed for this study for a period of 5 weeks and 1520 observations were made. Observations where done with bare eyes and the help of binoculars. Cows lie more often (61, 8 %) with their cranial sides away from each other than towards each other (P< 0, 00006), and more often with their body axis in line (59, 5 %) (P< 0, 00006) than at an angle. In 73, 7 % of the cases (with P< 0, 000 and with a 95 % confidence interval of 0, 685 to 0, 789), cows make one or more steps forward after rising. The fact that cows lie more often with their cranial sides away from each other and that they make a step forward during rising in 73, 7 % of the cases, shows that the <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems are not suitable for these observed behaviours. But knowing that cows on pasture position their body axis in line in 59, 5 % of the observations, the <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> system does not impede this behaviour in most of the cases...|$|R

At cow-level, the odds of having DD were increased {{in the case of}} lower parity and lactation. Important risk factors at herd-level were: restricted grazing time, fast rise in concentrate amount after calving, feeding by-products, herd trimming only at long intervals, and introduction of dry cows into the lactating herd before calving.

40|$|Animal welfare versus costs? – Assessment {{of dairy}} housing systems Animal welfare plays an {{important}} role in organic agriculture. The EEC-regulations lead to high standards: e. g. loose housing, outside yards and pasture for cattle. Loose housing systems for dairy cows mainly differ in the design of the lying area (cubicles, bedded-sloped floor, deep litter/straw yard). In this paper, animal welfare and economic aspects of these systems are confronted. Results from own behavioural observations on 40 farms and calculations of profitability are presented. With regard to most behaviour variables obser-ved, straw yards and sloped floors proved most adequate, followed by comfortable cubic-les. Traditional cubicle houses had the most adverse effects on behaviour. The same order was found for lesions. However, the economic calculations showed, that the straw yard system led to the highest costs, followed by the <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> with slatted floors, the sloped floor and cubicle houses with concrete passageways. Therefore, a higher welfare level will lead to higher costs, at least partially...|$|E
40|$|The {{first study}} {{described}} in this report involved housing 66 spring calving heifers {{in one of three}} systems during the winter, namely, (i) a conventional <b>cubicle</b> <b>house,</b> (ii) a <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> with cushioned flooring covering the slats (slat mats) in the passageway and (iii) on a wood-chip out-wintering pad. Behaviour, health and performance indicators were measured on all animals while pregnant from housing in November 2003 until calving in January 2004. Additionally, data were collected on the first 15 animals to calve in each treatment for the first four weeks of lactation in the spring. The slat mats resulted in some improvements to hoof health compared to the conventional <b>cubicle</b> <b>house.</b> Furthermore, it increased feeding times although this had no effect on feed intake or performance. The results also indicated that heifers have a preference for standing on cushioned flooring rather than on concrete during late pregnancy. Both groups indoors differed greatly from the outdoor heifers in several respects. The outdoor animals had healthier feet and were less affected by injuries to the limbs. They also had a more diverse behaviour repertoire and slipped and tripped less. However, their welfare was adversely affected by inclement weather conditions with indications of immunosuppression combined with a reduction in average daily gain being recorded. Furthermore, they were dirtier and spent less time lying down. None of these factors influenced milk yield, quality or composition in early lactation. Welfare problems associated with the pad were weather and management dependent and hence could be addressed by more frequent cleaning of the pad and/or an increase in space allowance combined with the provision of shelter. Hence, the potential for good welfare in dairy heifers was higher on the pad than indoors in a cubicle system even when slat mats were provided. In the second study, 62 autumn calving pluriparous dairy cows were housed in September 2004 in a cubicle system with either solid concrete floors or solid concrete floors covered by a rubber mat and cleaned by an automatic scrapper. Behaviour, locomotion and foot lesion scores were recorded from at least 3 weeks prior to calving until at least 16 weeks post-partum. Furthermore, in-depth measures of oestrous behaviour and reproductive performance were recorded. The cushioned flooring had no effect on sole or white line lesion scores or on dermatitis scores. However, it reduced the rate of wear of the heels in early lactation. Cows on cushioned flooring spent more time standing, but not feeding, at the feed face while cows on concrete stood in the cubicles instead. It appears that where cows have access to spacious, well-designed cubicles they can use them for standing to get relief for their feet from the concrete. Similar to the previous study this also indicates that cows prefer to stand on cushioned flooring than on bare concrete and emphasises the importance of at least providing cows with mats or mattresses in their cubicles. There were no effects of the cushioned flooring on oestrous behaviour or reproductive performance, which was poor in both treatments. It is suggested that the reasons for this were that the cushioned flooring did not provide sufficient traction for the cows and so they were as reluctant as the cows on concrete to perform mounting behaviour.

40|$|Summary Nowadays cows {{spent more}} and longer time inside, mostly in modern <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems. However, free range housing is {{becoming}} more popular. In these systems and also on pasture, cows spend almost 15 h/d lying down. There are various aspects to investigate lying behaviour of cows in the pasture: magnetic body alignment, different cow postures and lateralization. Objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there is a pattern in natural individual cow lying behaviour. If this individual pattern in lying behaviour in the pasture is not possible in a <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> system, improving and adjusting this system is an option. During five weeks four different herds were observed by two observers. The observations took place by scan sampling, through binoculars. The observations were done between 3 and 4 hours after milking, when most of the cows were lying, so that was the best moment to start with the observations. Between observations the cows had to have moved, otherwise the same situation would be observed twice. Most of the observed cows (2111 observations across four herds) prefer to lie in the N-S direction (55. 5...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} western {{countries}} with <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> is an efficient way of dairy farming. Though, a disadvantage is the high prevalence and incidence of foot disorders (clinical and subclinical), which cause high economic losses and also seriously impair the welfare of dairy cattle. To point out the importance of reducing the amount and severity of foot disorders, advice to farmers should include information about {{the scale of the}} problem and the consequences in terms of economics and animal welfare. To provide support in making decisions on implementing intervention measures, insight into costs and benefits of different measures should be available. The objective of this study, therefore, is to provide more insight into the costs and benefits, for farmer and cow, of different intervention measures to improve dairy cow foot health. Intervention measures were modeled when they were applicable on a dairy farm with <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> and when sufficient information was available in literature. Net costs were calculated as the difference between the costs of the measure and the economic benefits resulting from the measure. Welfare benefits were calculated as well. Cost-effective measures are: improving lying surface (mattress and bedding, € 7 and € 1 /cow per year, respectively), reducing stocking density (break even) and performing additional foot trimming (€ 1 /cow per year). Simultaneously, these measures have a relative high welfare benefit. Labor costs {{play an important role in}} the cost-effectiveness of labor-intensive measures. More insight into cost-effectiveness and welfare benefits of intervention measures can help to prioritize when choosing between intervention measures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{concentration}} and size distribution of airborne particles were measured {{inside and outside}} typical animal houses such as broilers, broiler breeders (both floor housing with litter); layers (floor housing system and aviary housing system); turkeys (floor housing with litter), pigs: fattening pigs (traditional houses, low emission houses with dry feed, and low emission houses with wet feed), piglets, sows (individual and group housing); cattle (<b>cubicle</b> <b>house),</b> and mink (cages). Using an aerosol spectrometer, particles were counted and classified into 30 size classes (total range: 0. 25 – 32 µm). Particles were measured on for two days, one in spring {{and the other in}} summer, in two of each species/housing combination during 30 min inside and outside the animal house. Outside temperature and relative humidity were also measured. Particle counts in the different size classes were generally higher in poultry houses than in pig houses, and counts in pig houses were generally higher than those in cattle and mink houses. The particle counts in animal houses were highest (on average 87 %) in the size classes 2. 5 μm (on average 97 %). Most particles outside were in the size class < 1. 0 μm (99 % in counts). Mean count median diameter (CMD) of particles inside the animal houses ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 59 μm, while mean mass median diameter (MMD) ranged from 3. 54 to 12. 4 μm.

40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} welfare problems in dairy cattle. Most studies on lameness have focused on wide ranging surveys to identify causal factors, but few have considered the welfare implications of this disorder. In this study, we compared the social and individual behavior of 10 lame cows and 10 nonlame cows. The 20 Hol-stein-Friesian cows calved in the summer and spent the autumn and winter together with another 36 nonlame cows in a Newton Rigg <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> building. The cubicle to cow ratio was 1 : 1, and wheat straw bedding was provided every day. The investiga-tors fed the cows ad lib a silage-based diet and milked them twice a day, at which time they received adjusted amounts of concentrate. The investigators observed the 2 groups of cows a total of 32 hr to obtain information on social and individual behav-iors through scan and behavior sampling. Although lame cows were less likely to start an aggressive interaction, there were no differences in times receiving aggression. No differences were found in the times licking other cows; however, the frequency of times being licked was higher in the lame cows. The lame cows spent more time lying out of the cubicles, had longer total lying times, and spent less time feeding. The be-havioral differences seen show that lame cows do not cope as successfully with their environment as do nonlame cows. Also, these results provide useful information on how licking in dairy cows may play a role in alleviating discomfort of other herd members who are in pain or who are sick.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the effects of}} floor system, digital dermatitis (DD) and interdigital dermatitis and heel-horn erosion (IDHE) on locomotion performance in 225 dairy cows of 12 commercial dairy herds. Nine herds were kept in cubicle houses with concrete passageways (either solid, slatted, or grooved concrete) and three herds were kept in straw yards. Animals were at most five times examined at monthly intervals for lesion severity of DD and IDHE and for locomotion score. Locomotion score was rated on a scale ranging from 1 to 5 (from normal to severe) and disturbed locomotion (lameness) {{was defined as a}} score ¿ 3. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the 943 observations using lameness (yes/no) as outcome variable. The proportion of observations scored as lame (locomotion score ¿ 3) increased from 18 % 1 month after trimming to 29 % at 4 months after trimming. Severe lesions of DD and IDHE were associated with a significantly higher proportion of lame cows. The proportion of animals with disturbed locomotion increased from 16 % to 40 % as the severity of DD increased and from 17 % to 30 % with increasing severity of IDHE lesions. Locomotion performance highly differed between the <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> and straw yard group. Only 1 % of all gaits in straw yard cows were scored as lame, while in cubicle housed cows these percentages varied from 24 % to 46 % with grooved floors showing the highest average locomotion score. Due to the extreme low incidence of lameness in straw yards, the statistical analysis had to be restricted to observations on concrete floors (n = 744). The logistic regression model with lameness (yes/no) as dependent variable and random effects of cow and herd resulted in Odds Ratios for severe DD and IDHE of, respectively, 3. 2 and 3. 2, both significantly larger than unity.

40|$|Since {{more and}} more dairy cattle is housed in zero grazing {{production}} systems, claw health is today more than ever an area of concern. In particular, digital dermatitis (DD) or Mortellaro disease is considered {{a major cause of}} epidemic lameness. In literature, several risk factors associated with DD are mentioned. A digital survey was conducted among Flemish dairy farmers (420 completed questionnaires) to provide an overview of the prevalence of DD in Flemish dairy herds and the associated risk factors. Associations between the DD prevalence and possible risk factors are the result of a chi-squared test. A large herd with a number of lactating cows was positively associated with a high prevalence of DD (P = 0. 0031). More than 67 % of the respondents used a claw bath or sprayer. The use of a claw bath was positively associated with a higher prevalence of DD (P 20 %) was mentioned by 34. 5 % of the respondents with <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing,</b> it is used in most farms (more than 85 % of the respondents used <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing).</b> Cleaning of the floors by manure scrapers and robots was associated with a high prevalence of DD (P= 0. 0001).

At each visit the {{locomotion}} of all cows was scored (15, 597 cows, 34, 643 measures). Multivariable regression analyses were preformed to identify risk factors associated with increased lameness (poor locomotion). Factors associated with mean herd poor locomotion were dry cows kept in straw yards compared with cubicle houses, pregnant heifers kept with milking cows compared with dry cows in winter, passage way widths 15 cm, routine trimming of claws ofall cows by a claw trimmer or by- the farmer compared with no routine claw trimming, feeding maize silage to milking cows compared with other forage types, {{and the use of}} automatic scrapers compared with tractor scrapers in the <b>cubicle</b> <b>house.</b> Farmers recorded the lesions they observed while treating lame cows. Sole ulcer, white line disease and digital dermatitis were the three most frequently recorded lesions. The occurrence of sole ulcer, white line disease or digital dermatitis compared with having no lesion was used as the outcome variable in three multilevel binomial logistic regression models with month from calving nested within cow nested within farm. Risk factors associated with increased risk of sole ulcer were being housed on sparse bedding for four months or more, having grooved concrete floors on ~e farm, large herd sizes and parity numbers of four and above. Risk factors associated with increased white line disease were grooved concrete floors increasing parity number. Risk factors associated with increased digital dermatitis were grooved concrete floors and large herd sizes. A large clinical trial was used to assess the effect of intervening on known risk factors associated with lameness. Farmers in the treatment group received farm specific recommendations grouped under five targets areas which reflected the hypothesised aetiologies of sole ulcer, white line disease and digital dermatitis. There were small reductions in locomotion score and sole ulcer rate on treatment farms compared with control. These suggested that the hypotheses that reduced standing time and encouraged increased lying time through improved cow comfort may reduce sole ulcer were, at least in part, correct. There was no clear effect of treatment on the rate white line disease and digital dermatitis. It is likely that more than one of the following factors explain the lack of significant results from these initial investigations; poor recognition oflameness by farmers, insufficient uptake of recommendations, predisposition to lameness from previous lameness event and insufficiently specific lesion definitions.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of fully automatic milking systems (AMS) on dairy farms can only succeed if cows visit the system {{more or less}} voluntarily, at regular intervals. This can be arranged by either forced or free cow traffic. In the case of forced cow traffic, the AMS is the only route from the lying area to the feeding area. An alternative is free cow traffic, where the cows can decide whether to visit the AMS or not. The behaviour in 3 x 20 crossbred Holstein Friesian dairy cows in three experiments (experiment Ia, Ib and II) was studied in a <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> with a selection system consisting of a selection stall and a concentrate feeder, simulating an AMS. Cows could obtain 250 g of concentrate in the system once every six hours. Actual milking occurred in a conventional milking parlour twice a day. Experiment Ia consisted of (1) a reference phase with no use of the selection system, (2) free cow traffic, (3) forced cow traffic, and (4) a reference phase. Experiment Ib was a repetition of experiment Ia. Experiment II was divided into (1) a reference phase with no use of the selection system, (2) forced cow traffic with two one-way passages between the feeding and lying areas, (3) forced cow traffic with one one-way passage, (4) free cow traffic with one free passage between the feeding and lying areas, and (5) free cow traffic with two such passages and (6) a reference phase. The number of visits paid to the selection system by individual cows appeared to be consistent in the different phases in each experiment (r = 0. 52 in experiment I (P < 0. 05); r = 0. 68 − 0. 86 (P < 0. 01) in experiment II). In experiments Ia and Ib, cows seemed to visit the selection system more often during forced cow traffic than during free cow traffic, but this was {{because some of the}} cows did not visit the system at all during free cow traffic. Therefore, the differences were not significant. In experiment II, cows paid the same number of visits to the selection system during different types of cow traffic, but when two passages were open during free cow traffic, the cows visited the system less (P < 0. 01). During forced cow traffic, cows spent more time standing on the slatted floor in the feeding area, spent less time standing at the feeding gate and made less journeys from the lying to the feeding area (significant in two of three experiments; P < 0. 01). It was concluded that forced cow traffic may improve the frequency of visits to the AMS, but somewhat restricts the cows' behaviour, and may, therefore, be questionable. Free cow traffic could work if cows are previously conditioned to take the route to the AMS...|$|E
40|$|In robotic milking {{there is}} always a slight chance of failure to attach the milking cluster. Attachment failure is most likely for cows whose udder {{conformation}} is less convenient for robot attachment. In general, after milking failure cows try to revisit the milking robot if they are not sent to a separate area. Since it is difficult to estimate the effect of milking failure on such a cow and her welfare in conditions of robotic milking, a specific 16 -day trial was conducted on 12 cows. These cows were milked in a milking parlour with six milking stalls. Each afternoon milking, three cows were not milked. All the cows were closely observed in the <b>cubicle</b> <b>house</b> for 1 h after the afternoon milking. Thereafter, all cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time and the three unmilked cows were milked. In total, each cow was observed 12 times after milking and four times after omitted milking. The following behavioural traits were registered: time budget for the 1 h, occurrence and time until eating, drinking, lying, urination and defecation, and aggressive interactions. Milking order was defined on the basis of how often a cow came to the milking parlour in the first batch of six cows. Moreover, the data related to the milk yield {{and the use of the}} automatic feeding installation with the complete diet were analysed. After omitted milking, only the cows from the first batch stood longer in cubicles (14. 2 min of 1 h) and lay less (5. 4 min of 1 h) than milked cows of the same batch (respectively 7. 0 min and 16. 3 min for standing and lying in cubicles) (P < 0. 01). After omitted milking, cows urinated earlier and more frequently (64. 5 %) than milked cows (36. 3 %) (P < 0. 002) (both batches). There were no statistically significant differences in eating time and feed intake after milking and omitted milking. Milk yield per cow averaged 24. 9 kg during days with omitted (delayed by 1 h) milking and 25. 3 kg during the days without omitted milking (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that cows show some signs of discomfort after omitted milking (urination); this discomfort seemed to be greater in cows coming earlier to the milking parlour (afterwards they preferred to stand rather than to lie). The 60 % of cases of milk leakage found after omitted milking indicates that failed cluster attachment can be accompanied by an extra risk factor for the occurrence of mastitis. However, omitted milking as a treatment did not influence feeding and aggressive behaviour or milking order when unmilked cows were brought to the milking parlour the third time together with the milked cows. Our methods and results can be useful for estimating the effects of robot milking failures on a cow. Future studies should pay particular attention to high-yielding cows and to longer periods of delayed milking. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

The latter design option {{was not included in the}} first year of the study. In that year the space allowance also differed between the sheltered and unsheltered pads. In the second year of the study animals in all three pad designs had the same space allowance. End of Project Repor...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of airborne dust, gases, microbes, endotoxin and bovine epithelial antigens (BEA, BDA 20) was studied in 26 modern, mainly <b>cubicle,</b> cow <b>houses.</b> Air samples of total dust, total spores, endotoxin and bovine epithelial allergens {{were collected on}} membrane filters with portable or piston pumps and analyzed with appropriate methods. Concentrations of gases (ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) were measured with diffusion tubes. Airborne viable spores were collected with a cascade impactor on five selective culture media for the identification of xerophilic, mesophilic and thermotolerant fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes. The geometric mean concentrations of total dust, BEA and BDA 20 were 0. 2 - 1. 9 mg/m 3, 5. 2 - 9. 7 mg/m 3 and 50 - 260 ng/m 3, respectively. The mean concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide were between 2. 8 - 15 ppm and 2200 - 3200 ppm, respectively. The geometric mean of endotoxins was 19 ng/m 3 and the concentrations of fungi were at the 10 1 - 10 3 cfu/m 3 level. In general, the variation in concentrations of total dust, viable fungi and endotoxin was large. The concentrations of total dust and fungi were lower than in earlier studies. Thus new <b>cubicle</b> <b>houses</b> provide a better working environment with regard to airborne hazards than the traditional cow houses. ...|$|R

The breeds differ from each other with technology of lairege and milking, predipping, grazing and herd size. The first was lairage in stanction housing and in-stall milking pipeline system and embodied average values TBC from 10 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 179 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1. The second breed was lairaged in loose grate without littered housing and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5, 5 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 68, 75 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1. The third and the fourth breeds were lairaged in loose <b>cubicle</b> littered <b>housing</b> and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 34, 33 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1.

40|$|In {{order to}} survey the {{behaviour}} of choosing the alley area instead of a cubicle as a lying place (cubicle refusal), a questionnaire {{was sent to the}} 273 dairy farms in Norway known to keep cows in <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> systems. Sixty-six percent of the farmers contacted were included in the study. The median herd size was 18 cows (range 7 – 118). More than 85 % of the herds had sheds providing one or more cubicles per cow. The mean herd occurrence of cubicle refusal was 6 %, but showed great variation (range 0 – 55 %). Regression analysis showed a significant association between rearing heifers in slatted floor pens and an increased cubicle refusal occurrence (p = 0. 02, R 2 = 0. 05), while herd size, use of litter, or cubicle-to-animal ratio were not found to be associated with cubicle refusal. The practice of rearing heifers in slatted floor pens accounted for about one half of the observed cubicle refusal (etiologic fraction = 0. 51) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> {{offers a}} good {{compromise}} between {{the needs of}} the animals and those of the breeders; {{it is one of the}} main housing systems for dairy cows. The recommendations relative to the design and management of <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> are, however, always subject to revision. Special attention is now being given to the improvement of animal comfort, particularly with regards to the lying cow. In this context, the level of comfort is estimated by the duration of the lying time, the frequency of the lying bouts and the ease with which cows are able to get up and lie down. The level of cow comfort is in direct relation to the softness of the floor, to the cubicle dimensions, and to the design of the lateral and frontal partitions. A soft floor can be assured through the use of either multilayer mattresses or a thick litter. Mattresses must be covered with a litter material that absorbs surface moisture and helps to ensure the cleanliness of the stall and udder. To achieve these objectives, the nature of the litter material (straw, sawdust, sand, lime, etc.) appears to be less important than the frequency of renewal. Cubicle floors covered with a thick layer (± 20 cm) of litter seem generally better appreciated by the cows than those equipped with mattresses, and their use is associated with a lower frequency of leg injuries as well as lameness. Sand appears to be a top-grade material for ensuring animal comfort. Nevertheless, the maintenance of a thick layer of litter demands an extra daily labor requirement and the handling of sand as a litter material requires specific equipment. There is a wide range of recommendations on cubicle dimensions due to differences in cow size and the need to take into account the cleanliness of the floor. Lateral partitions must be evaluated for their effectiveness in constraining the animal from spilling out into the neighboring cubicles while at the same time avoiding both injury and difficulties experienced by the cow in getting up and lying down. Finally, frontal partitions must be evaluated regarding their effectiveness in providing sufficient space to allow the cow to thrust its head forward as it stands up. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Skin damages were {{assessed}} at 48 conventional and organic farms with mainly <b>cubicle</b> <b>houses.</b> Scores from 1 – 9 were given depending on {{type and size}} of the damaged skin at 9 locations of the cow: outer hock, inner hock, knee and body all left and right hand side and the neck. Only the highest score per location is recorded and remarks of unusual findings are made separately. The most frequent and most severe affected location is the outer hock followed by the knee. Only 14 percent of all cows did not have any damage, 34 percent had only hairless patches and 24 percent of the cows did have at least one swelling. Correlations of the mean farm score for the left and right hand side are high for the outer hock and low for the body. To have the most impact in advising farmers, assessment should preferably be made {{at the end of the}} housing period, the most threatening period in animal welfare in the Netherlands.

40|$|Infectious hoof {{disorders}} are {{a serious challenge}} for dairy production since they cause pain and discomfort in cows and can compromise the competitiveness of dairy farming. Robot scrapers are capable of frequently removing liquid manure from slatted floors and can contribute to improved hygiene of walkways. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the implications of the robotic cleaning of walking areas for infectious hoof disorders in dairy cattle. A large herd ranging from 1, 247 to 1, 328 Holstein Friesian cows was monitored in two six-month periods in 2012 and in 2013. All animals were <b>housed</b> in a <b>cubicle</b> <b>housing</b> system with slatted floors in which walkways were cleaned using robot scrapers in 2013 but not in 2012. Statistical analysis was carried out with either the Chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test in R. Results indicated that the presence of infectious hoof disorders declined after robot scrapers were used for the cleaning of walkways. While in the first investigation period 648 animals suffered from infectious hoof diseases, in the second period only 340 animals were affected. This study stresses the significance of environmental hygiene to improve hoof health in dairy cattle...|$|R
40|$|In modern dairy housing, {{flooring}} conditions lead to restricted locomotion and claw disorders. Epidemiological {{studies showed}} that housing on concrete floors {{was positively correlated with}} the incidence of lameness and claw disorders. Lameness and claw disorders constitute a significant health and welfare problem in modern dairy farming. Animals experience pain, are limited in their natural behaviour and can less easily meet their biological needs. The research in this thesis is focused on epidemiological and ethological aspects of claw disorders and disturbed locomotion with special emphasises on floor type and implications for animal welfare. The majority of the 1. 5 million dairy cows in The Netherlands are nowadays <b>housed</b> in <b>cubicle</b> <b>houses</b> with concrete stall floors. A small percentage of dairy cows are housed in straw yards. This housing system has a deep litter (straw-bedded) area where animals can rest collectively, accompanied by a concrete walking surface in front of the feed alley. At first, we investigated the claw health of more than 7500 dairy cows on different stall floors. Four-fifths of the cows on a concrete stall floor suffered from one or more claw problems. Reduced figures in affected claws (58...|$|R

40|$|Sixty of the 65 {{dairy farms}} with <b>cubicle</b> <b>houses</b> in the Norwegian county of Oppland were {{included}} in a field study of the management of calving in 1990. The farmers recorded {{the location of the}} cow when giving birth, farmer presence and whether assistance was given during calving, occurrence of suckling, and time after birth when cow and calf were separated. Such data were recorded for a total of 1125 calvings. About 10 % occurred on pasture, while 78 % of the remaining calvings took place in the cubicle-equipped section. Thirteen percent calved in a calving pen, the remaining cows being tethered at the time of calving. Thirty-two percent of the calvings took place in houses lacking a calving pen altogether. Farmers were present during 41 % of the calvings. Suckling most frequently occurred after pasture calvings, and was least frequent after calvings within the cubicle-equipped section of the cowhouse. Injuries to the calf caused by trampling or contact with fittings etc. were rare, and no more common in association with calving in the cubicle-equipped section than with calving taking place with the cow isolated {{from the rest of the}} herd. All calves were removed from their dams within 24 h after birth. </p...|$|R
