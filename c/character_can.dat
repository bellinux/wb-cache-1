5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player <b>character</b> <b>can</b> also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> use {{one type}} of weapon, in {{addition}} to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
50|$|In WildStar, {{players are}} {{able to create a}} <b>character</b> that they <b>can</b> control through their playing session. These <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> move in an open, {{persistent}} world environment. <b>Characters</b> <b>can</b> level from 1 to 50. Gameplay mainly consists of quests, dungeons, and player versus player combat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Characters</b> <b>can</b> also gain {{a number}} of skills. What types of skills the <b>{{character}}s</b> <b>can</b> learn and how easily they can be learned usually depends on if the character creation system is “class based” or “skill based”.|$|R
50|$|Although combat {{plays a part}} in the game, most campaigns {{benefit from}} good {{role-playing}} skills {{on the part of the}} players. Almost all <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> make creative use of spontaneous magic, where <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> invent their own spell from lists of verb-noun combinations.|$|R
5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> learn is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player <b>character</b> <b>can</b> move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
50|$|Ascending allows {{players to}} choose {{to switch to a}} {{different}} faction: Human <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> become any of six human factions, and Athan <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> become any of the six Athan tribes. Characters will have special Ascension skills depending on their factions pre- and post-Ascension.|$|R
25|$|Hand-written <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> be {{recognized}} using SVM.|$|R
50|$|Certain <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> {{turn into}} dire apes.|$|R
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player <b>character</b> <b>can</b> fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> summon a {{specific}} Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to battling on foot, mecha specific to a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be summoned. While each mech has a fixed main pilot, the sub-pilot can be changed, which alters {{the types of}} attacks the mech can perform. After defeating the enemy, the party receives experience points which raise their basic statistics, and skill points which are used to upgrade each character's skill tree, unlocking new skills. New items and accessories can only be gathered either through searching the environment or defeating enemies, as currency and shops are not present.|$|E
50|$|Each human <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> drive vehicles. In early games, each playable <b>character</b> only <b>can</b> use one tank; and in {{recently}} games, one tanks <b>can</b> accommodate multi <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Druids {{and other}} <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> turn into dire boars.|$|R
50|$|Ascended <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> further level up higher to 160.|$|R
5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player <b>character</b> <b>can</b> perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each <b>character</b> <b>can</b> access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E
5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E
5|$|Players take up {{the roles}} of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space {{stations}} and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player <b>character</b> <b>can</b> engage in trade. The player character's primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.|$|E
50|$|The player <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> use Plot Points {{for several}} purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The tab <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> be {{graphically}} {{represented by}} special symbols: ...|$|R
50|$|Druids {{and other}} <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> have dire lions as animal companions.|$|R
5|$|Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game {{designer}} who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered {{a number of}} commercial failures; an irate Barron (Dalip Tahil) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be {{more powerful than the}} protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Jenny uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon) is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend Akashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.|$|E
5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be established with relative certainty.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the <b>character</b> <b>can</b> safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> be {{calculated}} from the binomial coefficient.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the series, various <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> {{speak with}} or {{understand}} animals.|$|R
50|$|Additional playable <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> {{be added}} to the game via paid DLC.|$|R
5|$|The playable <b>character</b> <b>can</b> lead a {{group of}} three {{additional}} allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|The versus mode {{is a free}} {{fighting}} mode where multiple {{players can}} box. The number of players can range from 0–2; both fighters can be controlled by either the computer or by a player. Initially {{there are only two}} playable characters; additional characters become accessible by playing through the story mode. Although the characters are grouped by their boxing weight class, any <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be selected to fight another regardless of weight class. Players can choose from ten locations for the bout. Initially, the only available arena is the Kamogawa Boxing Gym basement. New locations become available once a fight occurs there in the story mode.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} versions, Xenosaga I & II features random encounters within the environment, with enemies only {{appearing in the}} battle arena. During battle, the battle arena is displayed on the DS's top screen while commands and party status is displayed on the bottom screen. Battles are governed by a turn-based battle system similar to the main Xenosaga games. Battles take plates on a 5x6 grid divided between the main party and the enemy party. During their turn, a <b>character</b> <b>can</b> move to any part of their half of the grid.|$|E
50|$|Imprimitivity of <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> lead to missing Euler {{factors in}} their L-functions.|$|R
