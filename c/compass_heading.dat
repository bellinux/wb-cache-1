40|$|A {{fiber optic}} system for {{measuring}} magnetic heading and pitch {{of one or}} more <b>compass</b> <b>heads</b> in a towed acoustic array has been developed as a cooperative effort between engineers at Fiber Dynamics, Inc., and faculty and graduate students at Texas A&M. An unconventional photolithographic process for producing a bar-code pattern on a curved (spherical) surface was successfully implemented. First, an absorption process for applying a thin layer of photoresist uniformly to the gold-coated surface of a glass sphere was perfected. Then, a system for defining the patterns in the metal was assembled. A LabView computer program controlled the system as required to define the bar code pattern in the metal. High-quality bar code patterns were produced on floating spheres by this method. The data acquisition/signal processing system digitized and processed the raw data returning from the <b>compass</b> <b>heads,</b> and computed magnetic heading and pitch from the data. Processing of the signal from a single <b>compass</b> <b>head</b> required readout of a 7 -bit binary code giving coarse heading, using timing information to obtain fine heading, and measuring the apparent width of an analog bar to determine pitch. When monitoring multiple <b>compass</b> <b>heads</b> distributed along the fiber, a time-division demultiplexing technique was used for separating the data from the individual <b>compass</b> <b>heads.</b> For testing the system, the cylindrical sensor head was mounted on a machinist's table for rotating it through 360 ?? in the horizontal plane to vary the heading, and through ?? 10 ?? about a horizontal axis to vary pitch. Measured resolutions of the system were 0. 044 ?? for heading, and 0. 85 ?? for pitch...|$|R

5000|$|The radial {{lines on}} a compass rose are also called rhumbs. The {{expression}} [...] "sailing on a rhumb" [...] {{was used in}} the 16th-19th centuries to indicate a particular <b>compass</b> <b>heading.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A heading indicator, (sometimes {{referred}} to as a [...] "directional gyro (DG)"), which indicates the magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> that the plane's fuselage is pointing towards. The actual direction the plane is flying towards is affected by the wind conditions.|$|E
50|$|When {{tracking}} {{to or from}} an NDB, it is also usual {{that the}} aircraft track on a specific bearing. To do this {{it is necessary to}} correlate the RBI reading with the <b>compass</b> <b>heading.</b> Having determined the drift, the aircraft must be flown so that the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> is the required bearing adjusted for drift {{at the same time as}} the RBI reading is 0 or 180 adjusted for drift. An NDB may also be used to locate a position along the aircraft's current track (such as a radial path from a second NDB or a VOR). When the needle reaches an RBI reading corresponding to the required bearing then the aircraft is at the position. However, using a separate RBI and compass, this requires considerable mental calculation to determine the appropriate relative bearing.|$|E
5000|$|The Sperry Corporation {{developed}} the original gyroscopic autopilot in 1912. The device {{was called a}} “gyroscopic stabilizer apparatus,” and its purpose was to improve stability and control of aircraft.

30|$|Pedestrian dead {{reckoning}} (PDR) uses an {{inertial measurement unit}} (IMU) to detect when a user takes footsteps and how the direction changes between footsteps. The IMU has three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. The user heading change is computed by projecting the gyroscope measurements to the horizontal plane, which is estimated from the accelerometer [3]. It is also possible to use a <b>compass</b> for <b>heading</b> determination [4].|$|R

50|$|It is {{referenced}} {{by using}} either the magnetic <b>compass</b> or <b>heading</b> indicator, two instruments that most aircraft have as standard. Using standard instrumentation, {{it is in}} reference to the local magnetic north direction. True heading is in relation to the lines of meridian (north-south lines). The units are degrees from north in a clockwise direction. North is 0°, east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°.|$|R

50|$|With the {{increased}} sensor offering in smartphones, built-in accelerometers {{can be used}} as a pedometer and built-in magnetometer as a <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> provider. Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) can be used to supplement other navigation methods in a similar way to automotive navigation, or to extend navigation into areas where other navigation systems are unavailable.|$|E
50|$|Early mariners used portolan charts for navigation. These charts showed {{coastline}} with rhumb lines connecting ports. A mariner could navigate by aligning {{the chart}} with a compass {{and following the}} <b>compass</b> <b>heading.</b> Early charts had distorted coastlines because the cartographers {{did not know about}} declination, but the charts still worked because mariners were sailing in straight lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized <b>compass</b> (or <b>heading</b> indicator) is {{to read the}} magnetic compass only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic compass can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic compass while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R

50|$|The {{formula to}} {{determine}} the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> to an NDB station (in a no wind situation) {{is to take the}} relative bearing between the aircraft and the station, and add the magnetic heading of the aircraft; if the total is greater than 360 degrees, then 360 must be subtracted. This gives the magnetic bearing that must be flown: (RB + MH) mod 360 = MB.|$|E

50|$|The CIWS is {{designed}} to be the last line of defense against anti-ship missiles. Due to its design criteria, its effective range is very short relative to the range of modern ASMs, from 1 to 5 nmi km. The gun mount moves at a very high speed and with great precision. The system takes minimal inputs from the ship, making it capable of functioning despite potential damage to the ship. The only inputs required for operation are 440 V AC three-phase electric power at 60 Hz and water (for electronics cooling). For full operation, including some non-essential functions, it also has inputs for true <b>compass</b> ship's <b>heading</b> and 115 V AC for the PASS subsystem.|$|R
50|$|MineCam 3 was {{the first}} to use an {{electronic}} <b>compass</b> for <b>heading</b> display. Tandy (Radio Shack) had developed a device using a flux gate sensor to give x & y components of the Earth's magnetic field which drove the orthogonal windings of a 360 degree mechanical indicator, for use as a car compass. I.A.Recordings discarded the indicator and used the x & y voltages to control the position of a flashing spot added to the video picture. This gave a compass-circle type display on screen. If the x (east-west) signal was inverted, when looking vertically down, the spot appeared to be fixed above a point on the ground as the camera rotated.|$|R
25|$|A compass is also {{subject to}} errors when the compass is {{accelerated}} or decelerated {{in an airplane}} or automobile. Depending on which of the Earth's hemispheres the compass is located and if the force is acceleration or deceleration the compass will increase or decrease the indicated <b>heading.</b> <b>Compasses</b> that include compensating magnets are especially prone to these errors, since accelerations tilt the needle, bringing it closer or further from the magnets.|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{versions}} did {{not allow}} great circle navigation at latitudes higher than 60 degrees (North or South), and at around 75-80 degrees North/South it became impossible to [...] "fly" [...] closer to the poles, whichever <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> was followed. This problem is solved in FSX. Users may now navigate through any great circle as well as [...] "fly" [...] across both Arctic and Antarctic. This version also adds the option to have a transparent panel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Civil Aeronautics Board. Eyewitness and other evidence suggested Flight 3 proceeded from its departure in Las Vegas along essentially a straight line, 10° right of the designated airway, into high terrain that rose above their flight altitude of 8000 ft. This indicated to investigators that the crew was not using radio navigation to follow the airway (defined by the low frequency range), which would have provided them safe obstacle clearance, but was instead using a <b>compass</b> <b>heading.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sailing ships {{generally}} had {{two kinds}} of compasses: steering compasses, two {{of which would be}} mounted in a binnacle in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a bearing compass that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer Joao de Castro was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two steering compasses themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together. The [...] "bearing compass" [...] was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name [...] "standard compass" [...] It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the [...] "steering compass" [...] so the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> shown on the [...] "steering compass" [...] would be different to the <b>compass</b> <b>heading</b> shown on the [...] "standard compass".|$|E
5000|$|For {{underwater}} vehicles, {{the bottom}} tracking feature {{can be used}} as an important component in the navigation systems. In this case the velocity of the vehicle is combined with an initial position fix, <b>compass</b> or gyro <b>heading,</b> and data from the acceleration sensor. The sensor suite is combined (typically by use of a Kalman filter) to estimate the position of the vehicle. This may help to navigate submarines, autonomous, and remotely operated underwater vehicles ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{navigation}} systems today {{use some}} type of <b>compass</b> to determine <b>heading</b> direction. Using the earthÕs magnetic field, electronic compasses based on magnetoresistive (MR) sensors can electrically resolve better than 0. 1 degree rotation. Discussion of a simple 8 -point compass will be described using MR sensors. Methods for building a one degree compass using MR sensors will also be discussed. Compensation techniques are shown to correct for compass tilt angles and nearby ferrous material disturbances...|$|R
60|$|For a {{whole week}} Madeline held clinics where she expounded the {{scientific}} method of modern bread-making. She got {{a good deal of}} enjoyment out of her lectures. What boys these great hulking fellows were! She saw through their simple ruses. Some of them were grave as deacons; others wore expressions important enough to have fitted the faces of statesmen signing government treaties. These cowboys were children; they needed to be governed; but in order to govern them they had to be humored. A more light-hearted, fun-loving crowd of boys could not have been found. And they were grown men. Stillwell explained that the exuberance of spirits lay in the difference in their fortunes. Twenty-seven cowboys, in relays of nine, worked eight hours a day. That had never been heard of before in the West. Stillwell declared that cowboys from all points of the <b>compass</b> would <b>head</b> their horses toward Her Majesty's Rancho.|$|R
