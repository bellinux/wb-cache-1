5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

5|$|Clock {{towers in}} Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's <b>Clock</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of}} St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.|$|E

25|$|To {{compensate}} for the discrepancy, the frequency standard on board each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543MHz instead of 10.23MHz. Since the atomic <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment.

5|$|There {{has been}} a <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt (3,136lb/1,422kg) in C. The {{original}} five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune for {{every day of the}} week. The church is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|Ohio State {{controlled}} {{most of the}} secondquarter. Their firstscore was a 45-yd {{field goal}} by Josh Huston followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to Santonio Holmes to tie the score at 10–10. They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston; the first was from 36yards and the second was from 25yards. Following the kick-off, Texas took possession of the ball at their own 31yard-line with only 31seconds remaining in the first half. Young began the drive by throwing a 36-yard pass to the Ohio State 18yard-line and then the receiver ran out of bounds to stop the clock with 20seconds to play. On the next play, Young rushed for six yards and was tackled in-bounds, causing Texas to use a time out with 12seconds on the <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> second down, OSU's A. J. Hawk sacked Vince Young for a loss of 8yards, forcing Texas to take another time-out with sevenseconds remaining. Texas put in David Pino to complete a 37-yard kick with twoseconds left, making the score 16–13 in favor of Ohio State. Texas kicked off and time expired on the ensuing 18-yard return by Erick Jackson.|$|E

5|$|The Ravens {{played the}} Patriots {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} season in the 2012 AFC championship game, which the Ravens lost 23–20. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dove into the end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans {{in the corner of the}} end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff.

5|$|On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers {{failed to}} {{recognize}} the Bears' zone defense, having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed {{on his shoulder and}} injured his left collarbone, and was replaced by Seneca Wallace {{for the remainder of the}} game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7–3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Forté scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17–10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Forté ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27–20 victory for the Bears.|$|E

In the Hafele-Keating experiment, {{there was a slight}} increase in gravitational potential due to altitude that tended to speed the clocks back up. Since the aircraft flew at roughly the same altitude in both directions, this effect was approximately the same for the two planes, but nevertheless it caused a difference in comparison to the <b>clocks</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|R
5|$|The {{first play}} of the drive was a six-yard run by Linton, and it was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler. Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play, when he caught a short pass for a first down from Keldorf. Now at the Hokies' 31, Linton ran straight ahead for a two-yard gain. Linton's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf, but rather than punt, the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down. The fourth-down pass fell incomplete, and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30-yard line. Clark completed a six-yard pass to Parker, then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> third down, Clark completed a nine-yard pass to Michael Stuewe for a first down. A first-down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense, but on second down, Clark completed a pass to Stuewe for a first down at the Tar Heels 40-yard line. After a deep pass went incomplete, Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball {{for the second time in}} the first half. The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field. North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into scoring position before the end of the half, but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 220 lead.|$|E
5|$|On Penn State's {{first play}} from {{scrimmage}} {{in the second}} half, Zach Zwinak fumbled, and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points. After another Penn State drive stalled, Michigan drove down the field, and {{was faced with a}} third-and-short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day, and Michigan punted. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they turned the ball over again, this time via a Hackenberg interception; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal. When Penn State got the ball back, they ran a sustained, balanced drive (4 run plays, 5 pass plays, 50 yards) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game (as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45-yard field goal to go up by 4 points. Michigan promptly drove right back down the field, and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time, 27–24. In the fourth quarter, Ficken attempted a 47-yard field goal, but missed, and Penn State's 10-play 45-yard drive came up empty. Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Gardner to Funchess, putting them on top by 10 with 10:28 to go. On Penn State's ensuing drive, they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass, so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7; Sam Ficken kicked a 43-yard field goal. Michigan tried to run out the <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> their next drive, and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts. Though they were at one point within field goal range, they committed a five-yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range, and they had to punt. Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20-yard line. Needing a touchdown to tie the game, Penn State's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field, but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14-yard gain. The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards, and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Michigan then called their final timeout. Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed, and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left. Michigan took the ball at their own 35, drove it to the other 35, and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52-yard field goal, which he missed short. Penn State got the ball with two seconds left, but downed the ball to send the game into overtime.|$|E
