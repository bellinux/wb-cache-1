50|$|Other {{names for}} jicama include Mexican potato, ahipa, saa got, and <b>Chinese</b> <b>potato.</b> In Ecuador and Peru, the name jicama {{is used for}} the {{unrelated}} yacón or Peruvian ground apple, a plant of the sunflower family whose tubers are also used as food.The jícama vine can reach a height of 4-5 m given suitable support. Its root can attain lengths of up to 2 m and weigh up to 20 kg. The heaviest jícama root ever recorded weighed 23 kg and was found in 2010 in the Philippines (where they are called singkamas).Jicama is frost-tender and requires 9 months without frost for a good harvest of large tubers or to grow it commercially. It is worth growing in cooler areas that have at least five months without frost, as it will still produce tubers, but they will be smaller.Warm, temperate areas with at least five months without frost can start seed 8 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost. Bottom heat is recommended, as the seeds require warm temperatures to germinate, so the pots will need to be kept in a warm place. Jicama is unsuitable for areas with a short growing season unless cultured in a greenhouse. Growers in tropical areas can sow seed at any time of the year. Those in subtropical areas should sow seed once the soil has warmed in the spring.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate if differences in vertical distribution of soil nitrogen (Ninorg) affected root growth and N uptake of a variety of horticultural crops. Two field experiments were performed each over 2 years with shallow or deep placement of soil Ninorg obtained by management of cover crops. Vegetable crops of leek, <b>potato,</b> <b>Chinese</b> cabbage, beetroot, summer squash and white cabbage reached root depths of 0. 5, 0. 7, 1. 3, 1. 9, 1. 9 and more than 2. 4 m, respectively, at harvest, and showed rates of root depth penetration from 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm day) 1 C) 1. Shallow placement of soil Ninorg resulted in greater N uptake in the shallow-rooted leek and potato. Deep placement of soil Ninorg resulted in greater rates of root depth penetration in the deep-rooted Chinese cabbage, summer squash and white cabbage, which increased their depth by 0. 2 – 0. 4 m. The root frequency was decreased in shallow soil layers (white cabbage) and increased in deep soil layers (Chinese cabbage, summer squash and white cabbage). The influence of vertical distribution of soil Ninorg on root distribution and capacity for depletion of soil Ninorg was much less than the effect of inherent differences between species. Thus, knowledge about differences in root growth between species should be used when designing crop rotations with high N use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Starches {{isolated}} from 3 <b>Chinese</b> sweet <b>potato</b> varieties (XuShu 18, SuShu 2, and SuShu 8) differed in granule size and {{particle size distribution}} {{as well as in}} protein, lipid and phosphorus contents but the amylose contents were similar for these starches (19. 3 - 20. 0 %). The pasting behavior, swelling pattern, and syneresis properties were investigated and found to vary. On comparison, the physicochemical properties of the sweet potato starches rather differ from those of potato and mung bean starches. The quality of the starch noodle made from SuShu 8 starch was well comparable to that made from mung bean starch, and better than that made from SuShu 2 and XuShu 18 starches as evaluated by both instrumental and sensory analysis. Correlation between starch noodle quality and gel properties of the original starches was established {{in order to be able}} to predict the suitability of a starch for starch noodle manufacture. It was found that differently sized granule fractions showed a difference in ash, amylose and phosphorus content, as well as in gel firmness and freeze-thaw stability. The small size (< 20 µm) granule fractions were found to be more suitable for starch noodle making and the qualities of both dried and cooked starch noodles made from these fractions were significantly better than those made from their original starches and much better than those made from the large size granule fractions. Sweet potato and potato starches and their derivatives (acetylated and hydroxypropylated) were also evaluated for the ability to manufacture high quality White Salted Noodle (WSN) by replacing the commonly used wheat flour up to 20 %. It was found that only the use of acetylated starches could significantly improve WSN quality resulting in decreasing cooking loss, and increasing softness, stretchability and slipperiness. The cold peak breakdown (CPBD) of the composite flour, as measured in 1. 5 % NaCl solution, showed a significant correlation with the cooking loss, stretch stiffness and stretchability of WSN. Moreover, acetylated starch from potato and sweet potatoes were studied with respect to the degree of substitution (DS) and acetyl group distribution in differently sized granule fractions. The DS of the fractionated starches increased with decreasing starch granule size dimension. The DS of the amylopectin populations of differently sized granule fractions showed the same trends as the original starches, while the DS of the amylose populations were quite constant. It was confirmed that the acetylation only occurred in the outer lamellae of the crystalline region, but took place in all amorphous regions of starch granules. The acetyl group distribution is more heterogeneous in the amylose populations {{isolated from}} small size granule fractions...|$|R

When it was subjected to adverse circumstances such as high population density, nutrient depletion and UV light, it would secrete one or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins which are antimicrobial and toxic proteins inhibit growth of the related bacteria strains. There {{is no doubt that}} bacteriocins produced from Pcc not only provides a biological method for soft-rot disease of plants but also not easily causes environmental pollution. In this studies, the genes that are related to bacteriocin production is a pivotal factor to solve problem about soft-rot disease of many economical crops. From previous studies, low-molecular-weight bacteriocin Carocin S 1 had already been confirmed and reported that it was exported through the bacterial flagellum type III secretion system. The bacterial flagellum secretion system consisting of more than 20 different proteins is a rotary device for motility. Interestingly, The sequence of the gene related to LMWB is homologous to proteins of the type III secretion system injectisome. It seems that LMWB produced from Pcc not simply contribute to the bacterial flagellum type III secretion system. In this study, flagellin gene (fliG) of Pcc (H-rif- 8 - 6 was used in this study) was separated by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pET 32 a expression vector. The recombinant flagellin was purified by affinity purification using Ni 2 + -Sepharose resin. Furthermore, the mouse and New Zealand White rabbit were immunized with both flagellin FliC and FliG respectively to obtain polyclonal antiserum.

40|$|The Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC), {{created in}} 1971 and based in Taiwan, was {{originally}} {{the brainchild of}} the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). From the beginning, the fundamental goal of AVRDC has been to increase the production and quality of vegetables through improved varieties, increased disease and pest resistance/tolerance, increased heat tolerance and better cultural practices. Research concentrated initially on six vegetables: tomato, soy bean, mungbean, sweet potato, white <b>potato</b> and <b>Chinese</b> cabbage. Sweet <b>potato</b> and white potato were later dropped from the research programme and replaced {{over a period of}} time by three other major crops: pepper, alliums (onion, shallot, garlic) and eggplant. Genetic resources AVRDC collects and stores as many cultivars of its mandated crops as possible. Its Genetic Resources and Seed Unit (GRSU), constructed in 1984, is a large cold-storage facility capable of keeping some varieties of seed viable for as long as a century. By September 1995, GRSU had a total of 37, 938 accessions of its principal crops and 5, 404 accessions of non-prinicipal but regionally important crops. The unit holds the world's base collection of mungbean and pepper. The material provides a broad genetic base for vegetable breeding and safety backups against the risk of a limited and highly uniform gene pool. Requests for seed samples of material in the collections as well as information about breeding lines are regularly received. Ongoing research aims to establish sets of core collections and to generate information that will lead to better management of vegetable genetic resources. This includes the use of statistical, cytological, biochemical, and molecular tools in the analysis of genetic diversity and genetic changes at different phases of germplasm maintenance. The germplasm is made available to researchers. One of AVRDC's major achievements is the development of tomato varieties that yield well under hot, humid conditions. A rich source of vitamin C, tomato is a popular cash crop for small farmers and home gardeners throughout much of the world. The principal problems with tomato in the hot, humid tropics are poor fruit set and disease. The challenge for AVRDC's tomato breeders was to combine heat tolerance and disease resistance with desirable culture and eating characteristics. Today the GRSU's active collection of cultivated tomato and wild relatives is one of the largest in the world. Application of biotechnology Molecular techniques are used to understand the biology of the principal vegetables at the molecular level, in order to genetically engineer varieties that might otherwise take years to complete using conventional plant breeding methods. Biotechnology has assisted AVRDC plant breeders to produce mungbean varieties which are highly resistant to bruchids, a major pest of stored beans throughout the world. Current activities include tissue culture and transformation, pest and stress control, quality improvement and genetic mapping. Biotechnological research is one of the primary areas in which AVRDC collaborates with universities worldwide. Spreading the word To bring AVRDC closer to its partners and respond more effectively to differences in needs and capabilities among regions, the Center has established regional networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Southern Africa. In 1992 AVRDC signed an agreement with the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR). to be the executing agency for the Collaborative Network for Vegetable Research and Development in Southern Africa (CONVERDS). There are ten participating countries in the region: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The network is based at Horti, Tengeru near Arusha, Tanzama. Through its International Cooperation Programme, AVRDC assists in strengthening and enhancing national vegetable research and development capacity through information and communication services, collaborative research, technology transfer and institution building. AVRDC has recognized the very important role it can play in the development of human resources for vegetable research and extension, both through its training programmes and through the development of training materials. The Center's aim is to create a critical mass of well-trained and motivated researchers within the national agricultural programmes of developing countries themselves. Good information exchange is also vital to the development of national capacity. The Center operates a Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) service for national programmes. It produces and publishes commodity-specific quarterly updates which, abstracted from the latest worldwide horticultural information sources on these commodities, are available at no charge from AVRDC. Copies of selected articles from the SDI listings can be obtained on request. In addition a Tropical Vegetable Information Service (TVIS) project has established a computer retrieval system using the software MINISIS. The AVRDC library is a major repository of information on vegetable improvement and the Center is a leading publisher and distributor of vegetable research information. Publications from the Office of Publications and Communications (OPC) are distributed to more than 600 libraries and to individuals in 160 countries. The Center's bi-annual newsletter Centerpoint contains up-to-date news on the Center's courses, conferences, research and projects.
