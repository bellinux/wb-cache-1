2500|$|In Artemis Fowl, {{which is}} set two years after those events, the 12-year-old Artemis decides to regain the Fowl fortune by {{following}} leads on the Internet that refer to an underground world of fairies collectively called the People. Artemis manages to blackmail {{a member of the}} People into giving him what they call [...] "the Book" [...] which is like their Bible, holding all their secrets, <b>customs,</b> <b>rules,</b> and history. This leads him to ransom Lower Elements Police (LEP) Captain Holly Short for a portion of the People's gold. Artemis and Holly agree a deal whereby Holly retains half the ransom fee, while Artemis gets one wish from Holly and gets to keep {{the other half of the}} gold. After recovering Holly, the LEP attempt to permanently eliminate Artemis by setting off a biological weapon, but are thwarted when Artemis discovers a way around their attack (something not even the People had been able to develop).|$|E
6000|$|There are {{a hundred}} and forty of his letters to Mr. Freshfield on Oak Farm alone. Let us note in passing what is, I think, a not {{unimportant}} biographic fact. These circumstances brought him into close and responsible contact with a side of the material interests {{of the country that}} was new to him. At home he had been bred in the atmosphere of commerce. At the board of trade, in the reform of the tariff, in connection with the Bank act and in the growth of the railway system, he had been well trained in high economics. Now he came to serve an arduous apprenticeship in the motions and machinery of industrial life. The labour was immense, prolonged, uncongenial; but it completed his knowledge of the <b>customs,</b> <b>rules,</b> maxims, and currents of trade and it bore good fruit in future days at the exchequer. He manfully and deliberately took up the burden as if the errors had been his own, and as if the financial sacrifice that he was called to make both now and later were matter of direct and inexorable obligation. These, indeed, are the things in life that test whether a man be made of gold or clay. 'The weight,' he writes to his father (June 16, 1849), 'of the private demands upon my mind has been such, since the Oak Farm broke down, as frequently to disqualify me for my duties in the House of Commons.' The load even tempted him, along with the working of other considerations, to think of total withdrawal from parliament and public life. Yet without a trace of the frozen stoicism or cynical apathy that sometimes passes muster for true resignation, he kept himself nobly free from vexation, murmur, repining, and complaint. Here is a moving passage from a letter of the time to Mrs. Gladstone:-- ...|$|E
