I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E

He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with Thomas Jefferson, who used this advice when founding the University of Virginia. Jefferson and Priestley became close, {{and when he had}} completed his General History of the Christian Church, he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that [...] "it is now only that I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me." ...|$|E

500|$|The peak of {{his season}} came at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where {{he became the first}} person in Eritrean {{sporting}} history to win an Olympic medal. Zersenay took the bronze in the 10,000 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece behind Kenenisa Bekele, and Sileshi Sihine. His performance of 27:22.57 represented a dramatic improvement as he had beaten his previous best by ten seconds, despite unfavourably hot conditions. Zersenay refused to politicise his medal win behind his Ethiopian counterparts, stating: [...] "we have always been friends with the Ethiopians. Now we are a nation...I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am very happy." [...] The Eritrean-born runner Meb Keflezighi, representing the United States, won silver in the marathon a few days later, highlighting the country's improving standards. Zersenay finished his first Olympics by reaching another event final: he took seventh place in the men's 5000 metres race, confirming his position as a world-class runner.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{continued}} the educational projects {{that had been}} important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a [...] "Northumberland Academy" [...] and donating his library to the fledging institution.

[...] Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its [...] "corruptions", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772–74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, 2002, at UFC 40, {{nearly four}} years after the {{confrontation}} at UFC 19, Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight {{for the first time and}} cut too much weight, weighing in at 201lbs, 4lbs under the 205lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion; [...] "Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter.
