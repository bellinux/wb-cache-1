50|$|A {{type rating}} is a {{regulating}} agency's certification {{of an airplane}} pilot to fly a certain aircraft type that requires additional training {{beyond the scope of}} the initial license and aircraft class training. What aircraft require a type rating is decided by the local aviation authority. In many countries pilots of single-engined aircraft under a certain maximum weight (5,700 kg or 12,500 lb, typically) do not require a type rating for each model, all or most such aircraft being covered by one <b>class</b> <b>rating</b> instead. There are exceptions to this, e.g. under Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations the piston version of the Piper Malibu does require its own type rating. In New Zealand and South Africa there is no <b>class</b> <b>rating,</b> each aircraft model requiring its own rating. Countries which have adopted the <b>class</b> <b>rating</b> system for small aircraft typically require additional training and license endorsement for complexity features such as conventional undercarriage (tailwheels), variable-pitch propellers, retractable undercarriage, etc.|$|E
