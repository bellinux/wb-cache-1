25|$|The {{young woman}} is rude and {{insulting}} to both Gashade and Coley. She refuses {{to tell them}} her name. The three stop briefly in <b>Crosstree.</b> Gashade learns that Coin was seen there only {{a day or two}} before. As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black, Billy Spear (Nicholson), who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.|$|E

2500|$|A {{courtesy}} flag (or courtesy ensign) is flown by a visiting ship in foreign waters as {{a token of}} respect. It is often a small (that is, smaller than the ship's own national ensign) national maritime flag of the host country, although there are countries (such as Malta) where the national, rather than the maritime flag is correct. [...] The flag is customarily worn at the foremasthead of multi-masted vessels, the dockside yardarm or <b>crosstree</b> of the mast of single-masted vessels, while the house flag would be outboard. [...] It may be flown from the jackstaff of vessels without masts.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: As well as tops, <b>crosstrees</b> {{will also}} have futtock shrouds. Because <b>crosstrees</b> are smaller, there is less need for {{alternatives}} to the futtock shrouds as a way past them. This sailor is about to climb out round {{the edges of the}} <b>crosstrees</b> using the futtock shrouds.|$|R

One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore. He would think nothing of blowing me up, {{so long as he}} obeyed orders." ...|$|R
2500|$|The trestle is of oak. The {{crosstrees}} are [...] long, {{of normal}} section. The main post is [...] in length, and [...] square {{at its base}} and [...] diameter at the top. The underside of the lower <b>crosstree</b> is [...] above ground level. The roundhouse is of brick, with a boarded roof covered in tarred felt. A pair of underdrift millstones {{is located on the}} upper floor of the roundhouse, these were driven via a portable steam engine in times of calm. The roundhouse was originally built as a single-storey structure, it and the mill being raised a storey at a later date.|$|E
60|$|Planting the oar for a mast was no easy matter. Of {{course we}} {{did not attempt to}} do it until we had made the boom, and also a small <b>crosstree</b> at the top, from which we {{suspended}} the sail, not very artistically, it is true, but in such a fashion that it drew very well.|$|E
60|$|He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, {{stripped}} and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on <b>crosstree,</b> Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared {{into heaven}} and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth {{on the right}} hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.|$|E
50|$|The oak trestle is {{composed}} of two <b>crosstrees,</b> four quarterbars and the main post. The <b>crosstrees</b> are 22 ft long and 12 in square in section, as are the quarterbars. The main post is 16 ft high, and tapers from 29 in square at the base to 16 in diameter at the Samson Head. The whole is housed in a roundhouse of 22 ft diameter with 9 ft high walls.|$|R

60|$|I recall {{these things}} {{with a certain}} degree of feeling, because not less than a week later this poor fellow was {{discovered}} by one of our company swinging from the <b>crosstree</b> of the tent, a ghastly corpse. There was something inexplicable in the deed. No one could account for it. He seemed not to be a man of deep feeling. And one of the last things he uttered in my hearing was a coarse jest which I did not like and to which I made no reply.|$|E
60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr leapt {{instantly}} to {{his great}} height and waved a long green scarf. From {{one of the}} galleys behind the screen of rocks a trumpet rang out in immediate answer to that signal; {{it was followed by}} the shrill whistles of the bo'suns, and that again by the splash and creak of oars, as the two larger galleys swept out from their ambush. The long armoured poops were a-swarm with turbaned corsairs, their weapons gleaming in the sunshine; a dozen at least were astride of the <b>crosstree</b> of each mainmast, all armed with bows and arrows, and the ratlines {{on each side of the}} galleys were black with men who swarmed there like locusts ready to envelop and smother their prey.|$|E
60|$|Both he and Johnson {{would have}} killed Wolf Larsen at the {{slightest}} opportunity, but the opportunity never came. Wolf Larsen was too wise for that, and, besides, they had no adequate weapons. With their fists alone they had no chance whatever. Time and again he fought it out with Leach who fought back always, like a wildcat, tooth and nail and fist, until stretched, exhausted or unconscious, on the deck. And he was never averse to another encounter. All the devil that was in him challenged the devil in Wolf Larsen. They had but to appear on deck at the same time, when they would be at it, cursing, snarling, striking; and I have seen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation. Once he threw his heavy sheath-knife, missing Wolf Larsen’s throat by an inch. Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen <b>crosstree.</b> It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship, but the sharp point of the spike, whistling seventy-five feet through the air, barely missed Wolf Larsen’s head as he emerged from the cabin companion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid deck-planking. Still another time, he stole into the steerage, possessed himself of a loaded shot-gun, and was making a rush for the deck with it when caught by Kerfoot and disarmed.|$|E
50|$|The trestle {{is formed}} of two <b>crosstrees,</b> four quarterbars and a main post. The main post is 1 ft {{diameter}} at the crown tree.|$|R

50|$|The {{crosstrees}} are 24 ft long. The upper <b>crosstree</b> is 10 in {{square in}} section {{and the lower}} <b>crosstree</b> is 13 in by 12 in. The upper <b>crosstree</b> is made of two pieces of timber, scarf jointed in the vertical plane, and with an iron plate bolted under the join. There is also an oak plate {{on one side of}} the <b>crosstree,</b> which is bolted to the <b>crosstree,</b> a pair of spacers being used as the scarf is within the horns of the main post. The lower <b>crosstree</b> bears a date of 1869, which is probably the date the roundhouse was erected. The main post is 20 ft in length, and 30 in by 29 in in section at its base. It is fitted with a cast-iron Samson head by Christie and Norris, the Chelmsford millwrights.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>crosstree</b> {{serves to}} spread {{another level of}} holding ropes on a fresh wider spar so as to provide support to the next mast top section. Effectively, the <b>crosstree</b> allows to extend the height, mount yet another layer of sail shrouds and option more wind power to the ships. The <b>crosstree</b> also serves to spread the shroud tops.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Crosstree</b> {{serves as}} a fresh base to spread {{the next level of}} {{supporting}} [...] guy ropes, thereby providing a stable height extension to the masts. Without the <b>crosstree,</b> the ship's mast would have been severely limited in height, in relation to the width [...] (beam) of the ship.|$|E
50|$|Mona's Queen was {{virtually}} identical to her older sister, King Orry. The only {{difference was that}} the main mast <b>crosstrees</b> on Mona’s Queen were higher than those on King Orry.|$|R
60|$|The first {{lieutenant}} {{swung his}} telescope {{over his shoulder}} and mounted the rigging. When he came to the top-gallant <b>crosstrees</b> he sat down and gazed into the distance through his glass.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the recent}} restoration, the lower <b>crosstree</b> had been clamped at a quarterbar joint. The {{crosstrees}} stand within 3 ft of ground level. The brick piers that the crosstrees rest on had been tarred, and the crosstrees themselves painted white, {{evidence that the}} mill was built as an open trestle mill. Both crosstrees are of oak, the upper being 24 ft long and 13 by 12 in in section, whilst the lower <b>crosstree</b> is 12 by 11 in (305 by 292 mm) at the ends, thickening to 13+1/2 in at the centre. The post is 17 ft long, and 27 in square at its base.|$|E
50|$|A {{handguard}} (also {{known as}} the quillons, crossguard or <b>crosstree)</b> is {{also a part of}} a sword or knife that is just above the handle. It protects the wielder's hands from an opponent's blade should it happen to slide down the blade.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{night when}} she anchors she must have two head lights, one at the <b>crosstrees</b> and one at the topmast head. I shall {{be on the lookout}} for her, and we will take some blue lights and some red lights with us. Every night I will burn a blue light, say at nine o'clock. A man in the <b>crosstrees</b> will make it out twenty miles away, and that will tell them where I am, and that I don't want them. If I burn a red light it will be a signal for the yacht to come and pick me up." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned his}} face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the <b>crosstrees,</b> homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. + ...|$|R
60|$|The ship’s {{course was}} at once changed, and every rag of sail put upon her. The first {{lieutenant}} climbed to the upper <b>crosstrees,</b> and after a long look through his telescope returned to deck.|$|R
50|$|The body of {{the mill}} {{measures}} just under 18 ft by 11 ft in plan. The crowntree is 22 in square in section. It receives a 10 in diameter pintle projecting {{from the top of}} the main post. The side girts are 9 in by 20 in in section at the ends, thickening to 22 in at the <b>crosstree.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{group is}} active in two areas: Life {{sciences}} and asset management, including real estate. Chaired by Ernesto Bertarelli, Waypoint is headquartered in Geneva, with offices in London, Jersey, Boston and Luxembourg. Waypoint's interests include Kedge Capital, an investment management group specializing in hedge funds, private equity and real estate; a new asset management business, Northill Capital; and a UK real estate investment fund, <b>Crosstree.</b>|$|E
50|$|The trestle is of oak, {{with the}} main post thought to be of sweet chestnut. The {{crosstrees}} are 24 ft long, 12 in square at the ends, thickening to 15 in by 13 in at the centre. The underside of the lower <b>crosstree</b> is 3 ft above ground level. The main post is nearly 23 ft in length, 25 in square at its base and 22 in diameter at the top. The quarterbars are 12 in by 10 in in section. The roundhouse is of brick, with a boarded roof covered in tarred felt.|$|E
60|$|They sailed on {{the port}} tack {{for an hour and}} then came round again. The {{brigantine}} could no longer be seen from the deck, and could only just be made out from the <b>crosstrees.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Crosstrees</b> {{were added}} to her {{mainmast}} in 1939.The wheel house was originally open but was enclosed in 1948. A cafeteria was installed in 1955 and the following year she was converted from coal to oil burning and was fitted with radar in 1960.|$|R
60|$|Danny, {{in his big}} boots, trotted {{rather than}} climbed up the main rigging (this {{consumed}} Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the reeling <b>crosstrees,</b> and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black buoy-flag {{on the shoulder of}} a mile-away swell.|$|R
