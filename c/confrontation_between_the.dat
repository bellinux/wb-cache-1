5|$|Van Damme {{redesigned}} {{his final}} fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. Van Damme {{was unhappy with}} the scripted fight, which had his character running away and only a brief <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pair. He felt that the audience wanted a longer fight scene between the two actors.|$|E
5|$|In early 1962 Nasser again {{attempted}} to wrest {{control of the}} military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser {{for the first time and}} secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> military and his civilian government. According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda Straits Crisis was {{a two-week}} <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom and Indonesia over {{the passage of}} the Illustrious-class {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious through the Sunda Strait, a major waterway separating the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, occurring between August and September 1964. The incident was part of the larger Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, an armed conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia (with the military support of Britain) over the formation of the latter as an independent state.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, Nadars, then an {{aspiring}} business community, established their commercial {{base in the}} town. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Nadars’ rapid rise as a business community and pursuit for higher social status caused resentment in higher castes. The mutual <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot {{in the center of the}} city (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899.|$|E
5|$|Hans Dominik {{became the}} Jaunde post {{commander}} in 1904. For {{the next six}} years, Atangana accompanied him on at least fifteen administrative patrols and probative excursions. Atangana proved an astute diplomat, in one case negotiating {{with a group of}} rebellious Manguissa and thus averting a <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tribesmen and the Germans. Atangana helped open posts in such wide-ranging places as Bafia, Abong-Mbang, Mouloudou, Ngaoundéré, Garoua, and Maroua. The Germans largely kept themselves segregated from their African subjects, but Dominik and Atangana defied these standards and grew close, even dining together in the same tent on occasion. Back in Jaunde, Atangana gained responsibilities valued by the regime, such as overseeing a poll tax in October 1908.|$|E
50|$|Though remote, {{the region}} gained some notice in 2004-2006 during the Luna incident, in which {{policies}} regarding an orca separated from its pod led to <b>confrontations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the borders Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations.|$|R

50|$|During the years, as the {{two teams}} {{became more and more}} successful, they gained large {{supporter}} bases. <b>The</b> <b>confrontations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> clubs and their fans became commonplace and often resulted in tense encounters on the pitch and hooligan clashes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fans off the pitch.|$|R
5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and the United States {{over the}} Soviet {{deployment}} of nuclear missiles in Cuba.

50|$|There {{have been}} several <b>confrontations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two nations over North Korean clandestine {{activity}} in Japan besides the abductions including drug smuggling, marine poaching, and spying.

5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an Islamic headscarf. In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, diplomats and legal experts.|$|E
5|$|The decisive <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Libyan-FAP {{forces and}} the Chadian regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, {{the capital of the}} BET. The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp {{fighting}} to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} Procopius in the De Bello Gothico (the section of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, {{which may have been}} voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis (Serbia) and Singidunum (Belgrade). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to set them against in the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|Between {{conventions}} in April 1775, Randolph, who {{was both}} the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and President of the Virginia Conventions, negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder {{removed from the}} Williamsburg arsenal to a British warship during the Gunpowder Incident, which was a <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg {{to take his place}} as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> government and the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against {{the wishes of the}} government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
50|$|The Council had a {{disagreement}} with Pope Cyril V of Alexandria {{at the start}} of his pontificate, which was resolved in the Pontiff's favour. This was followed by several <b>confrontations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two parties, primarily because of the Pope's objection about the interference of the Council in the church's matters.|$|R
50|$|In April 2001, Quebec City {{played host to}} the Summit of the Americas {{where the}} Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was discussed.

25|$|Clashes erupted at the Kurdish Mountain area in Latakia Governorate. A {{series of}} <b>confrontations</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Army and the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) {{resulted}} in multiple casualties.

5|$|On 13 April 1923, {{during a}} {{procession}} by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event {{resulted in a}} <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, {{on the first of}} May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|Not {{everything}} was going well with the Confederate advance. By 9:30a.m., as the lead Union brigades were falling back, Nathan Bedford Forrest urged Bushrod Johnson to launch an all-out attack on the disorganized troops. Johnson was too cautious to approve of a general assault, but he did agree to keep the infantry moving slowly forward. Two hours into the battle, Gen. Pillow realized that Buckner's wing was not attacking alongside his. After a <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two generals, Buckner's troops moved out and, combined with the right flank of Pillow's wing, hit W. H. L. Wallace's brigade. The Confederates took control of Forge Road and a key section of Wynn's Ferry Road, opening a route to Nashville, but Buckner's delay provided time for Lew Wallace's men to reinforce McClernand's retreating forces before they were completely routed. Despite Grant's earlier orders, Wallace's units moved to the right with Thayer's brigade, giving McClernand's men time to regroup and gather ammunition from Wallace's supplies. The 68th Ohio was left behind to protect the rear.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{visit the}} Ghats as Sahil had planned. He takes Jai to an {{overhanging}} cliff, with a scenic view of Mahabaleshwar, {{where the two}} share a quiet moment. On returning to their resort, Jai offers {{to pay for the}} trip's expenses, to which Sahil agrees after some initial reluctance. The two return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction right before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts Jai and his clients and embarrasses the latter with a romantic gesture in front of everyone. This leads to a <b>confrontation</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of coming out to the world. On the contrary, Jai blames him for not reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to withdraw from him, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. He apologises and tells Sahil that he doesn't have to stay any longer if he doesn't want to. However, Sahil decides to stay, but refrains from having a conversation with Jai.|$|E
