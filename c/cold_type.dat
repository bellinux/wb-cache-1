2500|$|For {{a number}} of years after its introduction, the Selectric Composer was {{considered}} to be a highly desirable, powerful desk-sized <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> setting system, affordable by small businesses and organizations. It was usually leased, including a service contract for the skilled labor required to fix and adjust it. [...] The Selectric Composer was accorded respect and affection among small publishers, unrivaled until the appearance of the Apple Macintosh, laser printer, and desktop publishing software. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E

40|$|Sedimentological {{analyses}} concerning ice rafted debris, {{grain size}} distribution, biogeneous components, and clay mineral composition of four sediment cores from the Antarctic continental margin off Kapp Norvegia reveal a cyclical pattern {{of three different}} sediment facies. These are classified into warm and <b>cold</b> <b>types,</b> representing warm and cold climatic periods and a short transition period from cold to warm events. The sedimentological parameters reflect the variations with the cryosphere and the hydrosphere, which are directly influenced by the climatic fluctuations. The unusually high content of carbonaceous planktonic and benthonic foraminifera in these polar sediments, {{as well as the}} interfingering of terrigeneous and biogeneous-rich sediments with increasing distance from the continent, might reflect the influence of the Weddell Sea Polynya and the oscillations of polynya, pack ice and ice shelf extent during the late Pleistocene...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{autoimmune}} haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), autoreactive antibodies {{directed against}} {{red blood cells}} are up-regulated, leading to erythrocyte death. Mycoplasma suis infections in pigs induce AIHA of both the warm and <b>cold</b> <b>types.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the target autoantigens of warm autoreactive IgG antibodies. Sera from experimentally M. suis -infected pigs were screened for autoreactivity. Results Actin-reactive antibodies were found in the sera of 95 % of all animals tested. The reactivity was species-specific, i. e. reactivity with porcine actin was significantly higher than with rabbit actin. Sera of animals previously immunised with the M. suis adhesion protein MSG 1 showed reactivity with actin prior to infection with M. suis indicating that molecular mimicry is involved in the specific autoreactive mechanism. A potentially cross-reactive epitope was detected. Conclusions This is the first report of autoreactive anti-actin antibodies involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new model of the heliospheric {{interface}} - the region of the solar wind interaction with the local interstellar medium. This new model performs a multi-component treatment of charged particles in the heliosphere. All charged particles are divided into several co-moving <b>types.</b> The <b>coldest</b> <b>type,</b> with parameters typical of original solar wind protons, is considered in the framework of fluid approximation. The hot pickup proton components created from interstellar H atoms and heliospheric ENAs by charge exchange, electron impact ionization and photoionization are treated kinetically. The charged components are considered self-consistently with interstellar H atoms, which are described kinetically as well. To solve the kinetic equation for H atoms we use the Monte Carlo method with splitting of trajectories, which allows us 1) to reduce statistical uncertainties allowing correct interpretation of observational data, 2) to separate all H atoms in the heliosphere into several populations depending on the place of their birth and on the type of parent protons.

50|$|Johnston was {{originally}} printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print. (London Transport often {{did not use}} Johnston for general small printing, with many documents such as bus timetables using other typefaces such as Gill Sans). By the 1970s, as <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> was becoming the norm for printing, Johnston had become difficult for printers to use. Signs and posters of the period started to use other, more easily sourced typefaces such as Helvetica, Univers and News Gothic.

50|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>cold</b> <b>type</b> paralleled {{the development of}} web offset presses, particularly for newspapers, {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century.

Harris and Goss were two companies that led in the development of web offset presses. The Goss Community press, which is still in production as of 2014, was an affordable solution for small and mid-size newspapers, and they frequently bought Compugraphic typesetting equipment at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Snowflakes {{composed}} of snow crystals of <b>cold</b> temperature <b>types</b> were often observed in mid~winter in the Arctic Canada. The air temperature {{above the surface}} was mostly lower than- 25 'C during the period (November 1979 to January 1980). Snow clouds and precipitation particles were observed by a vertically pointing radar of 8. 6 mm in wavelength. The following is suggested from {{the discussion of the}} effects of size, number concentration, falling distance and collection efficiency of snow crystals on the formation of snowflakes. The non~rimed columns did not form snowflakes owing to its small collection efficiency and the short falling distance. When the level of the radar~echo top was higher than 4 km, the non~rimed combination of bullets grew large and aggregated with each other owing to its large collection efficiency and long falling distance. Cloud droplets might {{play an important role in}} the aggregation process in case of snow crystals of <b>cold</b> temperature <b>types,</b> because snowflakes of large size (around 5 mm in diameter) were observed only when snow crystals were heavily rimed in convective clouds. 1...|$|R
