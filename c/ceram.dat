In late 1944, plans were made to transfer No.79 Wing from North-Western Area Command to Northern Command in Papua New Guinea, where it would undertake operations against the Japanese in New Britain. The wing's composition for this move was to be Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons, operating Mitchells, and 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. No.31 Squadron was transferred from No.79 Wing to the Australian First Tactical Air Force at Morotai in December.

25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa) is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (Pteropus chrysoproctus), <b>Ceram</b> fruit bat Pteropus ocularis and lesser tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene minutus).|$|E

The Allied air forces conducted heavy raids on airfields in the Halmaheras, Celebes, <b>Ceram,</b> Ambon, Boeroe and other areas. US Navy carrier-borne aircraft also attacked Japanese air units based at Mindanao and mounted further attacks on Halmahera and Celebes. These attacks were successful, and by 14 September it was estimated that only 60 aircraft remained in the vicinity of Morotai.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} day the 31st Division had secured all of its D-Day objectives and held a perimeter [...] inland. There was little fighting and casualties were very low on both sides. The Japanese 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit was unable to offer any resistance to the overwhelming Allied force, and withdrew inland in good order. Japanese 7th Air Division aircraft based at <b>Ceram</b> and Celebes began a series of nightly air raids on Morotai on 15 September, but these had little effect on the Allied force.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese 7th Air Division {{continued}} to raid Morotai for {{months after the}} Allied landing. The air division conducted 82 raids on Morotai involving 179 sorties between 15 September 1944 and 1 February 1945. The aircraft used in these raids flew from <b>Ceram</b> and the Celebes and landed at airfields on Halmahera before proceeding to their targets. While 54 of the raids caused no damage, the others resulted {{in the destruction of}} forty-two Allied aircraft and damage to another thirty-three. Allied casualties from air attack were 19 killed and 99 wounded. The most successful raid was conducted on the night of 22 November when 15 Allied planes were destroyed and eight damaged. The regular Japanese air raids ceased at the end of January 1945, though a final attack took place on 22 March. USAAF night fighters had only limited success as raiders were normally detected only shortly before they entered anti-aircraft gun defended zones; these guns shot down most of the 26 Japanese aircraft lost over Morotai. The official history of the USAAF's night fighter force states that Morotai [...] "was probably the most difficult task undertaken by American night fighters during World War II" [...] due to the difficulty of detecting incoming raiders.|$|E

60|$|In {{the great}} island of <b>Ceram</b> {{there is also}} an {{indigenous}} race very similar to that of Northern Gilolo. Bourn seems to contain two distinct races,--a shorter, round-faced people, with a Malay physiognomy, who may probably have come from Celebes by way of the Sula islands; and a taller bearded race, resembling that of <b>Ceram.</b>|$|E
60|$|The people here--at {{least the}} chief men--were {{of a much}} purer Malay race than the Mahometans of the {{mainland}} of <b>Ceram,</b> which is perhaps due to there having been no indigenes on these small islands when the first settlers arrived. In <b>Ceram,</b> the Alfuros of Papuan race are the predominant type, the Malay physiognomy being seldom well marked; whereas here the reverse is the case, and a slight infusion of Papuan on a mixture of Malay and Bugis has produced a very good-looking set of people. The lower class of the population consist almost entirely of the indigenes of the adjacent island. They are a fine race, with strongly-marked Papuan features, frizzly hair, and brown complexions. The Goram language is spoken also at {{the east end of}} <b>Ceram,</b> and in the adjacent islands. It has a general resemblance to the languages of <b>Ceram,</b> but possesses a peculiar element which I have not met with in other languages of the Archipelago.|$|E
60|$|The {{influx of}} two races {{can easily be}} {{accounted}} for. The Sula Islands, which are closely connected with East Celebes, approach to within forty miles of the north coast of Bouru, while the island of Manipa offers an easy {{point of departure for}} the people of <b>Ceram.</b> I was confirmed in this view by finding that the languages of Bouru possessed distinct resemblances to that of Sula, as well as to those of <b>Ceram.</b>|$|E
60|$|IV. THE MOLUCCAN GROUP: {{comprising}} Bouru, <b>Ceram,</b> Batchian, Gilolo, and Morty; {{with the}} smaller islands of Ternate, Tidore, Makian, Kaióa, Amboyna, Banda, Goram, and Matabello.|$|E
60|$|Whether the Goram group formed {{originally}} part of New Guinea or of <b>Ceram</b> it {{is scarcely}} possible to determine, and its productions will throw little light upon the question, if, as I suppose, the islands have been entirely submerged within the epoch of existing species of animals, as {{in that case}} it must owe its present fauna and flora to recent immigration from surrounding lands; and with this view its poverty in species very well agrees. It possesses {{much in common with}} East <b>Ceram,</b> {{but at the same time}} has a good deal of resemblance to the Ke Islands and Banda. The fine pigeon, Carpophaga concinna, inhabits Ke, Banda, Il-Iatabello, and Goram, and is replaced by a distinct species, C. neglecta, in <b>Ceram.</b> The insects of these four islands have also a common facies--facts which seem to indicate that some more extensive land has recently disappeared from the area they now occupy, and has supplied them with a few of its peculiar productions.|$|E
60|$|Although the {{few months}} I {{at various times}} spent in Amboyna were not {{altogether}} very profitable {{to me in the}} way of collections, it will always remain as a bright spot in the review of my Eastern travels, since it was there that I first made the acquaintance of those glorious birds and insects which render the Moluccas classic ground {{in the eyes of the}} naturalist, and characterise its fauna as one of the most remarkable and beautiful upon the globe. On the 20th of February I finally quitted Amboyna for <b>Ceram</b> and Waigiou, leaving Charles Allen to go by a Government boat to Wahai on the north coast of <b>Ceram,</b> and thence to the unexplored island of Mysol.|$|E
60|$|But {{the fact}} of the Aru Islands having once been {{connected}} with New Guinea does not rest on this evidence alone. There is such a striking resemblance between the productions of the two countries as only exists between portions of a common territory. I collected one hundred species of land-birds in the Aru Islands, and about eighty of them, have been found on the mainland of New Guinea. Among these are the great wingless cassowary, two species of heavy brush turkeys, and two of short winged thrushes; which could certainly not have passed over the 150 miles of open sea to the coast of New Guinea. This barrier is equally effectual in the case of many other birds which live only {{in the depths of the}} forest, as the kinghunters (Dacelo gaudichaudi), the fly-catching wrens (Todopsis), the great crown pigeon (Goura coronata), and the small wood doves (Ptilonopus perlatus, P. aurantiifrons, and P. coronulatus). Now, to show the real effect of such barrier, let us take the island of <b>Ceram,</b> which is exactly the same distance from New Guinea, but separated from it by a deep sea. Cut of about seventy land-birds inhabiting <b>Ceram,</b> only fifteen are found in New Guinea, and none of these are terrestrial or forest-haunting species. The cassowary is distinct; the kingfishers, parrots, pigeons, flycatchers, honeysuckers, thrushes, and cuckoos, are almost always quite distinct species. More than this, at least twenty genera, which are common to New Guinea and Aru, do not extend into <b>Ceram,</b> indicating with a force which every naturalist will appreciate, that the two latter countries have received their faunas in a radically different manner. Again, a true kangaroo is found in Aru, and the same species occurs in Mysol, which is equally Papuan in its productions, while either the same, or one closely allied to it, inhabits New Guinea; but no such animal is found in <b>Ceram,</b> which is only sixty miles from Mysol. Another small marsupial animal (Perameles doreyanus) is common to Aru and New Guinea. The insects show exactly the same results. The butterflies of Aru are all either New Guinea species, or very slightly modified forms; whereas those of <b>Ceram</b> are more distinct than are the birds of the two countries.|$|E
60|$|We {{are able}} to divide this small {{archipelago}} into two well marked groups--that of <b>Ceram,</b> including also Bouru. Amboyna, Banda, and Ke; and that of Gilolo, including Morty, Batchian, Obi, Ternate, and other small islands. These divisions have each {{a considerable number of}} peculiar species, no less than fifty-five being found in the <b>Ceram</b> group only; and besides this, most of the separate islands have some species peculiar to themselves. Thus Morty island has a peculiar kingfisher, honeysucker, and starling; Ternate has a ground-thrush (Pitta) and a flycatcher; Banda has a pigeon, a shrike, and a Pitta; Ke has two flycatchers, a Zosterops, a shrike, a king-crow and a cuckoo; and the remote Timor-Laut, which should probably come into the Moluccan group, has a cockatoo and lory as its only known birds, and both are of peculiar species.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Kilwaru {{early in}} the morning of June 1st, with a strong east wind we doubled the point of <b>Ceram</b> about noon, the heavy sea causing my prau to roll abort a good deal, to the damage of our crockery. As bad weather seemed coming on, we got inside the reefs and {{anchored}} opposite the village of Warns-warns to wait for a change.|$|E
60|$|Going northward, Amboyna, {{a part of}} Bouru, and {{the west}} end of <b>Ceram,</b> the north part of Gilolo, and all the small islands around it, the {{northern}} extremity of Celebes, and the islands of Siau and Sanguir, are wholly volcanic. The Philippine Archipelago contains many active and extinct volcanoes, and has probably been reduced to its present fragmentary condition by subsidences attending on volcanic action.|$|E
60|$|Having seen a {{good many}} of the natives of Bouru from {{different}} villages, and from distant parts of the island, I feel convinced that they consist of two distinct races now partially amalgamated. The larger portion are Malays of the Celebes type, often exactly similar to the Tomóre people of East Celebes, whom I found settled in Batchian; while others altogether resemble the Alfuros of <b>Ceram.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{constant}} {{walking in}} water, and over rocks and pebbles, quite destroyed the two {{pair of shoes}} I brought with me, so that, on my return, they actually fell to pieces, and the last day I had to walk in my stockings very painfully, and reached home quite lame. On our way back from Makariki, as on our way there, we had storm and rain at sea, and we arrived at Awaiya late in the evening, with all our baggage drenched, and ourselves thoroughly uncomfortable. All the time I had been in <b>Ceram</b> I had suffered much from the irritating bites of an invisible acarus, which is worse than mosquitoes, ants, and every other pest, because {{it is impossible to}} guard against them. This last journey in the forest left me covered from head to foot with inflamed lumps, which, after my return to Amboyna, produced a serious disease, confining me to the house for nearly two months, a not very pleasant memento of my first visit to <b>Ceram,</b> which terminated with the year 1859.|$|E
60|$|I HAD long {{wished to}} visit the large island of Bouru, which lies due west of <b>Ceram,</b> and of which {{scarcely}} anything appeared to be known to naturalists, except that it contained a babirusa very like that of Celebes. I therefore made arrangements for staying there two months after leaving Timor Delli in 1861. This I could conveniently do {{by means of the}} Dutch mail-steamers, which make a monthly round of the Moluccas.|$|E
60|$|I believe, therefore, {{that the}} {{numerous}} intermediate forms that occur among the countless {{islands of the}} Pacific, are not merely {{the result of a}} mixture of these races, but are, to some extent, truly intermediate or transitional; and that the brown and the black, the Papuan, the natives of Gilolo and <b>Ceram,</b> the Fijian, the inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands and those of New Zealand, are all varying forms of one great Oceanic or Polynesian race.|$|E
60|$|The beetles figured on {{the plate}} as {{characteristic}} of the Moluccas are: 1. A small specimen of the Euchirus longimanus, or Long-armed Chafer, which has been already mentioned {{in the account of}} my residence at Amboyna (Chapter XX.). The female has the fore legs of moderate length. 2. A fine weevil, (an undescribed species of Eupholus,) of rich blue and emerald green colours, banded with black. It is a native of <b>Ceram</b> and Goram, and is found on foliage. 3. A female of Xenocerus semiluctuosus, one of the Anthribidae of delicate silky white and black colours. It is abundant on fallen trunks and stumps in <b>Ceram</b> and Amboyna. 4. An undescribed species of Xenocerus; a male, with very long and curious antenna, and elegant black and white markings. It is found on fallen trunks in Batchian. 5. An undescribed species of Arachnobas, a curious genus of weevils peculiar to the Moluccas and New Guinea, and remarkable for their long legs, and their habit of often sitting on leaves, and turning rapidly round the edge to the under-surface when disturbed. It was found in Gilolo. All these insects are represented of the natural size.|$|E
