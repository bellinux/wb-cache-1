25|$|After the Ottoman Army had {{evacuated}} Jerusalem, {{the city}} was occupied on 9 December 1917.

25|$|Aristotle <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> {{the falling}} stone, rising flames, or pouring water to {{illustrate}} his theory. His laws of motion emphasized the common observation that friction was an omnipresent phenomenon – that any body in motion would, unless acted upon, come to rest. He also proposed that heavier objects fall faster, and that voids were impossible.|$|E

25|$|By taking {{nine and}} a half hours to make their 321 on winning the toss England <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the {{difficulty}} of forcing the ball away from so turgid a pitch and so dusty an in-field and finally across a slow, lush, green carpet. Naturally suspicious of player's alibis, I was very much on their side this time - up to a point.|$|E

25|$|Coriander {{seems to}} have been {{cultivated}} in Greece since at least the second millennium BC. One of the Linear B tablets recovered from Pylos refers to the species as being cultivated for the manufacture of perfumes, it apparently was used in two forms: as a spice for its seeds and as a herb for the flavour of its leaves. This appears to be confirmed by archaeological evidence from the same period; the large quantities of the species retrieved from an Early Bronze Age layer at Sitagroi in Macedonia <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> cultivation of the species at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 George Smiley, the {{new chief}} of the secret {{intelligence}} service referred to as The Circus, continues to investigate his spy service {{in the aftermath of}} his exposure of Bill Haydon as Gerald the mole. Attempting to follow the trail of Karla, the Moscow Centre spymaster and to protect his politically-weakened spy service, Smiley launches an offensive against the Soviets. He and analysts Connie Sachs and Doc di Salis look into investigations unreasonably suppressed by the outed mole. They discover that Sam Collins's investigation of a money laundering operation in Laos <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> involvement by Karla.|$|E
25|$|Speaking of {{the other}} {{extended}} narratives, it is certainly possible that some could {{have been written by}} the condemned themselves as stated by the Accounts. They provided an account of the crimes committed as single episodes without exterior framework of life or work that might place them in a casual order and {{with a great deal of}} details about every crime. Cant language (or Cant tongue) was often employed; born in spoken speech, it was a language used by criminals for the purpose of concealment and mutual recognition. Its presence makes it likely that whoever composed the narratives wrote them in close association with the criminal. The enjoyment in exposing techniques and in explaining particular types of thieving and the way in which the repenting tone that appears everywhere else in the Accounts is minimised are other characteristics which <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a different author than the Ordinary. Where there are exaggeration, errors and embellishments we could attribute them to the bluster or self-deception of men speaking their last words before their execution.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1949, the {{movement}} {{spread to the}} new province of Newfoundland where six active squadrons, all supported by strong civilian committees, were in operation {{only a few weeks}} after Confederation. A year later, the need for an increase in the maximum establishment was recognized by the Government and the ceiling was raised to 22,500 cadets. As the League paused to observe its Tenth Anniversary in 1951, it <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a fine record of service to Canada. Some 65,000 boys had worn the Air Cadet uniform and participated in the training program. In 1961, as the League celebrated its coming of age, more than 150,000 Air Cadets had received training in the squadrons now numbering 332. If all the cadets who had received Air Cadet training to that time could have been paraded at one time in column of route, the parade would have stretched for a distance of 35 miles. In view of a strong demand for new units at the time and to provide for gradual expansion, authority was granted in 1972 for an increase by stages to the present entitlement of 28,000 Air Cadets.|$|E
25|$|There {{remained}} the struggle in Catalonia. At no {{stage in the}} war had there been a unanimous or even majority support for Archduke Charles (Charles III) in the principality, but {{the existence of a}} rebel group inside the province, together with a superior Allied military and naval presence in Barcelona, forced many towns to decide – often reluctantly – for the Archduke's cause. Nevertheless, those who wished to continue fighting <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the fact that the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, as well as those in Castile, were subject to a regime that had forced them to change their laws and historic constitutions, and at no stage since his victory at Almansa and the subsequent abolition of the fueros in Aragon and Valencia in 1707, had Philip V shown any intention of respecting Catalonia's privileges. In consequence, Barcelona decided to resist, but there would be no Allied help. After the peace agreements between the major powers neither Austria nor Great Britain could return to a war footing. To compound the issue, Tory diplomatic efforts with Philip V to secure Catalan liberties were half-hearted, and Bolingbroke made no protest when, in early July 1714 – after a year of guerilla warfare in the region – Berwick returned to Catalonia to formally besiege Barcelona. Antoni de Villarroel put up a stout defence of the city, but with little hope of relief the Catalan capital surrendered on 11 September. Cardona soon followed. Majorca held out for nine months until its surrender in July 1715.|$|E
25|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have seen the}} party lose focus {{with the rise of}} SAP neoliberal study groups, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has for many years appealed to Swedes as innovative, capable, and worthy of running the state. The Social Democrats {{became one of the most}} successful political parties in the world, with some structural advantages in addition to their auspicious birth within vibrant folkrörelser. At the close of the nineteenth century, liberals and socialists had to band together to augment establishment democracy, which was at that point embarrassingly behind in Sweden; they <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> formal democratic advances elsewhere to motivate political action. In addition to being small, Sweden was a semi-peripheral country at the beginning of the twentieth century, considered unimportant to competing global political factions; so it was permitted more independence, while soon the existence of communist and capitalist superpowers allowed social democracy to flourish in the geo-political interstices. The SAP has the resource of sharing ideas and experiences, and working with its sister parties throughout the Nordic countries. Sweden could also borrow and innovate upon ideas from English-language economists, which was an advantage for the Social Democrats in the Great Depression; but more advantageous for the bourgeois parties in the 1980s and afterward. While the SAP has not been innocent of repressing communists, the party has overall benefitted, in government coalition and in avoiding severe stagnation and drift, by engaging in relatively constructive relationships with the more radical Left Party and the Green Party. The early SAP had internal resources as well, in creative politicians with brilliant tactical minds, and similarly creative labor economists at their disposal.|$|E
50|$|The {{winner was}} chosen in {{two rounds of}} voting by a jury of eleven people {{including}} composed of deputies of the ARD and an association of composers and lyricist {{as well as a}} conductor.

Judge Reeves' injunction was therefore lifted.|$|R
500|$|Soviet {{influence}} in Latin America increased after Cuba became a communist state in 1961. The Cuban revolution was welcomed by Moscow since for once, they <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a communist government established by indigenous forces {{instead of the}} Red Army. Cuba also became the Soviet Union's [...] "front man" [...] for promoting socialism in the Third World as the Havana regime was seen as more marketable and charismatic. By the late 1970s, Soviet {{influence in}} Latin America had reached crisis proportions according to several United States Congressmen. Diplomatic and economic ties were established with several countries during the 1970s, and one of them, Peru bought external goods from the Soviet Union. Mexico, and several countries in the Caribbean, forged increasingly strong ties with Comecon, an Eastern Bloc trading organisation established in 1949. The Soviet Union also strengthened its ties with the communist parties of Latin America. Soviet ideologists saw the increasing Soviet presence {{as a part of}} the [...] "mounting anti-imperialist struggle for democracy and social justice".|$|E
500|$|Boosinger {{called the}} game too easy and streamlined, {{and found the}} Logic system to be too simple. He did however feel that finding contradictions in testimonies was [...] "fantastic as always", while too reliant on trial and error. Ronaghan said that many {{solutions}} in the Rebuttal phases are [...] "binary" [...] - while {{it makes sense to}} present a piece of evidence at several points, the game accepts only one of them. He found the controls to be fine, but called the touch screen-based walking controls [...] "awkward and imprecise". Goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the same contradiction, but where the game would only allow a specific one. At other times, she said that no reasonable solution could be found, forcing her to guess. John Walker at Eurogamer also complained about how reasonable solutions sometimes are not accepted. Hopper said that solving cases isn't intuitive enough, and involves a lot of trial and error. While some puzzles made sense to him, others were frustrating. Parker called the gameplay exciting, and said that the game has depth and variety, but that it is too easy at times.|$|E
2500|$|The French Orientalist René Basset {{forwarded}} another theory: {{the name}} {{derives from the}} Zenaga root b-k-t, meaning [...] "to be distant" [...] or [...] "hidden", and the feminine possessive particle tin. The meaning [...] "hidden" [...] <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the city's location in a slight hollow.|$|E

Some areas of new evolutionary forces have {{allowed for the}} Synodontis schall to have different phenotypes.

50|$|Folklorist R. B. Wilcox, {{collecting}} {{material for}} {{a book on the}} legends of upstate New York, queries Aceria Jones, a Gahato tea room hostess, regarding the village's rumored haunted woodpile. Aceria dismisses the story, but suggestively tells him she would be extremely grateful if he <b>could</b> <b>point</b> her <b>to</b> a job in the vicinity of a Norway maple (Acer platanoides). Moralistically rejecting her advances, Wilcox leaves, unknowingly killing his chance of getting the inside story.|$|R

The line at infinity is thus a line like any other in the theory: it {{is in no way}} special or distinguished.

2500|$|He {{may have}} been the subject of a number of Elizabethan satires such as Thomas Nashe's Lenten Stuffe, Ben Jonson's Every Man in his Humour, and {{may have been}} the model of Shakespeare's Falstaff, who was {{originally}} given the name [...] "Oldcastle". Sir John Oldcastle was an ancestor of Lord Cobham. [...] Though Falstaff is more likely modelled on his father William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (also descended from John Oldcastle) who was married to Frances Newton, whose family name was originally Caradock; referenced in 2 Henry IV when Falstaff sings [...] "The Boy and the Mantle," [...] a ballad in which Sir Caradoc's wife comes away with her fidelity and reputation intact (McKeen 1981). [...] This <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> William Brooke, being married to a Caradock such as the Sir Cacadoc in the ballad sung by Falstaff, as the model for Falstaff rather than Henry, being the son of a Caradock.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{leadership}} Latvia recorded major economic achievements. The state assumed {{a larger role}} in the economy and state capitalism was introduced by purchasing and uniting smaller competing private companies into larger state enterprises. This process was controlled by Latvijas Kredītbanka, a state bank established in 1935. Many large-scale building projects were undertaken - new schools, administrative buildings, Ķegums Hydroelectric Power Station. Due to an application of the economics of comparative advantage, the United Kingdom and Germany became Latvia's major trade partners, while trade with the USSR was reduced. The economy, especially the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, were micromanaged to an extreme degree. Ulmanis nationalised many industries. This resulted in rapid economic growth, during which Latvia attained a very high standard of living. At a time when most of the world's economy was still suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, Latvia <b>could</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> increases in both gross national product (GNP) and in exports of Latvian goods overseas. This, however, came at the cost of liberty and civil rights.|$|E
