40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Process {{adjustment}} {{strategy is}} an important part of the process improvement methods, which is also called engineering process control (EPC), and it is often integrated with statistical process control (SPC) to improve the process control performance. While feedback <b>control</b> <b>is</b> used to compensate for the output deviation, feedforward <b>control</b> <b>is</b> a proactive <b>control</b> strategy based on a direct measurement of the disturbance, and it acts before the disturbance affects the system. Feedforward <b>control</b> <b>is</b> usually combined with feedback control for variation reduction. In this article, rationales for feedforward <b>control</b> <b>are</b> explained, and a new philosophy on its application is given. The feasibility condition for feedforward <b>control</b> application <b>is</b> illustrated from a new disturbance decomposition viewpoint, and the validity of some disturbance models which work well for feedforward <b>control</b> <b>is</b> investigated.

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust <b>control</b> <b>was</b> used in Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts.

5|$|A case {{in which}} {{developer}} <b>control</b> <b>was</b> asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E
