40|$|A major {{trend of}} {{contemporary}} philosophy, called post-metaphysical or post-modern, links the « féminine » to {{the erosion of}} the subject.

During this time of my life- as a dancer in Hollywood living in near {{downtown}} Los Angeles, I sought {{to make sense of it}} all. My work seeks to highlight absurdity, beauty, and marginality, as I expose a gritty and also reverent narrative. I also deal well with place, in a loosely Marxist statement, which attempts to celebrate the margins of L. A. from my vantage point. I look at nihilism as positive expression in order to ritualize experience.

50|$|If, however, {{there is}} a {{provision}} that, on a breach of the condition, the property {{is to go to}} a certain heir, there is clearly a fideicommissum in favour of the mentioned heir, as where the testator leaves “my farm to A, subject to the condition that he shall not alienate it, and if he does the farm shall go to B.” Similarly, if a prohibition <b>against</b> <b>alienation</b> is made in favour of a class of persons, a fideicommissum is implied in favour of such class. For example, where the testator leaves “my farm to my daughter A, provided that she shall not alienate the farm out of the family,” a fideicommissum is created in favour of the testator’s descendants. The class to be favoured must be clearly specified; otherwise no fideicommissum is constituted.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Across the U. S. social {{activism}} {{is on the}} upsurge, offering {{possibilities for}} a revolution against capitalism. However, these possibilities are potentially undermined by entrenched factionalism amongst the left. At root, such in-fighting is fostered by the creation of false dualistic frameworks on the transition out of capitalism and into the next social system. These frameworks are categorized into two typologies labelled the “strategic” and “prefigurative” camps. Blasting open these dualisms can bridge the left and allow for fresher views on revolution {{and the role of}} the state, leadership and vanguardism, the significance of democracy, and the value of utopian dreaming. Replacing these frameworks is a methodology called the radical imagination, which poses that within everyday life exist creative opportunities for rebellion. The radical imagination enables the process of seizing spaces for revolutionary (re) production. By viewing daily life as the struggle <b>against</b> <b>alienation,</b> possibilities abound in capturing previously mundane spaces and injecting them with revolutionary activity...|$|R

40|$|In {{a day of}} such {{widespread}} and extensive alimony decrees, it is abnormal {{that there are not}} more authorities upon the questions raised by an attempt {{on the part of the}} wife 2 ̆ 7 s creditors to garnish future alimony installments. The law is indeed meagre on this subject and such cases as are available seem to be in hopeless conflict. Upon analysis, however, it may be that some guiding principles underlie the apparently paradoxical decisions. Two possible situations, in general, may be presented. First, after a decree for future installments, creditors of the wife may seek to attach the same by garnishment and thus subject the payments to the satisfaction of their claims, whether the installments be payable directly from the husband to the wife, or payable to a trustee, to be paid over to the wife at regular intervals; second, the court issuing the alimony decree, either originally or by supplementary decree, may attempt to prevent assignment or garnishment by a pro-vision <b>against</b> <b>alienation</b> until the money is actually paid over to the wife. These two situations, with the legal problems involved,will be discussed separately...|$|R

40|$|Health inequalities {{research}} has shown a growing interest in participatory ways of working. However, the theoretical ideas underpinning mainstream approaches to participation remain underexplored. This article contributes to theorising participatory practice {{for the kind of}} egalitarian politics to which many of those focused on reducing health inequalities are committed. First, we argue that the ambitions of participatory practice should be concentrated on ‘overcoming alienation’, rather than ‘attaining freedom from power’. An over-emphasis on negative freedom may help to explain a worrying confluence between participatory democracy and neo-liberal marketization agendas – we look instead to traditions of participatory practice that emphasize positive freedom and capacities for collaboration. Second, we discuss some such perspectives though consideration of critical pedagogy, but highlighting the role of materialised relations of authority, spaces, objects and encounters. Third, we explore the relationship between objectivity and alienation, arguing that participatory politics, <b>against</b> <b>alienation,</b> can look to reclaim objectivity for participatory, lively, practice. We then seek to show that participatory practice can play a role in creating common knowledge and culture, and in fostering a sense of public ownership over objective knowledge and institutions concerned with health. We conclude by asking what this looks like in practice, drawing some ‘rules of thumb’ for participatory practice in health inequalities research from existing inspiring examples. ...|$|R
5000|$|But, while du Perron {{was still}} in Rome, Pope Paul V decided to pick a quarrel with the Serene Republic of Venice, over its conduct in exercising its {{sovereign}} rights. The Venetian government had passed a law <b>against</b> <b>alienation</b> of property {{in favor of the}} Church, and another requiring governmental approval for the building of new churches. In addition, there was the very old argument over the exemption of the clergy from civil court jurisdiction. On April 17, 1606, Pope Paul launched a bull against Venice, imposing an interdict on all the territories belonging to the Serenissima. This was certain to lead to war, and would very likely excite the greed of Spain for additional territory in Lombardy. [...] King Henri IV, wishing to prevent this, proposed mediation between the Pope and Venice, and offered Cardinal de Joyeuse and Cardinal du Perron as mediators. The status of the Jesuits, who supported the papal interdict, became the main sticking point; the Venetians wanted them gone. Finally, due to the forceful persuasion of Cardinal de Joyeuse (du Perron claimed to be ill), the Pope gave way, the edict was withdrawn, and the crisis averted. Nonetheless, for the work that he had done, the Republic offered du Perron its thanks.|$|R
