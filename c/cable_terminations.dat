50|$|Undesired or {{unintended}} electric arcing {{can have}} detrimental effects {{on electric power}} transmission, distribution systems and electronic equipment. Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor <b>cable</b> <b>terminations.</b> When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices susceptible to arcing are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for transient currents, preventing arcing. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Wrapped {{optical fibre}} cable {{technology}} was developed independently in the UK and Japan in the early 1980s. In the UK, Raychem Ltd had a background in polymeric materials with resistance to high voltage environments; used for example in heat-shrinkable 33kV <b>cable</b> <b>terminations</b> and in polymer insulators. The initial development involved an all-dielectric fibre optic cable with a sheath made from tracking resistant material. The first installation was carried out on a 33kV overhead distribution line between sub-stations at Hartley and Goudhurst in Kent, UK in December 1982.The choice of a 33kV line indicates the expected market for the technology - building communication networks over local distribution lines when transmission and sub-transmission lines {{were expected to be}} equipped with OPGW. Over the next five years, installations were carried out in Norway, New Zealand, USA, India, Germany, France and Finland totalling about 180 km in both ground-wire and phase-conductor installations, and on both distribution and transmission lines. Raychem sold the wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} technology to Cookson Group plc in 1987. A subsidiary of Cookson Group was FOCAS Limited who completed the development work and commercialised the product as SkyWrap, supplying more than 16,000 km to customers in over 30 countries.

40|$|High-power voltage sourced converters(VSC’s) are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in modern transmission systems. These systems primarily use switching schemes generating kHz range harmonics, which may be magnified {{by one or more}} system resonances. Despite the high frequency harmonics, VSC systems widely use insulated equipment designed for operation at power frequencies; this includes critical substation components such as medium voltage polymeric cables and terminations. The stress grading systems of non-geometric (compact) <b>cable</b> <b>terminations</b> are susceptible to insulation degradation and eventual flashover failure, under high frequency harmonic stresses. As such, the present work studies high frequency voltage effects in cross-linked polyethylene <b>cable</b> <b>terminations,</b> and their relationship to stress grading (SG) design and material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) has been used to analyze electric field and resistive heating in termination designs, in response to parametric variations in SG material properties. Experimental studies investigate thermal behaviour in a variety of commercial termination designs, using a high voltage, high frequency test setup developed to replicate conditions of high frequency harmonic resonance in a VSC system. The study results show that high frequency voltage application increases the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise, in non-geometric (compact) termination designs using field-dependant stress grading materials. Geometric (stress cone) designs are insensitive to high frequency harmonics; however, they have disadvantages compared to compact designs, making them a less practical long-term solution for high frequency applications. Among non-geometric designs, the field-dependent electrical conductivity σ (E), the permittivity ε, and the temperature dependencies of σ (E) and ε strongly influence the termination electrical and thermal behaviour under high frequency stress. Since thermal hotspots in cable termination SG areas may lead to material degradation and eventual failure, recommendations are made for an optimal non-geometric stress grading design, for terminations operating in environments where high frequency harmonics may be present...|$|E
