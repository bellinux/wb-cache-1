500|$|By this time, Virginia had {{developed}} consumption, first seen {{sometime in the}} middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely [...] "ruptured a blood-vessel". Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: [...] "Each time I felt all the agonies of her deathand at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitivenervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity." ...|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
2500|$|Successive {{experiments}} {{concluded that}} infants used the surrogate {{as a base}} for exploration, and a source of comfort and protection in novel and even frightening situations. In an experiment called the [...] "open-field test", an infant was placed in a novel environment with novel objects. When the infant's surrogate mother was present, it <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> but then began venturing off to explore. If frightened, the infant ran back to the surrogate mother and <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for a time before venturing out again. Without the surrogate mother's presence, the monkeys were paralyzed with fear, huddling in a ball and sucking their thumbs.|$|E
60|$|Poor little Di, who {{had been}} terribly frightened, <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's arm on hearing this.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} wonder-stricken face towards him still; but drew back, and <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not stop, mejuffrouw, to parley {{with any}} of these scamps," [...] said Maria as she <b>clung</b> fearsomely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mistress's cloak.|$|R
60|$|But she <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother's neighbourhood, {{she knew}} not why.|$|E
60|$|In {{the dark}} hall Norah whirled and <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> companion, tearful.|$|E
60|$|There were {{footsteps}} {{upon the}} stairs. He <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in an agony of terror.|$|E
60|$|Maria {{was already}} {{dissolved}} in tears. Mrs. Posttlethwaite was struck dumb by the awfulness of the occasion, and <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sister Matilda.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father!" [...] The cry {{came from}} Mrs. Morris and she <b>clung</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, while little Nell {{set up a}} wild sobbing. [...] "Must we leave it all--everything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl gasped again, and <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> companion. [...] "Of course," [...] she said. [...] "You don't know Larry. If {{they had}} all the Cedar boys, too, he would ride {{straight}} through them." ...|$|R
60|$|She glowered without answering, {{then turned}} and <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother. She would not allow it.|$|E
60|$|He {{went off}} and Barbara <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother. She was shaking and her breath came hard.|$|E
60|$|He slowly relaxed his clasp, and {{she slid}} down like rain to earth. But still he <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Her {{tears were}} flowing as she tenderly embraced Phoebe, {{and the girl}} <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> not weeping, but full of warm, sweet emotion. 'Dear Miss Charlecote, now you are come, I have help and comfort!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Kitty {{threw her}} arms about the neck of that foolish woman, whoso loving heart she could not doubt, and <b>clung</b> sobbing <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Gone," [...] she said; and Mrs. Ellison, wise for once, asked no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear it! Oh Heaven, yes! Whence did it come?" [...] The {{young wife}} {{could not say}} from whence it came, but <b>clung</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's breast, comforting herself with the {{knowledge}} that that terrible sorrow was not hers.|$|R
60|$|Then he just <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hand; and presently, {{seeing that}} {{her eyes were}} wet, took courage enough to kiss her cheek.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{could not}} speak. She <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father, {{looking at him}} with anxious, sombre eyes; but he laughed and patted her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it was fearful!" [...] gasped Nell, sitting up. She <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sister {{with one}} hand, {{while the other}} grasped Jim's sleeve.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must love}} Jacques Chapeau too, father," [...] and having uttered these {{important}} words, Annot <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's arms, {{as if she}} feared he was going <b>to</b> throw <b>her</b> off, and sobbed and cried as though her heart were breaking.|$|R
60|$|He {{came over}} <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{and touched her}} delicately. Her heart beat with wild passion, wild raging passion. But she {{resisted}} as yet. It was always the unknown, always the unknown, and she <b>clung</b> fiercely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> known self. But the rising flood carried her away.|$|R
60|$|I stooped down, and {{her arms}} were {{suddenly}} around me like a vise. She <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> me with <b>her</b> whole body, and held me so that I could scarcely breathe.|$|R
60|$|Though Philip <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she {{released}} herself gently. Mr. Carey took {{the boy on}} his knee and put his arm round him.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{had never}} <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> so gratefully, nor felt so much honoured. 'Do {{you think he}} will have it badly?' she asked timidly.|$|E
6000|$|However, {{discussion}} {{was cut short}} by a little flying figure which came rushing across the garden, and Babie with streaming hair <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cousin, gasping—- ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{bare feet}} {{were in the}} burn, the {{rippling}} water of which laved her ankles. The lobsters played about her feet, or <b>clung</b> affectionately <b>to</b> <b>her</b> toes, as if loath to leave the water and be gathered {{in the folds of}} her blue apron.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would go, madam," [...] {{said the}} boy, [...] "but"--and he stopped short, still drawing {{back as the}} lady {{advanced}} on him, but still holding by the hand Alice Bridgenorth, who, {{too young to understand}} the nature of the dialogue, <b>clung,</b> trembling, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "No it is not!" [...] cried Torfrida suddenly, as if {{answering}} her own unspoken thoughts, and his. [...] "Love {{is still}} left. The gallows and the stake cannot take that away." [...] And she <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's side, and he again to hers.|$|R
6000|$|But Grace <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{position}} like a limpet. [...] "You {{may have}} trifled with others, but him you love as you never loved another man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Dearest mamma, {{what have}} I done?” she asked. “Sure I meant no harm.” And she <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother, and the pair went out sobbing together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{before you}} have said that you have forgiven me!" [...] he entreated as he <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> white draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{heard him}} in painful silence. She {{respected}} him, and dreaded his power over her father; but, unwilling to abandon hopes {{to which she}} yet <b>clung</b> as <b>to</b> <b>her</b> spring of existence, with a violent effort she determined to throw herself on the generosity of her lover.|$|R
60|$|She {{made the}} leap successfully, {{but as she}} grasped the limb of the further tree the sudden jar {{loosened}} the hold of the tiny babe where it <b>clung</b> frantically <b>to</b> <b>her</b> neck, and she saw the little thing hurled, turning and twisting, to the ground thirty feet below.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously now Klara {{began to}} creep along the low wall which {{supported}} the balustrade. Her feet made no {{noise in the}} soft, sandy earth, <b>her</b> skirts <b>clung</b> closely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> limbs; at every minute sound she started and paused, clinging yet closer to the shadow which enveloped her.|$|R
