Especially Java allows straightforward use of <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications,</b> typically utilized for accessing resources and services in Internet. Communication mechanisms over computer network could yield a non-deterministic behavior in distributed applications. A possible solution for checking effects related to non-deterministic behaviors is the insertion of tracing and replay capabilities into the programming environment. This paper investigates on the main causes of non-determinism in communications within Java distributed applications, and shows a solution for dealing with them providing tracing and replay capabilities. Such a solution relies on the automatic transformation of the application source code; It takes {{full advantage of the}} object-oriented structure of Java and it is portable over any standard implementation of the Java Virtual Machine...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} methods to provide faulttolerant {{real-time}} communication over ATM networks. Specifically, {{we are concerned}} with messages {{that have to be}} delivered by their deadlines even in the presence of faults. <b>Connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> service is well-suited for mission critical applications that demand delay guarantees. A critical part of connection oriented communication is the design of a connection admission control algorithm. We develop innovative fault tolerant realtime connection admission control algorithms that use an integrated spatial and temporal redundancy scheme, and provide algorithms that determine the appropriate redundancy parameters. To aid delay analysis, we first develop a generic traffic model to describe the traffic of individual connections in the network. We then develop an analytical method to derive the end-to-end delay bounds taking into account the impact of faults. ...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{computing}} environments increasingly {{consist of}} a range of supporting technologies offering a diverse set of capabilities to applications and end-systems. Such environments are characterised by sudden and dramatic changes in the quality-of-service (QoS) available to applications and users. Recent work has shown that distributed systems platforms can assist applications to take advantage of these changes in QoS and, more specifically, facilitate applications to adapt to their environment. However, the current state-of-the-art in these platforms reflects their fixed network origins through their choice of synchronous <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> paradigms. In this paper we argue that these paradigms are not well suited to operation in the emerging mobile environments. Furthermore, we offer an alternative programming paradigm based on tuple spaces which, we believe, offers a number of benefits within a mobile context. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a new platform based on this paradigm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new routing algorithm for a wireless ATM LAN. The LAN combines {{positive aspects of}} a <b>connection-oriented</b> and datagram <b>communications</b> schemes in its usage of the ATM VP/VC concept. In this scheme, a set of VPI trees, routed at each node in the LAN, are preestablished. This {{has the effect of}} emulating "connectionless" networking which simplifies handoffs and other mobility management tasks. Given that the VPI sink trees are preestablished, {{there is a need for}} a procedure to compute and update the routes of these VPI trees with changing conditions in the LAN. In this paper, we first propose an off-line procedure to compute the initial VPI trees. Since traffic condtions are likely to change rapidly in mobile networks, we develop the Virtual Trees Routing Protocol (VTPR) to dynamically ipdate the routing of VPI trees to handle congestion and/or topological changes in the network...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} use of a hop-limit {{constraint}} with techniques to provide survivability for <b>connection-oriented</b> ATM group <b>communications.</b> A hop-limit constraint is an approach that has evolved from solving point-to-point routing problems but has not been fully developed for group communications. A hop-limit: (1) limits the number of routes considered such that the routing problems of higher order complexity can be solved and (2) limits the length of any individual route to meet specific Quality of Service guarantees (such as delay). This paper focuses on the former. We compare the feasibility and cost of providing survivability using working multipoint routes with disjoint dedicated backup multipoint routes, where the multipoint routes are setup using either Self-Healing Rings, Shared Multicast Trees, or VC Meshes. We found that hop-limit constraints allowed us to exactly solve NP-complete routing problems on real networks.

40|$|Datagram {{services}} {{provide a}} simple, flexible, robust, and scalable communication abstraction; their usefulness {{has been well}} demonstrated {{by the success of}} IP, UDP, and RPC. Yet, the overwhelming majority of network security protocols that have been proposed are geared towards <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications.</b> The few that do cater to datagram communications tend to either rely on long term host-pair keying or impose a session-oriented (i. e., requiring connection setup) semantics. Separately, the concept of flows has received {{a great deal of attention}} recently, especially in the context of routing and QoS. A flow characterizes a sequence of datagrams sharing some pre-defined attributes. In this paper, we advocate the use of flows as a basis for structuring secure datagram communications. We support this by proposing a novel protocol for datagram security based on flows. Our protocol achieves zero-message keying, thus preserving the connectionless nature of datagram, and makes use of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Multi-class {{network is}} {{becoming}} a more attractive solution to provide Quality-of-Service guarantee, as more quality-demanding applications are emerging. This research considers networks that provide connection-oriented services, as in ATM and MPLS technologies, for example. A common scheme for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) in <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> is to dynamically segregate bandwidth between different traffic categories. These categories can represent topological Virtual Paths or different Classes-of-Service with different Quality-of-Service requirements. Bandwidth segregation can be efficient {{if and only if}} demands for different Classesof-Service or different Virtual Paths can be predicted accurately. This led us to develop a novel algorithm that has a much wider vision in allocating resources than classical distributed algorithms. We call the proposed algorithm, Virtual Demand Distribution (VDD) algorithm. This algorithm utilizes signaling packets to broadcast information that enhances the performance of DBA algorithms. Mathematical analysis of multi-class connection-oriented networks and performance analysis/comparisons of the proposed VDD algorithm and a Simple Distributed algorithm are presented...|$|E
40|$|Currently, popular {{operating}} systems {{are unable to}} support the end-to-end real-time requirements of distributed continuous media. Furthermore, the integration of continuous media communications software into such systems poses significant challenges. This paper describes a design for distributed multimedia support in a micro-kernel operating system environment which provides the necessary soft real-time support while simultaneously running conventional applications. Our approach is to extend existing micro-kernel abstractions to include QoS configurability, <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> and real-time threads. The design uses the following key concepts: {{the notion of a}} flow to represent QoS controlled communication between two application threads, a close integration of communications and thread scheduling and the use of a split-level scheduling architecture with kernel-and user-level threads. Implementation work is not yet completed and therefore performance figures are not available. However, the paper shows how our design qualitatively improves performance over existing micro-kernel facilities by reducing the number of protection-domain crossings and context switches incurred...|$|E
40|$|Magneto-optic {{devices are}} a {{potential}} enabler of better scaling, transparent networks that are bit-rate, protocol and format insensitive. Transparency is critical given the paradigm shift from <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> to IP-centric packet switched data traffic {{driven by the}} influx of high bandwidth applications. This is made more urgent by the large and growing optical-electronic bandwidth mismatch {{as well as the}} rapid approach of device dimensions to the quantum limit. Fiber-based switches utilizing bismuth-substituted iron garnets as Faraday rotators in Mach-Zehnder and Sagnac interferometer configurations are proposed, analyzed and characterized. The issues and limitations of these switches are investigated and efforts are undertaken to model and optimize the field generating coil impedance parameters. While alleviating the concerns associated with free-space switches and being compatible with contemporary optical networks, the performance of the fiber-based interferometric switches is still below theoretical limits and could be improved. Moreover, the discrete components of a fiber-based implementation engender scalability concerns. In keeping with the spirit of Richard Feynman 2 ̆ 7 s lectures, the maturity of planar lithographic techniques that are widely used in microelectronics is leveraged to realize integrated versions of the fiber-based interferometric switches. The design, analysis, fabrication and characterization of these integrated switches are detailed herein, including the selection of a suitable material system, design of the waveguide geometry, creation and calibration of a fabrication process based on direct-write scanning electron-beam lithography as well as determination of the switches 2 ̆ 7 fabrication tolerance. While the larger waveguide cross-section of the microphotonic switches enables efficient coupling to fiber and greatly reduces geometrical birefringence, the weak confinement results in longer device lengths. Moreover, the small but finite birefringence induces some polarization dependence in switch performance. Consequently, compact and nominally non-birefringent nanophotonic versions of the interferometric switches are proposed and analyzed in the interest of further improving switch performance and scalability...|$|E
40|$|Since current {{networking}} {{technology is}} rapidly evolving, many users can now access information {{from all over}} the world without any geographical and temporal constraints. Networks are now a fundamental infrastructure for social services, such as E-commerce, online banking, social networking services (SNS), and cloud computing. As a result, cur-rent networks must provide a flexible service composition and robust system components. 　　　Most networks are currently based on TCP/IP protocol suite, and any application that supports it can communicate with another application without custom-made protocols. Networks have evolved by incorporating extended functions on the TCP/IP core functions that are complementary without actually changing them. Current networks basically have both old-fashioned systems, and cutting-edge systems. 　　　There is a hierarchical structure referred to as an hourglass based on TCP/IP in the background of the universality of the fundamental networking capability. The main idea of this structure is that the TCP/IP ensures there is a logical connectivity between end-to-end applications. Users can introduce a variety of applied networking services on TCP/IP and physical access technologies under TCP/IP. However, since there still are many systems that only support traditional networking services, it is difficult to widely deploy advanced services in the network, and users may struggle to replace core network protocols with new protocols to correct a backward compatibility problem. 　　　Generally, it is believed that networking applications and services are evolving as the network environment expands and diversifies. However, a variety of dedicated systems that depend on particular platforms and the developing environment have appeared that lack a higher-level common platform for these advanced networking services and users have developed their own services, respectively. 　　　In this paper, we would like to discuss a common software platform for diversifying networking services. Not the only network software, such as the applications, ervers, and protocol stacks, but also the methodologies and implementation techniques are expected to provide a common software platform. 　In particular, instead of developing brand-new network systems, existing software assets and technologies are used to construct the advanced network environment. 　　　To achieve extensible network softwares, we have focused on a notion of an adap-tive communication. The dap-tive communication provides a way to adaptively compose networking capabilities of applications when the surrounding environment is changed. In practice, each networking function for the application could be added, removed, or replaced per functional unit, and therefore, a transparent mechanism that dynamically composes networking functions is required to ensure compatibility with existing systems. 　　　Network applications usually use socket interfaces that abstract the networking functions to communicate over the network. A socket interface generally supports two types of communication: <b>connection-oriented</b> <b>communications</b> and connectionless-oriented communications, and it allows for the construction of network software that is independent of the network protocol. So, I am proposing a system that enables networking functions to be transparently change an application by using the abstraction of the socket interface. Since the change in networking functions is conducted entirely within the socket interface,the application can use the socket interface as is. 　　　Many related systems that transparently change the networking functions of applications. However, there are some platform, performance,developer-oriented behavior,usability, and flexible functions composition restrictions that exist with these systems. This study aims at a more pragmatic system compared to these systems in that it has a component-oriented function, composition mechanism, minimum overhead, multi-platform support, and a unified usability by taking into account not only the methodology for transparent extension, but also a common-platform for higher-level services characteristic. In addition, we take into account a user-interface that targets non-professional users as well as developers in the paper. 　　　In this paper, the proposed system was designed and implemented to work on Windows and Linux operating systems, and evaluated its functionalities comparing with existing systems. The result showed following advantages; 　　● Users can extend and configure their systems as intended 　　● Non-experimental users also can utilize the proposed system without programming 　　● The proposed system can be available with more applications and operating 　　　systems 　　● Users can manage the proposed system without difficulty 　　　Therefore, the proposed system allows us to extend applications more concisely and finely on variety of network environments, and existing software asset can be leveraged to compose advanced network environment. 　　　In addition, performance overhead of the proposed system was measured by comparing with another application that equips network functions directly. The result showed that overhead of transmitting/receiving each user data was slightly several thousand clocks, and this value can be negligible considering that fluctuation time of the packet processing within the kernel protocol stack and packet transferring on the actual network. As a result, the proposed system could not be performance bottleneck on practical network systems...|$|E
