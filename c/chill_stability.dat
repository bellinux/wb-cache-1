40|$|The {{preparation}} and properties of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and silica gel and the {{mechanisms by which}} they stabilize beer are discussed. In stabilized beer, <b>chill</b> <b>stability</b> was associated with lower protein sensitivity to precipitation with tannins. Approximately 60 % of the proteoses were of low molecular weight (< 10, 000 daltons). The most acidic of these proteoses were the least stable in solution, being precipitated from beer by cold treatment and adsorbents...|$|E
