40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} (RAs) help reduce information asymmetries between corporate issuers and investors. However, although information asymmetries are more severe in emerging than in developed countries, <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> bestow lower information {{content in the}} former. This is a problem since deserving corporations that are based in emerging countries require that the suitable rating they receive by a major RA—indispensable for them to issue debt in developed capital markets—be a credible signal to investors. Among the possible explanations, it is conjectured that this unsatisfactory situation might result from RAs not investing enough in collecting information on emerging countries' corporations. Here, an indicator is used of RAs' effort to gather information and test econometrically whether—controlling for both sovereign ratings and the corporate performance indicators used by RAs—higher effort affects <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings.</b> A negative relationship between RAs' effort and <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> is found in developed countries whereas the relationship is positive in emerging countries. While the result for developed countries is coherent with the hypothesis that RAs raise their effort vis-a-vis problematic corporations, the result for emerging countries is inconsistent with such hypothesis. This evidence suggests that inducing RAs to raise their effort is desirable for corporations in emerging countries. Credit risk, sovereign risk, corporate credit ratings,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} internal <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> as {{a means by which}} commercial banks condense their informational advantage and preserve it vis-à-vis a competitive lending market. In drawing on a unique data set collected from leading universal banks in Germany, we are able to evaluate the extent to which non-public information determines <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings.</b> As a point of departure, the paper describes a sample of rating systems currently in use, and points at methodological differences between them. Relying on a probit analysis, we are able to show that the set of qualitative, or soft, factors is not simply redundant with respect to publicly available accounting data. Rather, qualitative information tends to be decisive in at least one third of cases. It tends to improve the firms ’ overall corporate rating. In the case of conflicting rating changes, i. e. when qualitative and quantitative rating changes have opposing signs, quantitative criteria dominate the overall rating change. Furthermore, the more restrictive the weighting scheme as part of the rating methodology is, the stronger is the impact of qualitative information on the firms ’ overall rating. The implications of our results underline the need to define stringent rating standards, from both a risk management and a regulatory point of view...|$|E
40|$|Scholars of {{corporate}} governance have debated {{the relative importance}} of country and firm characteristics in understanding corporate governance variation across emerging economies. Using panel data and a number of model specifications, we shed new light on this debate. We find that firm characteristics are as important as and often meaningfully more important than country characteristics in explaining governance ratings variance. These results suggest that over recent years firms in emerging economies had more capability to rise above home-country peer firms in <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> than has been previously suggested. In fact, 16. 8 % percent of firms in emerging economies have been able to exceed the 75 th percentile of <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> in developed economies and 45. 5 % of firms in emerging economies have been able to exceed the 50 th percentile of <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> in developed economies. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> and firm performance, including both a global measure of corporate governance and four sub-indices corresponding Audit, Board Structure, Shareholder Rights and Compensation, provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> represent a proper approximation {{of the quality of}} corporate governance practices from inside the companies. This fact determines the investors which seek to hold shares in certain companies for a long term to be interested in the quality of corporate governance practices related to those companies. Using the cross-sectional multiple linear regression model for a random sample of 155 U. S. companies listed at New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and NYSE Amex Equities, belonging to twenty industries, in 2011, our research emphasizes a negative relationship between corporate governance global rating and firm performance. Also, we find a negative relationship between corporate governance sub-indices and firm performance, with some exceptions. However, when we removed the companies from financial and real estate sectors, respectively 29 companies, resulting another sample of 126 companies, the results support the same findings. This study reveals that the commercial <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings,</b> like Governance Risk Indicators (GRId), provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) are affected by measurement errors. This research is important to the shareholders and investors globally, who are using commercial <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings,</b> in order to identify and quantify the risks of their investments.

40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} areas of finance, academics and practitioners have devoted {{less attention to}} working capital management. Although working capital management {{is an integral part}} of corporate finance and contributes to the success of operational, financing and investment decisions, this area of corporate finance is relatively unexplored in the finance literature. To this effect, the Finance and Treasury Association of Australia has been promoting research in this area in order to raise awareness among academics and practitioners. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature and examine the latest working capital management practices of Australian firms. This thesis proposes a new approach that reconciles traditional working capital management with risk management principles. By extending the traditional working capital approach, this research develops a risk-adjusted working capital model and examines the determinants of working capital for Australian firms over the period 2003 - 2008. Using dynamic panel data estimation and median regression techniques, this study finds mixed evidence supportive of the risk-adjusted working capital model. Sectoral analysis reveals heterogeneous working capital patterns. It also identifies the sectors with high reliance on cash and inventory. After controlling for fundamental factors (such as sales, size, leverage and profitability), significant differences in working capital practices are apparent. Firms with low-leverage appear to hold higher cash holdings than high-leverage ones. The evidence provided does not support the window dressing hypothesis. The second section of this thesis examines the determinants of corporate profitability for publicly listed Australian firms by using three measures of corporate profitability namely, net profit, economic value added and return on assets. Through dynamic panel estimation technique, the determinants of corporate profitability are tested. Using panel least squares methods, median regression methodology and after controlling for sectoral variations, the findings shows that the determinants of corporate profitability vary across Australian sectors. The analysis is extended to control for firm’s fundamental characteristics such as working capital, <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> and performance, and the results are still supportive of heterogeneous determinants. It is discernable that firms with the worst working capital deficit exhibit a significant negative relationship to debt ratio. The same significant negative relationship is observed between firms with poor <b>corporate</b> governance <b>ratings</b> and debt ratio. Profitable firms on the other hand have a tendency to hold positive cash holdings, whereas non- profitable firms tend to exhibit negative cash holdings. Cash flow adequacy is one of the critical factors influencing corporate credit decisions. Since working capital deals with short-term cash flows, this thesis explores the interaction between working capital and <b>corporate</b> credit <b>ratings.</b> By employing working capital and firm’s characteristics as explanatory variables, this study examines the determinants of <b>corporate</b> credit <b>ratings.</b> Following a rigorous data selection process, <b>corporate</b> credit <b>ratings</b> of Australian firms are collected from Standard &amp; Poor’s for the period 2003 - 2008.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of credit rating agencies into emerging markets is examined {{with respect to}} the overall quality of informational signals provided by ratings to capital markets. <b>Corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> from six developing economies with relatively sophisticated financial sectors are modeled using ordered probit estimation techniques. The paper finds that the informational content in emerging-market corporate credit ratings is poor ipso facto and compared to similar models of developed market ratings, and suggests that the sample countries are subject to what is termed an ‘emerging market premium’. The consequences of this hypothesis for applications in development finance and regulatory regimes are briefly considered. Procyclicality is not found to be a problem, but this is attributed to clustering rather than through-the-cycle design. It is concluded that corporate credit ratings currently do not actively enhance efficient financial intermediation in developing financial markets and are not a sufficient criterion for risk allocation in regulatory regimes...|$|E

Further analysis is carried out in order to assess the total impact of corporate governance on stock price by eliminating any correlation between the independent accounting variables and corporate governance scores.

Specifically, we show that linking bank CARs to external ratings would {{have a series of}} undesirable effects for NHICs. First, since ratings are by far less widespread for banks and corporations in NHICs, bank CARs would be practically insensitive to improvements in the quality of assets, widening the gap between banks of equal financial strength located in higher and lower income countries. Second, bank and <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> in NHICs (as opposed to their homologues in high-income countries) are strongly linked to their sovereign ratings. This would expose bank capital requirements in NHICs to the same “pro-cyclical ” swings, which have characterized sovereign rating revision in the recent crisis episodes.

It has led to unprecedented environmental consequences. So this region needs to shift the conventional pattern of "develop first and then treat the pollution" to a trajectory of sustainable development. To that end, this paper examines a variety of policy responses, at national, regional and international levels, to deal with growing concerns about the environmental challenges in Asia. In the context of national responses, special attention is paid to the following issues: coordination between the central and local governments, market-based environmental instruments and industrial policies, tougher emissions standards for mobile and stationary sources and fuel quality, policies to promote energy efficiency and the use of clean energy and biofuels, the integration of environmental policies with economic and sectoral policies, and engagement of the private sector through e. g., ecolabelling, green government procurement, <b>corporate</b> <b>ratings</b> and disclosure programs, and drawing the support of financial institutions to promote improved corporate environmental performance.
