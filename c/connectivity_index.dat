5000|$|In {{the fields}} of {{chemical}} graph theory, molecular topology, and mathematical chemistry, a topological index {{also known as a}} <b>connectivity</b> <b>index</b> is a type of a molecular descriptor that is calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound.

Topological indices are used for example in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) in which the biological activity or other properties of molecules are correlated with their chemical structure.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Molecular {{connectivity}} is a topological descriptor of a molecule. It {{has been}} used as an independent variable to describe biological activities, physicochemical parameters (melting points, boiling points, partition coefficients) and chromatographic retention indices. There are inherent problems in using molecular connectivity. A zero connectivity term has two opposing meanings: 1) The connectivity term does not exist in a specific molecule and 2) The molecule is approaching infinite connectivity. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part I describes a study in which two methods of calculating molecular <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> were evaluated. These were the traditional reciprocal square root and nontraditional approach. In each case, two involving biological responses and a third using connectivity to predict octanol-water partition coefficients, the molecular <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> calculated by the traditional reciprocal square root method yielded superior results. This method of calculating indices was used for parts II IV of this thesis. Part II describes a study correlating molecular <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> with gas chromatographic retention indices (Kovats indices) on two sets of compounds, 144 saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and 53 monounsaturated hydrocarbons. Using subsets from both populations of hydrocarbons, it was shown that the actual regression models using <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> as independent variables are dependent on the particular compounds used to construct the regression equation. Part III compares the relative usefulness of partition coefficients and first order molecular <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> in predicting gas chromatographic retention indices. In general both are equally effective. Both approaches are incapable of distinguishing between sets of alkane isomers with differing branching positions, alkene isomers with differing locations of double bonds, and cis and trans alkene isomers. Part IV examines the relationship of molecular connectivity with extrapolated R[subscript M] and log k' values in liquid chromatography of two sets of phenolic compounds. While good correlations were obtained, it was shown again that the choice of significant molecular <b>connectivity</b> <b>indices</b> is dependent on the particular set of compounds being evaluated...|$|R

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to employ a}} linear combination of the <b>connectivity</b> <b>indexes</b> (LCCI) method to model a physicochemical property {{of a series of}} molecules is outlined throughout. The chosen physicochemical property is the solubility of 19 natural amino acids. This property is modeled with the aid of normal LCCI and of linear combinations of special constructions of connectivty indexes relating to different numbers of amino acids, including and excluding extreme outliers. The employed indexes are analyzed following their descriptive power of solubility of natural amino acids. A linear combination of reciprocal <b>connectivity</b> <b>indexes</b> (LCRCI) showed the best mapping of the water solubility of 16 amino acids while a model based on LCRCI, along with the use of supraconnectivity indexes for the amino acids proline, serine and arginine, achieved very good modeling of the water solubility of the entire set of n = 19 natural amino acids. Linear combinations of fragment connectivty indexes were also analyzed while linear combinations of orthogonal connectivty indexes (LCOCI) were used to improve the modeling and to detect dominant descriptors for this physicochemical property.
