Coal-tar pitch is a precursor of many useful carbon materials (e. g., graphite, carbon fibers, electrodes and matrices of carbon/ carbon composites). Modified coal-tar pitch (MCTP) was prepared using two different heat-treatment methods and their properties were characterized and compared. One was prepared using heat treatment in nitrogen gas; the other was prepared under a pressure of 350 mmHg in air. The MCTPs were investigated to determine several properties, including softening point, C/H ratio, <b>coke</b> yield, <b>formation</b> of anisotropic mesophase and viscosity. The MCTPs were subject to considerable changes in chemical composition due to condensation and polymerization in the used-as-received coal-tar pitch after heat-treatment under different conditions.

The MCTP formed by heat-treatment in nitrogen showed isotropic phases below 350 oC for 1 h of soaking time.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{is a major}} concern of jet engine development. During flight, engine components reach extreme temperatures as a result of frictional heating due to elevated airflow velocities. Jet fuel is used as a coolant to dissipate heat throughout the engine. This cooling process induces temperature and pressure increases within the fuel. At temperatures above 325 °F, hydrocarbon fuels start to become thermally unstable, leading to the formation of solid deposits, known as coke. This paper outlines an experimental study that was conducted to further examine the coking mechanism. Specifically, a complete experimental setup and procedure was designed to simulate <b>coke</b> deposit <b>formation</b> in a controlled laboratory environment.

The carbon morphologies formed on the sample surface could generally be classified as bulk graphite, carbon filaments and graphite particle clusters. Carbon filaments were nanoscale in size, and uniform. The particles in the graphite particle clusters were relatively large (0. 1 - 2. 5 ìm) and non-uniform.

40|$|SSZ- 13 {{materials}} have been synthesized with varying amounts of Al to produce samples with different concentrations of Brønsted acid sites, and consequently, these SSZ- 13 materials contain {{increasing numbers of}} paired Al heteroatoms with increasing Al content. These materials were then characterized and tested as catalysts for the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction at 400 °C and 100 % methanol conversion under atmospheric pressure. A SAPO- 34 sample was also synthesized and tested for comparison. SSZ- 13 materials exhibited significant differences in MTO reactivity as Si/Al ratios varied. Reduced Al content (higher Si/Al ratio) and, consequently, fewer paired Al sites led to more stable light olefin selectivities, with a reduced initial transient period, lower initial propane selectivities, and longer catalyst lifetime. To further support the importance of paired Al sites {{in the formation of}} propane during this initial transient period, a series of experiments was conducted wherein an H-SSZ- 13 sample was exchanged with Cu^(2 +), steamed, and then back-exchanged to the H form. The H-SSZ- 13 sample exhibited high initial propane selectivity, while the steamed H-SSZ- 13, the Cu^(2 +) -exchanged SSZ- 13 sample, and the steamed Cu-SSZ- 13 sample did not, as expected since steaming selectively removes paired Al sites and Cu^(2 +) exchanges onto these sites. However, when it was back-exchanged to the proton form, the steamed Cu-SSZ- 13 sample still exhibited the high initial alkane selectivity and transient period typical of the higher Al content materials. This is attributed to protection of paired Al sites during steaming via the Cu^(2 +) cation. Post-reaction coke analyses reveal that the degree of methylation for each aromatic species increases with increasing Si/Al in SSZ- 13. Further, SAPO- 34 produces more polycyclic species than SSZ- 13 samples. From these data, the paired Al site content appears to be correlated with both MTO reaction behavior and <b>coke</b> species <b>formation</b> in SSZ- 13 samples...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental behaviour of granular materials in packed/moving beds under simplified blast furnace conditions. Such study {{has a significant}} impact on the development of new technology such as pulverized coal injection and the performance of blast furnace operation. Experiments have shown that a number of interesting phenomena appear in blast furnace operation. These phenomena involve rich granular dynamics which currently attract strong interest from a wide scientific and engineering. However, previous work on this area, limited by the research techniques, is predominantly at large scales focusing on phenomenological descriptions, but rarely touching on the basic fundamentals governing these phenomena. A novel discrete element simulation at an individual particle level can overcome these problems. For this purpose, this work conducts a systematic study of these important phenomena, including crater <b>formation,</b> <b>coke</b> collapse, creep motion and particle percolation, by use of the discrete element method (DEM). The experiments and simulations conducted in the impact of a particle stream onto a particle bed using a 20 slot model suggest that the DEM can reproduce the experimental results well under comparative conditions. The crater size is shown to be affected by the discharging rate, discharging height and materials properties, and is related to the ratio of the input energy from the falling stream to the inertial energy from the original packing. Fundamental understanding of coke collapse based on three different configurations: batch charging, self loading and load impact have been investigated. It was found that coke collapse is a kind of continuous avalanche due to top layer particles spreading. Apparent frozen layer under rapidly flowing layer is not stationary and slowly creep motion can be detected at an arbitrary depth. The mean velocity of creep motion decays exponentially with depth. Percolation happens due to both gravity and strain. The percolation velocity under gravity is much greater than that under shear. Size ratio effect is most significant. For size ratio smaller than threshold gravity induced percolation dominate otherwise shear due to the descending of the packed bed. Additionally, this work demonstrates the value of DEM as a tool for complementing experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{and steel}} making is an energy {{intensive}} industrial sector using mainly coal as the heat source and reduction agent. The industry {{gives rise to}} about 10 % of the anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in the world. Due to the challenge for CO 2 mitigation, interest for agricultural waste (palm and coconut shells) use as a renewable energy and carbon source as heating agent and reducing agent contributes to energy conservation and emission reduction, and can partially replace coal and coke. In the present study, the conventional material investigated was metallurgical coke which was blended with different proportions of palm and coconut shells as well as agricultural waste chars {{in order to reduce}} the waste in the landfill. Metallurgical coke, palm shell/coke blends and coconut shell/coke blends were combusted in a drop tube furnace (DTF) at 1200 °C under 20 % O 2 and 80 % N 2 gas mixture while palm char was devolatilized at 450 °C under N 2 atmosphere. Subsequently, the residual materials were put in contact with an EAF iron oxide rich slags and their interfacial reactions and phenomena have been studied at 1550 °C in a horizontal tube furnace under inert atmosphere (1 L/min Ar) with off gases measured using an IR analyser. The initial devolatilization and the subsequent step of combustion of these samples are conducted in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) and in a Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA), respectively, while the sessile drop approach was used to investigate the interfacial reactions taking place in the slag/carbon region. A Thermogravimetric Analyser coupled with Mass Spectrometer (TGA-MS) was also used to study the behavior of coke and agricultural wastes at high temperatures in order to understand the thermal behavior and gas products that evolved at high temperatures. The weight loss profiles, gas formation and products distribution were significantly different between the coke and agricultural waste samples. It was found that more gases were released from agricultural waste than from coke that participated in the subsequent carbon/slag reactions. In the gas phase reaction studies, the blends containing agricultural waste materials indicated higher combustion efficiencies compared to coke alone with an improved surface area resulted from volatile matter removal. The role of chemical structure and properties, as well as inorganic matter in agricultural waste blends also influenced the combustion performance. The rate of devolatilization appears to improve the coke/palm shell blends burnout as well as its foaming behavior when put in contact with an iron oxide rich slag. For carbon/slag interactions, experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1550 °C) with off gases (CO, CO 2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements and estimation of slag foam volumes were calculated using specialized software. Off gas analyses following the carbon/slag interfacial reactions have been measured for all the carbonaceous materials and significantly different gas concentrations have been observed. The rates of total gas generation (CO+CO 2) from palm char was comparable to those seen in coke; however the gases released from palm chars were extent over a longer period of time and allowed their entrapment in the slag matrix, enhancing the volume of the slag. A slower rate of FeO reduction is seen when coke reacted with the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag, while the palm shell blends showed a faster reduction. Independent of the carbon material used as a substrate, the final stage of reaction reveals comparable contact angles due to similar extents of reduction and Fe deposition at the interface. The steady gas generation seen in palm char compared to <b>coke</b> allows the <b>formation</b> of a highly porous particle, promoting gasification and allowing more gases to be trapped in the slag phase.

Meanwhile, benzene, which is applied into the manufacturing of complex chemicals, is an important chemical intermediate in petrochemical industry. Direct methane dehydroaromatization (DHA) under non-oxidative condition is an alternative approach to convert methane into benzene. The reaction mechanism is generally considered a synergistic result of metal sites and Bronsted acid sites of HZSM- 5.

The effects of process variables such as temperature and gas composition (He dilution, CH 4 /CO 2 ratio) on the <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> rate were determined. The reactivity of H- 2 On several kinds of carbon was also investigated. The morphology of the coke was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The induction times for <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> were significantly affected by temperature and by the CO content in the feed gas. The results of catalytic tests {{were consistent with the}} TG measurements. The behaviour of SiO 2 and La 2 O 3 supported Ni catalysts agree with a mechanism in which the lanthana support {{plays an important role in}} the carbon deposition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coke</b> <b>formation</b> rates under propane {{dehydrogenation}} reaction {{conditions on}} a used monolithic Pt/¿-Al 2 O 3 catalyst have been experimentally determined in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) {{as a function}} of time on stream covering wide temperature and concentration ranges. For relatively short times on stream, especially at low temperatures and low propylene concentrations, a remarkable initial quadratic increase has been observed in the <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> rates versus time with a high apparent propylene reaction order. After longer times on stream the <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> rate decreases to a constant residual coke growth above approximately 12 wt. % coke content. The experimental data have been successfully described by a kinetic rate expression based on a mechanistic dual coke growth model. In this model it has been assumed that initially coke precursor is formed via a propylene oligomerisation process, explaining the observed auto-catalysis for short times on stream...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermodynamic}} {{features of}} hydrogen production via chemical looping reforming of waste cooking oil were studied at atmospheric pressure using Gibbs free energy minimization, {{accounting for the}} possibility of <b>coke</b> <b>formation.</b> The synthesis gas composition was determined as a function of reforming temperature (400 – 1000  °C), steam to carbon ratio (S/C, 1 – 14) and NiO to carbon ratio (NiO/C, 0 – 2). To evaluate the thermodynamically plausible products, the study started with an expanded product set of approximately 30 by-products. The results show that <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> can be thermodynamically inhibited by increasing the S/C ratio and/or the NiO/C ratio. The conditions that maximize hydrogen production, minimize methane and carbon monoxide content as well as avoid <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> at thermoneutral conditions were found to be S/C =  5, T =  600  °C and NiO/C =  0. 493. Under these conditions, a hydrogen yield of 144. 3  mol/kg of soybean waste cooking oil can be obtained, which appears to be an attractive result for starting experimental research...|$|E
40|$|The reactor {{material}} strongly affects <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> during {{steam cracking}} of hydrocarbons. Therefore, {{in the past}} decade several specialized reactor materials have been developed that have proven to be efficient in reducing <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> for ethane steam cracking. However, their beneficial anticoking properties are questioned when heavier feedstocks such as naphtha are cracked. Therefore, the effect of the composition of the reactor material has been investigated for ethane and naphtha cracking in an electrobalance setup under industrially relevant conditions. A significant reduction of <b>coke</b> <b>formation</b> is obtained for specialized alloys compared to typical Fe-Cr-Ni heat resistant steels when a sulfur-free naphtha is cracked. A thin layer of alumina on the surface along with manganese chromite provides the highest resistance to coking, as was demonstrated by the SEM and EDX analyses. The decrease in coking rate translates in a run length increase of 50 % for a typical naphtha furnace equipped with reactors made out of an Al-enhanced alloy instead of typically applied heat resistant steel...|$|E
