5000|$|On December 16, Modrikamen, {{the lawyer}} winning the case, changed the address-to-which-{{correspondence}}-is-to-be-addressed of his clients. Up till then, {{his office was}} the <b>correspondence</b> <b>address.</b> The change means that all further correspondence has to be mailed to each client individually (he represents over two thousand clients). Also, {{as some of the}} clients live abroad, a different set of terms now applies, as to the time in which cases have to be handled. Also, the correspondence has to be translated into the addressee's language. As a consequence, it becomes less likely that any 'third party' action to be instituted by the government will be handled this year. Also, it is reported that the FPIM had indeed appealed for a substitution of judges, but as it had done so only after the ruling, this was dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Thursday February 12, {{trade in}} the share was resumed, opening at €1.10 (and closing at €1.11), down from the €1.32 close on Tuesday. It is {{announced}} that the Belgian government will meet {{with representatives of the}} Dutch, French and Luxembourg governments, as well as of BNP Paribas and Fortis. A joint press conference by the Belgian and French Prime Ministers will follow. In parliament the Prime Minister was engaged in a fierce defence, particularly in the matter of the attempt to vote the 125 million non-voting shares. He emphasized that the government had inquired into the matter, but that the actual push to have the meeting approve this was done by Fortis Bank, not by the government. All the opposition parties demanded that the Minister of Finance step down. Modrikamen achieved an additional victory in court: he was allowed to change the <b>correspondence</b> <b>address</b> of all the shareholders he represented to their individual addresses (as he did on December 16). A Dutch lawyer requested an injunction against the Dutch state: as the sale of the Dutch parts of Fortis is now illegitimate, any further actions concerning these parts any further actions should be frozen, pending the renegotiations and court actions.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, NextMedia {{reportedly}} sold 70% stake of NextMedia's subsidiary Colored World Holdings (CWH, {{incorporated in}} the British Virgin Islands) to Sum Tat Ventures (STV, {{incorporated in the}} British Virgin Islands), a private company 100% owned by Jimmy Lai. [...] CWH was estimated to have net asset value of US$6.1 million. STV paid US$100 million in cash for 70% stake of CWH. In 2013, STV paid another US$20 million in cash for the remaining 30% stake of CWH. [...] CWH itself had its assets sold in 2011, and ceased operation in 2011. Thus, in total, STV paid US$120 million in cash for CWH. Very little information is available for STV. However, on Jimmy Lai's Form 3B disclosure form, STV is listed as having the same <b>correspondence</b> <b>address</b> as NextMedia, at 1/F., 8 Chun Ying Street, Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate, Tsueng Kwan O, NT, Hong Kong. [...] The purchase of CWH was largely seen as a transfer of cash from Lai to NextMedia to offset NextMedia's continual losses during that time, and to boost assets as collateral for NextMedia to obtain additional loans in the future. However, as US$120 million is approximately 1/10 of Lai's net worth, some speculate real liquidity of Lai's personal assets, and whether Lai made other loan guarantees to obtain such an amount.|$|E

40|$|The threat on the {{survival}} of animal species due to intensive use of natural resources is incorporated within resource management models, paying special attention to uncertainty regarding the conditions that lead to extinction. The {{manner in which the}} potential benefits forgone due to the species extinction (denoted extinction penalty) induce more conservative exploitation policies is studied in detail. When the extinction penalty is ignored, the optimal policy is to drive the resource stock to a particular equilibrium level from any initial state. When the extinction penalty is considered and the conditions that lead to extinction are not fully understood (i. e., involve uncertainty), an interval of equilibrium states is identified, which depends on the penalty and the immediate extinction risk. <b>Correspondence</b> <b>address...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{liquidity}} risk in the pricing of corporate bonds. We show that liquidity is a priced factor in an APT style model for the expected returns on corporate bonds. The exposures of corporate bond returns to fluctu-ations in treasury bond liquidity and equity market liquidity help to explain the credit spread puzzle. The total estimated liquidity premium is around 45 basis points for long-maturity investment grade bonds. For speculative grade bonds, which have higher exposures to the liquidity factors, the liquidity premium is around 100 basis points. The liquidity factors are also important for the equity market, where they have some explanatory power for the cross section of equity returns. ∗We are grateful to Inquire Europe for financial support. <b>Correspondence</b> <b>address</b> of both authors...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{literature}} on Central Bank independence provides many informal discussions on the optimal institutional design of the Central Bank, {{the development of a}} formal framework to address this issue is still a very much open area. This paper contributes to filling this gap by studying monetary policy making when (i) decisions in the central bank are taken by a committee, rather than a single indi-vidual, and (ii) the government has some power over the appointment of central bankers. It is shown that, when the members of the central bank committee have staggered terms and do not vote strategically, the following results hold: 1) Low inflation is more likely to arise under collective, rather than monolithic, decision making. 2) The influence of the government over the appointment of central bankers translates into influence over the choice of monetary policy itself. 3) The ability of the government to affect monetary policy is weakened when the monetary authority is a committee instead of a single individual. ∗University of Maryland. <b>Correspondence</b> <b>address...</b>|$|E
