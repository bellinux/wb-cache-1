5|$|Antoni Gaudi {{was born}} in 1852 in Riudoms or Reus, to the <b>coppersmith</b> Francesc Gaudí i Serra (1813–1906) and Antònia Cornet i Bertran (1819–1876). He was the {{youngest}} of five children, of whom three survived to adulthood: Rosa (1844–1879), Francesc (1851–1876) and Antoni. Gaudí's family originated in the Auvergne region in southern France. One of his ancestors, Joan Gaudí, a hawker, moved to Catalonia in the 17th century; possible origins of Gaudí's family name include Gaudy or Gaudin.|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a <b>coppersmith</b> in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} principled {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} matrix size in some applications of <b>Coppersmith's</b> lattice method for finding roots of modular polynomial equations. It relies on {{an analysis of the}} actual performance of <b>Coppersmith's</b> attack for smaller parameter sizes, which {{can be thought of as}} "focus group" testing. When applied to the small-exponent RSA problem, it reduces lattice dimensions and consequently running times (sometimes by factors of two or more). We also argue that existing metrics (such as enabling condition bounds) are not as important as often thought for measuring the true performance of attacks based on <b>Coppersmith's</b> method. Finally, experiments are given to indicate that certain lattice reductive algorithms (such as Nguyen-Stehlé's L 2) may be particularly well-suited for <b>Coppersmith's</b> method.

25|$|Pann {{was born}} {{sometime}} between 1794 and 1798, in Sliven, Rumelia (in today's Bulgaria). According to some accounts, his mother, Tomaida, was an ethnic Greek, while his father, Pantoleon Petrov, was Bulgarian; {{it is known}} that he worked as a <b>coppersmith</b> bucket-maker, which makes it likely that he was a Romani of the Kalderash caste. In Romania, the latter view is notably supported by Romani community activists, who cite Pann among the most prominent Romani artists. This view is also accepted by some Romanian authors. Various other interpretations state that Pantoleon Petrov, who died during Anton Pann's childhood, was Bulgarian, Aromanian, or Romanian. The writer, who was the youngest of Petrov and Tomaida's three sons, eventually adopted the family name Pann, as a colloquial contraction of his father's given name.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the arrival}} of the first railroads in 1847, few mills and {{manufacturing}} facilities were established in Indianapolis. One of the town's earliest gristmills, built in 1821, was a predecessor to the Acme-Evans Company. The Indianapolis Steam Mill Company, the town's first incorporated business, completed a new mill along the White River in 1831, but it closed in 1835. Other early industrial enterprises included a sawmill, flourmill, and a wool-carding factory. The Indianapolis Foundry, the town's first, began operations in 1833; the Indianapolis Brewery, another first for the town, was established the following year. With improved rail transportation in the 1850s, factory-made goods became more readily available in Indianapolis, and new factories were built in addition to several beef- and pork-packing plants. Iron manufacturing also expanded in the city, and a new brass foundry and a <b>coppersmith</b> arrived in the mid-1850s. Indianapolis's first gasworks was completed in 1851, and the Indianapolis Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying city residents with natural gas for lighting in early 1852, but natural gas usage was slow to expand in the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Jewish community in Włodawa is first recorded {{in connection with the}} Lublin fair of 1531. By 1623 Włodawa had a representative in the Council of the Four Lands. The community's prosperity was due to the granting of a city charter in 1534. For much of the early modern period, a time when the Polish-speaking community of the region was predominately engaged in agriculture, Jews appear to have composed much {{of the population of the}} city, engaged in all forms of craft production and trade. The community was devastated by the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, but afterwards was re-established and rebuilt. By 1765 the town had 630 Jews. In 1693, the town had 197 dwellings, 89 of which were owned by Jewish families. The census of 1773 records Jewish physicians, butchers, millers, barbers, goldsmiths, tailors, furriers, merchants, and carters, in addition to one Jew in each of the trades of <b>coppersmith,</b> cobbler, glazier, chandler, and wheelwright. There were also 8 Jewish schoolmasters, 2 educators, a cantor, a bass player and a cymbal player. There were 2,236 Jews in 1827 and 6,706 in 1907.|$|E

40|$|We draw a new {{connection}} between <b>Coppersmith's</b> method for finding small solutions to polynomial congruences modulo integers {{and the capacity}} theory of adelic subsets of algebraic curves. <b>Coppersmith's</b> method uses lattice basis reduction to construct an auxiliary polynomial that vanishes at the desired solutions. Capacity theory provides a toolkit for proving when polynomials with certain boundedness properties do or do not exist. Using capacity theory, we prove that <b>Coppersmith's</b> bound for univariate polynomials is optimal {{in the sense that}} there are no auxiliary polynomials of the type he used that would allow finding roots of size N^ 1 /d+ϵ for monic degree-d polynomials modulo N. Our results rule out the existence of polynomials of any degree and do not rely on lattice algorithms, thus eliminating the possibility of even superpolynomial-time improvements to <b>Coppersmith's</b> bound. We extend this result to constructions of auxiliary polynomials using binomial polynomials, and rule out the existence of any auxiliary polynomial of this form that would find solutions of size N^ 1 /d+ϵ unless N has a very small prime factor...|$|R
