They used gas systems such as ammonia (R-717) or sulfur dioxide (R-764), which {{occasionally}} leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic refrigerants such as Freon-12 (R-12) were introduced. However, R-12 damaged the ozone layer, causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a thermostatic chamber for the performance analysis of commercial vapor compression refrigerators. The thermostatic chamber and the refrigerators are equipped {{with a range of}} sensors to monitor respectively the temperature and humidity inside and outside the chamber and the thermodynamic conditions of the working fluid, i. e. temperature, pressure and mass flow rate, in the circuit critical points. The acquisition of sensor data and the refrigerator performance evaluation are provided thanks to a real-time and automatic interface developed adopting LabView© integrated development environment (IDE). The thermostatic chamber is adopted to compare the performance of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a as environmentally-friendly alternatives to the R 404 a, the current working fluid in the considered <b>commercial</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Indeed, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of R 404 a is approximately twice the value of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a. The purpose of the experimental campaign is verify whether the R 407 f and R 410 a refrigerants allow comparable thermodynamic performances to R 404 a without requiring substantial component replacements.   Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the description of the developed thermostatic chamber and the system setup for the experimental campaign of a commercial vapor compression refrigerator. The chamber is composed by a 180 x 180 x 220 cm stainless steel climatic room with an internal volume of 5. 12 m 3, properly insulated by 100 mm of expanded polyurethane. The thermostatic chamber integrates the commercial vapor compression refrigerator, the refrigerant charging equipment and all the necessary sensors to monitor the environment conditions and evaluate the system performance. Originality/Value Global warming concerns have increased the efforts of the scientific community to identify alternative refrigerants in air conditioning systems with lower environmental impact and many results in the literature show their technical and economical feasibility. However, the introduction of these refrigerant alternatives in industrial products encounters some difficulties and, nowadays, several commercial refrigerators still adopt working fluids with a significant global warming potential. In this context, this paper presents the development and setup of a thermostatic chamber that can be adapted to real refrigerators to compare the thermodynamic performance of different refrigerants. An automatic control and data acquisition systems allow to test the thermostatic chamber in several technical configurations, i. e. ambient temperature and operating temperatures etc. The experimental campaign, applied to a commercial vapor compression refrigerator, compares the performance of environmentally-friendly refrigerants alternatives, i. e. R 407 f and R 410 a, to the currently adopted working fluid, i. e. R 404 a. The results may lead the company to launch onto the market a similar <b>commercial</b> <b>refrigerator</b> adopting a working fluid with a lower environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|Axial flow {{fans are}} often the largest {{contributor}} to the noise emitted from <b>commercial</b> <b>refrigerator</b> systems. This has driven the demand for quieter, yet higher performance axial flow fans. Turbulent fluid motion and aerodynamic forces interacting with the fan blades generate noise as the fan rotates. The aerodynamic noise emitted from a fan can be modelled {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy which are typically proportional to the computational cost. Application of a fan performance model to an optimisation algorithm can be used to develop new and higher performing fan blades. However, there is currently no rapid method to generate an optimal fan design of specified performance. The method developed in this project was experimentally validated and shown to be able to predict the flow rate accurately; however, the fan noise prediction was unsuccessful. Noise source identification showed that the dominant fan noise source was incident turbulence noise which was neglected in the aeroacoustic modelling and explains the poor noise prediction. Knowing the dominant noise source allows for future modelling to include all relevant physics which will allow for more accurate modelling that will increase the performance of axial flow fans and reduce refrigeration noise. This study also showed that fans with aerofoil blade shapes have superior performance to fans with cambered plate blades, which are commonly used in commercial refrigerators. ii...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of non-linear multi-objective optimization is conducted {{in order to}} define a set of process parameters (i. e. load paths) for defect-free tube hydroforming. A generalized forming severity indicator that combines both the conventional forming limit diagram (FLD) and the forming limit stress diagram (FLSD) was adopted to detect excessive thinning, necking/splitting and wrinkling in the numerical simulation of formed parts. In order to rapidly explore and capture the Pareto frontier for multiple objectives, two optimization strategies were developed: normal boundary intersection (NBI) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based {{on the concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 dominated solutions 2 ̆ 2. The NBI method produced a uniformly distributed set of solutions. For the MOGA method, a stochastic Kriging model was used as a surrogate model. Furthermore, the MOGA constraint-handling technique was improved, Kriging model updating was automated and a hybrid global-local search was implemented in order to rapidly explore the Pareto frontier. Both piece-wise linear and pulsating pressure paths were investigated for several case studies, including straight tube, pre-bent tube and industrial tube hydroforming. For straight tube hydroforming, the optimal load path was obtained using the NBI method and it showed a smaller corner radius compared to that predicted by the commercial program LS-OPT 4. 0. Moreover, the hybrid method coupling global search (MOGA) and local search (sequential quadratic programming: SQP) was applied for straight tube hydroforming, and the results showed a significant improvement in terms of the stress safety margin and reduced local thinning. For a <b>commercial</b> <b>refrigerator</b> door handle, the MOGA method was utilized to inversely analyze the loading path and the calculated path correlated well with the production path.

Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of light characteristics at the single- and few photon level {{plays a key}} role in many quantum optics applications. Often photodetection is preceded with the transmission of quantum light over long distances in optical fibers with their low loss window near 1550 nm. Nonetheless, the detection of the photonic states at telecommunication wavelengths via avalanche photodetectors has long been facing severe restrictions. Only recently, demonstrations of the first free-running detector techniques in the telecommunication band have lifted the demand of synchronizing the signal with the detector. Moreover, moderate cooling is required to gain single-photon sensitivity with these detectors. Here we implement a liquid-nitrogen cooled negative-feedback avalanche diode (NFAD) at telecommunication wavelengths and investigate the properties of this highly flexible, free-running single-photon sensitive detector. Our realization of cooling provides a large range of stable operating temperatures and has advantages over the relatively bulky <b>commercial</b> <b>refrigerators</b> that have been used before. We determine the region of NFAD working parameters most suitable for single-photon sensitive detection enabling a direct plug-in of our detector to a true photon counting task.
