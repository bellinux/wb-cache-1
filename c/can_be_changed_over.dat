Spin wave excitations provide a powerful method for studying exchange interactions and spin configurations.

40|$|Plasmons, {{which are}} {{collective}} charge oscillations, offer {{the potential to}} use optical signals in nano-scale electric circuits. Recently, plasmonics using graphene have attracted interest, particularly because of the tunable plasmon frequency through the carrier density n. However, the n dependence of the plasmon velocity is weak (∝ n^ 1 / 4) {{and it is difficult}} to tune the frequency over orders of magnitude. Here, we demonstrate that the velocity of plasmons in graphene <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> two orders of magnitude by applying a magnetic field B and by the presence/absence of a gate; at high B, edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs), which are plasmons localized at the sample edge, are formed and their velocity depends on B and the gate screening effect.

New paradigms that devolve management control and responsibility to multiple actors in the system (users or automated agents) have therefore emerged.

Complex spin configurations are examined for many different systems and are shown to arise from a simple competition between exchange and Zeeman energies.

The authors also discuss the dynamic behavior of magnetic multilayers. Emphasis is placed on spin waves in magnetic multilayers with canted spin configurations and the softening of modes at magnetic phase transitions. Furthermore they show that spin wave excitations provide a powerful method for studying exchange interactions and spin configurations.

40|$|Addition {{of a novel}} anionic surfactant, namely lauryl {{polyoxyethylene}} sulfate, to an aqueous-acetonitrile electrolyte {{makes it}} possible to separate nonionic organic compounds by capillary electrophoresis. Separation is based on differences in the association between analytes and the surfactant. Highly hydrophobic compounds such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons are well separated by this new surfactant. Migration times of analytes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> readily <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> an unusually large range by varying the additive concentration and the proportion of acetonitrile in the electrolyte. Several examples are given, including the separation of four methylbenz[a]anthracene isomers and the separation of normal and deuterated acetophenone. The effect of adding this new surfactant to the acidic electrolyte was also investigated. Incorporation of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in the electrolyte is shown to dynamically coat the capillary and reverse electroosmotic flow. Chiral recognition mechanism is studied using novel synthetic surfactants as chiral selectors, which are made from amino acids reacting with alkyl chloroformates. A satisfactory separation of both inorganic and organic anions is obtained using electrolyte solutions as high as 5 M sodium chloride using direct photometric detection. The effect of various salts on electrophoretic and electroosmotic mobility is further discussed. Several examples are given under high-salt conditions...|$|R

Unlike traditional epitaxial strain induced by substrates, the strain from bending will not suffer from critical thickness limitation, crystalline quality variation, and substrate clamping, and more importantly, it provides a more intrinsic and reliable way to study strain-controlled behaviors in functional oxide systems.
