50|$|A {{telephone}} <b>card,</b> <b>calling</b> card or phonecard for short, is {{a credit}} card size plastic or paper card, {{used to pay for}} telephone services (often international or long distance calling). It is not necessary to have the physical card except with a stored-value system; knowledge of the access telephone number to dial and the PIN is sufficient. Standard cards which can be purchased and used without any sort of account facility give a fixed amount of credit and are discarded when used up; rechargeable cards can be topped up, or collect payment in arrears. The system for payment {{and the way in which}} the card is used to place a telephone call vary from card to card.|$|E

5000|$|A cheerful {{character}} who always wore a rose choker which her father gave her. He {{told her that}} if she ever took it off, she would be punished. Anise was unable to take it off until it disappeared after Ninufa, a bat-like-creature, bowled her over. After Ninufa scurried away, Anise found that she was holding a Red card. She ignores the fact and runs after Ninufa to get her choker back when a monster attacks. Mr. Itsushi, the librarian, tells her that she must kiss the card she was holding. When she does so, Kaede appears out of the <b>card</b> <b>calling</b> her [...] "master". Anise becomes the Dominion, able to summon any of the four rose knights. However, whenever the knights use their power, they drain the life force from her blood. This causes Anise to believe that becoming the Dominion is her punishment for losing her choker. Although the choker she was wearing only brought Anise in the center of attention, for fear of her father's punishment she begins searching for it {{with the help of her}} Rose Knights. Apparently one of her special powers as a Dominion as that she is able to call forth a black whip-like rope filled with thorns to use to beat them into submission, or to collar them (much to the delight of the black and white roses).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Last {{year the}} number of users who used basic voice call over IP {{networks}} considerably increased. Voice over IP (VoIP) network must provide intelligent services such as Free Phone (FP), Account <b>Card</b> <b>Calling</b> (ACC) and others. It is needed to evaluate {{the influence of the}} new intelligent services on performance of SIP proxy server. Each intelligent service has own interaction between the intelligent network nodes and SIP proxy server. The analytical model of SIP proxy server which operates like soft SSP node was proposed in the paper. Development of analytical SIP proxy server model was based on Jackson's theorem. The calculation of the influence of services FP on SIP proxy server of the given network was carried out by using the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} for telecom applications must satisfy the same demanding requirements {{as the other}} components in the telecom network with respect to availability, scalability, and real-time performance. Unfortunately {{it is difficult to}} provide state-of-the-art realtime service without sacrificing the other. ClustRa is a parallel and distributed telecom DBMS designed as a careful balance between these requirements. The filosophy has been to provide sufficient real-time capabilities for telecom applications. This paper describes the architecture of ClustRa, its real-time features and a performace evaluation. 1 Introduction ClustRa is a telecom database management system [7]. It is built to meet the combined requirements from modern telecommunication applications like intelligent networks (IN) and mobile telephony. IN was introduced in the 80 's to support new types of telecom services, e. g. terminal- (UPT) and service mobility, virtual private nets, and credit <b>card</b> <b>calling.</b> To achieve rapid d [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new way in which one can view and tackle a {{relevant}} class of feature interaction problems in telephony. One can view them as mode confusions, which are {{well known in the}} human-computer interface of shared-control systems. In telephony, call control is shared between users and many modern telephony features. Some examples are call screening, call forwarding, voice mail, and credit <b>card</b> <b>calling.</b> We find that a considerable number of undesired telephony feature interactions in the feature interaction benchmark of Cameron et al. are also shared-control mode confusions. We therefore adapt the known measures from the shared-control area for preventing mode confusions and apply them against undesired feature interactions in telephony. To prove our idea, we show how the concerned feature interaction problems in the benchmark can be avoided. Attention to mode confusions helps to design features with less undesired surprises. Key words: mode confusion, feature interaction, telephony, human-computer interface, shared-control systems...|$|E

The world-wide nature of telecommunication services requires that the systems are open distributed systems. We examined the services and service features described in ITU-T Capability Set 1 from the ODP information viewpoint.
