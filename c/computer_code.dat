5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the <b>computer</b> <b>code</b> to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their <b>computer</b> <b>code</b> and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, a programmer, and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green <b>computer</b> <b>code)</b> were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide a sense of the game's world.|$|E

25|$|Reactions in {{chemical}} processes are either unimolecular or bimolecular. The rate of a unimolecular reaction is an average over a vast ensemble {{of the rate}} coefficients for the microscopic events of collisional energy transfer and of reaction of a completely isolated molecule. Gilbert's {{work in the field}} of unimolecular processes started with the development of theorems for this relationship. These theorems are elegant developments in matrix algebra, proving relations that had been previously known only for particular cases. His theorems also became the basis for numerical methods that he developed to perform the requisite calculations.
