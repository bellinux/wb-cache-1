Charge transfer from the carbon pyrrolidine ring to the C 60 -cages is observed and this charge redistribution influences not only the carbon atoms but also the nitrogen. The major influence of different functionalization groups on the pyrrolidine nitrogen is whether or not they lead to quaternisation while no differences could be detected for different groups (methyl group or alkyl chain) producing one or the other configuration.

50|$|In {{describing}} Savoy style Lindy Hop, observers {{note that}} the follower is led out of the basic Swingout sideways as a default. This is not the case, however, as leading a follow out backwards or forwards is just as likely. Savoy style is also said to be characterized by a pronounced downwards 'bounce', which is again something of a misnomer, as different dancers employed varying degrees and types of 'bounce', and observers of Frankie Manning have noted changes in his own dancing style in this respect over the years. Despite these comments, {{it is important to}} {{note that the}} 'bounce' described is characteristic of many African American vernacular dance forms. One of the clearest distinctions between Hollywood and Smooth style Lindy Hop and Savoy style Lindy Hop is the open 'connection' and relative freedom of the follower to improvise within the structure of the Swingout in particular. Again, this technical difference varies between individual dancers, and between teachers today. Historians may also note that Hollywood style, while often characterized by a more intense connection (characterized at its extreme by <b>counter</b> <b>balance),</b> also featured extensive variations and individual improvisation within the swingout in other instances.|$|E

This reluctance developed because there existed general upper-class fear that if redistricting to meet population changes were carried out, voters in large, expanding or expanded urban areas would vote for confiscatory wealth redistribution that would severely inhibit the power of business interests who controlled state and city governments early in the century. Of the forty-eight states then in the Union, only seven twice redistricted even one chamber of their legislature following both the 1930 and the 1940 Censuses. Oregon did not redistrict between 1907 and 1960, Illinois not between 1910 and 1955, while Alabama and Tennessee {{had at the time}} of Reynolds not redistricted since 1901.
