40|$|Apple scab is {{the most}} {{important}} disease of apples in New York State where apples are grown on more than 44, 000 acres. Apple growers control apple scab by applying fungicides to prevent infections on leaves and fruit. Growers can avoid unnecessary fungicide sprays if they know when the apple scab ascospores in the over-wintering leaf litter will be released. Eliminating one fungicide spray on all of the apple acreage in New York would save growers approximately $ 1 million each year. However, eliminating a spray when it is really needed could cause losses equal to at least four times that potential savings. In a project funded by the New York State IPM program, samples of apple leaf litter from eight locations in six counties around New York State were assessed at critical times during spring to determine the status of apple scab ascospore maturation and release. Each of the 12 assessments involved detailed microscopic examinations of the fungal spore-producing structures after they had been removed from the leaf litter. The lead scientist provided results to extension educators who then used e-mail, <b>code-a-phones,</b> faxes, radio spots, and newsletters to inform apple growers about results of scab spore assessments...|$|R
