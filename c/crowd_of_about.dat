5|$|Resistance to the {{excise tax}} {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 100 people in Washington County. On {{the night of}} November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 100 journalists, supporters, {{and friends}} who had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E

50|$|Die Nullfünfer {{previously}} {{played in}} Stadion am Bruchweg, built in 1928, and modified {{several times over}} the years to hold a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> over 20,300 spectators. Averaging <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 15,000 while in the 2. Bundesliga, the team's hard won recent success had them regularly filling their venue.

5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|The Gentlemen's Singles competition, {{the only}} {{event of the}} championship, was contested on grass courts by 22 players who each paid one guinea to participate. The tournament started on 9 July 1877, and the final – delayed for three days by rain – was played on 19 July {{in front of a}} <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 200 people who each paid an entry fee of one shilling. The winner {{received}} 12 guineas in prize money and a silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas, donated by the sports magazine The Field. Spencer Gore, a 27-year-old rackets player from Wandsworth, became the first Wimbledon champion by defeating William Marshall, a 28-year-old real tennis player, in three straight sets in a final that lasted 48 minutes. The tournament made a profit of £10 and the pony roller remained in use. An analysis made after the tournament led to some modifications of the rules regarding the court dimensions.|$|E

50|$|However, {{it was in}} 1984 {{that the}} Blackpool hooligans started to earn their reputation. In March, Rochdale F.C. were totally {{overwhelmed}} when 3,000 Blackpool fans descended on their Spotland Stadium when they usually had <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 1,300. A mob of Blackpool fans went on the rampage causing “A trail of havoc” according to the Manchester Evening News headlines who continued, “21 cars were damaged, two parked vehicles overturned and 4 Police cars damaged.” By April, 1984 according to the Blackpool Evening Gazette, the police were worried <b>about</b> an army <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 200 hooligans and vowed to drive them out.|$|R

50|$|The city is {{considered}} a stronghold of rugby union in Russia, {{to the extent that}} the Rugby Union of Russia was headquartered locally for many years. Two Krasnoyarsk clubs, Krasny Yar and Enisey-STM, participate in the national Professional Rugby League, and Enisey-STM qualified for the European Rugby Challenge Cup, the second-tier pan-European club competition, in 2015-16. Matches take precedence in the local media, and the city derby match can attract <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 3000 - 5000. Many players of the Russian national rugby team hail from the area. Some of Russia's international rugby matches are played at the Central Stadium.|$|R

5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has {{provided}} the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities {{to find a new}} home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|R
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of professionalism in the Irish game, provincial rugby games were {{generally}} poorly attended. During most of the 1990s, Leinster matches regularly attracted <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 500 to 2,000. The decision to structure the game professionally via the provincial network through centralised player contracts and the subsequent on-field success achieved by Leinster and the other provinces resulted in {{a significant increase in}} support within a decade. Leinster had 3,700 season ticket holders in 2006, double the amount of the previous season. Leinster's supporters were named as 'Player of the Month' for April 2009 following their support in the European Cup Quarter Final against Harlequins at The Stoop.|$|R

50|$|A {{third place}} {{finish in the}} 1970-71 season nurtured hopes that Wolfen had {{successfully}} re-established themselves in tier II, but instead the club was sent down for breaking DFV statutes by poaching players, and financial irregularities. Despite winning immediate re-promotion out of the Berzirksliga, the club could only manage 10th and 11th finishes in 1973 and 1974, and was sent down yet again. Wolfen spent seven of the next eight seasons on the DDR-Liga (II) before slipping out of sight into lower level competition in 1985. Their most successful season during this period was in 1983-84 when they finished third, drawing <b>crowds</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 1,600 spectators to watch their matches at the 10,000-capacity Jahnstadion.|$|R
