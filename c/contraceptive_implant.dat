40|$|Background: In the United States, an {{estimated}} 51 % of pregnancies are unwanted (Sanders et. al., 2014). High rates of unwanted pregnancy {{can be reduced}} {{by the use of}} various contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives are a popular choice among fertile women and have been shown to effectively prevent pregnancy. <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> are a type of progestogen-only birth control. The implant is a single rod that is inserted subdermally into the upper arm. It has 68 mg of active compound and is effective in preventing pregnancy for up to 3 years (Gezginc et. al., 2007). Objective: Examine if <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> decrease a woman’s sexual desire via a literature review. Methods: A structured literature review was conducted. Articles related to the effect of <b>implant</b> <b>contraceptives</b> on sexual libido were considered. Scopus, Medline, and PubMed were used to find related literature. Peer reviewed studies containing {{one or more of the}} keywords: <b>contraceptive</b> drug <b>implants,</b> sexual dysfunction, libido or sexual behaviour were included in the review. Animal studies, non-English studies, studies on menopausal women, and studies on endometriosis and gynaecological cancers were excluded. Results: Six articles that met the criteria were selected. The degree of the relationship between use of an implant and decreased sexual libido varied between studies. A general decrease in sexual libido was reported. Conclusion: The evidence demonstrated a decrease in sexual desire with the use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants.</b> Further research excluding other side effects and focusing only on libido is needed to further explore causative effects...|$|R

50|$|A <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant</b> is an implantable {{medical device}} {{used for the}} purpose of birth control. The implant may depend on the timed release of hormones to hinder {{ovulation}} or sperm development, the ability of copper to act as a natural spermicide within the uterus, or it may work using a non-hormonal, physical blocking mechanism. As with other contraceptives, a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant</b> is designed to prevent pregnancy, but it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

40|$|Long-acting {{reversible}} contraceptive (LARC) {{methods include}} intrauterine devices (IUDs) and <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants.</b> These methods are safe, effective, and reversible, require {{little to no}} maintenance, are cost-effective over time, and have much better compliance rates than other hormonal methods. For these reasons, they are ideal for many women, especially young women who wish to delay or avoid pregnancy {{for at least three}} years. Yet fewer than nine percent of women in the United States who use contraception use an IUD and less than one percent use <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants.</b> However, communities around the country are developing new strategies and creative initiatives to improve access to these methods. Youth-serving professionals, educators, and health care providers can {{play an important role in}} helping to dispel myths among youth people so that they can make informed decisions about contraception and choose the best option for them...|$|R
50|$|Increasing use of long-acting {{reversible}} contraceptives (such as IUD and <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants)</b> {{decreases the}} chance of unintended pregnancy by decreasing {{the chance of}} incorrect use.

5000|$|<b>Contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> in the UK and Australia are [...] "injected" [...] {{under the}} skin using a special device similar to a large syringe or ear-piercing gun, and {{extracted}} by making a tiny incision through which the implant is pulled out.

40|$|Cases: In {{addition}} to previously published case reports, further cases of intravascular migration of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> {{have been identified}} from an information request to two national adverse reaction spontaneous reporting systems. We report on two new cases of insertion into the venous system with subsequent embolism to a pulmonary artery. Conclusion: Incorporating barium sulfate into the implant has facilitated diagnosis of these very rare adverse events with the initial diagnosis of embolism to the pulmonary arterial tree made by chest X-ray. Removal of an implant from a segmental branch of a pulmonary artery is technically challenging and not without risks. Unsuccessful removal appears to be preceded by a delay in diagnosis leading to endothelialization of the implant in the pulmonary arterial wall. Implications: Subdermal placement of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> over the anterior surface of the biceps {{rather than in the}} sulcus between them biceps and triceps may negate this rare but reported risk...|$|R

50|$|The <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant</b> is hormone-based {{and highly}} effective, {{approved}} {{in more than}} 60 countries and used by millions of women around the world. The typical implant is a small flexible tube measuring about 40mm in length and is inserted under the skin (typically in the upper arm) by a health care professional. After it is inserted it prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones that prevent ovaries from releasing eggs and thicken cervical mucous. The two most common versions are the single-rod etonogestrel implant and the two-rod levonorgestrel implant.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Knowledge {{about global}} use {{patterns}} of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> is limited. This study aims to describe implant use patterns from a user and prescriber perspective. Material and methods: In a cross-sectional design, we estimated the annual {{number of users}} by calculating doses sold per 1000 women-years in the Norwegian Prescription Database for the years 2006 - 2012. For each contraceptive method, we calculated {{on an annual basis}} a proportion of defined daily doses (DDDs) of all hormonal contraceptives in five years age groups. Data were analyzed in SPSS version 22, with chi-square test, t-test, and survival analysis. Results: Sales from pharmacies for <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> more than doubled over the study years and was consistently higher in the younger age groups. The collection rate was 9. 3 per 1000 women in 2012, when implant sales amounted to 2. 4 % of all daily doses of hormonal contraceptives sold. General practitioners and doctors with no specialty were the major prescribers to starters of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants,</b> whereas gynecologists prescribed nearly 12 % of the volume, a higher proportion to women > 35 years of age than younger women. The cumulative proportions of continued users at 6 -, 12 -, 24 -, and 36 -months were 96. 1 %, 78. 6 %, 51. 9 %, and 34. 9 %, significantly lower for users who had doctors with no specialty as prescribers. At end of first expiration period, 21 % of starters continued using implants. Conclusion: Implants play a minor role in the overall use of hormonal contraception in Norway. One in five starters continue as long-term users...|$|R

50|$|Among {{birth control}} methods, IUDs, along with <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants,</b> {{result in the}} {{greatest}} satisfaction among users. Evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents {{and those who have}} and have not previously had children. Once removed, even after long-term use, fertility returns to normal rapidly. Failure rates are about 0.8% with copper devices and 0.2% with hormonal (levonorgestrel) devices {{in the first year of}} use.|$|R
50|$|Vaginal sexual {{activity}} {{without the use}} of contraception through choice or coercion is the predominant cause of unintended pregnancy. The incorrect use of a contraceptive method, and failure of the method chosen also contributing. Available contraception methods include use of birth control pills, a condom, intrauterine device (IUD, IUC, IUS), <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant</b> (implanon/nexplanon), hormonal patch, hormonal ring, cervical caps, diaphragms, spermicides, or sterilization. Women choose to use a contraceptive method based on method efficacy, medical considerations, side effects, convenience, availability, friends' or family members' experience, religious views, and many other factors. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally or politically undesirable.|$|E
5000|$|Due to its {{restricted}} habitats, {{reproduction is}} tightly regulated.After a girl has her first menstrual cycle, she receives a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant,</b> has her hymen cut, and has her ears pierced; it's considered a {{coming of age}} ceremony and a signal of young adulthood.In order to have children, the two prospective [...] "co-parents" [...] must take a course together and pass a number of physical, psychological and economic tests before being issued parents' licenses.Very few families are authorized {{to have more than}} two children.Three-fourths of all Betan children are gestated in artificial wombs, although co-parents who prefer to have their children through old-fashioned pregnancy are free to do so.Genetically engineered Hermaphrodites form a significant minority of the Betan population.|$|E
5000|$|A slow-release {{hormonal}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implant</b> {{for female}} devils {{is being developed}} and tested in a joint program between the Save the Tasmanian Devil program, the Zoo and Aquarium Association, the Taronga Conservation Society and the University of Sydney. This wildlife contraceptive program is aimed to help the devils continue with their wild behaviour by mating freely, but without certain females contributing too much to the next generation, which [...] "can have long-term genetic consequences for the insurance population". Contraceptive trials in male devils showed that their testosterone increased, instead of decreasing as other male mammals' testosterone does.

50|$|Long-acting {{reversible}} contraceptives (LARC) are {{methods of}} birth control that provide effective contraception {{for an extended period}} without requiring user action. They include injections, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants.</b> They are the most effective reversible methods of contraception because they do not depend on patient compliance. So their 'typical use' failure rates, at less than 1% per year, are about the same as 'perfect use' failure rates.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> {{may cause}} {{irregular}} bleeding which some women find unacceptable as a side-effect ("Irregular bleeding and spotting common in first 6 months" [...] associated with IUS; similar to side-effects observed with IUD, injection or implant. [...] "Changes in bleeding pattern which {{are likely to}} remain irregular") or a complete cessation of menstrual flow (amenorrhea). Side effects that are observed less often may include emotional lability, weight gain, headache, and acne.|$|R
40|$|Premature {{removal of}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> (Norplant [levonorgestrel implants], Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) {{is a cause}} of a sizable {{national}} medical expenditure in the United States. Understanding {{the factors that influence}} the decision to remove the implants and being able to predict which users are likely to elect discontinuation prematurely could provide useful information for counseling patients as they are considering <b>contraceptive</b> <b>implants</b> so that potentially enormous long-term savings could be achieved. This study surveyed 98 women who had Norplant inserted and removed between January 1991 and December 1994. Data were collected from chart review, and when necessary, a questionnaire was used to extract information not found in the chart. The chi-squared statistic and t-test were used to compare demographic variables. All but one subject received comprehensive pre-implant counseling. The main reason given for electively removing the Norplant prematurely was irregular menstrual bleeding (60 %). Pre-implant counseling did not influence the decision for removal. These results indicate the importance of clarifying patients' doubts regarding menstrual bleeding irregularities during follow-up visits rather than relying on the information patients received during preimplant counseling...|$|R
