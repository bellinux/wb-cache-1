In comparison, a more traditional design like the PowerPC (PPC) has seen dramatic internal changes, yet code written for the first PPC's will still run without modification on the latest versions.

40|$|Iterative {{multi-user}} {{detection and}} time-variant channel estimation in a multi-carrier (MC) code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA) uplink requires high computational complexity. This is mainly due to the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) filters for data detection and time-variant channel estimation. We develop an algorithm based on the Krylov subspace method to solve a linear system with low complexity, trading accuracy for efficiency. It has been shown by Dumard et al that this approach enables drastic reduction of computational complexity as well as storage reduction when used for time-variant channel estimation. We compare two scenarios of parallel interference cancellation (PIC), in <b>chip</b> <b>space</b> and in user space. In the case of PIC in <b>chip</b> <b>space,</b> the Krylov subspace method allows parallelization of the computations of the K filters and storage reduction.

40|$|Embedded {{computing}} {{differs from}} general purpose computing in several aspects. In most embedded systems, size, cost and power consumption {{are more important}} than performance. In embedded System-on-Chips (SoC), memory is a scarce resource and it poses constraints on <b>chip</b> <b>space,</b> cost and power consumption. Whereas fixed instruction length feature of RISC architecture simplifies instruction decoding and pipeline implementation, its undesirable side effect is code size increase caused by large number of unused bits. Code size reduction minimizes memory size, <b>chip</b> <b>space</b> and power consumption all of which are significant for low power portable embedded systems. Though code size reduction has drawn the attention of architects and developers, the solutions currently used are more of cure than of prevention. Considering the huge number of embedded applications, {{there is a need for}} a dedicated processor optimized for low power and portable embedded systems. In the study, we propose a variation of Hybrid Instruction Encoding (HIE) for the embedded processors.

40|$|Machining of copper-based alloys {{tends to}} produce irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>chip</b> serration. However, turning {{cold-rolled}} material could sometimes produce regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>chip</b> serration. The regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>chip</b> serration is indeed layers of shear bands that grow and agglomerate to become chip serration. In this paper, {{an investigation into}} the formation of shear bands in the microcutting process of single point diamond turning is presented. The experimental results reveal how shear bands are initiated at the free edge of the chip and then propagated towards the tool tip. A new finite element model is developed to simulate the initiation and formation of these shear bands and to provide evidence for how these shear bands are induced by the elastic strain concentration. In contrast to the popular assumption that materials behave as rigid plastic during machining, the results reveal that elastic strain is one of the dominant factors leading to the formation of shear bands. Finally, an analytical model is proposed to reveal the influence of shear bands on the cutting force and on the formation of serrated chips. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{astonishing}} {{success story}} of microelectronics cannot go on indefinitely. In fact, once devices reach the few-atom scale (nanoelectronics), transient quantum effects {{are expected to}} impair their behaviour. Fault tolerant techniques will then be required. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the problem of transient errors in nanoelectronic devices. Transient error rates for a selection of nanoelectronic gates, based upon quantum cellular automata and single electron devices, in which the electrostatic interaction between electrons is used to create Boolean circuits, are estimated. On the bases of such results, various fault tolerant solutions are proposed, for both logic and memory nanochips. As for logic chips, traditional techniques {{are found to be}} unsuitable. A new technique, in which the voting approach of triple modular redundancy (TMR) is extended by cascading TMR units composed of nanogate clusters, is proposed and generalised to other voting approaches. For memory chips, an error correcting code approach is found to be suitable. Various codes are considered and a lookup table approach is proposed for encoding and decoding. We are then able to give estimations for the redundancy level to be provided on nanochips, so as to make their mean time between failures acceptable. It is found that, for logic <b>chips,</b> <b>space</b> redundancies up to a few tens are required, if mean times between failures have to be of the order of a few years. Space redundancy can also be traded for time redundancy.
