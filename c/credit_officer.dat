It introduces qualitative analysis to a randomized study. Findings suggest that microcredit demand and use is shaped {{not only by}} agro-ecological conditions, but by two major partially interrelated factors: debt-related norms articulated with {{the perception of the}} sanction in case of repayment default, and the "social life" of microcredit, namely, how social actors, <b>credit</b> <b>officers,</b> and local leaders, engage with microcredit. On a conceptual perspective we argue that microcredit "markets" do not result from supply confronting demand, but instead, are historical, political, and social constructs...|$|R
