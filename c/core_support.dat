25|$|In the 1989 {{election}} to the Chamber of Deputies, on 18 June 1989, the party achieved remarkable success by attracting votes from far beyond its <b>core</b> <b>support</b> base. Many Luxembourgers voted for the ADR as a protest vote, allowing the ADR to register 7.3% of the vote, win 4 of the 60 seats, and come fourth. The spectacular triumph of the party in the election required the leadership to formulate a new party strategy. On 12 November 1989, the name was amended to 'Action Committee 5/6ths' (Aktiounskomitee 5/6), reflecting its increased attention to other concerns. The party lost one of its deputies, Josy Simon, when he defected to the Democratic Party in spring 1991.|$|E
25|$|At Kek Lok Si (Chi-lo Ssu/Jili Si), the Temple of Supreme Happiness, on an {{inscription}} in stone dated 1906 listing {{the particulars of}} donors, it is recorded that Cheng Ssu-wen (Chung Keng Quee) with honorary second rank, donated 6,000 yuan, the 5th largest donation. Another stone inscription, this one dated 1907 recording the origin {{and development of the}} temple, shows that Cheng Ssu-wen (Chung Keng Quee) was one of the six senior secretaries of the temple at that time. He was one of the five wealthy patrons from Penang whom Beow Lian convinced (between 1887 and 1891) to form the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> for the construction of the temple, after having selected the site in Ayer Itam. With this, Chung Keng Quee became a director or Da Zongli (Great Prime Minister) of the new temple.|$|E

25|$|The Republican Party's current {{ideology}} is American conservatism, which {{contrasts with the}} Democrats' more progressive platform (also called modern liberalism). Its platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies, the Republican Party is socially conservative and seeks to uphold traditional values based largely on Judeo-Christian ethics. The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs from its founding until the 1930s, when it was based in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. Since 1952, {{there has been a}} reversal against protectionism and the party's <b>core</b> <b>support</b> since the 1990s comes chiefly from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural areas in the North, as well as from conservative Catholics, Mormons and Evangelicals nationwide.|$|E
25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp {{producer}} Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986) featured Stipe's vocals {{closer to the}} forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, [...] "Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice." [...] The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and eventually peaked at number 21 on the Billboard album chart.

500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{judicial}} system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the chief judge of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military, with early evidence including not only Alexander I's role in the Greco-Persian Wars but also with the city-state of Potidaea accepting Perdiccas II of Macedon as their commander during their rebellion against the Delian League of Athens in 432 BC. In addition to the esteem won by serving as Macedonia's supreme commander, Philip II was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father's reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers.
