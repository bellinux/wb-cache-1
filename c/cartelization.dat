2500|$|The agreement, {{known as}} Red Line Agreement after a red line was drawn around the former {{boundaries}} of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted, [...] "he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful <b>cartelization</b> or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over {{a large part of}} the Middle East".

50|$|A key {{effect that}} the Council had on the economy was the rapid {{increase}} in cartels, especially the law passed in 1932 allowing the government to mandate <b>cartelization.</b> The dispute was sparked when several industrial firms refused CGII orders to cartelize, prompting the government to step in. Since the corporations cut across all sectors of production, mutual agreements and <b>cartelization</b> was a natural reaction. Hence in 1937, over two-thirds of cartels authorized by the state, many of which crossed sectors of the economy, had started after {{the founding of the}} Council, resulting in the noticeable increase in commercial-industrial <b>cartelization.</b> Cartels generally undermined the corporative agencies that were meant to ensure they operated according to Fascist principles and in the national interest, but the heads were able to show that cartel representatives had total control over the individual firms in the distribution of resources, prices, salaries and construction. Businessmen usually argued in favour of 'collective self-regulation' being within Fascist ideological lines when forming cartels, subtly undermining corporative principles.|$|E
50|$|The {{breakthrough}} phase: The historical {{origin of}} a wider political <b>cartelization</b> is identified in {{the crisis of the}} capitalist system after World War II. The breakdown of the anarchic - or imperialistic - world system in 1945 marks the beginning of the comprehensive inter-state <b>cartelization</b> of the western world. The extreme material, political and human losses and sacrifices led the nations - or more precisely: their ruling classes - to the conclusion that war and protectionism should not be used any more as weapons against each other to assure the survival of the free western world. This culminated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade coming into force rather than in service of mankind on 1 January 1948.|$|E
50|$|A {{practice}} is anti-competitive {{if it is}} deemed to unfairly distort free and effective competition in the marketplace. Examples include <b>cartelization</b> (collusion among companies producing the same product or services to fix the price of goods or services intended to mutual higher profit), predatory pricing, and abuse of a dominant position.|$|E
50|$|There are game theoretic {{models of}} market {{interaction}} (e.g. among oligopolists) that predict that {{an increase in}} market concentration will result in higher prices and lower consumer welfare even when collusion {{in the sense of}} <b>cartelization</b> (i.e. explicit collusion) is absent.

5000|$|In the Cole-Ohanian model {{there is}} a slower than normal {{recovery}} which they explain by New Deal policies which they evaluated as tending towards monopoly and distribution of wealth. The key economic paper looking at these diagnostic sources {{in relation to the}} Great Depression is Cole and Ohanian’s work. Cole-Ohanian point at two policies of New Deal: the National Industrial Recovery Act and National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the latter strengthening NIRA’s labor provision. According to Cole-Ohanian New Deal policies created <b>cartelization,</b> high wages, and high prices in at least manufacturing and some energy and mining industries. Roosevelts policies against the severity of the Depression like the NIRA, a “code of fair competition” for each industry were aimed to reduce cutthroat competition in a period of severe deflation, which was seen as the cause for lowered demand and employment. The NIRA suspended antitrust laws and permitted collusion in some sectors provided that industry raised wages above clearing level and accepted collective bargaining with labor unions. The effects of <b>cartelization</b> {{can be seen as the}} basic effect of monopoly. The given corporation produces too little, charges too high of a price, and under-employs labor. Likewise, an increase in the power of unions creates a situation similar to monopoly. Wages are too high for the union members, so the corporation employs fewer people and, produces less output. Cole-Ohanian show that 60% of the difference between the trend and realized output is due to <b>cartelization</b> and unions. Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan also present a nice exposition that’s in line with Cole-Ohanian[...]|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>cartelization</b> began slowly, but the cartel {{movement}} took hold after 1873 {{in the economic}} depression that followed the postunification speculative bubble. It began in heavy industry and spread throughout other industries. By 1900 there were 275 cartels in operation; by 1908, over 500. By some estimates, different cartel arrangements may have numbered in the thousands at different times, but many German companies stayed outside the cartels {{because they did not}} welcome the restrictions that membership imposed.|$|E
50|$|Pennock (1997) {{shows that}} the rubber tire {{industry}} faced debilitating challenges, mostly brought about by changes in the industry's retail structure and exacerbated by the Depression. Segments of the industry attempted to use the NRA codes to solve these new problems and stabilize the tire market, but the tire manufacturing and tire retailing codes were patent failures. Instead of leading to <b>cartelization</b> and higher prices, which is what most scholars assume the NRA codes did, the tire industry codes led to even more fragmentation and price cutting.|$|E

50|$|During the New Deal, likewise, {{attempts}} were made to stop cutthroat competition, attempts that appeared very similar to <b>cartelization,</b> which would be illegal under antitrust laws if attempted by someone other than government. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933-35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers preferred federal and state regulation—controlling the rates and telephone services provided by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T), for example—and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new type of R&D {{cooperation}} between firms endowed with asymmetric spillovers, which we call symmetric Research Joint Venture (RJV) <b>cartelization,</b> based on reciprocity in information exchange. In this setting, firms coordinate their R&D expenditures and also share information, but such that the asymmetric spillover rates are increased through cooperation by equal amounts. It is found that this type of cooperation reduces R&D investment by the low spillover firm when its spillover is sufficiently low and the spillover of its competitor is sufficiently high. But it always increases the R&D of the high spillover firm, as well as total R&D (and hence effective cost reduction and welfare). A firm prefers no cooperation to symmetric RJV <b>cartelization</b> if its spillover rate is very high and the spillover rate of its competitor is intermediate. The profitability of symmetric RJV <b>cartelization</b> relative to other modes of cooperation is analyzed. It is found that symmetric RJV <b>cartelization</b> constitutes an equilibrium for a very wide range of spillovers, namely, when asymmetries between spillovers are not too large.

40|$|Cartel Theory {{research}} exclusively {{focuses on}} national legislatures, {{which has led}} to empirical uniformity among the studies. By only examining national legislatures, researchers have only observed chambers where there is a strong connection between party reputation and legislator reelection. This project examines legislatures where the connections between party reputation and legislator reelection vary widely. 	National legislatures generally have legislative rules enabling agenda control and therefore tend to have low majority roll rates. The variation in majority roll rates this project finds among U. S. state legislatures is due to the variance in legislative rules among these chambers. While most other Cartel Theory research implicitly assumes a connection between legislative rules and majority roll rates, this project verifies it empirically. 	This project further seeks to determine what causes legislative <b>cartelization.</b> In order to determine causal factors, the project examines cases where there is variation in legislative <b>cartelization</b> and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection. U. S. state legislatures display substantial variation in both of these variables and are, therefore, ideal candidates for observation. 	With these motivations in mind, this project’s primary two research questions test unverified assumptions made in the Cartel Theory literature: 1. 	How strong is the relationship between legislative <b>cartelization</b> and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection probability? 2. 	Are low majority roll rates indicative of chambers having institutionalized rules enabling agenda control? The answer to the first is that, among U. S. state legislatures, there is not a consistently strong relationship between majority roll rates and the connection between party reputation and legislator reelection, though there is a strong relationship between agenda control-enabling legislative rules and this connection. These two findings suggest that we need alternative measures of <b>cartelization.</b> More broadly, the findings suggest that Cartel Theory may not be as universally applicable as it once seemed. The answer to the second question {{is that there is a}} strong connection between low majority roll rates and legislative rules enabling agenda control but that this relationship is variable and alternative measures of <b>cartelization</b> are necessary for future Cartel Theory research...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis makes a twofold {{contribution}} to the existing literature. Firstly, it shows that clientelism complements <b>cartelization,</b> providing parties with stability in condition of weak mass mobilization. Secondly, it traces the specific mechanisms through which cartel parties channel public resources, within the institutional setting of the post-communist Europe. It provides an important extension to the cartel party literature {{in the context of}} new democracies. The main finding of this project is that cartel parties can survive and achieve stability through clientelistic distribution of benefits, both within, and outside their organisations. Furthermore, I find that <b>cartelization</b> generates a new model of clientelism, as public resources (e. g. procurement contracts) are also used to finance the party organisations, not only the clients. Through the in-depth case study of Romania, we can see that when political parties have little time to develop territorial networks and mobilization capacity, clientelism becomes an effective tool for establishing roots in society. The context of post-communist countries presents distinctive conditions for clientelistic linkages and the <b>cartelization</b> process. Multi-party systems in these countries have reappeared simultaneously with the institutions of the democratic state. Consequently, party-state interpenetration has been more profound, building upon previous legacies, as well as the permissive transitional circumstances. The present thesis analyses the following sequences of clientelistic exchanges: (1) internal party selection – patrons within the party organisations, (2) party patronage – political interference in public institutions, (3) politicization—political appointments in key positions of the Central Government (i. e. Senior Civil Servants), and finally (4) preferential resource allocation—public funding channelled through party networks. In addition to the chapters devoted to each of these clientelistic mechanisms, the thesis also contains a comparative chapter overseeing the challenges and opportunities for clientelism and <b>cartelization</b> in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) ...|$|E

The Great Depression is not yet well understood. Economists have offered many theories for both the massive decline and the slow recovery of output during 1929 — 39, but no consensus has formed on the main forces behind this major economic event. Here we describe and demonstrate a simple methodology for determining which types of theories are the most promising. Several prominent theories blame the Great Depression on frictions in labor and capital markets. The sticky wage theory is that wage stickiness together with a monetary contraction produces a downturn in output. (See Michael Bordo, Christopher Erceg, and Charles Evans 2001.) The <b>cartelization</b> theory is that an increase in <b>cartelization</b> and unionization leads to a slow recovery. (See Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian 2001.)

The views expressed herein {{are those of}} the authors and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System. The Great Depression is arguably the most significant economic event of the 20 th century. Bordo, Erceg, and Evans (2001) develop a model in which sticky wages combine with a monetary contraction to produce a downturn in output. Cole and Ohanian (2001) argue that the slow recovery is due to increased <b>cartelization</b> and unionization. Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Cooper and Ejarque (2000) develop models in which monetary contractions increase frictions in capital markets and lead to downturns driven by collapses in investment. In our view the critical feature of the sticky wage story or the <b>cartelization</b> story is that both lead to a wedge between marginal rates of substitution between consumption and leisure and the marginal product of labor. The critical feature of the capital market story is that capital market frictions introduce a wedge between the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption and the marginal product of capital...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{striking}} {{aspects of}} the recovery from the Great Depression in the United States: the recovery was very weak and real wages in several sectors rose significantly above trend. These data contrast sharply with neoclassical theory, which predicts a strong recovery with low real wages. We evaluate the contribution of New Deal <b>cartelization</b> policies designed to limit competition and increase labor bargaining power to {{the persistence of the}} Depression. We develop a model of the bargaining process between labor and firms that occurred with these policies, and embed that model within a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. We find that New Deal <b>cartelization</b> policies are an important factor in accounting for the post- 1933 Depression.
