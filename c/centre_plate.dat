50|$|A new {{smoother}} {{single plate}} spring-drive clutch was now fitted, the two friction rings {{carried by the}} <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> were held apart by leaf springs. Other changes included Girling brakes with wedge and roller shoe expansion and balance lever compensation using operating rods in tension with automatic compensation between front and rear brakes all four of which might be applied by hand or foot. Drums were now 9 inches diameter. 16-inch steel disc wheels replaced the 18-inch wires Top speed rose to 60 mph.|$|E
50|$|Improvements {{in plate}} rolling allowed {{a change in}} the shape of the girder. Rather than merely a slightly-curved top plate with {{triangular}} gussets, it was now possible to roll a semi-circular plate. This allowed the fully developed 'balloon' shape to be used, as in the second cross-section illustrated. The top web of the girder was semi-circular and riveted to the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> by an L-strip. The side gussets, also curved, were riveted parallel to the edges of this top plate, rather than through another L-strip, as used originally. Brunel (probably correctly) considered the smooth balloon profile to be a more efficient design, influenced by his geometric approaches to design rather than Eaton's mathematical analysis. More practically, the parallel lap joint halved the amount of riveting needed, compared to the L-strip.|$|E

40|$|The texture {{profile of}} a cross-rolled Al-Li 8090 alloy plate, 45 mm thick and in a T 851 condition, was {{quantified}} using the electron back-scatter diffraction technique. The result showed that in the surface region texture was weak while towards the <b>plate</b> <b>centre</b> there were two main components, { 110 } and { 110 } (each about 40 % volume fraction) which are related by a 90 degrees rotation. Samples cut from different positions through the plate thickness were fatigued using a self-aligning four-point bend rig at a stress amplitude of 80 % yield strength of the <b>plate</b> <b>centre,</b> R= 0. 1, 20 Hz and room temperature in air. It was found that, though having many more secondary cracks, the sample from the surface region had a fatigue lift: {{similar to that of}} the sample from the <b>plate</b> <b>centre</b> and longer than the rest. The high proportion of large misorientation grain boundaries in the surface sample was believed to be the major reason for its better fatigue properties. The sample from about 12 mm from the plate surface had a shorter fatigue life due to a relatively large proportion of brittle (cleavage and intergranular) fracture...|$|R
5000|$|The Jolly Boat is a 15 foot (4.6 metre) ketch rigged open day-boat {{designed}} by J. Laurent Giles. Originally designed for plywood construction, more recent examples {{were made with}} GRP with plywood decks and bulkheads, manufactured by AJS Marine in Chichester. The standard specification {{was described as a}} yawl rig, however the mizzen mast is mounted forward of the rudder making the rig a ketch (in modern terminology, see yawl: historical usage) although this is unusual for so small a boat. The foresail is mounted on a bowsprit. A sloop rig version was also available. In the ketch configuration the mainsail is gaff rigged and the mizzen a balanced lug. A steel <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> and ballast makes the boat quite stable, and the high topsides, broad beam and large cockpit are designed with comfortable family cruising in mind. An outboard well on the port side is provided for a 4h.p. [...] outboard motor.|$|E
50|$|The term Salcombe Yawl {{refers to}} a small sailing dinghy {{restricted}} class native to Salcombe in South Devon, and also to the traditional sailing vessel from the area upon which that class was based, with a 200-year history. The current class of vessel has {{about the size of}} a Merlin Rocket, that is 4.88 m and about 180 have been built of which 80% are still in use. It is built traditionally by hand from mahogany, and is clinker built. The <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> is cast iron, but more recent Yawls have bronze plates. While it is rigged as a ketch with the mizzen ahead of the rudder post, the label yawl is probably derived from a corruption of the word yole, meaning a small inshore fishing boat. Designers, work within the class restrictions, adding innovations to each vessel. It is raced in two classes depending on the age of the boat. A newly built boat in 2009 would cost £40,000 while a second hand vessel would be half of that. There is a glassfibre derivative with aluminium spars called a Devon Yawl. The mould for this was taken from a 1968 Salcombe Yawl and because of the nature of its construction is a one-design. There are approximately 300 Devon Yawls and they are built both in the UK and USA.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956 a {{committee}} meeting {{was held at}} West Kirby Sailing Club with the proposal of expanding the Star fleet, at the {{time there was a}} majority view of Star owners that the fleet should not be expanded (11 in favour, 1 against, 2 abstentions) at the current time but instead a new boat somewhat larger than the 16 ft Star should be developed with [...] "a more modern design and a more solid construction than the Liverpool Bay Falcons" [...] This proposal became the Hilbre One Design. Designer Alan Buchanan was commissioned to build a sturdy shallow drafted boat with a drop keel suitable for use on the Dee estuary which could be used for both racing and family picnics. The design had to cope with the shallow waters and strong tidal effects and moorings which dry out twice a day. Buchanan's design was for 19 feet 9 inches long boats, built of wood, with a clinker built hull. Their draught is 4 ft 5in with their <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> lowered, and 1 ft 7in with it raised. They had a displacement of 2700 lbs (including the 500 lb keel) and looked more like a yacht than a large dinghy. The original design had a flat stern but the committee decided to change this to one with an over hang similar to a Seabird Half Rater and also to add a small cuddy for day and family sailing.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} induced draft fans are of ever growing concarn in industry, especially in the power generation industry. The reliability and plant efficiency depend on the design conditions of all plant components. Induced draft fans handle high temperature flyash-laden flue gas, and are often plagued by mass-flow deficiencies and excessive vibration in fossil fuel powerplants [1]. In this research an existing induced-draft fan is analysed to investigate the occurrence of high stresses forming on the impeller, as these stresses lead to cracks appearing on the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> of the impeller. The basic approach used {{to address this problem}} is implementing the Finite Element Method starting with different cantilever beam configurations to simulate the connection of the blade with the <b>centre</b> <b>plate.</b> Geometries are kept constant to facilitate in the practical set-up implementation stage of the dissertation. The practical set-up is used to verify the results obtained from the Finite Element Method program, and it serves as a benchmark test for evaluating the further use of the chosen Finite Element Method program. A simplified Finite Element Method model is presented for the induced draft fan. Static and frequency analyses are done to determine the characteristics of the fan structure. Lastly an advanced dynamic analysis is done on the specific fan. Different ramp force functions are used to simulate different start-up curves for the fan. A conclusion will be drawn from the dissertation, and recommendations will be made for similar future research work...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. This report {{documents}} the steps taken to {{gain insight into}} the dynamics of a HS MkVII self-steering three piece bogie. This was done by firstly studying the dynamics and stability of linear simplifications of the bogie and wagon and then by investigating {{the dynamics of the}} bogie by means of a non-linear model. With the necessary insight into the dynamics of the bogie, an optimised relationship between the primary suspension stiffness and the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> friction of a self-steering three-piece bogie was achieved. The optimised model’s wear is less than half that of the reference model and has a safe operating speed of 80 km/h for an empty wagon and 140 km/h for a loaded wagon. It is recommended that the following be done before issuing a final technical recommendation; • A final optimisation of the lateral and longitudinal primary suspension stiffness arrangement; taking into consideration the physical vertical load bearing capacity of the rubber suspension elements. • A study in order to quantify the effects, on wear, of the increased misaligned position of the bogie on straight track following a curve. A verification of the ADAMS/Rail simulation results by conducting specific on-track tests. • A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis...|$|E
40|$|Free-standing thick-film {{cantilevers}} {{have the}} potential to be used as micro-generators as well as self-generating resonant sensors. Earlier versions of free-standing devices were implemented by fabricating in the form of multilayer structures. Instead of structures with a plate of PZT sandwiched between upper and lower electrodes, multimorph structures consist of three individual PZT plates having equal thicknesses (of about 40 ?m each). Ag/Pd conductors form the separators between the layers, also acting as electrodes on the upper and lower layers of the structure. Each piezoelectric plate was polarised in its thickness direction with two different modes: parallel and series. In the parallel mode, both the upper and lower PZT plates were polarised in the opposite direction, while in the series mode the upper plates and the lower plates were polarised in the same direction. The <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> of PZT acts as the neutral axis of the structure. Using the direct piezoelectric effect, a voltage was generated when the multimorph structures were bent by the application of a harmonic excitation. An output power of 10 ?W was measured for the parallel polarised sample. Series multimorphs, however, exhibited a non-linear effect, where the output power was 21 ?W for an up-sweeping frequency, but was reduced by a factor of 50 for a down-sweeping frequency...|$|E

40|$|Centre bearing {{forces and}} wear losses in three piece bogies have been {{simulated}} using VAMPIRE®. Bogie rotational resistance has been modelled at centre bearings and constant contact side bearers accounting for uneven loading during track transitions. The detailed model handles cylindrical centre bearings accounting for rim wall contact {{as well as}} the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> planar friction connections and uneven loading. The simulations have been performed for a range of curve radii assuming gauge face lubricated track. Wagons of moderate or high friction resistance to bogie rotation at centre bearings and side bearers have shown altered wheel wear, reducing maintenance cycle times in operations for rollingstock. In this paper, simulation studies have examined the effects of cant deficiency / excess and transition curvature on the wear performance of wagons and individual wheelsets, in particular the high wearing leading wheelsets. Wheel wear is shown to be altered due to changes in bogie rotation friction moments retained through the curve when cant deficiency of the curve is altered. The simulation results also show that transition curvature design can be used to reduce high wheel/rail wear in 3 piece bogies generated by high bogie rotation resistance. In the same way, transition curvature design can be used to alter the wheelset angle of attack during constant curving on 3 piece bogies...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a sub-millimetre skin punch biopsy device for minimally invasive and suture-free skin sampling for molecular diagnosis and research. Conventional skin punch biopsies range from 2 - 4 mm in diameter. Local anaesthesia is required and sutures are usually used to close the wound. Our microbiopsy is 0. 50 mm wide and 0. 20 mm thick. The microbiopsy device is fabricated from three stacked medical grade stainless steel plates tapered to a point and contains a chamber within the <b>centre</b> <b>plate</b> to collect the skin sample. We observed that the application of this device resulted in a 0. 21 ± 0. 04 mm wide puncture site in volunteer skin using reflectance confocal microscopy. Histological sections from microbiopsied skin revealed 0. 22 ± 0. 12 mm wide and 0. 26 ± 0. 09 mm deep puncture sites. Longitudinal observation in microbiopsied volunteers showed that the wound closed within 1 day and was not visible after 7 days. Reflectance confocal microscope images from these same sites showed the formation of a tiny crust that resolved by 3 weeks and was completely undetectable by the naked eye. The design parameters of the device were optimised for molecular analysis using sampled DNA mass as the primary end point in volunteer studies. Finally, total RNA was characterized. The optimised device extracted 5. 9 ± 3. 4 ng DNA and 9. 0 ± 10. 1 ng RNA. We foresee that minimally invasive molecular sampling will play an increasingly significant role in diagnostic dermatology and skin research...|$|E
