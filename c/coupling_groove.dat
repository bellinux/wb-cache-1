40|$|Optical interconnects, the chip-scale {{integration}} of optoelectronic devices with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) silicon circuits, provide a promising approach for {{the realization of}} the next-generation high-speed computing and communication systems. Unfortunately, optoelectronics lacks an obvious platform for monolithic integration. One of the practical solutions is the hybrid integration, through heteroepitaxial growth, of compound semiconductor optoelectronic components with silicon technology. This thesis is devoted to developing high-performance GaAs-based quantum dot lasers directly grown on silicon substrates and their monolithic integration with waveguides and electroabsorption modulators. The investigation of 1. 5 μm siliconbased high-Q random photonic crystal microcavity light emitters utilizing PbSe colloidal quantum dots has also been conducted. High-performance quantum dot lasers directly-grown on silicon substrates have been achieved in this study. The performance of III-V-based lasers on silicon can be degraded by the inherent high-density propagating dislocations. To enhance device performance, a novel quantum dot dislocation filter has been developed. The best lasers exhibit relatively low threshold current density (Jth = 900 A/cm 2), large small-signal modulation bandwidth of 5. 5 GHz, and a high characteristic temperature (T 0 = 278 K). The monolithic {{integration of}} InGaAs QD lasers with waveguides and quantum well(QW) electroabsorption modulators has been achieved through molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth and regrowth. Focused-ion-beam milling is utilized to create high-quality etched GaAs facets with a reflectivity of 0. 28 and <b>coupling</b> <b>groove</b> with coupling coefficient greater than 20 %. Quantum-dot lasers with focused-ion-beam-etched facets exhibit comparable performance to those with cleaved facets. The integrated modulator exhibits a modulation depth ~ 100 % at 5 V reverse bias. In addition, the monolithic integration of the amorphous silicon waveguide with quantum dot laser has also been demonstrated by using plasma-enhanced-chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD). Finally, enhanced photoluminescence at 1. 5 μm wavelength has been observed from PbSe colloidal quantum dots embedded in a silicon-based random photonic crystal microcavity. Such microscale light sources on silicon can also be fabricated or integrated on silicon CMOS chips, which may provide a viable route for inter- and intrachip optical communications...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports new neural probe schemes {{incorporating}} various {{optical waveguides}} for optogenetic applications. A photodefinable polymer (SU- 8) has been patterned to form optical mixer and splitter waveguides for advanced optical functions with multiple light sources and easy delivery {{of light to}} multiple shanks, respectively. Also, multiple stimulation sites have been implemented by step-wise patterning in a single waveguide. In addition to SU- 8 waveguides, iridium electrodes have been integrated for recording of neural signals from optically stimulated neurons with light of specific wavelengths.

40|$|The human SNM 1 A and SNM 1 B/Apollo {{proteins}} {{are members}} of an extended family of eukaryotic nuclease containing a motif related to the prokaryotic metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) fold. SNM 1 A is a key exonuclease during replication-dependent and transcription-coupled interstrand crosslink repair, while SNM 1 B/Apollo is required for maintaining telomeric overhangs. Here, we report the crystal structures of SNM 1 A and SNM 1 B at 2. 16 Å. While both proteins contain a typical MBL-β-CASP domain, a region of positive charge surrounds the active site of SNM 1 A, which is absent in SNM 1 B and explains the greater apparent processivity of SNM 1 A. The structures of both proteins also reveal a putative, wide DNA-binding groove. Extensive mutagenesis of this <b>groove,</b> <b>coupled</b> with detailed biochemical analysis, identified residues that did not impact on SNM 1 A catalytic activity, but drastically reduced its processivity. Moreover, we identified a key role for this groove for efficient digestion past DNA interstrand crosslinks, facilitating the key DNA repair reaction catalysed by SNM 1 A. Together, the architecture and dimensions of this <b>groove,</b> <b>coupled</b> to the surrounding region of high positive charge, explain the remarkable ability of SNM 1 A to accommodate and efficiently digest highly distorted DNA substrates, such as those containing DNA lesions...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grooved</b> <b>coupling</b> {{pipe joining}} systems uses a roll {{grooving}} technique to join pipes and pipe joining components. A groove {{is placed on}} the end of two pipes to prepare the pipes engagement with the coupling housing and gasket. The gasket creates a pressure responsive seal on the outside diameter of the pipe, unlike standard compression joints, where pressure acts to separate the seal. The gasket sealing is enhanced as the coupling housing is tightened onto the pipe end. [...] "The economics of the grooved method derive from simplified assembly that involves three basic concepts: a pressure responsive gasket that creates a leak-tight seal; couplings that hold the pipe together; and fasteners that secure the couplings.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the optical response of two sub-wavelength grooves on a metallic screen, {{separated by a}} sub-wavelength distance. We show that the Fabry-Perot-like mode, already observed in one-dimensional periodic gratings and known for a single slit, splits into two resonances in our system : a symmetrical mode with a small Q-factor, and an antisymmetric one {{which leads to a}} much stronger light enhancement. This behavior results from the near-field <b>coupling</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> Moreover, the use of a second incident wave allows to control the localization of the photons in the groove of our choice, depending on the phase difference between the two incident waves.

50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a <b>grooved</b> <b>coupling,</b> has four elements: <b>grooved</b> pipe, gasket, <b>coupling</b> housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by {{cold-forming}} (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|R

40|$|To machine {{a complex}} {{precision}} product, several tools are needed. These tools {{are placed on}} a tool turret. A tool must return several times to its original position. To attain a very high repeatability between the upper part and {{the base of the}} tool turret mounted on a precision lathe, it is preferable that the parts of the tool turret are statically determined in their contacts. This is attained by using a kinematic coupling. To attain the required stiffness this coupling is provided with a preload of 1. 5 · 103 N. The machining forces are typically less than 1 Newton. A special kinematic <b>coupling,</b> consisting of <b>grooves</b> and balls, was designed, made, and tested. By providing the grooves with self-adjusting surfaces, hysteresis is reduced to less than one-tenth of a micrometer. Maximum stiffness is aimed at by using cemented carbide, a material with a high admissible stress, at the contact points. Experiments show that this kinematic coupling, under a preload of 1. 5 · 103 N, has a static stiffness of more than 1 · 108 N/m in every direction and a repeatability better than one-tenth of a micrometer...|$|R
40|$|Kinetics for grain {{boundary}} penetration {{and weight loss}} were determined for 304 L stainless steel in Ti-gettered liquid Li. Empirical weight loss rate coefficient expressions were determined as function of both N content and temperature which predict the weight loss behavior of stainless steel for Li with high N content. Capillarity was eliminated as a possible driving force for {{grain boundary}} penetration of Fe by Li with the evidence of a grain boundary <b>groove.</b> <b>Coupled</b> ionic diffusion in a corrosion product surface film is suggested as the controlling mechanism for grain boundary grooving of Fe in N-contaminated liquid Li. Stress-enhanced grain boundary penetration showed that the penetration of stressed Fe {{is a function of}} t sup 1 / 3 rather than t sup 1 / 2, suggesting that primary creep of the Fe is continually breaking the protective corrosion product in the grain boundaries. A new purification procedure and systems were designed and constructed to achieve very low N contents in the liquid Li (less than 300 ppM N). A gas purification train, based on a molten Al bubbler for the removal of O and N, was designed and built, and vacuum melting of as-received Li and gettering are being initiated. Experiments designed to determine the role of Cr in stainless steel resistance are in progress. Also experiments have been designed which will investigate how liquid metal corrosion {{is a function of the}} contact potential between the metals. (auth...|$|R
40|$|In the {{measurement}} and instrumentation fields, kinematic couplings {{have been widely}} used to create precise and repeatable interfaces on a variety of devices. However, these devices have been limited to low load and clean environments such as in semiconductor manufacturing facilities. While traditional factory environments present less ideal conditions for the implementation of kinematic couplings, the benefits of more repeatable, deterministic interfaces is becoming more necessary as tolerances for products continue to become more stringent. In this thesis, general exact constraint and kinematic coupling design theory is discussed with specific application for use in industrial environments. Factors such as installation and cleanliness are discussed along with traditional design parameters such as Hertzian contact stress and preload. To test out the application of kinematic couplings to detrimental environments, two separate case studies were performed. The first case study consists of a small scale metrology device used to calibrate the home position of the ABB 6400 R robot. In this application, a low-load coupling is designed for a less than ideal environment. The second case study applies kinematic coupling theory to the medium scale, high load wrist interface on the same robot. In the latter, two forms of couplings were compared, including the classic ball and <b>groove</b> <b>coupling</b> as a baseline and the three pin coupling as a new, cheap solution. Testing of prototypes of each concept shows potential for inclusion of this technology in future robot models. by Patrick Willoughby. Thesis (S. M.)
