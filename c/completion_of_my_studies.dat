On the evening to which he referred you, I approached your cottage, as he said, {{for the purpose of}} asking shelter for the night. At that period I had been studying hard to qualify myself for the holy calling which I now pursue; and, on the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>studies,</b> had indulged in the recreation of a tour on foot through Brittany, by way of innocently and agreeably occupying the leisure time then at my disposal, before I entered the priesthood. When I accosted your father I had lost my way, had been walking for many hours, and was glad of any rest that I could get for the night. It is unnecessary to pain you now, by reference to the events which followed my entrance under your father's roof. I remember nothing that happened from the time when I lay down to sleep before the fire, until the time when I recovered my senses at the place which you call the Merchant's Table. My first sensation was that of being moved into the cold air; when I opened my eyes I saw the great Druid stones rising close above me, and two men on either side of me rifling my pockets. They found nothing valuable there, and were about to leave me where I lay, when I gathered strength enough to appeal to their mercy through their cupidity. Money was not scarce with me then, and I was able to offer them a rich reward (which they ultimately received as I had promised) if they would take me to any place where I could get shelter and medical help. I supposed they inferred by my language and accent--perhaps also by the linen I wore, which they examined closely--that I belonged to the higher ranks of the community, in spite of the plainness of my outer garments; and might, therefore, {{be in a position to}} make good my promise to them. I heard one say to the other, 'Let us risk it'; and then they took me in their arms, carried me down to a boat on the beach, and rowed to a vessel in the offing. The next day they disembarked me at Paimboeuf, where I got the assistance which I so much needed. I learned, through the confidence they were obliged to place in me in order to give me the means of sending them their promised reward, that these men were smugglers, and that they were in the habit of using the cavity in which I had been laid as a place of concealment for goods, and for letters of advice to their accomplices. This accounted for their finding me. As to my wound, I was informed by the surgeon who attended me that it had missed being inflicted in a mortal part by less than a quarter of an inch, and that, as it was, nothing but the action of the night air in coagulating the blood over the place, had, in the first instance, saved my life. To be brief, I recovered after a long illness, returned to Paris, and was called to the priesthood. The will of my superiors obliged me to perform the first duties of my vocation in the great city; but my own wish was to be appointed to a cure of souls in your province, Gabriel. Can you imagine why?" ...|$|E

40|$|When {{working with}} human subjects, a {{researcher}} is first required to obtain permission to conduct research. This process is undertaken so that {{participants in the}} study experience minimal harm. Therefore, in order to conduct my research into discrimination against the Deaf in Western Michigan, I had to first receive permission to do so by the Human Subjects Board at Grand Valley. However, during the process, five important issues arose. First, I had to explain the cultural and language differences between the Deaf and mainstream Americans. Second, I had to develop a list of questions. Third, I applied for the wrong level of review. Fourth, I had to discuss the importance of retaining any documentation until the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>studies.</b> Lastly, I had to prove that I was able to retain the confidentiality of my informants. Therefore, I hope to demonstrate how I overcame these issues and instruct others on how to avoid them when researching cultures that have not been frequently studied...|$|E

40|$|One {{milestone}} of 1991 was the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> otter behavioral development when 60 -month-old Scarnose {{gave birth}} to her first pups. I finally observed the mechanism for female dispersion. This mechanism turned out to be intrasexual aggression, but unexpectedly this took the form of a near fatal attack on one of Scarnose's pups of one mother by her sister Junior. Followed up by a personal attack on Scarnose by her mother, Mama, this led to Scarnose leaving the area with her pups. Junior, who has already given birth, is positioning to replace Mama as matriarch. One of Mama's surviving female pups, One-Eye, fully integrated into the male Clan, but was also driven away by Junior. Also during 1991, Scarnose survived a near-fatal attack of mastitis, appearing moribund, but overnight opening the enormous abscess and draining it herself, and subsequently recovering. For the first time, a pup was observed voluntarily dispersing rather than being abandoned as is normal. Two new behaviors were added to the ethogram: sleep-nipping and closed-mouthed scream...|$|R

The title of the thesis is not entirely representative of the work, which was carried out for the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>studies</b> in the University of Technology in Delft. Thanks to my supervisor, Dr. ir. T. J. Heimovaara, I came across many different aspects {{that are involved in}} sustainable landfilling.

40|$|After <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>studies</b> at Aga Khan University Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), I {{reported}} {{back to my}} {{parent organization}} Aga Khan Education Service for Pakistan {{in the first week}} of July 2002. I was posted in Aga Khan Girls High School Ovirk, Garamchashma as a headmaster on August 5, 2002. This school is situated in a very backward area of district Chitral. After joining the school I held meetings with teachers and members of the school management committee to introduce myself and also to get their views about the future of the school. I realized after the meetings that the school management committee members (SMC), who represent the community in school, were worried about the poor performance of the high school students in external examinations. Statistics showed very poor performance of the students in the last six years’ Board examinations. I decided to work on this single issue on priority bases. I met students individually to help them improve their results in the external examinations scheduled for April 2003. I also held a series of meetings with teachers and parents in order to improve the students’ results. Board’s examinations were held in April this year and the results were announced in June. These results amazed all the rank and file of the area. The results were hundred percent passes with twelve percent A and forty-four percent B grades. This was a new record in the seven years history of the school. I introduced School Improvement Plan in April this year. Under this plan teachers were asked to use Urdu or English in their daily conversation. The school library was re- activated after being in a non-functional state for the last one and a half years. Physical punishment, a cherished activity of the teachers, was banned. In addition to that many other administrative measures were announced to put the school administration on the right track. I made intervention after a long needs assessment of the school. Things have started changing in the school. For example, the teachers have started using Urdu and English in their classes and among themselves. Previously, the local language used to be the language of teaching. I have been helping teachers in their classroom teaching and other forums. The impact of all these things may come up in the ongoing mid-term exam results...|$|E

40|$|José Alberto Kaplan’s Sonata for trumpet {{and piano}} bears an undiscussable {{relationship}} with the musical language of Paul Hindemith. This observation oriented <b>my</b> <b>study</b> towards a comparative analysis {{with the work of}} the German composer. The analysis revealed a close association between Kaplan’s Sonata and Hindemith’s II Piano Sonata, a fact that recommended an informal interview with Kaplan.

40|$|Land {{and water}} for {{agriculture}} are scarce natural resources hence {{the promotion of}} good land management has taken center stage in Zambia. This study attempts to measure the factors that could {{be associated with the}} adoption of conservation farming practices considering that farmers have multiple practices to choose from and may adopt a given technology package in pieces. Based on a 1999 / 2000 national representative sample, the study suggests that farmers may be using intercropping to manage risk in low rainfall areas whereas pot holing does not yet appear to be considered as a risk reduction option. The thrust {{of this study is that}} policy makers should strive to build human capital, while at the same time retain skilled farmers through reduced adult mortalities. Provision of extension services should concentrate in areas with relevant physiographical factors while infrastructure should be improved to minimize costs of delivering extension services and agricultural inputs.

The little {{material}} {{of the interesting}} family of Gomphinae we know from this island, is represented by a few specimens of the genus Gomphoides. In the year 1929 on July 13 and some days afterwards, two specimens, one male and one female of different species were taken by myself on a small river in the mountains near Mt. St. Benedict. Since these captures no Gomphoides was seen again, all the time I stayed in Trinidad. Mr. E. B. WILLIAMSON in Michigan, from whom I got information when determining my Gomphoides-specimens, wrote me in this connection, {{that he was just}} working at a revision of the genus and not able (March 17, 1930) to name my Trinidad specimens. About one year afterwards in a letter dated Jan. 13, 1931, Mr. WILLIAMSON wrote me, that two Gomphoides-specimens were received from Trinidad from the collector Belmontes in Brasso, a male in a consignment for his own collection and a female in a collection consigned to Dr. WALKER in Toronto, which specimen was forwarded to him by Dr. WALKER. In his last letter of April 6, 1932, Mr. WILLIAMSON noted on the Gomphoides-specimens: "As to Trinidad Gomphoides, I think there are two species in all the material to date.

40|$|ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This {{dissertation}} {{would not}} have been possible without the help and support from many people. First and foremost, I would like to express my immense gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Baba Vemuri, who introduced me to the field of medical image analysis and assisted me in each step throughout <b>my</b> PhD <b>study.</b> The research described in this dissertation was mostly born from the lively meetings and intense discussions with Dr. Vemuri. Without his patient guidance and strongest support, I could never have reached this important point in my life. I feel so fortunate to have him as a good friend and kind mentor. I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Sartaj Sahni, Dr. Anand Rangarajan, Dr. Arunava Banerjee, and Dr. Siriphong Lawphongpanich, for being very generous with their time and knowledge and always being supportive during the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> PhD <b>study.</b> The five years I have spent in the University of Florida is definitely one of the most memorable experiences in my life. I am very grateful to all the professors who have taught me many interesting and rewarding courses in computer science, mathematics and statistics. Especially, I would like to thank Dr. Baba Vemuri...|$|R
40|$|The author {{offers a}} {{description}} of how his earliest encounters with Van den Berg inspired him, gave him a vision, a way of seeing, and his vocation to phenomenology and psychology. He acknowledges his indebtedness to how Van den Berg’s style cultivates an aesthetic sensibility that has shaped his own efforts to find a poetic voice for psychological writing. Tracing out {{the path of a}} 40 -year journey, and weaving in Van den Berg’s work, the author shows how he came to appreciate phenomenology as a work of homecoming, how such homecoming is a matter of the heart, how metaphor is the language of the heart and its ways of knowing, and how Van den Berg’s phenomenological metabletics guided his own metabletic studies on technology. At the end of the article he shows how he came to appreciate how metabletics is a cultural therapeutics and a foundation for an ethical epistemology. Meeting a Teacher I first met J. H. van den Berg in 1968 as I was nearing the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> doctoral <b>studies</b> in psychology at Duquesne University. He lectured on some of the work of Harry Stack Sullivan and while I was interested in Sullivan’s work, there was something else in van den Berg’s words that cap...|$|R
