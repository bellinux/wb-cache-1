Analysis <b>of</b> regulations shows that the timing of the match AC field <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> <b>waste,</b> part – has a different interpretation, and some – no question. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} modernization of Ukrainian environmental of the regarding waste management. However, the use of the whole of the EU towards Ukraine does not seem realistic and necessary. It was determined that within the ecological modernization should be used the following principles of waste management of the EU: prevention of waste; recycling and reuse (if waste generation that cannot be prevented, should be used as much recycled materials, mainly through recycling); improving technology and monitoring of final disposal (waste that cannot be reused or recycled, should be incinerated, disposal in landfills should be used as a last possible alternatives).
