While the lightning strike data are not questioned directly here, the palaeo-environmental contextwithin which the paper is set, the portrayal of former findings and the assumptions regarding weathering mechanisms in Lesotho are commented on. Frost shattering is the centre of Knight and Grab's weathering critique but, contrary to that stated in their text, none of the cited authors invoke this process in Lesotho. Other weathering processes that are speculated upon are not specific to cold climates either and thus cannot be used in support of their argument. In terms of debris and block distribution, lightning will not account for the preferential location of relict blocks and debris below the summits on south-facing slopes, or for the extensive valley floor accumulations that are documented in Lesotho. Knight and Grab also falsely portray former studies by implying that palaeo-environmental inferences in the area are drawn fromblock origin or morphology alonewhen the climatic signatures were derived from integrated assessments. In a palaeo-context, the relative contribution of lightning to debris production under dryer and colder conditions, when <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> activity in the highlands was likely reduced, is also questioned.

40|$|M. Sc. Lightning {{data are}} used in various {{applications}} from risk management to weather forecasting providing valuable insight to everyday operations. In South Africa, the South African Weather Services (SAWS) commissioned a new lightning detection network in February 2006. The nineteen-sensor network spread across South Africa overcomes previous disadvantages to lightning detection by providing wider coverage, higher detection efficiencies and better spatial resolution. This study investigated the influence of terrain elevation on lightning density in South Africa {{using data from the}} SAWS lightning detection network. Data incorporating one year from February 2006 to January 2007 were analysed using Geoinformatic Information System (GIS) programmes. The study incorporated two phases of analysis. The first included an evaluation of lightning climatology and the influence of elevation on lightning density for the whole of South Africa. The second phase, using four sub-regions of South Africa, included evaluation of local influences of elevation, slope and aspect on lightning density, for a period restricted to one month, December, during the peak lightning season. Lightning density was found to be highest over high topographic regions of the Highveld and escarpment regions. Enhanced lightning activity occurs over the eastern coast and over the Indian Ocean adjacent to the KwaZulu Natal coast. Diurnal variations in lightning activity indicate the influence of solar radiation on <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> development with peaks occurring during the late afternoon and early evening. Results of the influence of elevation on lightning density over the country of South Africa, indicate that lightning density increases with elevation up to a maximum of 1 800 m decreasing thereafter, in contrast to literature reports indicating maximum activity at 1 200 m elevation. This result was found throughout the year except for winter months where thunderstorms are dominated by frontal activity. Lightning density in all four sub-regions was found to increase with elevation up to approximately 1 500 m and decrease thereafter. Diurnal patterns of lightning activity in all regions indicate the dominance of convective thunderstorms. Slope and aspect was found to be influential in certain regions but mostly as a secondary factor influencing thunderstorm development. Lightning density in South Africa is influenced to a great degree by terrain elevation especially over the highly elevated regions of the Highveld and Escarpment. This work contains the first comprehensive analysis of lightning frequency distributions from the new (2006) SAWS lightning detection network, and the first significant update of lightning distribution over southern Africa since 1975...|$|E

40|$|The summer {{rainfall}} {{region of}} South Africa {{is dominated by}} <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> development from October to March. The result is that lightning is a common event {{over most of the}} country during this time. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) installed a stateof- the-art Lightning Detection Network (LDN) in late 2005 in order to accurately monitor lightning across South Africa. Data from this network for 2006 was utilised in order to develop an initial climatology of lightning in South Africa. Analyses were performed of lightning ground flash density, flash median peak current and flash multiplicity on a 0. 2 ° grid across South Africa. The highest ground flash density values were found along the eastern escarpment of the country, extending onto the high interior plateau. There is a general decrease in flash density from east to west, with almost no lightning recorded on the west coast of the country. The regions of highest flash density recorded the highest percentages of negative polarity lightning. The percentage of positive lightning was higher in the winter months, as was the median peak current of lightning of both polarities. The median peak current distribution displayed distinct bands of current values oriented in northwest to southeast bands across the country. The bands of higher median peak current correspond to the regions {{to the rear of the}} interior trough axis in areas dominated by stratiform cloud development and were more dominant in the mid summer months. The highest flash multiplicity was recorded in the regions of highest flash density. Along the southern escarpment, on the eastern side of South Africa, flash multiplicity values exceeded 3 flashes per square kilometer. The highest flash multiplicity of negative polarity lightning was recorded in the spring and early summer. Throughout the year, the percentage of single stroke flashes for positive lightning is high. Topography and the position of the surface trough have a very strong influence on the ground flash density and median peak current distributions, but not on the flash multiplicity distribution. The results from the analyses of the three lightning variables were then combined to determine risk indexes of high intensity lightning and of positive polarity lightning. The eastern part of South Africa is at extreme risk from both large amounts of lightning and from positive polarity lightning, whereas the regions in the northwest of the country that are dominated by mining are at extreme risk from mainly positive polarity lightning...|$|E

OPAL annually maps Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune (and will also map Saturn from 2018) in several visible near- infrared wavelength filters. The Uranus 2014 OPAL observations were made on the 89 th November at a time when a huge cloud complex, first observed by de Pater et al. (2015) and subsequently tracked by professional and amateur astronomers (Sayanagi et al., 2016), was present at 30 - 40 deg N. We imaged the entire visible atmosphere, including the storm system, in seven filters spanning 467924 nm, capturing variations in the coloration of Uranus clouds and also vertical distribution due to wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering and methane absorption optical depth. Here we analyse these new HST observations with the NEMESIS radiative-transfer and retrieval code in multiple-scattering mode to determine the vertical cloud structure in and around the storm cloud system. The same storm system was also observed in the H-band (1. 4 - 1. 8 micrometers) with the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 31 st October and 11 th November, reported by Irwin et al. (2016, 10. 1016 j. icarus. 2015. 09. 010). To constrain better the cloud particle sizes and scattering properties over a wide wavelength range we also conducted a limb-darkening analysis of the background cloud structure in the 30 - 40 deg N latitude band by simultaneously fitting: a) these HSTOPAL observations at a range of zenith angles; b) the VLTSINFONI observations at a range of zenith angles; and c) IRTFSpeX observations of this latitude band made in 2009 at a single zenith angle of 23 deg, spanning the wavelength range 0. 8 - 1. 8 micrometers (Irwin et al., 2015, 10. 1016 j. icarus. 2014. 12. 020). We find that the HST observations, and the combined HSTVLTIRTF observations at all locations are well modelled with a three-component cloud comprised of: 1) a vertically thin, but optically thick deep tropospheric cloud at a pressure of approximately 2 bars; 2) a methane-ice cloud based at the methane-condensation level of approximately 1. 23 bar, with variable vertical extent; and 3) a vertically extended tropospheric haze, also based at the methane-condensation level of 1. 23 bar. We find that modelling both haze and tropospheric cloud with particles having an effective radius of approximately 0. 1 micron provides a good fit the observations, although for the tropospheric cloud, particles with an effective radius as large as 1. 0 micron provide a similarly good fit. We find that the particles in both the tropospheric cloud and haze are more scattering at short wave- lengths, giving them a blue color, but are more absorbing at longer wavelengths, especially for the tropospheric haze. We find that the spectra of the storm clouds are well modelled by localized thickening and vertical extension of the methane-ice cloud. For the particles in the storm clouds, which we assume to be composed of methane ice particles, we find that their mean radii must lie somewhere in the range 0. 1 1. 0 m. We find that the high clouds have low integrated opacity, and that streamers reminiscent of <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> anvils are confined to levels deeper than 1 bar. These results argue against vigorous moist convective origins for the cloud features...|$|E

The average high is [...] {{while the average}} low is [...] With a mean precipitation of , it is the rainiest season. This is due to hot temperatures and high insolation {{that lead to the}} development of a low pressure system called the Chaco Low situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic High to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region, favouring precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorms.</b> The Chaco Low also interacts with the South Atlantic high to bring warm and tropical air from the north which is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest due to higher insolation.|$|R
40|$|Arizona {{and other}} areas of the Southwest are {{experiencing}} rapid growth in population and water demand (Eden and Megdal, 2006). Despite the economic and real estate downturn that began in 2007, future demands for water and the resulting need for wastewater reclamation and reuse are expected to continue to grow (Scott et al., 2011), especially in Arizona’s urban corridor stretching from Flagstaff and Prescott in the north, through Phoenix, and to Tucson and Nogales in the south (Morrison Institute, 2008). This region has a semiarid to arid climate with warm, mostly dry winters, and hot summers. Rainfall primarily occurs in <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorms</b> that characterize the North American monsoon. Surface waters are subject to increased climate change and variability, exerting ever-greater pressure on groundwater and effluent as sources of supply (e. g., Tucson Water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Lightning Potential Index (LPI) is a mea-sure of the {{potential}} for charge generation and separation that leads to lightning flashes in <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorms.</b> It is calculated from model simulated updraft and microphysical fields. It was designed to predict {{the potential}} of lightning occurrence in operational weather forecasting models, but could possibly be used to improve short-range forecasts of heavy rain. The index is modified here to be model grid-scale transparent between 1 and 4 km (the approximate upper limit of explicit microphysical weather forecasts). Two case stud-ies show that the modification appears to work quite well, and that LPI can be calculated on both an extremely high res-olution research-grid (i. e., 1. 33 km) and high resolution (i. e., 4 km) operationally compatible forecast grid. Analytical ex-pressions are presented to use the LPI to predict the hourly lightning flash density. ...|$|R
50|$|Like all of North Dakota, Devils Lake has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfb) with very cold winters with frequent light snowfall, and warm to very warm, wetter summers with most rain from <b>convective</b> <b>thunderstorms.</b> During the 1936 North American cold wave, {{the town was}} one of the coldest places south of the Canada-US border, averaging &minus;21 F for the five weeks ending February 21, 1936 (though at a different site from that now in use). On average 53.4 nights fall to or below 0 F, 104.1 days fail to top freezing, and 184.5 nights fall below 32 F. In the winter, only 17.5 days on average top freezing, and in severe winters months can pass without even a minor thaw. Extreme heat is rare in summer, with only one day in three years topping 100 F, and only 9.3 topping 90 F.|$|R
