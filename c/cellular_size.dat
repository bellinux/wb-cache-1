50|$|While the sulfide is {{available}} in the surrounding sediment, produced by other bacteria from dead microalgae that sank down to the sea bottom, the nitrate comes from the above seawater. Since the bacterium is sessile, and the concentration of available nitrate fluctuates considerably over time, it stores nitrate at high concentration (up to 0.8 molar) in a large vacuole like an inflated balloon, which is responsible for about 80% of its size. When nitrate concentrations in the environment are low, the bacterium uses the contents of its vacuole for respiration. Thus, the presence of a central vacuole in its cells enables a prolonged survival in sulfidic sediments. The non-motility of Thiomargarita cells is compensated by its large <b>cellular</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{decrease}} the thermal {{error in the}} machining of high speed machine tools, a new design idea based on the cellular metal structures was proposed. With forced convection in cellular metals, the heat generated in machining will be dissipated and the machining precision can be guaranteed. The thermal property of machine slides using 2 D rectangle cellular structures was studied with theoretical analyses and numerical simulation. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the finite element simulation results. The {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} and the thermal performance were acquired with the volume-averaging method and the relationships between the <b>cellular</b> porosity, <b>cellular</b> <b>sizes</b> and the thermal performance were discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue repair {{is thought}} to be {{regulated}} by progenitor cells, which in other tissues are characterized by their Notch 1 expression or small <b>cellular</b> <b>size.</b> Here we studied if these traits affect the chondrogenic potential and are markers for multipotent progenitor cell populations in adult articular cartilage. METHODS: Directly isolated articular chondrocytes were sorted with regard to their Notch 1 expression or <b>cellular</b> <b>size.</b> Their colony forming efficiency (CFE) and their potential to differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages were investigated. The different sorted populations were also expanded in monolayer and analyzed {{in the same manner as}} the directly isolated cells. RESULTS: No differences in CFE or adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic potentials were detected among the sorted populations. Expanded cells displayed a higher osteochondral potential than directly isolated cells. CONCLUSION: <b>Cellular</b> <b>size</b> or Notch 1 expression is not per se a specific marker for mesenchymal progenitor cells in adult articular cartilage. Monolayer-expanded adult chondrocytes contain a larger mesenchymal progenitor cell-like population than directly isolated cells, highly likely as a result of dedifferentiation.

40|$|Objects {{making up}} complex porous systems in Nature usually span {{a range of}} sizes. These size {{distributions}} play fundamental roles in defining the physicochemical, biophysical and physiological properties {{of a wide variety}} of systems – ranging from advanced catalytic materials to Central Nervous System diseases. Accurate and noninvasive measurements of size distributions in opaque, three-dimensional objects, have thus remained long-stand-ing and important challenges. Herein we describe how a recently introduced diffusion-based magnetic resonance methodology, Non-Uniform-Oscillating-Gradient-Spin-Echo (NOGSE), can determine such distributions noninvasively. The method relies on its ability to probe confining lengths with a (length) 6 parametric sensitivity, in a constant-time, con-stant-number-of-gradients fashion; combined, these attributes provide sufficient sensitivity for characterizing the underlying distributions in μm-scaled cellular systems. Theoretical derivations and simulations are presented to verify NOGSE’s ability to faithfully reconstruct size distributions through suitable modeling of their distribution parameters. Experiments in yeast cell suspensions – where the ground truth can be determined from ancillary micros-copy – corroborate these trends experimentally. Finally, by appending to the NOGSE proto-col an imaging acquisition, novel MRI maps of <b>cellular</b> <b>size</b> distributions were collected from a mouse brain. The ensuing micro-architectural contrasts successfully delineated dis-tinctive hallmark anatomical sub-structures, in both white matter and gray matter tissues, in a non-invasive manner.

Afterwards, the biofilms were characterized in terms of respiratory activity, amount of biomass, cellular density, <b>cellular</b> <b>size</b> and total and extracellular proteins and polysaccharides. The biofilm mechanical stability was assessed by sequential submission of the biofilms to increasing ReA, respectively, 4000, 8100, 12100 and 16100. The results showed that P. fluorescens biofilms were 5 times more active, had a higher amount of biomass, cellular density, a reduced <b>cellular</b> <b>size</b> and a four-fold higher amount of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides than B. cereus biofilms. The application of shear stress forces higher than the one under which the biofilm was formed (ReA = 2400) caused biomass removal. The high percentage of removal occurred {{with the implementation of}} a ReA of 8100 for both B. cereus and P. fluorescens biofilms. The total series of ReA did not give rise to total biofilm removal, since only about 76 % of P. fluorescens biofilm mass and 53 % of B. cereus biofilm mass were detached from the cylinders. This latter result evidences that B. cereus had a higher mechanical stability than P. fluorescens biofilms.

To date, vesicles have largely been single-compartment structures with homogenous interiors, which has impeded the fulfilment of these goals. This thesis details the development of technologies to address this. We develop droplet-based methods to controllably generate multi-compartment vesicles (MCVs) for the first time. The potential of these novel structures as artificial cells capable of hosting a range of biological and bio-mimetic processes is explored. Most notably, we introduce spatial segregation of function, thus mimicking eukaryotic organelles, and incorporate an artificial enzymatic signalling cascade to transmit chemical signals between distinct vesicle regions. We also construct microfluidic devices to generate related structures known as multisomes. Microfluidic technologies enable the size of these constructs to be scaled-down (approaching characteristic <b>cellular</b> <b>sizes),</b> and the production throughput to be scaled-up (hundreds of multisomes produced a minute). We demonstrate their use as programmable modular microdroplet ???factories??? for in situ chemical synthesis in physiological environments, with potential relevance for therapeutic applications.

Significant cellular nutrient reservoirs of nitrate and ammonia were measured in all three experiments, and the ratio of mg/ 1 of cellular nutrient reservoir to mg/ 1 of particulate nitrogen ranged from zero to 1. 0. Cellular nitrite reservoirs ranging from 0 - 1 μM were observed during nitrite assimilation, A practical method of measuring nitrate reservoirs was developed. From the raw data, parameters calculated were nutrient specific uptake rates, particulate nitrogen specific growth rates, relative <b>cellular</b> reservoir <b>size,</b> percent soluble organic nitrogen, photosynthetic assimilation ratios, chlorophyll a / carbon ratios, and nitrogen to carbon ratios. Specific uptake rates {{were found to be}} highly variable, and at times were ca. 20 times the highest measured population growth rate.

Calculated relative <b>cellular</b> nutrient reservoir <b>sizes</b> do not correspond directly to trends in specific growth rates, although it was noted that large relative <b>cellular</b> nutrient reservoir <b>sizes</b> preceded the initial large increases in particulate nitrogen specific growth rates.
