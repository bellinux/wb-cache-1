40|$|Appearance {{traits in}} fish, those {{external}} body characteristics that influence consumer acceptance at point of sale, {{have come to}} the forefront of <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> farming, as <b>culture</b> profitability is closely linked to management of these traits. Appearance traits comprise mainly body shape and skin pigmentation. Analysis of the genetic basis of these traits in different fish reveals significant genetic variation within populations, indicating potential for their genetic improvement. Work into ascertaining the minor or major genes underlying appearance traits for <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> is emerging, with substantial progress in model fish in terms of identifying genes that control body shape and skin colors. In this review, we describe research progress to date, especially with regard to <b>commercial</b> <b>fish,</b> and discuss genomic findings in model fish in order to better address the genetic basis of the traits. Given that appearance traits are important in <b>commercial</b> <b>fish,</b> the genomic information related to this issue promises to accelerate the selection process in coming years...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{development}} of <b>commercial</b> marine <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> in the late 1970s, the demand for brine shrimp cysts has gradually increased from a few tonnes to approximately 800 tonnes per annum, representing approximately 40% of the total aquaculture demand for feeds for early stages. The price of the cysts varies during the last a few decades depending on both demand {{and the quality of}} the cysts. During the last 25 years, the Great Salt Lake in the United States has been the major supplier of brine shrimp cysts to the world aquaculture industry and the subject of numerous speculations regarding its capacity to sustain a growing aquaculture industry. However, due to the unpredictable fluctuation of the cyst yield from Great Salt Lake, there are other sites for cyst production, such as lake Urmia in Iran, Aibi Lake in China, Bolshoye Yarovoye in Siberia, Kara Bogaz Gol in Turkmenistan, and several lakes in Kazakhstan.|$|R

A survey was performed at Kotalipara upazila, Gopalganj to analyze <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> system especially culture methods, stocking density, feeding and relative profitability during April to September 2008. It was observed that 64 % of the total farmers were practicing carp polyculture whereas 17 % and 19 % farmers were cultivating their ponds with pangus monoculture and tilapia and carp polyculture respectively. The average stocking density was found 10378 fry/ha for polyculture and 14466 fry/ha for pangus monoculture. The average doses of Urea, TSP and MP used by the farmers for mixed culture were 361 kg, 340 kg and 133 kg per ha per year respectively. The <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> feed used for mixed culture was the highest in Kalabari that was 250 kg followed by 200 kg in Radhaganj and 170 kg in Sadullapur per hectare per year. In case of mixed culture, Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) was the highest in Sadullapur which was 3. 47 and BCR was 4. 05, the highest in Radhaganj for pangus culture.

50|$|Pond {{culture is}} the most common system in the country. Other forms of <b>fish</b> <b>culture</b> such as cage culture are only {{starting}} to be discussed especially by the emerging <b>commercial</b> <b>fish</b> farmers. Previously farmers, 99 percent of whom were subsistence fish farmers, had ponds ranging anywhere from 50 m² to 200 m². The majority (an estimated 60 percent) remain at subsistence level of production with little or no technical inputs or management. With the drive to commercialise aquaculture, production efforts to increase the pond surface have resulted in a current average of 500 m² per pond. Farmers at this level have adopted the use of inputs such as quality fish seed and feed. The feed, however, is still usually made on-farm using formulae provided by the Aquaculture Research and Development Centre, Kajjansi.|$|R

In order to keep the hulls shallow, the schooners were [...] "very wide aft, with a heavy, clumsy stern and fat counters, the run being hollowed out excessively so as to produce in the after section a series of very abrupt horizontal curves." [...] The two masts came to nearly the same height above the waterline, and the schooners carried a large jib extending from the bowsprit end to the foremast.|$|R
