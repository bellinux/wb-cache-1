2500|$|The {{most common}} use for Portland cement {{is in the}} {{production}} of concrete. [...] Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape desired, and once hardened, can become a structural (load bearing) element. Concrete can be used in the construction of structural elements like panels, beams, street furniture, or may make <b>cast-in</b> situ concrete for building superstructures like roads and dams. These may be supplied with concrete mixed on site, or may be provided with 'ready-mixed' concrete made at permanent mixing sites. Portland cement is also used in mortars (with sand and water only), for plasters and screeds, and in grouts (cement/water mixes squeezed into gaps to consolidate foundations, road-beds, etc.).|$|E

50|$|The King City High School Auditorium is {{executed}} in <b>cast-in</b> -place concrete. The design makes {{full use of}} concrete's potential for plastic form, with compound curves, rounded corners and <b>cast-in</b> sculptural forms. The structure is somewhat elliptical in plan, with rounded corners. A projecting rounded bay at the front comprises the main entrance, with three pairs of doors separated by tall fluted pilasters surmounted by cast busts of Comedy and Tragedy, dividing a triptych relief sculpture that is itself divided into three levels. The ends of the facade curve around to the side elevations, which have inset fluted panels whose pilasters are crowned with more cast sculpture derived from characters from A Midsummer Night's Dream. The rear elevation is comparatively plain and utilitarian.|$|E
50|$|Threaded inserts, steel plates, and coolant pipes can be <b>cast-in</b> {{during the}} casting process.

50|$|Extra heat is {{contributed by}} the intense {{pressure}} and friction taking place inside the barrel. In fact, if an extrusion line is running certain materials fast enough, the heaters can be shut {{off and the}} melt temperature maintained by pressure and friction alone inside the barrel. In most extruders, cooling fans are present to keep the temperature below a set value if too much heat is generated. If forced air cooling proves insufficient then <b>cast-in</b> cooling jackets are employed.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} water-cooled, and is {{produced}} using cast-iron cylinder block, with <b>cast-in</b> cylinders. The engine utilizes diesel fuel {{delivered in a}} direct injection method from a Bosch PES style inline injection pump. The cylinder head is a single unit for all cylinders, and the cylinder head cover and air intake are shared by a single cast aluminum alloy. Interestingly, exhaust ports 2&3 and 4&5 are siamesed together, presenting an exhaust manifold with only four outlets.|$|E

50|$|Navistar {{claims that}} the wet-sleeve design enhances {{durability}} because the consistent wall thickness of the sleeve allows for consistent heat transfer, ensuring the cylinders stay round during thermal expansion. Additionally, they state that the hardened cylinder sleeve is more durable and wear resistant than a softer, <b>cast-in</b> wall. Also, the replaceable cylinder sleeves protect the block from damage (e.g. in case of foreign objects entering the cylinder) and can easily be replaced, which Navistar claims enables simpler restoration to original specifications. The wet-sleeve design also allows the engine to be rebuilt easily to factory specifications, sometimes without even removing the engine from the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The V8s used in Aston Martins from 1969 to 2000 {{were based}} on an {{internal}} design by Tadek Marek and were used extensively {{in a variety of}} models, starting with the 1969 DBS V8, followed by the Vantage, Virage, plus Volante convertible versions amongst others. After the Vantage was discontinued in 2000, there were no V8 models until the introduction in 2005 of a hand-built dry-sump version of Jaguar's AJ-V8 with 4.3 L. The block, heads, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, inlet and exhaust manifolds, lubrication system and engine management are all unique to the Aston Martin. It was used in the V8 Vantage. In 2008, capacity was increased to 4.7 L by using pressed cylinder liners instead of <b>cast-in</b> liners.Aston Martin has since sourced its engines, both V8s as well as V12s, from American manufacturer Ford with additional future engine supply from Germany's Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
5000|$|Brakes on the [...] "CERV-I" [...] {{are similar}} to the HD type {{available}} on the Chevrolet Corvette. Sintered iron linings are used with fin cooled drums, and the brake drum webs are lightened by drilled lightening holes which also permit the flow of cooling air. The brake drums are cast aluminum with <b>cast-in</b> iron braking surfaces. The rear brakes are inboard mounted next to the differential so that braking torque is transmitted directly to the frame without influencing any of the rear wheel articulating members. Braking effort distribution is 57% front and 43% rear {{to take advantage of the}} superior braking characteristics of the weight distribution afforded by the rear engine type vehicle. The brakes may be actuated by either one of two pedals so that the driver may use either foot depending on the particular driving situation. An unusual brake master cylinder utilizes two pistons operating in series so that it either the front or rear brakes fail the remaining brakes can be actuated.|$|E

Production continues to this day, but are sold under the brand Hot Wings, In Air and sometimes under generic brands, often with <b>cast-in</b> marks removed. Former Dyna-Flites pieces can be identified by the [...] "Axxx" [...] reference number moulded into the body. Twenty six of the original moulds have now been retired, being either updated or replaced by other subjects. Red Box Toys went on to release 3 new pieces in 1999 which continued the series' numbering sequence. Those aircraft were an F-19, U-2 'Senior Span' and Me-262. The Me-262 was a new cast, not re-release of the earlier mold in the line.In 2006 Red Box added four WWII Japanese aircraft to the line up.

50|$|VW stopped {{production}} of the Karmann-Ghia in Brazil during the early 1970s, and the Puma was redesigned to use the Volkswagen Brasilia as a base instead for 1973. Assembly of Pumas in South Africa by Bromer Motor Assemblies also began during this period. They finished 357 cars in two years, until closing due to bad finances. The bodywork was restyled in 1977, while similar in appearance the bumpers were now moulded as parts of the body, rather than being separate chrome units. The body was now somewhat less rounded than before, and coupés received rear quarter windows rather than the previous louvres. In 1980, {{it was time for}} another restyling as well as a rename. The coupé became the GTI, while the spider became the GTC. The new look included rubber bumpers with decorative <b>cast-in</b> ridges which mimicked the Porsche 911 G's telescopic impact bumpers. The taillights were replaced by the Volkswagen Brasilia's Mercedes-style units, all the rage at the time with Brazilian cottage manufacturers. The small push-button doorhandles were replaced with more modern units borrowed from the Alfa Romeo Ti 4.|$|E
50|$|The Avenger {{originated}} from Long Island, NY-based station WHN and was broadcast over a time-span of 62 weeks. It {{also seems to}} have aired on many stations across the United States as a transcription series. The 62 weeks refer only to the period during which the program aired, not the number of shows. There were apparently a number of preemptions, due to coverage of sporting events. Most likely, the series consisted of a then standard run of 26 half-hour episodes (plus repeats). Unfortunately, {{despite the fact that}} the program was recorded for syndication, the only remaining artifacts of the show are seven scripts. All of these are from the first nine weeks of the show, one of which is an original script entitled Tear Drop Tank. The others are The Hate Master, River of Ice, Three Gold Crowns, The Blood Ring, The Devil’s Horns, and The Avenger. All are based on the magazine novels of the same name, with the exception of The Avenger, which is based on the second adventure, The Yellow Hoard. None of the scripts mentions the production crew or <b>cast—in</b> fact, the first three surviving scripts do not even list the authors.|$|E
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central <b>cast-in</b> passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith {{widespread}} {{application of}} ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) system, heat transfer process of pile ground heat exchanger (PGHE) has attracted much attention. Previous researches, studying {{the impact of}} groundwater flow, mainly focus on the PGHE with <b>cast-in</b> U-tubes. However, compared with the PGHE with U-tubes, PGHE with <b>cast-in</b> spiral coils has better heat transfer performance and is more suitable for a modern city with high building density. Therefore, in this paper, a 3 -D simulation model and a simplified analytical model are established to investigate the influence of groundwater flow on the thermal performance of PGHE with <b>cast-in</b> spiral coils. A comparison between these two models is carried out. Both numerical and analytical {{results show that the}} groundwater flow has an enhancing effect on the heat transfer performance of the PGHE with spiral coils and can accelerate the heat transfer process into stability. When the seepage velocity is 1 e- 5 m/s, the average enhancing rate is 22. 98 %...|$|E
40|$|The Australian anchor {{industry}} is rapidly growing, however, guidance {{for the design}} of post-installed and <b>cast-in</b> anchors for safety-critical applications in Australian codes of practice is minimal. The current level of guidance has resulted in a lack of consistency for product assessment and limited guidance for design. This paper summarises a design procedure for <b>cast-in</b> and post-installed anchors that has been endorsed by the Australian Engineered Fasteners and Anchors Council (AEFAC) for adoption in Australia. The design procedure is based on design guidelines that are intended to become a harmonised European Standard. The design guidelines are an imperative part of a framework being developed by AEFAC to enhance quality and safety standards in the Australian fastener industry...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{installation}} of <b>cast-in</b> situ concrete structures such as bored piles and diaphragm walls may influence {{the properties of the}} adjacent soil. Installation effects are important because they may change the stresses applied to, and subsequent performance of <b>cast-in</b> situ bored piles and diaphragm walls. These effects have been studied using the finite element method. In particular the generation of excess pore pressures during construction and subsequent dissipation of these pore pressures have been examined using coupled consolidation analyses. A number of analyses featuring different variations of the construction process have been carried out. The results show that the in-situ stress regimes around bored piles and diaphragm walls do change due to installation and that there is only partial recovery with time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Assembly-box {{concrete}} {{hollow floor}} {{is a new}} kind of cellular voided floor structure, in which a lot of prefabricated box-shaped interior forms are placed regularly on the formwork before the floor concrete is cast. The new type of box-shaped filler is termed assembly-box and could behave as load-bearing elements. Such floor system has many advantages, such as low self-weight, good mechanical behavior, equally flexural stiffness in two directions and high voided rate. The characteristic of this floor structure is the combination of precast assembly-box and <b>cast-in</b> orthogonal grids of ribs. For the purpose of understanding the behavior of this floor, a test has been carried out with three scale specimens under vertical loading. All experimental values provide essentially the same result that a typical flexural failure occurred under ultimate load and the structural system of assembly-box hollow could behave like an overall <b>cast-in</b> hollow floor. A part of the top plate in assembly-box could be viewed as the flange of rib beam during the process of structural design...|$|E
