50|$|CLEP {{tests are}} {{primarily}} multiple-choice exams (though some include fill-in or ordering questions, and one College Composition exam has an essay section) which are {{scored on a}} scale from 20 to 80. The majority of schools grant credit for a score of 50 or higher, but passing scores are determined by the individual schools and may vary. The schools are responsible for awarding the number of credits you would receive for each test. The scores in the table below are endorsed by the American Council on Education as recommended <b>credit-granting</b> scores for each of the exams. On foreign language tests, the score will determine the number of credit granted. For example, one university may grant 8 credits for a score of 50, 12 credits for a score of 62 and 18 credits for a score of 73.|$|E

A few years later, the university consortium created the business institute called CIMBA. In 1991, Clemson University became the degree-granting institution and graduated the first MBA class. In the mid-1990s, CUIS began its summer graduate study abroad program and created offerings for undergraduate students. CUIS began to offer study abroad programs for graduate students in 1997. In 1999, the University of Kansas became the degree-granting university for CUIS. The following year, CUIS offered its first semester-long program for undergraduate students and then later began to offer journalism and communication courses to undergraduate students. In 2008, The University of Iowa (UI) became the new <b>credit-granting</b> institution for CUIS, and CIMBA now offers courses from the UI's Tippie College of Business, College of Engineering, and College of Liberal Arts & Sciences.

40|$|In {{the past}} Taiwanese banks that {{evaluated}} customers ’ credit emphasized collaterals and guarantors, adopting such methods as {{the rule of}} thumb, a credit rating system, and numeric credit scoring system that are primarily based upon subjective judgements. However, Taiwanese banks nowadays no longer possess a superior competitive position, owing to the internationalization and liberalization of Taiwan’s financial market. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop a credit evaluation model to lower banks’ <b>credit-granting</b> risk. This study proposes a contingent fuzzy approach to reduce the type I error or type II error in banks ’ <b>credit-granting.</b> This approach combines cost-volume-profit analysis with Morkovian dynamic programming and uses fuzzy theory to estimate the break-even point interval for the linguistic variable. In other words, the model addresses an objective <b>credit-granting</b> indicator by cost-volume-profit analysis and assures the safety-first decisions through Markovian dynamic programming.

The primary emphasis of the. earlier part of this new literature was on microeconornic phenomena and it contributed importantly to our understanding of the behavior of lenders and borrowers and the nature of the <b>credit-granting</b> process by financial intermediaries. More recently, there has been an increased tendency to focus on the macroeconomic implications of the <b>credit-granting</b> decision and a long debate has been waged over the relative importance in the transmission mechanism of the so-called credit channel and the so-called money channel, although the latter should be more appropriately called the monetary conditions channel.

On this basis, it proposes the AVE-related CPFR mechanism grounded on grid, and further analyzes its working principles, grid methods matching the AVE-related CPFR working flow, the strengths of this mechanism as well as the n-tier prediction working flow. In addition, it constructs the selection model of <b>credit-granting</b> guarantee approaches and provides evidence for it. Under this mechanism, credit risk in the AVE enterprises can be optimized, and the AVE chain matches the working mechanism of CPFR in their capacities of real-time resource sharing, n-tier resource allocation, mission assignment, control, and supervision. It is hoped that the distance management and risk blockage could be achieved in supply chains within AVE enterprises by establishing a strong self-organized and self-control working chain.

40|$|The present work aims to {{shed light}} on the {{different}} factors that affect the <b>credit-granting</b> process, namely the firms tendency to allow payment deferments. These factors are several and not always – or not completely – well known or clearly perceived by the management. Nevertheless, the choice of the <b>credit-granting</b> process should be adequately pondered. For this reason, we have firstly identified two macro-classes of factors: the first one is connected with the structural and dynamic characteristics of the firms (internal factors); whereas the second class refers to variables that depend on the environment in which the firms work (external factors). Secondly, each of the two classes of factors have been further divided into homogeneous sub-classes. From their combined analysis it is possible to increase the awareness of the "forces" that drive each firm to expand or to reduce commercial credit. In concrete, the different key factors cannot be completely separated, even because many factors influence each other or are somehow interrelated. Nevertheless, analyzing one by one all the factors, {{we have been able to}} formulate remarks otherwise not feasible. In concrete, the firms perform, as long as they can, a combined assessment of the different variables, comparing their pros and cons and the agreement between client and supplier on the payment deferment is the result of a compromise between different requirements, but ultimately there always will be a factor that prevails and that will be decisive on "if" and "how much" credit to grant. Among the many factors analyzed, one that seems frequently decisive – and could not be otherwise – is the bargaining power of the parties. In fact, this power is able to endorse, but also to correct or even to reverse a decision that the management would assume only considering the other factors...|$|E
40|$|Accurate <b>credit-granting</b> {{decisions}} {{are crucial to}} {{the efficiency of the}} decentralized capital allocation mechanisms in modern market economies. Credit bureaus and many financial institutions have developed and used credit-scoring models to standardize and automate, to the extent possible, credit decisions. We build credit scoring models for bankcard markets using the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Risk Analysis Division (OCC/RAD) consumer credit database (CCDB). This unusually rich data set allows us to evaluate a number of methods in common practice. We introduce, estimate, and validate our models, using both out-of-sample contemporaneous and future validation data sets. Model performance is compared using both separation and accuracy measures. A vendor-developed generic bureau-based score is also included in the model performance comparisons. Our results indicate that current industry practices, when carefully applied, can produce models that robustly rank-order potential borrowers both at the time of development and through the near future. However, these same methodologies are likely to fail when the the objective is to accurately estimate future rates of delinquency or probabilities of default for individual or groups of borrowers...|$|E
40|$|Credit risk {{analysis}} {{is an active}} research area in financial risk management and credit scoring {{is one of the}} key analytical techniques in credit risk evaluation. In this study, a novel intelligent-agent-based fuzzy group decision making (GDM) model is proposed as an effective multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool for credit risk evaluation. In this proposed model, some artificial intelligent techniques, which are used as intelligent agents, are first used to analyze and evaluate the risk levels of credit applicants over a set of pre-defined criteria. Then these evaluation results, generated by different intelligent agents, are fuzzified into some fuzzy opinions on credit risk level of applicants. Finally, these fuzzification opinions are aggregated into a group consensus and meantime the fuzzy aggregated consensus is defuzzified into a crisp aggregated value to support final decision for decision-makers of <b>credit-granting</b> institutions. For illustration and verification purposes, a simple numerical example and three real-world credit application approval datasets are presented.

40|$|Idiosyncratic knowledge, {{defined as}} the {{internal}} knowledge produced by a bank on each of its borrowers, {{is at the heart}} of the financial intermediation process. Nonetheless, the way bank managers use information in the <b>credit-granting</b> process remains a black box in the existing econometric studies. On the basis of a statistical textual analysis conducted on prior-to-creditcommittee notices of 52 credit files stemming from a social bank, our paper offers three main contributions. First, we show that the social bank under scrutiny produces a rich idiosyncratic knowledge mainly composed of soft information. Second, we reveal how the qualitative and the quantitative dimensions of the idiosyncratic knowledge are used when credit conditions are determined; hierarchy playing a key role in this process of interpretation. Third, our results indicate that the bank relies on an information system as well as on its agents’ cognitive abilities to memorise the idiosyncratic knowledge it produces. In this respect, our research points out deficiencies in the bank’s organisational memory and suggests some directions to remedy them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|At present, {{with new}} {{technologies}} emerging daily {{and the growing}} need for more flexibility in scheduling, {{there seems to be}} an overall drive towards the need for distance learning. According to PBS Campus, 67 % of colleges and universities agree that online education is a critical, long-term strategy for their institution. As a result, 49 % of public colleges and universities and 34 % of all higher education institutions offer complete online degree programs (PBS Campus, 2004). In addition, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, “in the 12 -month 2000 – 2001 academic year, there were an estimated 3, 077, 000 enrollments in all distance education courses offered by 2 -year and 4 -year institutions.

40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{follow-up}} to {{an article published in}} Technique Financi 8 re et Developpement in 2000 (see the appendix to the hardcopy version), which portrayed the first results of a new strategy in the field of development finance implemented in South-East Europe. This strategy consists in creating microfinance banks as greenfield investments, that is, of building up new banks which specialise in providing credit and other financial services to micro and small enterprises, instead of transforming existing <b>credit-granting</b> NGOs into formal banks, which had been the dominant approach in the 1990 s. The present paper shows that this strategy has, {{in the course of the}} last five years, led to the emergence of a network of microfinance banks operating in several parts of the world. After discussing why financial sector development is a crucial determinant of general social and economic development and contrasting the new strategy to former approaches in the area of development finance, the paper provides information about the shareholder composition and the investment portfolio of what is at present the world's largest and most successful network of microfinance banks. This network is a good example of a well-functioning private public partnership. The paper then provides performance figures and discusses why the creation of such a network seems to be a particularly promising approach to the creation of financially self-sustaining financial institutions with a clear developmental objective...|$|E
40|$|The Equal Credit Opportunity Act {{was enacted}} in 1974 as (1) a {{consumer}} protection statute {{designed to provide}} accurate information to and about consumers involved in credit transactions, and (2) an antidiscrimination statute designed to shield protected classes of consumers from discrimination in the granting of credit. The Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations to further these statutory goals. Congress intended that the Act would be enforced through both private litigation and public compliance programs. Few private lawsuits have been brought under the Act, however, and public enforcement efforts have neither checked credit discrimination nor halted perpetuation of prior discrimination. Professor Matheson believes that courts, government enforcement agencies, and consumers should focus on substantive (rather than procedural) violations of the Act and its implementing regulations. The Act should be amended {{to allow for a}} minimum damage recovery for successful plaintiffs. The definition of 2 ̆ 2 adverse action 2 ̆ 2 in the regulations should be amended to acknowledge that credit granted on different terms than those requested by an applicant may indicate illegal discrimination. Detailed statistical information must be kept by <b>credit-granting</b> institutions and made available to private litigants and government enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying and eliminating credit discrimination.
