5|$|The Beacon-class gunvessels were a {{class of}} {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s. They were the first warships of the Royal Navy expressly designed to use the engines of an older <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> with a different hull shape. They were generally deployed overseas to the China, East Indies, West Africa, Pacific, North America and West Indies Stations. In addition to , the ships fought pirates and suppressed the slave trade in East and West Africa. As their engines wore out in the mid-1880s, they were mostly retired and scrapped {{by the end of}} the decade. A few survived into the early 1900s as they were modified for harbour service before being sold or scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{conventional}} single-engined container ships, the new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> has a twin-skeg design: it has twin diesel engines, each {{driving a}} separate propeller. Usually, a single engine is more efficient, but using two propellers allows a better distribution of pressure, {{which increases the}} propeller efficiency more than the disadvantage of using two engines.|$|E

25|$|The Endurance class amphibious {{transport}} docks are {{the biggest}} <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in the RSN. They were designed and built locally by ST Marine to replace the old County class tank landing ships (LST). Each ship is fitted with a well dock that can accommodate four landing craft and a flight deck that can accommodate two medium lift helicopters. While the RSN describes the Endurance class as LSTs, they lack the beaching capability traditionally associated with LSTs, and their well docks and flight decks qualify the Endurance class more as amphibious transport docks.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the RSN ordered six Victory class {{corvette}}s from Friedrich Lürssen Werft of Germany. The first corvette {{was built}} in Germany while the remaining five were built locally by ST Marine. The corvettes were also the first <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in the RSN to have an anti-submarine capability. The corvettes are noted for being the fastest ships in the fleet, and for their tall mast, making them top-heavy compared to ships of similar class. However, this is suitable within the fairly calm Singapore waters. The six corvettes form the 188 Squadron of the RSN.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the British Royal Navy had a {{requirement}} for a destroyer leader suitable for leading the new, fast, R-class destroyers. To meet this requirement, the Director of Naval Construction prepared {{the design of a}} new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> smaller and cheaper than the existing Marksman and es, but still capable of accommodating the additional staff required to command the destroyer flotilla and carrying the same armament. Five ships of the new class were ordered in April–July 1916, with Valentine one of two ships ordered from Cammell Laird in July that year at a tender price of £218,000 per ship. Valentine was laid down at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 7 August 1916, was launched on 24 March 1917 and completed on 27 June 1917.|$|E

25|$|The {{outcome was}} a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> {{exceeding}} 2,500 tons. Solutions to the stability problems of earlier classes were {{incorporated in the}} design, with a lower bridge and a slightly wider and deeper hull. Weaponry was restored to the six 5inch guns of the Fubukis, in Type C mountings, and eight 24inch torpedoes, in two quadruple mountings with improved reloading facilities, were also fitted. New engines and machinery layouts were used to improve performance and weight. As completed, there was no improvement to anti-submarine and anti-aircraft (AA) weaponry, somewhat surprisingly in view of Japan's commitment to naval aviation and the anti-aircraft capability of the subsequent Akizuki class. During 1943 and 1944, however, the AA outfit was improved on the surviving ships and radar was fitted.|$|E
25|$|John Finn is the 63rd Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, {{the first}} of which, , was {{commissioned}} in July 1991. With 75 ships planned {{to be built in}} total, the class has the longest production run for any U.S. Navy surface combatant. As an Arleigh Burke-class ship, John Finns roles included anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and anti-surface warfare, as well as strike operations. During its long production run, the class was built in three flights: Flight I (DDG-51–DDG-71), Flight II (DDG-72–DDG-78), and Flight IIA (DDG-79–DDG-126). John Finn will be a Flight IIA ship, and as such, will feature several improvements in terms of ballistic missile defense, an embarked air wing (two MH-60R Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System helicopters), and the inclusion of mine-detecting ability. DDG-51 was also the first <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in the U.S. Navy to include anti-NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical) warfare protection.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the ships}} proved {{versatile}} and durable, and had long second lives postwar. One became a specialized flagship late in her life. Some became oceanographic and hydrographic survey ships, either in U.S. Navy, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or Greek service. Eighteen {{were transferred to}} the United States Coast Guard – where they became known as Casco-class cutters – between 1946 and 1949 for service mostly as weather reporting ships, a role they played until the late 1960s and early 1970s; some of the Coast Guard ships saw service in the Vietnam War, and one survived as a cutter until 1988. A number of the units of the class were transferred to foreign navies, including those of Ethiopia, Italy, Norway, the Philippines, and South Vietnam, for use as patrol vessels and training ships, and a few saw commercial service as cruise ships in Greece. The murky information available on a unit incorporated into the Vietnam People's Navy {{after the fall of}} South Vietnam in 1975 suggests that she remained active until at least 2000 and may remain active today; even if reports of her longevity are inaccurate, {{it should be noted that}} the last member of this large and long-lived <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> did not leave service until 1993, when the ship transferred to Italy was decommissioned by the Italian Navy.|$|E
