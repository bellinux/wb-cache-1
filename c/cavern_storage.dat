50|$|Just {{south of}} the main {{entrance}} and main security fence stands a single railway platform, for workers access to the site. Within the security fence, the marshalling yard of 8 parallel loops exists, formerly shunted by a dedicated MoD diesel hydraulic shunting locomotive.

40|$|Monitoring {{the ground}} {{deformation}} concerns {{the safety of}} gas storages much. The ground deformation in salt <b>cavern</b> gas <b>storage</b> area is characterized by spatial diversity and temporal nonlinearity owing to the spatial distribution of salt caverns and the cyclic variation of stress environment. A technique with high spatial and temporal monitoring density is therefore needed to fully reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ground deformation in salt <b>cavern</b> gas <b>storage</b> area. Based on permanent scattered interferometry (PSI) technique, the ground deformation history in Jintan salt <b>cavern</b> gas <b>storage</b> area from 2007 to 2010 was retrieved using PALSAR data.

The ground deformation in Jintan gas storage area presents obvious spatial patterns. Area with high settlement velocity corresponds to the area with intense human engineering activities. In addition, nonlinear behaviors {{were found in the}} ground deformation history in Jintan gas storage area; and this deformation history could be divided into three stages of settlement and two stages of uplifts.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years, <b>cavern</b> <b>storage</b> of LPG's, petrochemicals, such as {{ethylene}} and propylene, and {{other petroleum products}} has increased dramatically. In 1991, the Gas Processors Association (GPA) lists the total U. S. underground storage capacity for LPG's and related products of approximately 519 million barrels (82. 5 million cubic meters) in 1, 122 separate caverns. Of this total, 70 are hard rock caverns and the remaining 1, 052 are caverns in salt deposits. However, along the eastern seaboard of the U. S. and the Pacific northwest, salt deposits are not available and therefore, storage in hard rocks is required. Limited demand and high cost has prevented the construction of hard rock caverns {{in this country for}} a number of years. The storage of natural gas in mined caverns may prove technically feasible if the geology of the targeted market area is suitable; and economically feasible if the cost and convenience of service is competitive with alternative available storage methods for peak supply requirements. Competing methods include LNG facilities and remote underground storage combined with pipeline transportation to the area. It is believed that mined <b>cavern</b> <b>storage</b> can provide the advantages of high delivery rates and multiple fill withdrawal cycles in areas where salt <b>cavern</b> <b>storage</b> is not possible. In this research project, PB-KBB merged advanced mining technologies and gas refrigeration techniques to develop conceptual designs and cost estimates to demonstrate the commercialization potential of the storage of refrigerated natural gas in hard rock caverns.

The article {{presents}} {{issues related to}} technical and economic optimization of filling underground gas <b>storage</b> in salt <b>cavern</b> (CUGS) on the example of Mogilno. Operation practice suggests that {{the first step is}} to inject the caverns with a high convergence, then with smaller and at the end caverns with the smallest convergence. In the withdraw process, the situation is reversed. On the other hand, the gas injection into the deepest caverns requires more compressor power. Optimization that takes into account only the speed of <b>storage</b> <b>caverns</b> convergence is not ideal. While injecting gas into <b>storage</b> <b>caverns,</b> compressors typically use about 1 – 3 % of the transported gas, depending on the management of compressors operation. Taking into account the amount of gas supplied to the CUGS Mogilno, the cost of fuel gas that is used can be significant. In the liberalized gas market an underground gas storage operator will have to account carefully and buy fuel gas at market prices. These facts raise an important question: how to manage the operation, in a free gas market in the most efficient way which affects the profitability service storage provision in underground gas <b>storage</b> in salt <b>caverns.</b> This paper presents the optimization model, developed by the authors, that minimizes the consumption of fuel gas, while preventing overdependence loss of underground salt caverns volume, during the gas injecting process into <b>storage</b> <b>caverns.</b> Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|AbstractThe {{underground}} water-sealed storage {{technique is}} critically important and generally accepted for the national energy strategy in China. Although several small underground water-sealed oil <b>storage</b> <b>caverns</b> have been built in China since the 1970 s, {{there is still a}} lack of experience for large-volume underground storage in complicated geological conditions. The current design concept of water curtain system and the technical instruction for system operation have limitations in maintaining the stability of surrounding rock mass during the construction of the main <b>storage</b> <b>caverns,</b> as well as the long-term stability. Although several large-scale underground oil storage projects are under construction at present in China, the design concepts and construction methods, especially for the water curtain system, are mainly based on the ideal porosity medium flow theory and the experiences gained from the similar projects overseas. The storage projects currently constructed in China have the specific features such as huge scale, large depth, multiple-level arrangement, high seepage pressure, complicated geological conditions, and high in situ stresses, which are the challenging issues for the stability of the <b>storage</b> <b>caverns.</b> Based on years' experiences obtained from the first large-scale (millions of cubic meters) underground water-sealed oil storage project in China, some design and operation problems related to water curtain system during project construction are discussed. The drawbacks and merits of the water curtain system are also presented. As an example, the conventional concept of “filling joints with water” is widely used in many cases, as a basic concept for the design of the water curtain system, but it is immature. In this paper, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the conventional concept are pointed out, with respect to the long-term stability as well as the safety of construction of <b>storage</b> <b>caverns.</b> Finally, new concepts and principles for design and construction of the underground water-sealed oil <b>storage</b> <b>caverns</b> are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Salt <b>cavern</b> <b>storage</b> {{is usually}} in bedded salt rock {{formation}} except salt dome, {{in particular in}} China. The rocks composing a bedded salt rock formation, e. g., mudstone, rock salt, interlayer, etc., often present viscoelastic-plastic behaviors, which is an important influencing factor of the long-term stability of salt caverns in it. Modelling the rheological behavior with the Druck-Prager creep model, an example of stability analysis of four salt caverns at Jintan Salt Mine of China with the finite element method is elaborated in this paper. The results show that besides the inevitable loss of effective storage room with time due to creep deformation, which decreases evidently with internal pressure but decreases slowly at a certain pressure value, the variation of operating internal pressure in each cavern can cause the change of volumes of other nearby caverns and then affect the stability of all the caverns. The internal pressure difference should be as small as possible during the operation of salt caverns...|$|E

Five regions of the U. S. A. were studied for underground storage development and PB-KBB reviewed the literature to determine if the geology of these regions was suitable for siting hard rock storage caverns. Area gas market conditions in these regions were also studied to determine the need for such storage. Based on an analysis of many factors, a possible site was determined to be in Howard and Montgomery Counties, Maryland. The area has compatible geology and a gas industry infrastructure for the nearby market populous of Baltimore and Washington D. C [...] As Gas temperature is lowered, the compressibility of the gas reaches an optimum value. The compressibility of the gas, and the resultant gas density, is a function of temperature and pressure. This relationship can be used to commercial advantage by reducing the size of a storage cavern for a given working volume of natural gas. This study looks at this relationship and and the potential for commercialization of the process in a storage application. A conceptual process design, and cavern design were developed for various operating conditions. Potential site locations were considered and a typical plant layout was developed. In addition a geomechanical review of the proposed cavern design was performed, evaluating the stability of the mine rooms and shafts, and the effects of the refrigerated gas temperatures on the stability of the cavern. Capital and operating cost estimates were also developed for the various temperature cases considered. The cost estimates developed were used to perform a comparative market analysis of this type of gas storage system to other systems that are commercially used in the region of the study...|$|E
40|$|A viable {{hydrogen}} {{infrastructure is}} one of the main challenges for fuel cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or <b>cavern</b> <b>storage</b> since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants.
