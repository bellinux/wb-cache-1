5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes. Eruptions can last anywhere from hours to days, with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes. Although they {{are associated with}} felsic magma, Plinian eruptions <b>can</b> <b>just</b> as well occur at basaltic volcanoes, given that the magma chamber differentiates and has a structure rich in silicon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces <b>can</b> <b>just</b> be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E

25|$|In Austria a colloquially called {{church tax}} (Kirchensteuer, officially called Kirchenbeitrag, i.e. church contribution) {{has to be}} paid {{by members of the}} Catholic and Protestant Church. It is levied by the churches {{themselves}} and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax <b>can</b> <b>just</b> be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1% (Catholic church) and 1.5% (Protestant church).|$|E

25|$|Every order theoretic {{definition}} has its dual: it is {{the notion}} one obtains by applying the definition to the inverse order. Since all concepts are symmetric, this operation preserves the theorems of partial orders. For a given mathematical result, one <b>can</b> <b>just</b> invert the order and replace all definitions by their duals and one obtains another valid theorem. This is important and useful, since one obtains two theorems {{for the price of}} one. Some more details and examples {{can be found in the}} article on duality in order theory.|$|E
25|$|Uniaxial {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one <b>can</b> <b>just</b> as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
25|$|The single {{candle in}} the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched {{chandelier}} is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude {{to the presence of}} the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni's side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub <b>can</b> <b>just</b> be seen on his wife's side, evoking a common literary metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.|$|E

That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I <b>can</b> <b>just,</b> sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been issues {{with the use of}} false DMCA {{takedown}} notices. Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer <b>can</b> <b>just</b> claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses). In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on Second Life is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.|$|E
25|$|The sunni {{scholar and}} sufi mystic Ibn Arabi stated the angels {{are the first}} beings created and {{distinguished}} between angels of the corporeal and the incorporeal world, called Al-Ama (the cloud), there all of the creation will be created. In this place, angelic beings dwelled {{in the presence of}} God, but are unable to recognize each other or even themselves, until God elected one of them, to become the Higher Pen writing, everything God will create in the cosmos. The angels in the corporeal world are more akin to the humans than in the majority Islamic view. Accordingly, angels are spirits blown into light, while humans are spirits blown into shape, and jinn spirits blown into wind (wind is referring to the hot air, discharged from the flame called marijin min nar, from which the jinn are created according to the Quran). Humans are even superior to the angels, because angels <b>can</b> <b>just</b> follow straight lines, therefore they can function as forces of nature and perform specific tasks but are unable to know Gods names, attributes or to perceive God in different ways like humans can do. Angels hesitated to bow before Adam, because they were unable to see the true nature of human. Some angels erred in believing their way of perceiving God is the only way, and they become guilty of opposing Adam as a vice regent and fixing on one interpretation of God to the exclusion of others.|$|E
