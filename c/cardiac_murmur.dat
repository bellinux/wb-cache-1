40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} on {{analysis of the}} pathologic <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> for congenital heart defects was proposed based on the wavelet packet (WP) technique. Considering the difference of the energy intensity distributions for the innocent and pathologic murmurs in frequency domain, the WP decomposition was introduced and the WP energies at each frequency band were calculated and compared. Based on the analysis of {{a large amount of}} clinic heart sound data, the murmurs energy distributions were divided into five frequency bands, and the relative evaluation indexes for <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> (ICM) were proposed for analysis of the pathologic murmurs. Finally, the threshold values between the innocent and pathologic <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> were determined based on the statistical results of the normal heart sounds.

The histology of this lesion {{was found to be}} identical with the arterial intimal changes. It has been postulated that Takayasu's arteriopathy may rarely extend to the valvular and mural endocardium of the heart, producing <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs.</b> Similar cases with <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> reported earlier and attributed to associated rheumatic endocarditis were probably due to the same pathological process extending to the endocarditis...|$|R
40|$|In this study, 28 horses of {{different}} breeds were examined at rest using auscultation, digital phonocardiography and echocardiography. After the auscultatory examination, {{it was possible}} to classify the 28 horses in four groups. The first group only contained one healthy test sub-ject. This animal was used to prepare a phonocardiogram without any <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> with the Welch Allyn Meditron Analyser 4. 0. The second group consisted of patients with diastolic murmurs (n = 10). The third group was made up of horses with systolic murmurs (n = 12). Horses with both diastolic and systolic murmurs were put into a fourth group (n = 5). Two horses from the second group and three horses from the third group displayed special characteristics in their phonocardiograms that set them apart from the other test subjects in their respective groups. Those five animals were discussed in more detail in individual case studies (diastolic murmur with a greater variation in intensity, a spindle-shaped murmur of grade 2 intensity in the atrioventricular block with otherwise presystolic murmur, functional murmur in addition to systolic regurgitant murmur, murmur sound variations with atrial fib-rillation, <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> due to a tetralogy of Fallot). The echocardiographic examination was used to assess the actual state of the heart and in-cluded standard section B-mode images, M-mode measurements of contractility and Doppler ultrasound. The latter was employed to, on the one hand, evaluate cardiac valve function in colour and, on the other hand, measure the speed of regurgitation on the insufficient cardiac valves using CW-Doppler ultrasound. Five horses from the second group were diagnosed with severe aortic insufficiency using echocardiography. Four horses from the same group were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe and one with mild aortic insufficiency. The group with systolic murmurs consisted of animals with the following valve insufficiencies: five moderate and one mild-to-moderate mitral in-sufficiencies, four horses with mild, moderate, mild-to-moderate or moderate-to-severe tri-cuspid insufficiencies with additional pulmonary disease (pulmonary abscess, COB and two horses with interstitial pneumopathy), one horse with moderate-to-severe tricuspid insuffi-ciency and severe mitral insufficiency. One foal displayed the characteristic abnormalities of a tetralogy of Fallot. All horses also underwent a phonocardiographic examination. The Meditron Analyser permits the simultaneous recording of an ECG and a PCG. For each patient, recordings were taken from the left-hand side on the auscultation points of the mitral valve, the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve and from the right-hand side on the tricuspid valve. The <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> were assessed visually according to their respective patterns using the following criteria - auscultation points, frequency, phase of the cardiac cycle and characteristics and intensity of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs.</b> The intensity of the murmurs was determined semi-quantitatively {{on the basis of the}} amplitude. Using a descriptive approach, it was the objective of this study to assess the validity and use-fulness of digital phonocardiography. Auscultation plays an important role in cardiac diag-nostics and phonocardiography can serve as a useful addition. In this study I discussed and evaluated factors that influence the representation of <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs.</b> A special focus was on the auscultated intensity and on the phonocardiographic amplitude of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> vis-à-vis the severity of valvular insufficiency. In this connection I found that intensity and amplitude do not always reflect the severity of the condition. In addition, it became clear that <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> are carried away with the flow of blood. This means that the auscultation points are not to be regarded as fixed points, but that one should more correctly speak of aus-cultation areas. Moreover, <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> resulting from an insufficient valve are not neces-sarily heard the loudest over this valve...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the auscultatory findings using traditional and electronic sensor-based stethoscopes. Thirty-three adult healthy Beagles (20 females, 13 males, mean age: 4. 8 years, range 1. 4 – 8 years) were auscultated by four investigators with different experiences (INVEST- 1, - 2, - 3 and - 4) independently with both stethoscopes. Final cardiological diagnoses were established by echocardiography. Mitral murmurs were heard with both stethoscopes by all investigators and echocardiography revealed mild mitral valve insufficiency in 7 dogs (21 %, 4 females, 3 males). The statistical sensitivity (Se) in recognising <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> proved to be 82 % using the traditional stethoscope and 75 % using the electronic one in the mean of the four examiners, whilst statistical specificity (Sp) was 99 % by the traditional and 100 % by the electronic stethoscope. The means of the auscultatory sensitivity differences between the two stethoscopes were 0. 36 on the left and 0. 59 on the right hemithorax, demonstrating an advantage for the electronic stethoscope being more obvious above the right hemithorax (P = 0. 0340). The electronic stethoscope proved to be superior to the traditional one in excluding <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> and especially in auscultation over the right hemithorax.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{access the}} {{incidence}} of diagnostic errors in the initial evaluation of children with <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs.</b> METHODS: We evaluated our 7 -years of experience in a public pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic. Of 3692 patients who {{were sent to the}} hospital, 2603 presented with a heart murmur and were investigated. Patients for whom a disagreement existed between the initial and final diagnoses were divided into the following 2 groups: G 1 (n= 17) with an initial diagnosis of an innocent murmur and a final diagnosis of cardiopathy, and G 2 (n= 161) with an initial diagnosis of cardiopathy and a final diagnosis of a normal heart. RESULTS: In G 1, the great majority of patients had cardiac defects with mild hemodynamic repercussions, such as small ventricular septal defect and mild pulmonary stenosis. In G 2, the great majority of structural defects were interventricular communication, atrial septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. CONCLUSION: A global analysis demonstrated that diagnostic error in the initial evaluation of children with <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> is real, reaching approximately 6 % of cases. The majority of these misdiagnoses were in patients with an initial diagnosis of cardiopathy, which was not confirmed through later complementary examinations. Clinical cardiovascular examination is an excellent resource in the evaluation of children suspected of having cardiopathy. Immediate outpatient discharge of children with an initial diagnosis of an innocent heart murmur seems to be a suitable approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A 67 -years {{old woman}} with no cardiac past history was {{presented}} postoperatively after elective surgery for per-trochanteric femur fracture with dyspnea, hypotension, pulmonary congestion, oliguria and tachycardia. Cardiogenic shock was suspected {{and she was}} transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) and treated as such with diuretic and an inotropic agent. No improvement occurred and her condition deteriorated with a new systolic parasternal <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmur.</b> Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DLVOTO) was considered and proven by echocardiographic studies. The inotropic therapy was discontinued and fluid expansion was given. Rapid uneventful recovery occurred. Myocardial infarction was biochemically excluded. Follow-up echocardiography demonstrated mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographic evaluation of critically ill patients deteriorating after the initiation of inotropic treatment for hypoten-sion, especially when a new <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmur</b> is heard, is of pivotal importance since dobutamine-induced DLVOTO, asso-ciated with hypovolemia, is conversely treated with discontinuation of inotropic drugs and appropriate volume expansion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background All hip {{fracture}} {{patients with}} a <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmur</b> have an echocardiogram {{as a part of}} their preoperative work-up in our unit. We performed a retrospective audit {{to assess the impact of}} obtaining a pre-operative echocardiogram on the management of hip fracture patients. Methods All hip fracture patients (N = 349) between 01 / 06 / 08 and 01 / 06 / 09 were included in the study. 29 patients had pre-operative echocardiogram (echo group). A computer generated randomised sample of 40 patients was generated from N, 'non-echo' group. Data was obtained from medical records and the Hospital Information Support System (HISS). The groups were compared using Student's t test. Approval was obtained locally from the clinical governance department for this project. Results Age and gender distribution were similar in both groups. Indication for echo was an acute cardiac abnormality in 4 cases. 25 patients had echo for no new cardiac problem (indication being <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmur</b> in 23 patients and extensive cardiac history in 2 cases). Cardiology opinion was sought in 5 cases. No patient required cardiac surgery or balloon angioplasty preoperatively. Patients having pre-operative echo had significant delay to surgery (average 2. 7 days, range 0 - 6 days) compared to 'non-echo' group (average 1. 1 days, range 0 - 3 days), (p Conclusion We have developed departmental guidelines for expediting echo requests in hip fracture patients with <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmur.</b> A liaison has been established with our cardiology department to prioritise such patients on the Echocardiography waiting list, to prevent unnecessary avoidable delay.

40|$|Background: Relationships between <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> {{detected}} during {{physical examination}} and {{coronary heart disease}} mortality among the general population are not well described. Aims: To assess the relationship between <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> detected during physical examination and coronary heart disease mortality. Methods and Results: This relationship was examined with Cox regression analyses of data from 7990 adults, aged 30 – 75 years, from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study (1976 – 1992). Covariates included age, race, sex, history of CVD, diabetes, probable left ventricular hypertrophy, serum cholesterol, body mass index, blood pressure, and smoking status. During 16. 8 follow-up years, there were 457 deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) (ICD- 9 410 – 414) and 661 deaths from diseases of the heart (ICD- 9 390 – 398, 402, 404, 410 – 414, 415 – 417, 420 – 429). A systolic murmur was present in 420 persons and a diastolic murmur was present in 56 persons at baseline. Persons with a heart murmur were at increased risk of death from CHD (relative risk= 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval= 1. 2, 2. 5) and from diseases of the heart (RR= 2. 2, 95 % CI= 1. 6, 2. 9) after multivariate adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Similar results were observed when murmur intensity (i. e., murmur grade) was accounted for. Conclusions: These {{results suggest that the}} presence of a heart murmur may be associated with an increased risk for mortality from both CHD and diseases of the heart...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the usefulness of cardiovascular symptoms and signs in the recognition of significant congenital heart lesions that required surgical or catheter interventions in different pediatric age groups. Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out of 110 patients with significant heart anomalies that required surgical or catheter interventions (group I) and 113 children, presenting with <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs,</b> with congenital heart conditions not requiring any interventions. (group II) Results: Clinical symptoms or signs were significantly more common in group I than in group II subjects (85 % vs 32 %, P < 0. 0001). The odds of having significant lesions requiring interventions in the presence of either cardiovascular symptoms or signs were 37. 5 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 5 - 218. 1) for neonates, 14. 5 (95 %CI: 4. 7 - 51. 7) for infants, and 8. 0 (95 %CI: 3. 3 - 19. 2) for children and adolescents. In neonates, the negative predictive values of the absence of symptoms or signs in isolation were relatively low at 64 % and 65 %, respectively. In children beyond infancy, the positive predictive values of the presence of symptoms or signs in isolation were also low at 62 % and 68 %, respectively. Conclusions: Clinical assessment of cardiovascular symptoms and signs remains useful in the evaluation of the significance of pathological <b>cardiac</b> <b>murmurs</b> in children in the present era of technology.
