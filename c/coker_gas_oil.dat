40|$|To {{clarify the}} effect of sulfur {{compound}} addition on catalytic activity and catalyst deactivation, hydrodesulfur ization (HDS) of <b>coker</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (CGO) was carried out over demetallation catalysts, metal tolerant desulfurization catalyst and desulfurization catalysts. The initial HDS constant and catalyst life were slightly improved {{by the addition of}} 1 000 ppm of dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), probably by the prevention of coking on the catalyst surface. The CH 3 S radical formed via thermal decomposition was important in the suppression of recombination of heavy hydrocarbon radicals which results in coke or coke precursor formation. The addition of small amounts of sulfur compounds to the CGO is expected to reduce coke formation during the early stages of HDS. 数種類の水素化脱メタル触媒，耐メタル水素化脱硫触媒および水素化脱硫触媒を用いて， 1. 88 wt％の硫黄を含む熱分解重質軽油（CGO）の脱硫反応を高圧撹拌槽型反応器で行い，触媒の初期反応速度および活性劣化に及ぼすジメチルジスルフィド（DMDS）の添加の効果について検討した。さらに，使用済み触媒の表面積および堆積したコーク量の測定を行った。その結果， 1000 ppm程度のDMDSの添加により，反応開始後 24 hまでの初期反応速度が 3 ％程度大きくなり，また活性劣化因子は最大 10 ％程度小さくなった。DMDSの添加により，触媒表面上に堆積するコーク量が減少したことが触媒活性の向上に寄与したと考えられる。すなわち，添加したDMDSの熱分解で発生したCH 3 S・ラジカルが原料油の分解で生成する炭化水素ラジカルと優先的に反応して，コークあるいはその前駆体の生成を抑制したものと考えられる。このように，微量のDMDSを添加することにより，触媒の活性劣化が抑制できると考えられる...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} regression model for hydrogen consumption during hydrotreating of several <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> such as virgin light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VLGO), hydrocracker light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (HLGO), <b>coker</b> light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (KLGO), and a partially hydrotreated heavy <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (PHTHGO) stream over commercial NiMo/ɣ-Al 2 O 3 in a micro-trickle bed reactor. The experiments covered a temperature range of 353 - 387 °C, pressure range of 8. 27 - 10. 12 MPa, LHSV range of 0. 7 - 2. 3 h- 1, and H 2 /oil ratio = 600 N m 3 /m 3. H 2 consumption can be determined by different approaches; therefore, the best approach was selected by comparing the following: analysis of H 2 content in gas streams, analysis of H 2 content in liquid streams, and an approach reported in literature that is based on the decrease of the aromatics content. The comparison showed better agreement between the analysis of H 2 content in gas streams and the method reported in the literature. For this reason, the analysis of gas streams was selected to build a regression model by performing statistical analysis of the effects of process conditions on H 2 consumption data at the conditions mentioned above. H 2 consumption based on gas analysis decreased in the following order: KLGO>VLGO>HLGO>PHTHGO. The H 2 consumption regression model developed in this work was then tested with a new batch of experimental data, and the model performed better than similar correlations available in the literature. The secondary {{objective of this}} work was to study the effects of process conditions indicated above on hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), and hydrodearomatization (HDA) conversions by statistical analysis. The experimental data of hydrotreating conversions were then used to build regression models and carry out the optimization of process conditions for each feedstock. The optimum sets of conditions for the hydrotreating of each feedstock are the following: VLGO (T = 353 °C, P = 9. 37 MPa, LHSV = 0. 9 h- 1), HLGO (T = 383 °C, P = 10. 12 MPa, LHSV = 0. 9 h- 1), KLGO (T = 372 °C, P = 7. 79 MPa, LHSV = 0. 7 h- 1), PHTHGO (T = 379 °C, P = 9. 44 MPa, LHSV = 0. 7 h- 1). In summary, the optimum hydrogen consumption as well as hydroprocessing conditions for all the four different feedstocks are substantially different. This information is critical in operating a commercial hydrotreater efficiently...|$|R

30|$|As {{crude oil}} supply {{all over the}} world is {{becoming}} heavier and inferior in quality and the demand for middle distillate is larger, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is still the key process in oil refinery and is now in rapid development [6]. The retardation effects of nitrogen compounds and condensed aromatics in FCC process have to be figured out if shale oil is used to produce clean fuel. The retarding effects of basic nitrogen compounds may be explained by two mechanisms [7, 8, 9]. First, the basic nitrogen compounds reversibly absorb on the Brønsted or Lewis acid centers and then poison the acid centers, thus weaken other hydrocarbons cracking ability. Second, since their big size and aromatic nature, the basic nitrogen compounds may be the precursors of coke. Li et al. [10] found that the retarding effects of non-basic compounds and condensed aromatics in catalytic cracking of <b>coker</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> are not as serious as those of basic nitrogen compounds.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{electrospray}} ionization (ESI) {{coupled with}} Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has been widely applied for characterizing nitrogen compounds in crude oil and its distillates [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], oil bitumen sands [16], and shale oils [17, 18]. ESI FT-ICR MS {{can be used to}} identify the molecular structure of nitrogen compounds with high-molecular-weight and double-bond equivalent (DBE) values. However, amine species could not be distinguished from pyridine or pyrrole derivatives by ESI FT-ICR MS if they have the same DBE values. For instance, ESI FT-ICR MS cannot identify whether nitrogen compounds with a DBE value of 4 are pyridine derivatives or aniline derivatives. Fortunately, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis can provide some chemical functional group information to understand the molecular structures of compounds more clearly. In this study, ESI FT-ICR MS combined with FT-IR was used to characterize the nitrogen compounds in CGO, which can give a more accurate characterization of nitrogen compounds in <b>coker</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

The results demonstrate that the m/z of basic and non-basic nitrogen compounds ranges from 180 to 560 and from 200 to 460, respectively. Six basic nitrogen compounds, N 1 (a molecule contains one nitrogen atom, similarly hereinafter), N 1 O 1, N 1 O 1 S 1, N 1 O 2, N 1 S 1, and N 2, are identified by their positive-ion mass spectra, and four non-basic nitrogen compounds, N 1, N 1 O 1, N 1 S 1, and N 2, are characterized by their negative-ion mass spectra. Among these nitrogen compounds, the N 1 class species are the most predominant. Combined with the data of ESI FT-ICR MS and FT-IR, the basic N 1 class species are likely pyridines, naphthenic pyridines, quinolines, and benzoquinolines. The most non-basic N 1 class species are derivatives of benzocarbazole. The N 2 class species are likely amphoteric molecules with pyridine and pyrrole core structures.|$|E

30|$|<b>Coker</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (CGO), a {{main product}} {{derived from the}} coking process, {{can be used as}} the {{feedstock}} of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. However, when the FCC unit is blended with a certain amount (generally less than 20 wt%) of CGO, the activity and selectivity of catalyst decrease, the feedstock conversion drops, recycle oil and slurry oil withdrawal increase, the yield of coke increases, product distribution deteriorates, and CGO bending ratio becomes strictly limited [1, 2, 3]. Earlier works [4, 5] on this subject concluded that nitrogen compounds in CGO, especially basic nitrogen compounds, could heavily deactivate FCC catalysts. The poisonous basic nitrogen compounds could reversibly adsorb onto the acid site of catalyst, resulting in a diminution of acid centers, or acted as coke precursors due to their size and aromatic nature [6]. Fu and schaffer [7] and Ho et al. [8] proposed that nitrogen content, proton affinity, and molecular size (or molecular weight) of basic nitrogen compounds were the key factors affecting the performance of FCC. Nevertheless, Li et al. [9, 10] argued that the effect of structure and composition of basic nitrogen compounds was much more obvious than that of nitrogen content. Consequently, the characterizing nitrogen compounds in CGO and investigating the nitrogen compounds how to deactivate FCC catalysts have become research hotspots.|$|E

40|$|New {{catalyst}} {{development for}} the hydrotreating process, employing functionalized mesoporous carbon (mC) support is studied. mC support was prepared by the volume templating of alkali modified SBA- 15 using sucrose as the carbon source and then functionalized using nitric acid of various concentrations (upto 8 M HNO 3). A series of NiMo catalysts (12 % Mo and 2. 4 % Ni) were prepared using these functionalized mC supports. The supports and catalysts were characterized by N 2 physisorption, SAXS, XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM, TEM, H 2 -TPR and HRTEM. SAXS results indicated mild reduction in ordered structure of mesoporous carbons after functionalization. N 2 physisorption analysis indicated progressive reduction in surface area and pore volume {{with the increase in}} nitric acid concentration. Enhancement of surface functional groups and acidity after functionalization were observed through FTIR spectroscopy and Boehm titration. SEM images showed the retention of needle like morphology in all functionalized carbon supports. TEM images showed that the increase in nitric acid concentration causes excessive etching, resulting in the reduction of ordered structure of functionalized mesoporous carbons. Hydrotreating study of these NiMo/mC catalysts were carried out under industrial operating conditions in a laboratory scale trickle bed reactor using <b>coker</b> light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> derived from Athabasca bitumen as feedstock. NiMo catalyst supported on 6 M acid treated mC (i. e. NiMo/mC- 6 M) showed the highest activity due to higher surface functional groups, higher acidity and better textural properties. The HDS and HDN activities of NiMo/mC- 6 M catalyst were higher than that of NiMo/ã-Al 2 O 3 catalyst owing to lower support metal interaction (SMI), higher surface area and effective functionalization. Using the mC- 6 M support, NiMo catalysts with different metal loading (12 – 27 % Mo, 2. 4 to 5. 4 % Ni) were prepared and characterized. Hydrotreating activity study of these catalysts indicated that the catalyst with 22 % Mo and 2. 9 % Ni loading was the optimum catalyst on 6 M functionalized mC support. Higher metal loading (> 22 %Mo) led to excessive pore blockage and improper metal dispersion resulting in decreased activity. Kinetic study of the optimum catalyst was carried out by varying temperature (330 °C to 370 °C), gas-to-oil ratio (400 – 1000 Nm 3 /m 3), LHSV (1. 0 to 2. 5 hr- 1) and pressure (7. 8 to 9. 8 MPa) and the data was fitted by non-linear regression method using power law model. The calculated reaction orders and activation energies were 2. 8, 1. 5 and 189 KJ/mol, 98. 9 KJ/mol for HDS and HDN, respectively. The results of HRTEM and H 2 -TPR indicated lower SMI in mC supported catalyst resulting in the generation of qualitatively Type-II like NiMoS phase on functionalized mC supports, which is considered to be very active for hydrotreating. The hydrotreating activity of the optimum catalyst was higher than that of commercial catalyst (supported on ã-Al 2 O 3). Long term deactivation experiment carried out over a total period of 10 weeks confirmed the durability of NiMo/mC catalyst for the duration of operation.
