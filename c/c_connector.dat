50|$|Most SR {{connectors}} are {{variants of}} SR-50 (50 Ω) or SR-75 (75 Ω) versions, with the SR-75 typically having a thinner center pin. They often resemble <b>C</b> <b>connectors</b> in shape, and have threaded inserts similar to N connectors. Further numerical suffixes denote specific kinds of connectors, for instance the CP 75-164 {{is a much}} larger high power connector, designed for upwards of 3000W, with a similar appearance to an N or UHF type.

50|$|SMC (SubMiniature version <b>C)</b> <b>{{connectors}}</b> are coaxial RF connectors {{developed in}} the 1960s. They use a #10-32 UNF threaded interface (screw type). They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 10 GHz. Female (a.k.a. plug) SMC connectors have a socket for the center contact, and male (a.k.a. jack) SMC connectors have a pin for the center contact. SMC jack connectors have an external thread while SMC plug connectors have the mating hex nut. Available in 50-Ohm and 75-Ohm characteristic impedance, they provide an interconnect means for small form factor coaxial cables (e.g. 50-Ohm RG-174, 75-Ohm RG-179) and printed circuit boards where small footprint is important.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the OnePlus X {{features}} a smooth glass back with textured aluminium bezels which provides a good grip on {{the frame of the}} phone. Both versions of the phone feature a dark glass back reminiscent of the glass back on the iPhone 4. The phone inherits the alert slider first found on the OnePlus 2 which toggles between All, Priority Only and No notifications. Due to the smaller form factor of the phone the internal battery was smaller compared to the OnePlus 2, coming in at 2,525 mAh compared to the latter's 3,300 mAh battery. The lower price of the phone also meant that the fingerprint sensor previously present on the OnePlus 2 has been omitted along with other features like optical image stabilization and swappable back covers. Oddly, the USB Type-C connector of the OnePlus 2 has not been carried over to the OnePlus X and the phone uses the micro USB instead of the newer USB-Type <b>C</b> <b>connector.</b> OnePlus has released textured back covers for the OnePlus X which resemble the styles of the swappable StyleSwap Covers for the OnePlus 2 with Bamboo, Rosewood, Black Apricot and Kevlar backs.|$|E
40|$|This {{evaluation}} board {{allows the}} ADM 1175 /ADM 1176 / ADM 1177 /ADM 1178 devices {{to be easily}} evaluated. These parts combine a hot swap controller and an on-board 12 -bit ADC-based digital power monitor that reports the power being drawn. The hot swap control circuitry allows the boards to be safely inserted and removed from a live 3. 15 V to 16. 5 V backplane. The parts provide precise, robust, current-limiting protection against transient and nontransient short circuits and undervoltage and overcurrent conditions. In addition to the standard hot swap functionality, the on-board power monitoring circuitry allows for precise monitoring of the power profile of each individual line card within a designated rack system. Communication to the power monitor is via an on-board I 2 C ® port. Order codes for evaluation kits are shown in the Ordering Guide. (Pinouts and detailed package drawings {{can be found in}} the individual product data sheets). GENERAL DESCRIPTION The ADM 1175 /ADM 1176 /ADM 1177 /ADM 1178 hot swap controller and digital power monitor evaluation board can be controlled by the configuration tool allowing the device to be actively stimulated through software. This board requires a bench power supply of between 3. 15 V and 16. 5 V, connected through J 3 and J 4. Download the latest version of the configuration tool from Analog Devices, Inc., at www. analog. com/powermonitorsw. Note that when changing devices the software should first be shutdown and the power supply to the board removed.

40|$|Nowadays it is {{commonly}} accepted that in the old and modern Indo-European languages the so-called left periphery of the sentence marks the interface between syntax and discourse/context features. The present paper deals with {{the analysis of the}} left sentence periphery in Gothic. For this purpose, the behaviour of the following linguistic elements will be analysed: (a) interrogative particles; (b) sentence introducers in relative clauses; (<b>c)</b> textual <b>connectors.</b> On the basis of the consideration - corroborated through interlinguistic comparison - that the discourse layer finds a specific formalization in the syntactic structure, the main aim of the present study is to investigate how and to what extent a different pragmatic function of the aforementioned elements correlates with a specific syntactic representation. The interference role of the Greek and Latin source texts will also be taken into consideration, mainly in order to ascertain whether the grammaticalization processes which those elements underwent were either induced or implemented by the models.
