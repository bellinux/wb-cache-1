5|$|From its {{formation}} in 1936, Coastal Command {{did not receive}} the support it required {{to be an effective}} naval air service. In September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland beginning the war in Europe. The Command's position was <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> {{the first nine months of}} the war, the period known as the Phoney War. German submarines were not able to reach the Atlantic unless they undertook a dangerous transit journey through the North Sea and around Britain's northern waters or through the English Channel, which was guarded by the Royal and French Navies. The powerful French Navy was responsible for covering half of the Atlantic shipping routes and thus contributed half of the Allied forces available.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{most popular}} car to date, the Commodore, was {{introduced}} in 1978 as the VB. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E body shell, but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from {{the adoption of a}} design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> three rear-seat passengers. With the abandonment of left-hand drive markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Milan {{were drawn}} against German team Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. The first leg at the San Siro {{ended in a}} 2–2 draw after Bayern had scored an {{equaliser}} three minutes into stoppage time. The second leg at Bayern's home ground the Allianz Arena was more <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> Milan, as they scored two first half goals to win the match 2–0 and win the tie 4–2 on aggregate. Milan were drawn against English team Manchester United in the semi-finals. The first leg at United's home ground Old Trafford, Kaka scored twice to give Milan a 2–1 lead after Cristiano Ronaldo had scored an early goal. However, two goals from Wayne Rooney {{in the second half}} meant United won the first leg 3–2. The second leg at the San Siro saw Milan win 3–0 to progress to the final after a 5–3 aggregate victory.|$|E

5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has {{provided}} the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> fans. Two critical opportunities {{to find a new}} home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|E
5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} deployed with 310 {{horses in}} 1873, both as mounts and as draught animals, but {{large numbers of}} these died on the march, and {{for much of the}} 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police's work. The importance of horses to the force's work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police's horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were worked very hard. A large riding school was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak {{towards the end of the}} century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of saddlery, mostly of the British Army's Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> both the rider and horse.|$|E

25|$|By 1830, the {{population}} of Hobart Town was over 20,000, with 18,108 men, and 6,171 women.

The whaling, sealing, wool and wattle oil industries were booming, as were agricultural crops such as wheat and apple growing.

25|$|Real-time MRI {{refers to}} the {{continuous}} monitoring ("filming") of moving objects in real time. While many different strategies have been developed since the early 2000s, a recent development reported a real-time MRI technique based on radial FLASH and iterative reconstruction that yields a temporal resolution of 20 to 30 milliseconds for images with an in-plane resolution of 1.5 to 2.0mm. The new method promises to add important information about diseases of the joints and the heart. In many cases MRI examinations may become easier and more <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> patients.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} few years the subject of {{invasive}} marketing has arisen with the advent of television screens on carriages. The first few weeks saw several hundred complaints as the volume level was turned up to maximum in order to help generate revenue from marketing. After several weeks of complaints the company eventually backed down and introduced two 'quiet cars' to the rolling stock offering a peaceful respite for passengers. Other complaints included window advertising which blocked the views outside and caused travel sickness in some passengers. Although windows continue to be obscured making viewing of the exterior difficult and travel less <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> passengers, the company has responded to complaints by reducing the size of the advertisements.|$|E
25|$|Most horses do {{not object}} to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process. To make it more <b>comfortable</b> <b>for</b> the horse, a groom should pull the mane out of the crest in an upwards direction, rather than {{sideways}} or down. An application of Orajel or clove oil on {{the roots of the}} mane can help desensitize the area during the pulling process. It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the pores are open. Using a mane pulling device such as the ManePuller may also be considered because it tends to be quicker and therefore less stressful for the horse (and groom).|$|E
