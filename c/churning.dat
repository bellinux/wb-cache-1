5|$|In the Ramayana, Tara is {{addressed}} by Vali as {{the daughter of}} the vanara physician Sushena. Sometimes, verses are added in the Bala Kanda, the first book of the Ramayana, which describe principal monkeys created by various deities: Vali and Sugriva are described as sons of the king of the gods, Indra and the sun-god Surya respectively; while Tara is described {{as the daughter of}} Brihaspati, the guru of the gods. The 12th century Tamil Ramavataram and the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayanam state that Tara and Ruma rose, along with other apsaras, from the ocean of milk during its <b>churning</b> by the gods and the demons, to acquire the elixir of life (amrita). In the Theyyam drama tradition of Kerala, the gods tire and request Vali to help in the <b>churning.</b> When Vali just starts <b>churning,</b> Tara rises from the ocean and thus is gifted to Vali.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of peers, namely <b>Churn,</b> is an inherent property of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems and {{is critical to}} their design and evaluation. Although every excellent P 2 P protocol has some solution to this issue, studies on <b>Churn</b> are still seldom. This paper studies various factors related to <b>Churn,</b> and uses them to analyze and evaluate P 2 P protocols. Prior researches on <b>Churn</b> are all based on the P 2 P network factors in <b>Churn</b> environment, and their difference is whether to use these factors as predecessor references to build <b>Churn</b> analytical models or as successor references to test the models. According to this difference, this paper first divides various factors into two categories: impacting <b>Churn</b> and affected by <b>Churn.</b> There is a causal relationship between these two categories. Factors impacting <b>Churn</b> are cause, and the factors affected by <b>Churn</b> are effect. In this paper, we use this causality to simulate and analyze P 2 P <b>Churn.</b> Cause is used as the input data and effect is used as the output result. Second, based on the classification of <b>Churn</b> factors, we present a performance evaluation framework and two comparing models. Based on the framework and models, we simulate and analyze three P 2 P protocols and get some useful results such as the performance of these protocols under <b>Churn,</b> the advantage of Chord over others, and the mos...|$|R

After Vali is presumed dead in a battle with a demon, his brother Sugriva becomes king and appropriates Tara; however, Vali returns and regains Tara and exiles his brother, accusing him of treachery.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata (Adi Parva book) {{records that}} Kamadhenu-Surabhi {{rose from the}} <b>churning</b> of the cosmic ocean (Samudra manthan) by the gods and demons to acquire Amrita (ambrosia, elixir of life). As such, she is {{regarded}} the offspring of the gods and demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi, the seven great seers. She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and ghee ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.|$|E

After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (<b>Churning</b> of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E

Using customer transaction and billing data, this study investigates determinants of customer <b>churn</b> in the Korean mobile telecommunications service market. Results indicate that call quality-related factors influence customer churn; however, customers participating in membership card programs are also more likely to <b>churn,</b> which raises questions about program effectiveness. Furthermore, heavy users also tend to <b>churn.</b> In order to analyze partial and total defection, this study defines changes in a customer's status from active use (using the service on a regular basis) to non-use (deciding not to use it temporarily without having <b>churned</b> yet) or suspended (being suspended by the service provider) as partial defection and from active use to <b>churn</b> as total defection. Thus, mediating effects of a customer's partial defection on the relationship between the <b>churn</b> determinants and total defection are analyzed and their implications are discussed. Results indicate that some <b>churn</b> determinants influence customer <b>churn,</b> either directly or indirectly through a customer's status change, or both; therefore, a customer's status change explains the relationship between <b>churn</b> determinants and the probability of <b>churn.</b> Customer <b>churn</b> Customer retention Mediation effect Mobile telephone service Business strategy Partial defection...|$|R
25|$|Companies {{usually make}} a {{distinction}} between voluntary <b>churn</b> and involuntary <b>churn.</b> Voluntary <b>churn</b> occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary <b>churn</b> occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for <b>churn</b> are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary <b>churn,</b> because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day. It churned nearly stationary {{for two days}} {{off the coast of}} Florida where significant coastal erosion resulted from the <b>churning</b> waves. On September 12, the storm began moving slowly toward North Carolina, at times nearly stalling and alternating between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E

By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the <b>churning</b> of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E

Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on the <b>Churning</b> of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{scalability}} {{limitations of}} BGP {{have been a}} major concern in the networking community lately. An important issue in this respect is the rate of routing updates (<b>churn)</b> that BGP routers must process. This paper presents an analysis of the evolution of <b>churn</b> in four networks in the backbone of the Internet over the last six years, using update traces from the Routeviews project. The <b>churn</b> rate varies widely over time and between networks, and cannot be understood through “blackbox” statistical analysis. Instead we take a different approach with a focus on investigating the underlying reasons for BGP <b>churn</b> evolution. Through our analysis we are able to identify and isolate the main reasons behind many of the anomalies in the <b>churn</b> time series. We find that duplicate announcements is a major <b>churn</b> contributor, and responsible for most large spikes in the <b>churn</b> time series. Other intense periods of <b>churn</b> are caused by misconfigurations or other special events in or close to the monitored AS, and hence limiting these is an important mean to limit <b>churn.</b> We then analyze the remaining “baseline ” <b>churn,</b> and find that it is increasing with a rate much slower than the increase in the routing table size.

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper are solely {{those of the authors}} and do not necessarily reflect the official positions or policies of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hires occur for two reasons- to grow a business and to replace those who have left. Hiring can be for expansion or it can be associated with <b>churn.</b> Analogously, separations reflect a decrease {{in the size of the}} business or the departure of a current employee who is replaced by a new employee. The importance of <b>churn,</b> growth hires, and employment-decreasing separations changes over the business cycle in a logical way. <b>Churn</b> is an important part of employment dynamics, allowing workers to move to their most efficient use. Although <b>churn</b> has no direct effect on employment growth since for every worker who separates another worker is hired into the business, understanding <b>churn</b> helps provide a clearer picture of what happens to the labor market when the economy slows and when it recovers. We present empirical evidence on <b>churn</b> from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) microdata. <b>Churn</b> is procyclical. <b>Churn</b> declines during recessions because separations, which during good times would have been associated with a replacement hire, are allowed to go unfilled during recessions. As a result, employment declines. <b>Churn</b> also declines during recessions because workers become reluctant to quit their jobs, and in response businesses reduce their hiring. Hiring declines during recessions. During the 2007 - 09 recession, four-fifths of hiring reductions are associated with reduced <b>churn,</b> not with reductions in job creation. Recession-induced decreases in <b>churn</b> are important because they are likely to reduce the efficiency with which the labor force operates. <b>Churn</b> moves workers from less productive uses to more productive ones. The efficiency cost of reduced <b>churn</b> can be substantial if the increased labor misallocation that occurs during recessions is permanent or long lasting. We estimate that the cost of reduced <b>churn</b> is about two-fifths of a percentage point of GDP annually throughout the three-and-one-half year period since the beginning of the recession...|$|R
