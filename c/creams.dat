5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid <b>creams,</b> vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with <b>creams</b> alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, cryosurgery may be beneficial. Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone <b>creams</b> may help.|$|E
50|$|Chocolate ice <b>cream</b> {{is used in}} the {{creation}} of other flavors, such as rocky road. Other flavors of ice <b>cream</b> contain chocolate chips mixed in with the ice <b>cream.</b> For example, (plain) chocolate chip ice <b>cream</b> is made with vanilla ice <b>cream,</b> chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip) ice <b>cream</b> is made with chocolate ice <b>cream,</b> and mint chocolate chip ice <b>cream</b> is made with mint ice <b>cream.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Strawberry ice <b>cream</b> is {{a flavor}} of ice <b>cream</b> made with {{strawberry}} or strawberry flavoring. It {{is made by}} blending in fresh strawberries or strawberry flavoring with the eggs, <b>cream,</b> vanilla and sugar used to make ice <b>cream.</b> [...] Most strawberry ice <b>cream</b> is colored pink or light red. Strawberry ice <b>cream</b> dates {{back at least to}} 1813, when it was served at the second inauguration of James Madison. [...] Along with vanilla and chocolate ice <b>cream,</b> strawberry is one of the three flavors in Neapolitan ice <b>cream.</b> Variations of strawberry ice <b>cream</b> include strawberry cheesecake ice <b>cream</b> and strawberry ripple ice <b>cream,</b> which is vanilla ice <b>cream</b> with a ribbon of strawberry jam or syrup. Some ice <b>cream</b> sandwiches are prepared neapolitan-style, and include strawberry ice <b>cream.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though {{traditional}} {{cookies and}} <b>cream</b> ice <b>cream</b> {{is made with}} vanilla or sweet <b>cream</b> ice <b>cream,</b> there are variations that use chocolate, coffee or mint ice <b>cream</b> instead.|$|R
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic <b>creams,</b> are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical <b>creams</b> have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Second World War, Crewe Hall {{was used}} as a {{military}} training camp, repatriation camp for Dunkirk troops and a US army camp, becoming the gun operations headquarters for the north-west region in 1942. It housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers from 1943. The hall was leased as offices in 1946, becoming the headquarters of Calmic Limited, who eventually employed nearly 800 people at Crewe Hall. Calmic produced hygiene and medical products on the site including tablets, <b>creams,</b> analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed industrial facilities adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995. Wellcome produced liquids, tablets, <b>creams</b> and antibiotic aerosols at the site; the hall itself was used for administration, but the stables block was rebuilt internally for use as laboratories and the industrial facilities were expanded.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be useful. In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical <b>creams,</b> the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E

50|$|Sour <b>cream,</b> or cultured <b>cream,</b> is {{manufactured}} {{through the}} processing of <b>cream,</b> {{and the addition of}} lactic acid bacteria. <b>Cream</b> is prepared from milk, in today’s industry by centrifugal separation. <b>Cream</b> is high in fat, the variety of <b>cream</b> that is used in sour <b>cream</b> production is coffee <b>cream</b> which is 18% milk fat. Once the <b>cream</b> is separated from the milk, the milk fat is distributed in the manner of an oil-in-water emulsion. Another example of an oil-in-water emulsion is mayonnaise.|$|R
50|$|<b>Creamed</b> food, in cooking, denotes {{food that}} is {{prepared}} by slow simmering or poaching in milk or <b>cream.</b> Some typical <b>creamed</b> dishes include <b>creamed</b> corn and <b>creamed</b> chipped beef on toast.|$|R
5|$|Owing {{to their}} ability to fix {{molecular}} nitrogen and therefore increase the soil fertility and stimulate plant growth, Azotobacter species are widely used in agriculture, particularly in nitrogen biofertilizers such as azotobacterin. They are also used in production of alginic acid, which is applied in medicine as an antacid, in the food industry as an additive to ice cream, puddings, and <b>creams.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such as ice <b>creams,</b> cakes and caramels.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by <b>creams,</b> 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5000|$|Ice <b>cream</b> parlors (or parlours) are {{restaurants}} that sell ice <b>cream,</b> gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt to consumers. Ice <b>cream</b> is typically sold as regular ice <b>cream</b> (also called hard-packed ice <b>cream),</b> gelato, and soft serve, {{which is usually}} dispensed by a machine with {{a limited number of}} flavors (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, and [...] "twist", a mix of the two). It is customary for ice <b>cream</b> parlors to offer a number of flavors and items. Parlors often serve ice <b>cream</b> and other frozen desserts in cones or in dishes, to be eaten with a spoon. Some ice <b>cream</b> parlours prepare ice <b>cream</b> desserts such as sundaes (ice <b>cream</b> topped with syrup, whipped <b>cream</b> and other toppings) or milkshakes.|$|R
50|$|Grape ice <b>cream</b> is ice <b>cream</b> with a grape flavor. Some recipes use {{grape juice}} in its preparation. Dishes and {{variations}} include grape ice <b>cream</b> sandwiches and grape ice <b>cream</b> soda. Grape ice <b>cream</b> is sometimes offered at grape festivals. For example, the Naples Grape Festival has offered grape ice <b>cream.</b> Grape ice <b>cream</b> {{is not a}} commonly made flavor.|$|R

Sandman's Cafe and Bar is a licensed bar where guests can purchase alcoholic drinks and food options including Eagle Boys pizza. It is located on the park's western border between the Cave of Waves and the splashdown of The Wedgie. Salty's Kiosk is located next to The BRO and sells slushies, ice <b>creams</b> and other snack foods.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, <b>creams,</b> and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by {{ultraviolet}} light (see sunscreen). It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid <b>creams</b> are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and <b>creams</b> against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing <b>creams</b> or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice <b>creams)</b> or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
25|$|Dairy {{products}} are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized fresh <b>cream</b> is called sweet <b>cream</b> butter. Production of sweet <b>cream</b> butter first became {{common in the}} 19th century, {{with the development of}} refrigeration and the mechanical <b>cream</b> separator. Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized <b>cream</b> is called raw <b>cream</b> butter.
