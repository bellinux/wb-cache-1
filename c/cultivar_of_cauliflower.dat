40|$|Four <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> {{broccoli}} Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck, two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> early <b>cauliflower</b> Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis L., four <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> late <b>cauliflower</b> Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis L. and one <b>cultivar</b> <b>of</b> {{red cabbage}} Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata L. were screened to determine some reproductive parameters of Aleyrodes proletella (Linnaeus, 1758) in a no-choice assay. The highest and lowest fecundity (eggs) and fertility (pupae and adults) were obtained with late cauliflower (cultivar Picasso) and red cabbage (cultivar Cabeza negra), respectively. As regards to adult emergence (from egg to adult), the higher percentages were obtained with broccoli (cultivar Chevalier) and late-cauliflower cultivars Mayfair and Picasso, {{and the lowest}} value was obtained with the late-cauliflower cultivar Arbon. In choice experiments, A. proletella preferred late-cauliflower cultivar Picasso and broccoli cultivars Agripa and Marathon to red-cabbage cultivar Cabeza negra. Significantly more adults per day, and more pupae and empty pupal cases per plant were found on broccoli and cauliflower cultivars than on red cabbage. At 22 ± 1. 5 °C, A. proletella required significantly more days for development on red cabbage than on broccoli and cauliflower cultivars. A. proletella developed significantly faster on early-cauliflower cultivar Matra. These results {{suggest that it is}} important to minimize the use <b>of</b> the broccoli <b>cultivars</b> Chevalier and  Agripa and the late-cauliflower cultivar Picasso in order to avoid the risk of further expansion of whitefly populations where these brassica crops and A. proletella are present.

40|$|The {{effect of}} organic versus {{conventional}} growing practise on yield, quality, pests and diseases of three vegetable crops were examined. <b>Cultivars</b> <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Botrytis), bulb onions (Allium cepa L.) and carrots (Daucus carota) were grown organically and conventionally {{during the years}} 2000 - 2003. Differences in cultivar yield, quality and resistance towards pests were determined. However, none <b>of</b> the <b>cultivars</b> were observed to be superior in the conventional compared to the organic growing system. Yields <b>of</b> conventional <b>cauliflower</b> and onions were higher than when grown organically, whereas no differences in carrot yields were observed between the two systems. A larger percentage of the harvested conventional onions were discarded, reducing the difference in net yield between the two systems. Generally, the reasons for discarding varied between the two systems. In organic cauliflower damage by slugs and loose curds were {{the main reasons for}} discarding. Loose curds can be explained by nitrogen deficiency while the damage by slugs is ascribed to the warm and humid environment created under insect nets used in the organic growing system. In both systems, the most severe reason for discarding of onions was exterior watery scales. Rot and mold were more pronounced in the conventional system whereas thick-necked onions were more frequent in the organic system due to larger distance between the onions. Conventional carrots were significantly more damaged by carrot flies than organic carrots even though the flies were present in the organic system and pesticides were applied in the conventional system. In contrast, more deform carrots were seen in the organic system. Generally, less organically crops were discarded due to pests, which presumably {{can be explained by the}} resistance of organic crops towards pests due to the increased diversity of microbial biomass and presence of insect natural enemies. On the contrary, the lower yields in organically grown vegetables can mainly be explained by morphological defects probably created by changes in growing system design in order to facilitate weed management. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{multifunctionality}} {{of living}} mulch systems was the underlying research question for field trials with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Botrytis) and leek (Allium porrum L.). Field trials were {{conducted at the}} Hessian Research Estate Frankenhausen over 3 years, parallel demonstration plots were established over 2 years on commercial pilot farms for entomological investigations in a big scale mode, plots of 1000 m². In all trials white clover (Trifolium repens L.) {{was used as a}} single species living mulch. In the years 2012 and 2013 the experimental design consisted of a 2 -factorial approach for the test <b>of</b> 3 <b>cultivars</b> and the effect of additive and substitutive system for the establisment <b>of</b> living. The <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> were Chambord F 1, Belot F 1, and White ball, of leek Herbstriesen Hannibal, Axima, and Catcher F 1. For the substitutive system of living mulch each third row was replaced by clover with the potential of common weeding in the areas covered by vegetables. The establishment of clover took place between 4 weeks after planting or later. In 2014 a one year trial was added for the investigation of different sowing dates of living mulch, 2 and 4 weeks after planting, towards the performance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> and leek, cultivated with one cultivar. The two year pilot farm activities were located at two organic field vegetable farms in Northrhine-Westfalia, each site in one year. Crop yields were mainly influenced {{by the fact that the}} Substitutive system had a plant density which was 2 / 3 of the figures in control and Additive system. Therefore all figures found were significantly lower. Opposite to these findings the data referred to single crops showed an advantage for the Substitutive system. With regard to the second system tested the addition of clover into the vegetable system did not cause reductions of yields in any case. This was obvious on the levels of nutrient yields of the crops. The samples of pit fall traps were measured over a time span between August and midth of September in 2013 and midth of August till end of September in 2014. The estimates were done on a family level. The main groups were found at each site, in each crop as dominant: Carabidae >> Staphilinidae > Arachnidae. The abundance was significantly different on the species level according to Kruskal Wallis evaluations, statistical distinctions on the system could not be found due to small diffenrences and partly inconsistent results...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{introduction}} strategy for living mulches (LMs) {{to reduce the}} potential nitrate leaching was investigated when grown with vegetables with high nitrogen (N) demand and low use efficiency in four European countries: Italy, Slovenia, Germany and Denmark over 2 yr. The plant N uptake and soil nitrate N content at harvest, in the autumn, and in the following spring were measured below open-pollinated and hybrid <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> and leek crops. The cultivars performed differently over the 2 yr. In Italy and Slovenia, when LM of burr medic or white clover was broad sown (addition design ADD) {{at the same time}} as crop transplanting, the N uptake of crops was hampered without increasing the total aboveground N accumulation. Delaying LM sowing by 2. 5 – 4 weeks maintained the N uptake of crops. In Germany, delaying white clover sowing for a month in cauliflower reduced soil nitrate at the start of leaching by 17 – 33 kg N ha− 1 in the ADD design and 25 kg N ha− 1 in the substitution design (SUB), where rows of cash crops were replaced by rows of LM. An overwintering LM of grass–clover incorporated in strips and root pruned decreased soil nitrate at the start of the leaching period by 35 kg N ha− 1 in cauliflower, and in leek, an LM of dyer's woad decreased the soil nitrate by 55 kg N ha− 1 at harvest and 30 kg N ha− 1 at the start of leaching. The effect of delayed LM sowing depended on the LM species and system design. Overall, the SUB and ADD designs showed potential to reduce nitrate leaching, whereas the ADD design had stronger competition against either cash crop or LM. The key to reduce soil nitrate N without jeopardizing crop yields may be to identify suitable growing periods, sometimes combined with root pruning, for each LM species and system design. The LM introduction strategy can be used to control competition and reduce the potential leaching, but the performance depends on the intensity of the interspecific competition and the local conditions...|$|R
40|$|Brassica, {{the only}} {{vegetable}} crop attributed {{with the potential}} to protect cancer and cardiovascular diseases were investigated in present study. The antioxidant activity, total phenol and L-ascorbic acid in 3 selected <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower,</b> cabbage and kohlrabi grown in Ås Norway (59 ° 40 ’N) were stored at 0 °C, 5 °C and ice for 6 - 7 weeks. Antioxidants were analyzed by FRAP Assay in Konelab, total phenols by Follin-Ciocalteu’s phenol Reagent (FCR) in Konelab and L-ascorbic acid by HPLC. Overall, the low temperature enhanced the postharvest quality of selected vegetables. There was a variation in the content of antioxidant from 0. 19 - 0. 78 mmol/ 100 g FW, 0. 22 - 1. 92 mmol/ 100 g FW and 0. 30 - 0. 45 mmol/ 100 g FW in cauliflower, cabbage and kohlrabi respectively where the exceptionally highest value was observed in ice stored red cabbage cv. Rovite (1. 92 mmol/ 100 g FW). The total phenol in the present study as a part of antioxidant was found to be varying from 39. 14 - 85. 39 mg GAE/ 100 g FW, 29. 12 - 166. 89 mg GAE/ 100 g FW and 26. 81 - 42. 27 mg GAE/ 100 g FW in cauliflower, cabbage and kohlrabi respectively. Here, the dramatically high total phenol among the studied Brassica was noticed in Rovite stored in ice storage condition. Among treatments, the antioxidant activity and total phenolics increased at both 0 °C and 5 °C storage conditions in cauliflower while they did not significantly increase in cabbage and kohlrabi. Unlike 0 °C and 5 °C, the storage treatment in ice exhibited mixed effects with significant increase in the amount of antioxidant activity and total phenol in cauliflower cultivars (Flamenco and Celio) and cabbage cultivars (Castello and Rovite) or no significant increase in cauliflower cv. Nemo, cabbage cv. Bartolo or even decrease in kohlrabi cultivars. In the same way, L-ascorbic acid was ranging from 51. 62 - 75. 18 mg L-asc/ 100 g FW, 32. 77 - 46. 27 mg L-asc/ 100 g FW and 25. 93 - 39. 02 mg L-asc/ 100 g FW respectively in cauliflower, cabbage and kohlrabi; with the highest value in cauliflower (Celio) at 0 °C. The analysis of L-ascorbic acid at different treatments in cauliflower cultivars illustrated that ice was the best storage condition though it decreased significantly in Celio. Meanwhile, L-ascorbic acid content decreased in cabbage and kohlrabi cultivars during storage except red cabbage (Rovite) where it increased significantly. Moreover, the variation in the content of dry matter in cauliflower, cabbage and kohlrabi ranged from 5. 54 - 8. 56 %, 5. 85 - 9. 61 % and 3. 93 - 5. 70 % respectively; with a highest value in Bartolo cabbage at harvest and depicted a declining trend over storage among all the crops under study. The two-way Anova analysis and Turkey’s LSD for the treatment means revealed that the low temperature treatment of 0 °C was the best storage condition for the selected Brassica vegetables as it reduces the ongoing metabolism to the minimum. The present study thus suggests that this low temperature treatment preferably 0 °C can be used to commercially store Brassica vegetables...|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} for cauliflower micro-propagule production {{was developed and}} optimised for both micropropagation and artificial seed production techniques using meristematic tissues from cauliflower curd. All steps in the protocol were empirically optimised including: blending, sieving, culture methods, liquid culture media composition and plant growth regulator combinations and concentrations. The cost of the micro-propagules could be reduced {{by as much as}} 50 % on the initial costings reported previously since treatments doubled the number of microshoots produced per culture unit. The research confirmed the suitability <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots to be encapsulated as artificial seeds and an effective {{protocol for}} microshoot encapsulation was designed through the optimization of 1) the production <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots suitable for encapsulation, 2) encapsulation procedures, 3) artificial seed artificial endosperm structure, 4) conversion materials. The possibility <b>of</b> culturing <b>cauliflower</b> artificial seeds in commercial substrates such as perlite, sand, vermiculite and compost was confirmed. The use of plant preservative mixture (PPM) for the control <b>of</b> contamination in <b>cauliflower</b> culture media and artificial seeds was optimised and the effect of this material on the development of plant material was assessed. It was confirmed that cauliflower artificial seed could be stored in a domestic refrigerator for up to 6 months which could have a great impact in cauliflower breeding programmes. The huge number <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots that could be produced using this protocol and the homogeneity of the culture system, provided a tool for the molecular analysis <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots (and artificial seed) abiotic stress tolerance analysis. Various treatments were conducted to improve microshoot cold tolerance and the up-regulation of the CBF/DREB 1 transcription factor including low temperature acclimation, mannitol, ABA (abscisic acid) and Mo (molybdenum). Microshoots were confirmed to acclimate successfully using low temperature. Mo was shown to improve the cold tolerance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots and to up-regulate CBF/DREB 1 in the absence of low temperature acclimation. Acclimation did not increase the accumulation of dehydrin proteins and it is concluded that dehydrins do not {{play a significant role in}} the cold tolerance <b>of</b> <b>cauliflower</b> microshoots. Since cauliflower breeding and seed multiplication protocols make extensive use of micropropagation, the studies reported in this research could make a significant impact by decreasing the cost of micropropagation and increasing its reliability. It also opens new perspectives for further research for cauliflower artificial seed production and the possibility of sowing these seeds directly in the field.
