These legal documents envisage the methods of determination of customs value: the primary ones, {{which are based on}} the transaction value, but also the secondary ones, which are based on other methods for determination of customs value of goods. The customs services of the EU Member States have on their disposal six methods for determination of customs value of goods. Those methods in the mentioned acts of the EU and Serbia are transposed from the Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. The fact that mentioned acts of the EU and Serbia request that the customs value of goods must be clearly and precisely determined, that means to be determined in the same way, is understandable because the customs base {{is one of the most}} significant elements of customs. There are many reasons for that: in a certain way, the customs base is in relation with all other elements of customs structure; from the procedure in which the customs base is determined, that means from its universality depends the amount of income which will the EU and Serbia, on that ground, collect to finance public expenditure predicted in the budget; and most of the customs on the imported goods in the EU is determined ad valorem...|$|E

Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic <b>Community.</b> The EU <b>Customs</b> Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation of the customs union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field of customs cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> occupies rules aimed at regulating the customs debt and guarantees. The provisions of the new <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> (Section 3 of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union.

Author also concludes that the application of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> of the European Union outside the context of the founding treaties of the European Union is impossible...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main aspects {{related to the}} modernisation process of the European Union customs legislation and identifies a series of benefits that arise from implementing the measures of the Modernised <b>Community</b> <b>customs</b> <b>code.</b> In this context, foreign trade companies must adapt their logistics strategies to the new customs system, a necessary condition {{in order to obtain}} competitive advantages. In an increasingly competitive global environment, best practices in the customs activity have a positive influence both on the international trade {{as well as on the}} consumer safety and protection. The results of implementing best practices are also found in rankings made by different institutions and international organisations regarding the competitiveness in logistics and ease in the development of foreign trade transactions. They mainly relate to reducing the time for the necessary clearance procedure and reducing the logistics costs by decreasing the number of physical and documentation checks, giving a priority treatment to consignments when they are selected for control, the possibility to choose the location for customs controls and less information to submit in summary declarations...|$|E

This thesis defines in detail customs tariff regulation from prospective of financial and custom law in both legal systems. It further represents the views of the main principles of customs regulation, defines customs tarrif, its basic elements and types, and also compares legislation in the Ukraine and in European Union. The legal sources in the field of customs tarrif regulation valid for both in the Ukraine and in European Union are also stated. The main part of the work is dealing with the <b>Community</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Code,</b> Code's implementing provisions (Commision Regulation No 2454 / 93), Common Customs tariff of the EU, which is the external tariff applied to products imported into the European Union, and Combined Nomenclature as the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the Customs Union. The Ukrainian Customs tariff Act and the Ukrainian Clasification of Comodities in foreign trade contain the comodity nomenclature of foreign trade. The last part of the thesis deals with value of goods and contry of origin of goods. I describe here the definition of value of goods and methods of its assessment in Ukraine and European Union.

40|$|In 2016, the European Union has {{launched}} a new and ambitious project for the future regulation of international trade in the European Union and the rules of its taxation: since the 1 May 2016, the new Union Customs Code (UCC) has entered into force. It revokes the old <b>Community</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> (CCC), which was applied since 1992, and passed {{in the form of}} EU regulation sets brand-new rules for the application of Common Customs Tariff and calculation of customs duties (tariffs) in all the EU Member States. It is oriented {{to the creation of the}} paperless environment for the formalisation of international trade operations (full electronic declaration of customs procedures) and ensuring of a more uniform administration of customs duties in the tax and customs authorities of the Member States in the European Union. Therefore, the article raises and seeks to answer the problematic question whether the Member States of the European Union themselves are ready to implement these ambitious goals and does the actual practice of the Member States support that (considering the practice of the Republic of Lithuania). The research, which is based on the analysis of case law in the Republic of Lithuania (case study of recent tax disputes between the taxpayers and customs authorities that arose immediately before and after the entry into force of the UCC), leads to the conclusion that many problematic areas that may negatively impact the functioning of the new Customs Code remain and must be improved, including an adoption of new legislative solutions...|$|E
40|$|As {{recalled}} by the EU WMD Strategy and the New Lines of Actions for combating proliferation, {{export control}} on dual use goods {{is an important}} barrier against proliferation, together with nuclear security and nuclear safeguards, {{to which it is}} linked through the Additional Protocol (INFCIRC 540). This requires export declarations for fifteen nuclear activities listed in Annex I, according to the list of controlled items foreseen in Annex II, derived from the NSG Trigger list. The export control legal framework in the European Union is set by Council Regulation 428 / 2009, which sets out the general framework for EU-wide controls on exports, brokering and transit, and introduces controls on intangible technology transfers as foreseen by UN Security Council Resolution 1540. Enforcement by customs is ruled by the <b>Community</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> and its recent security amendments, founded on the Commission Decision on establishment of common risk criteria and standards for security and safety risk analysis. This is applied since 1 January 2011, and introduces a strong legal mechanism for the equivalent application of customs controls and treatment of the legitimate trade (AEO) at the EU external borders. It is aimed towards identifying high-risk consignments / goods that could have serious implications on the security and safety of the EU and its citizens, and contains a set of common risk criteria to be applied in the Member States' automated risk analysis systems in order to continuously screen advance electronic cargo information for security and safety purposes. The present paper will provide an overview of the export control process in the EU, underlining the main issues and challenges. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear security (Ispra...|$|E
