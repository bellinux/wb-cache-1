The value of - 3 + 1 mm. represents the most favorable particle size for <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> in the sintering process. About 20 % of total coke fines (- 0. 5 mm) are produced during different steps of preparation.

40|$| fuel. A {{number of}} {{significant}} differences in the mode of occurrence of antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc were found between the two combustion plants studied. The element vanadium had almost identical modes of occurrence in fuel from both plants studied. A comparison of trace element mode of occurrence determined for the Collinsville power utility pulverised fuel by sequential leaching with mode of occurrence determined for the in-ground feed coals using graphical methods showed a reasonable level of agreement. It is concluded that the use of two methods of determining mode of occurrence provides better definition of mineral type in some cases. For example a siderite mode of occurrence could be determined using graphical relationship whereas the sequential leach data gave only a carbonate mode of occurrence. Further, the sequential leach data solved the problem of parallel graphical relationships. For example, galena was determined to be the mode of occurrence of lead from the sequential leach data, whereas graphical relationships indicated a pyrite mode of occurrence because of the relationship with sulphur. Combustion of coal occurs in three phases, namely devolatilisation, combustion of the volatile matter, and combustion of the residual char. Mineral matter may be excluded from the residual char particles due to desegregation and separation in the milling process, or included within the char particle. During combustion, trace elements partition between the bottom ash, the fly ash, and flue gas (lost up the stack). The concentration of trace elements in ash samples from the Collinsville and Mitsui power utilities was determined by INAA and XRF. The partitioning behaviour of the trace elements is examined by calculating relative enrichment values for the trace elements. Generally the partitioning behaviour and classification of trace elements in this study matched those found in previous published studies for a given element. The relative enrichment trends of elements exhibiting significant differences in mode of occurrence between the two combustion plants sampled (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to determine the control of mode of occurrence on the partitioning behaviour. It is hypothesised that the relative volatility of a particular element in combustion reflects the temperature at which the host mineral or the organic matter thermally decomposes. Thus organically bound elements should be more volatile than pyrite associated elements, which should be more volatile than carbonate associated elements, which should be substantially more volatile than silicate associated elements. Other factors that may influence partitioning behaviour such as the major element chemistry of the ash, plant design and operating conditions, and temperature variations within the combustion chamber were discounted as significantly influencing relative enrichment differences for the two combustion plants studied. It is concluded that element mode of occurrence has a strong influence on the relative volatility of a given element, and that comparison of sequential leach results from two pulverised fuel utilities has the potential allow prediction of the relative volatility of trace elements in combustion. Some complications may arise due to exclusion of some mineral grains and localised variations in the oxidation state within the combustion zone. Solid combustion wastes (fly ash and bottom ash) are commonly disposed of in landfill and impoundment facilities. Unless the landfill is impermeable to water, disposal of solid wastes in such fashion allows interaction with the hydrogeological system and could lead to detrimental environmental impacts. Leaching of indicative “total waste” composites made up by blending fly ash and bottom ash samples from each power utility in an 80 / 20 proportion was undertaken using the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in the leachates was compared to recreational water and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium, manganese, and selenium in the Collinsville leachate exceeds both the recreational and drinkwater guideline concentrations. The concentration of nickel in the Collinsville leachate was found to exceed the recommended drinkwater concentration, but is below recreational water guideline value. The concentration of boron and selenium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed both the recreational and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed the drinkwater standard. The concentration of an element in the ash sample was found to be a poor indicator of the mobility of the element. Elements that showed substantial differences in mode of occurrence in the pulverised fuel (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of the element from solid combustion waste. It is concluded that, where the difference in element mobility between the two composite ash samples is significant, mode of occurrence does exert some control on the proportion of a trace element in the ash that can be mobilised by the TCLP protocol. In particular, trace elements present in coal associated with silicates appear substantially unavailable for mobilisation by the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in samples of feed coal, <b>coke</b> and <b>breeze</b> from the Bowen coke works was determined by INAA and XRF. A new index (the CRE index) was developed to characterise the enrichment or depletion of trace elements in the <b>coke</b> and <b>breeze.</b> <b>Coke</b> is classified as enriched (Class 1), neither enriched nor depleted (Class 2), depleted (Class 3) or highly depleted (Class 4). Breeze was classified as enriched (denoted “e”), neither enriched nor depleted (denoted “a”) and depleted (denoted “d”). Comparison of the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in combustion and carbonisation was undertaken by comparing the RE and CRE data. It is concluded that all but the most volatile elements (sulphur, selenium, arsenic and tungsten) are substantially retained in the coke. The substantial retention of trace elements in coke is likely due to the lower temperature at which carbonisation occurs compar...|$|R

Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{constant}} energy prise rising necessitates further researches about material loading and fuel and chemical component distribution along pallets, {{as well as}} thermal processes in the layer of sintered bauxite charge. The analysis of {{current state of the}} sintering process modeling problem suggests the need for adequate thermal model of the bauxite agglomeration process for sintering process optimization tasks solving. This paper contains results of bauxite charge sintering process modeling on finite element thermal model developed by author. Simulation results achieved to eliminate inherent to this process, lack of heat in the upper horizons of the layer and its excess, due to the accumulation of recovered heat in the lower layers. Conducting researches revealed uneven character of transmitted power distribution, which is released per unit volume, both with weight and height of the cake, which has a substantial increase in areas near the edge and a gradual decrease from the upper to the lower horizons of the cake. It was investigated combustion time of solid fuel particles for the conditions of considered process. Also was performed the calculation of optimal distribution of <b>coke</b> <b>breeze,</b> both with height and width of sinter pallets, with the accumulation of heat overlying agglomerate horizons. This ensures the alignment of the maximum temperature of the combustion zone in horizons of layer. The simulation results led to the conclusion about the possibility of reducing the amount of fuel in the charge, subject to the required concentration of <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> in the horizon, which is possible in amplification of size fractions segregation of the feed material with height of pallets. Conclusions. In this paper was implemented the thermal model of bauxite agglomeration process, which was developed {{on the basis of the}} finite elements method. The research allowed to establish uneven distribution pattern of the transmitted power, which is released per unit volume, both with width and height of pallets. The presented simulation results indicate the possibility to stabilize the combustion zone temperature in the range of 1290 - 1380 ?C, which is intended to avoid undermelting of lower layers and undersintering of upper layers of the charge, and thus increase the valid production. Dependences, which were obtained in this paper, characterize an optimal distribution of <b>coke</b> <b>breeze.</b> As a result, the required amount of fine fractions (which are the main carrier of solid fuels) will be concentrated in the upper part of the layer. This will eliminate the lack of heat in these horizons. In turn, the reduction of fuel in the lower layers, due to the concentration of large fractions, eliminates the appermelting of agglomerate. Charge loading system, which has form of a drum feeder, does not provide the required distribution of solid fuel in height of layer. This creates the prerequisites for choosing the type and characteristics of boot device of sintering machine, in order to ensure as close as possible to the estimated distribution of fuel in prepared to sintering bauxite charge. ? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ???????????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ?? ????????????? ??????? ???????-?????????? ???????? ??????. ??????????? ????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??? ??????? ???????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ?????? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ??????, ??? ?? ??????, ??? ? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????, ? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????, ??? ????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????? ???? ??????? ?? ?????????? ?????. ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????, ?????????? ? ????????? ??????, ??? ?? ?????? ??? ? ?? ?????? ??????, ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????. ?????????? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ? ????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????, ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ???????...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature H- 1 NMR and rheometry {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on 4 : 1 wt/wt blends of a medium volatile bituminous coal with two anthracites, two petroleum cokes, charcoal, wood, a low-temperature <b>coke</b> <b>breeze,</b> tyre crumb, and active carbon {{to determine the effects}} on fluidity development to identify the parameters responsible for these effects during pyrolysis and to study possible relationships among the parameters derived from these techniques. Positive, negative, and neutral effects were identified on the concentration of fluid material. Small positive effects (ca. 5 - 6 %) were caused by blending the coal with petroleum cokes. Charcoal, wood, and active carbon all exerted negative effects on concentration (18 - 27 % reduction) and mobility (12 - 25 % reduction in T- 2) of the fluid phase, which have been associated with the inert character and high surface areas of these additives that adsorb the fluid phase of the coal. One of the anthracites and the low-temperature <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> caused deleterious effects to a lesser extent on the concentration (7 - 12 %) and mobility (13 - 17 %) of the fluid material, possibly due to the high concentration of metals in these additives (ca. 11 % ash). Despite the high fluid character of tyre crumb at the temperature of maximum fluidity of the coal (73 %), the mobility of the fluid phase of the blend was lower than expected. The comparison of H- 1 NMR and rheometry results indicated that to account for the variations in minimum complex viscosity (eta(*)) for all the blends, both the maximum concentration of fluid phase and the maximum mobility of the fluid material (T- 2 L) had to be considered. For individual blends, two exponential relationships have been found between the complex viscosity and the concentration of solid phase in both the softening and resolidification stages but the parameters are different for each blend...|$|E
40|$|Producers of iron sinter need precise phase {{analysis}} for effective operation supervision. It {{is not enough}} to consider only chemical composition, but it is beneficial to know the iron sinter mineralogical composition. Producers can utilize this information for better sinter mechanical properties adjustment and sinter yield improvement. When iron ore fines under 6 mm are mixed with limestone flux, recycled materials and <b>coke</b> <b>breeze,</b> and are heated to about 1250 °C the iron sinter is obtained. Produced iron sinter is in partial melting of mixture porous, but physically strong enough heterogeneous material, in which the iron bearing minerals are bonded together by range of different phases, where complex ferrite phases are very well known as SFCA (Silico-Ferrite of Calcium and Aluminum).

40|$|During {{the iron}} ore {{sintering}} process, iron ore fines (< 6 mm) {{are mixed with}} limestone flux and <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> and heated to ~ 1300 &# 0186;C. This results in partial melting of the mixture, and converts the loose raw materials into a porous but physically strong composite material in which the iron bearing minerals are bonded together by a range of complex ferrite-like phases known collectively by the acronym 'SFCA' (Silico-Ferrite of Calcium and Aluminium). These 'SFCA' phases can be divided {{on the basis of}} composition and morphology into two main types: one is a low-Fe form that is simply referred to as SFCA, and the second is a high-Fe, low-Si form called SFCA- 1. SFCA and SFCA- 1 are believed to be the most desirable bonding phases in iron ore sinter because of their high reducibility, high mechanical strength and low reduction degradation, all of which are significant factors in determining the efficiency of the blast furnace...|$|E
40|$|In modern ironmaking, {{granulation}} is {{the first}} step of the sintering process. It is typically carried out in continuous drum granulators using water as a binder, and involves multiple components besides iron ores, such as return fines and other recycled materials (dusts, mill scale, sludges), solid fuel (<b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> or anthracite) and fluxes (limestone, lime, olivine, dunite or dolomite) (Ball, 1973). As it is necessary to maintain a consistent quality of the granules (size distribution, porosity, strength, etc.) despite of the varying iron ore origins, the question arises as to how the properties of the iron ore particles (size and shape) influence the granulation process. The granulation process is partly influenced by the characteristic of the feed and partly by the action of cohesive force inside the drum granulator (Newitt et al. 1958). The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of raw material properties on the kinetics of iron ore granulation considering in particular the mechanisms ruling wet granulation for two iron ores and to know the factors which determine the texture, shape, porosity and mechanical strength of the granules...|$|E

Besides above, foaming practice is also able to increase furnace yield because by carbon injection into slag of electric arc furnace, (FeO) content in slag descends and thus improves the quality of melting steel. The experiments of foaming slag were carried out in PT. Krakatau Steel - Slab Steel Plant 130 tonne electric arc furnace using the experimental melting procedures involving alternate DRI charging plan, <b>coke</b> <b>breeze</b> injection control, lime or dolomite addition control and slag height control.
