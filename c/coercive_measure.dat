40|$|The use of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> namely restraint, {{seclusion}} and involuntary medication, remain controversial {{methods of}} practice within forensic psychiatry. Ethical and moral debates surrounding {{the use of}} <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> are compounded {{by the need to}} balance care, safety, and security. Despite such tensions, limited research has been conducted in this area. This paper examines the prevalence of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> and factors associated with their use specifically within forensic psychiatry. A systematic review was conducted and fifteen empirical studies were identified, each examining the use of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> in forensic inpatient psychiatry, reported in papers published between January 1980 and January 2012. Findings suggest that patients who are younger or newly admitted tend to be secluded most often. Findings relating to gender, ethnicity and patient diagnoses, however, are equivocal. Patients tend to perceive experiences of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> negatively. Staff perceptions however, appear to be determined by their role in governing or practicing coercive interventions. Findings are discussed in light of variations in hospital settings, policies and sociocultural traditions. While the uses of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> appear to be influenced by a combination of all patient, staff, and environmental factors, further research is required to explore each of these aspects in greater detail...|$|R

Use of forced medication was associated with patients being significantly less likely to justify their admission when interviewed after three months. All <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> were associated with patients staying longer in hospital. When the influence of other variables was considered in a multi-variate analysis, seclusion remained as a significant predictor of longer inpatient stay, adding about 25 days to the average admission. Of the three <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> forced medication appears to be unique in its significant impact on patient disapproval of treatment. While all <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> are associated with patients staying longer in hospital, only use of seclusion is associated with longer inpatient stays independently of coerced patients' having higher symptom scores at the time of admission...|$|R

Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards.

40|$|Purpose In many European countries, {{initiatives}} have emerged {{to reduce the}} use of seclusion and restraint in psychiatric institutions. To {{study the effects of}} these initiatives at a national and international level, consensus on definitions of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> assessment methods and calculation procedures of these <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> are required. The aim {{of this article is to}} identify problems in defining and recording <b>coercive</b> <b>measures.</b> The study contributes to the development of consistent comparable measurements definitions and provides recommendations for meaningful data-analyses illustrating the relevance of the proposed framework. Methods Relevant literature was reviewed to identify various definitions and calculation modalities used to <b>measure</b> <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> in psychiatric inpatient care. Figures on the <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> and epidemiological ratios were calculated in a standardized way. To illustrate how research in clinical practice on <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> can be conducted, data from a large multicenter study on seclusion patterns in the Netherlands were used. Results Twelve Dutch mental health institutes serving a population of 6. 57 million inhabitants provided their comprehensive coercion measure data sets. In total 37 hospitals and 227 wards containing 6812 beds were included in the study. Overall seclusion and restraint data in a sample of 31, 594 admissions in 20, 934 patients were analyzed. Considerable variation in ward and patient characteristics was identified in this study. The chance to be exposed to seclusion per capita inhabitants of the institute's catchment areas varied between 0. 31 and 1. 6 per 100. 000. Between mental health institutions, the duration in seclusion hours per 1000 inpatient hours varied from less than 1 up to 18 h. The number of seclusion incidents per 1000 admissions varied between 79 up to 745. The mean duration of seclusion incidents of nearly 184 h may be seen as high in an international perspective. Conclusion <b>Coercive</b> <b>measures</b> can be reliably assessed in a standardized and comparable way under the condition of using clear joint definitions. Methodological consensus between researchers and mental health professionals on these definitions is necessary to allow comparisons of seclusion and restraint rates.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of basic patient characteristics at admission, history within 24 hours be-fore admission, and living conditions on the risk of experiencing <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> controlling for ward characteristics in a multi-level approach. Methods: Patient characteristics of 3389 patients (1920 women) who had received inpatient treatment in 2007, data relat-ing to <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> and ward characteristics were extracted from the clinical basic documentation. Results: Patients with aggressive behaviour in the 24 hours prior to admission had a three times higher risk of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> compared to non-aggressive patients. Severity of illness increased the risk of coercion markedly. With each level of severity, the risk of coercion was doubled. Voluntariness of stay appeared to be the best protective factor against <b>coercive</b> <b>measures.</b> If a patient stayed voluntarily, this reduced the risk of coercion by more than two thirds. No impact was found for living conditions.

The {{question}} of the balance between the protection and the coercive measures of the property rights still remains relevant to the Courts or prosecutors each time dealing with the issues of applying a temporary limitation of the property rights. Lithuanian law establishes several ways of affecting property rights: {{it could be a}} <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> under the Criminal Procedure Code or a penal sanction under the Criminal Code. The temporary limitation of the property rights as a <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> is related to the human right of the inviolability of property. Therefore, any restriction of the property rights should be imposed as an ultima ratio measure, without which it would not be possible to achieve the required goals in the criminal procedure. It should be noted that even if justifying the use of the <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> to achieve the required goals, the right of the inviolability of property is violated if such measure is applied too long or when imposition of such measure is disproportionate. It is worth mentioning that the <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> - temporary limitation of the property rights could be applied even during the pre-trial investigation when there is no Court’s decision about the person’s guilt. For such reason the imposition of such <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> should be strictly measured. Because of fast advancement of technology and digital products in today’s world, the circle of the objects of the ownership becomes wider, broadening the meaning of the property. Accordingly, the coercive measures, directed to the restriction of the property rights, should adapt to the changing environment. According to the Lithuanian and international case law and legal doctrine, this article analyses problems when applying a temporary limitation of the property rights. Although the applicable terms of such <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> are set in the Criminal Procedure Code, the number of extensions in the cases involving serious or very serious crimes shall not be subject to any limits. When the case is forwarded to the Court, the Court, disposing of the case, decides concerning the imposition of the temporary limitation of the property rights or its application, and the number of extensions is also unlimited. In practice, property rights of the individuals are limited to a relatively long period of time, which results in the loss {{of the value of the}} property. Such loss, after the Court enters the decision, affects both the person whose property rights were restricted and the person, for which the benefit of the property rights was restricted. After the evaluation of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides the possibility to impose a temporary limitation of the property rights in order to secure a civil claim, even when such civil claim is not submitted (and could not be submitted until the evaluation of the evidence in the Court proceedings) in order to avoid unnecessary use of the <b>coercive</b> <b>measure,</b> it is proposed to amend the Code, setting a term within which the victim should make a decision whether to bring civil claim or not. The term should not stop the victim to bring such civil claim later in the process. Accordingly, in order to protect the value of the property from the depreciation, when the temporary limitation of the property rights is imposed in the proceedings, it is advisable to allow to dispose such property before the Court enters final judgment. The prosecutor or the Court by the initiative of the prosecutor in regard to the circumstances of the case could enter a decision to dispose such property if there is no complaint from the owner of such property. After this, the limitations could be imposed to the funds obtained from the sale of such property...|$|E

Isolation (41. 35 %) was the most frequent <b>coercive</b> <b>measure,</b> followed by mechanical restraint (33. 17 %) and forced medication (25. 48 %). The type of center has some influence; specifically in RP there is less risk of isolation and restraint than in SPH. Not having had any previous imprisonment reduces isolation and restraint risk while {{increases the risk of}} forced medication, as well as previous admissions to psychiatric inpatient units does. Finally, the fact of having lived with a partner before imprisonment reduces the risk of forced medication and communication with the family decreases the risk of isolation. Patients subjected to a <b>coercive</b> <b>measure</b> exhibited a pronounced psychopathology and most of them had been subjected to such measures on previous occasions. The mere fact of external assessment of compliance with human rights slows down the incidence of coercive measures.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use and}} implications of using <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> within a high security hospital. High security hospitals are unique environments where challenges are often faced in balancing care with safety and security. The use of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures,</b> namely, restraint, seclusion, rapid tranquillisation and segregation, are considered unavoidable necessities in preventing and/or limiting harm. Yet <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> are deemed ethically, morally and professionally controversial. This study explores patient, staff and environmental factors that influence variations in attitudes and experiences towards the use of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> using a sequential mixed methods design. Stage one {{examines the}} rates, frequencies and demographic characteristics of patients experiencing <b>coercive</b> <b>measures..</b> Stage two uses standardised questionnaires to elicit and analyse staff and patient attitudes towards aggression (ATAS), containment measures (ACMQ) and hospital environment (EssenCES). Stage three uses a constructivist grounded theory approach to conducting semi-structured interviews with staff using institutional and emotional work theories. Findings revealed that younger, newly admitted females were those most likely to experience coercion. Aggression was viewed as being significantly more destructive on the pre-discharge ward, {{in comparison with the}} admission, ICU and treatment ward. Discrepancies were found between staff and patient perceptions of the least acceptable containment measures. Patients experienced the hospital environment as more supportive and cohesive than staff. Finally, findings from the staff interviews uncovered a complex interplay between personal and institutional expectations, values and actions. Further research is required into examining i) the attitudes and implications regarding the least restrictive methods, ii) the internal dynamics within high secure hospitals warrant and what it means for staff to be working in an environment where patients feel more supported by being contained than staff do when containing them, and iii) {{what can be done to}} relieve the tensions of healthcare professionals expected to care, coerce and contain...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The use of <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> in {{psychiatry}} {{is still}} poorly understood. Most empirical {{research has been}} limited to compulsory admission and to risk factors on an individual patient level. This study addresses three <b>coercive</b> <b>measures</b> {{and the role of}} predictive factors at both patient and institutional levels. METHODS: Using the central psychiatric register that covers all psychiatric hospitals in Canton Zurich (1. 3 million people), Switzerland, we traced all inpatients in 2007 aged 18 - 70 (n = 9698). We used GEE models to analyse variation in rates between psychiatric hospitals. RESULTS: Overall, we found quotas of 24. 8...|$|R
