40|$|We {{present a}} new sensor for power {{monitoring}} that measures current flow in {{a circuit breaker}} without permanent modification of the breaker panel or the circuit breaker itself. The sensor consists of three parts: an inductive pickup for sensing current from the breaker face, an inductive link designed to transmit power through the steel breaker panel door, and a passive, balanced JFET modulator circuit for transmitting information through the inductive link. The demodulated breaker current signal is available outside of the breaker panel door.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} the {{evaluation}} of a frame-work MagnoTricorder, a system that utilizes the magnetic sensor in smartphones to detect the running devices at home thru a single-point sensing. MagnoTricorder leverages the effect of Electro Mag-netic Interference (EMI) generated by the AC current in the main power-line at home. This EMI induces a magnetic field that highly fluctuates {{the reading of the}} magnetic sensor in smartphones. In this paper, we utilize this characteristic for detecting and identi-fying the running devices at home thru the <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker</b> <b>Panel.</b> Experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the devel-oped framework. Results show that MangoTricorder can detect and identify individual devices with 93 %- 98 % accuracy. 1...|$|E

50|$|In July 2017, {{asbestos}} {{was found}} in the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panels,</b> which is inside the driver compartment, of the C and K sets. This caused all C and K sets to be taken out of service for inspection. As a result, S sets were used to replace C/K sets on services that were scheduled as C/K. As of 21 July 2017, some C/K sets are returning to service, but many are still being replaced by S sets.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} grids, a {{power system}} network integrates transmission grids, distribution grids, distributed generators and loads that have connection points called busses.

Traditionally, these grid connections are unidirectional point to multipoint links. In distributed generation grids, these connections are bidirectional, and the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability concerns.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{an accident}} {{in which two}} maintenance workers suffered severe burns while replacing a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> in a steel mill, following model of analysis and prevention of accidents (MAPA) developed {{with the objective of}} enlarging the perimeter of interventions and contributing to deconstruction of blame attribution practices. The study was based on materials produced by a health service team in an in-depth analysis of the accident. The analysis shows that decisions related to system modernization were taken without considering their implications in maintenance scheduling and creating conflicts of priorities and of interests between production and safety; and also reveals that the lack of a systemic perspective in safety management was its principal failure. To explain the accident as merely non-fulfillment of idealized formal safety rules feeds practices of blame attribution supported by alibi norms and inhibits possible prevention. In contrast, accident analyses undertaken in worker health surveillance services show potential to reveal origins of these events incubated {{in the history of the}} system ignored in practices guided by the traditional paradigm...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new sensor for power monitoring that measures current flow in {{a circuit breaker}} without permanent modification of the breaker panel or the circuit breaker itself. At the breaker panel, an inductive pickup and low-power amplifier sense current from the breaker face. Two coupled resonators form an inductive link {{that serves as a}} communication channel through the steel breaker panel door. A passive, balanced JFET mixer circuit transmits the sensed current signal through the inductive link by impedance modulation. Outside of the breaker panel door, sense circuitry detects the impedance modulation, and a digitally implemented compensator inverts the non-uniform frequency response of the analog sensor circuitry to reconstruct the original current signal. This sensor provides a solution for low-cost, non-intrusive retrofit of any <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> for centralized power monitoring. by Daniel Robert Vickery. Thesis (M. Eng.)

50|$|For {{reasons of}} {{aesthetics}} and security, domestic <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> and consumer units are normally located in out-of-the-way closets, attics, garages, or basements, {{but sometimes they}} are also featured {{as part of the}} aesthetic elements of a building (as an art installation, for example) or where they can be easily accessible. However, current U.S. building codes prohibit installation of a panel in a bathroom (or similar room), in closets intended for clothing, or where there is insufficient space for an electrician {{to gain access to the}} panel. Specific situations, such as an installation outdoors, in a hazardous environment, or in other out-of-the-ordinary locations might require specialized equipment and more stringent installation practices.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft are {{susceptible}} to encounters with volcanic ash particles during flight. The volcanic ash particles which are ingested can easily contaminate the fuselage of the aircraft. The contamination will necessitate the cleaning of the cockpit electronics and <b>panels,</b> <b>panels,</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> and passenger and baggage compartments. The electrical and aircraft avionics systems can be so heavily be covered with volcanic ash particles {{to the point where}} a complete replacement is required, due to overheating or diminished accuracy of the equipment. The ash can be drawn into cargo-hold and affect the fire-warning system and can cause spurious alarms. The ash itself is hazardous to the engines by melting and solidifying as a glassy material on the turbine blades, affects the small tolerances which make the turbine efficient. The glassy material which is formed on the blades also has the possibility of shattering and throwing hard debris through the engine which can cause damage.|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> or fuse <b>panels.</b> Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> or fuse <b>panel</b> could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R
25|$|Low-voltage <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{are also}} made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current {{requires}} special breakers because the arc is continuous—unlike an AC arc, {{which tends to}} go out on each half cycle. A direct current <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> has blow-out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{generator}} interlock kit {{is installed}} on the front cover of the home's <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b> It consists of two sliding steel or plastic (depending on the brand) plates held together by three bolts. When moved down, the plate blocks the generator backfeed <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> and allows the main breaker to remain on; when moved up, the generator backfeed <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> may be turned on, but the main <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is blocked and will remain off. The generator backfeed <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is connected to a generator inlet installed (preferably) {{on the outside of}} the structure. A short cord connects the generator to the house inlet, usually through the use of twistlock plugs and sockets.|$|R
40|$|The global {{electric}} power infrastructure {{is undergoing a}} dramatic transformation from a centralized, demand-following network to one that is more dynamic and consumer-interactive. This process requires {{a very large number}} of advanced sensors be deployed throughout the entire system. This manuscript documents the development of two enabling technologies for the realization of such large-scale monitoring networks. The first technology pertains to the idea of harvesting ambient energy to power wireless sensor nodes on overhead power lines such that these wireless sensors can be operated continuously without interruptions. A new type of piezoelectromagnetic (PEM) energy harvester is developed. The harvester is comprised of a bimorph piezoelectric cantilever with permanent magnets mounted on its tip. When placed near to an AC current source, the magnets couple to the AC magnetic field and excite the piezoelectric cantilever, which in turn generates a large electrical voltage output. The energy converted by the harvester is then rectified, stored and conditioned by a power conditioning circuit. The power is delivered to a wireless sensor platform at a regulated DC voltage. In this design, an enhanced magnetic coupling method is proposed and verified. A new closed-form lumped parameter model for the bimorph piezoelectric cantilever is devel- oped. The harvester is able to generate a raw power output of 500 &# 956;W when the device is placed 1 cm from the center of a 0. 75 inch conductor that carries a current of 20 A. At that level of power output, the device is able to allow a low-power wireless sensor node to collect and transmit measurement data to a remote device once every 10 seconds. The second research topic documented in this thesis is about non-intrusive electricity metering using remote energy sensing techniques. A stick-on energy metering system that can be easily installed on the surface of <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> is developed. The system uses magnetic and electric sensor to measure the electromagnetic field produced by the energized conductor in each individual circuit. A signal processing algorithm is invented to accurately reconstruct the current and voltage waveforms from the measurement data. The installation of such stick-on devices does not require the use of electricians. Therefore, the overall cost of deployment is estimated to be one-tenth that of the state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R
40|$|Improved signal {{conditioning}} electronics and new experimental {{results are presented}} for a sensor that measures current flow in a <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> A PIC microcontroller optimizes the phase reference for the synchronous detection system on startup {{eliminating the need for}} I/Q demodulation. Ultimately, the parts count of the {{signal conditioning}} electronics is halved compared to the previous work. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the sensor's response to 60 Hz signals with higher harmonic content and to step transients in 60 Hz signal amplitudes. The proposed current sensor does not require permanent modification of the <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> or the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> itself.

50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, <b>breaker</b> <b>panel,</b> or electric panel) is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective fuse or <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> for each <b>circuit</b> in a common enclosure.

These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability. This means less panel space and wire are needed, and why commercial buildings frequently utilize higher voltage for general task lighting.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are {{manufactured}} in standard sizes, using {{a system of}} preferred numbers to cover a range of ratings.

40|$|In this paper, the {{contribution}} of SF 6 losses {{to the impact of}} high-voltage SF 6 <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> on global warming is evaluated.
