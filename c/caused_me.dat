5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had <b>caused</b> <b>me.</b> I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
500|$|Almendra is {{considered}} a paradigm of the growing influence of the youth-led counterculture of the 1960s on Argentina at that time, {{as well as a}} representative of that generation. After Spinetta's death, President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said: [...] "That record of the teardrop, when we would call albums long plays, and [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", I will never forget them." [...] Charly García, also on the occasion of Spinetta's death, stated: [...] "I can not describe the shock that Almendra's first album <b>caused</b> <b>me.</b> For me, [...] "La balsa" [...] was the originator of Argentine rock, but without a doubt, Luis Alberto and company were its architects." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "It mystifies me why MI6 gave the list credibility. If they were really worried about the safety of their agents they could have denied it." [...] After The Sun {{newspaper}} called Tomlinson a [...] "traitor" [...] and published his email address, he received death threats, and fearing for his life, went into hiding for a time. Government officials later conceded that the list did not originate from Tomlinson.|$|E

500|$|During the investigation, {{the police}} found {{a note in}} Cho's room in which he criticized [...] "rich kids", [...] "" [...] and [...] "deceitful charlatans". In the note, Cho {{continued}} by saying that [...] "you <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> to do this." [...] Early media reports also speculated that he was obsessed with fellow student Emily Hilscher and became enraged after she rejected his romantic overtures. Law enforcement investigators could not find evidence that Hilscher knew Cho. Cho {{and one of his}} victims, Ross Alameddine, attended the same English class during autumn 2006. Also in one video, he mentions [...] "martyrs like Eric and Dylan", referring to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me.

5000|$|Unlike George Wallace, who repented of his segregationist past, Johnson, who {{sometimes}} refused {{to shake hands}} with black voters, was once endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, and campaigned against [...] "mongrelization", never apologized. In 1996, he said: [...] "I have to admit that I have not grown to the point where I am not uncomfortable when I see a mixed couple. It <b>causes</b> <b>me</b> discomfort.

500|$|Cele Goldsmith's {{tenure as}} editor {{began with the}} {{opportunity}} to showcase two very well-established writers: E.E. Smith and Isaac Asimov. Smith's The Galaxy Primes began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, [...] "Marooned off Vesta", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of Amazing, and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. Cordwainer Smith's [...] "Golden the Ship Was—Oh! Oh! Oh!" [...] appeared in April; and {{by the middle of the}} following year she had managed to attract stories from Robert Sheckley, Alan E. Nourse, Fritz Leiber, Gordon R. Dickson, Robert Bloch, and James Blish. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert Heinlein back as a subscriber; Heinlein read a copy of the June 1961 issue, which, he said, [...] "... <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> to think I had been missing something." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the eleven}} years {{up to and}} {{including}} Traviata, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to Aida), he wrote only six new works for the stage. [...] Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a [...] "total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm not doing anything. I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> by I vespri siciliani. Cursed operas!" [...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you like that is exaggerated. [...] He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E
500|$|Dougan {{was sold}} on to Blackburn Rovers {{for a fee}} of £15,000 in March 1959. He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1–1 draw away to Arsenal at Highbury. He scored twice on {{the opening day of}} the 1959–60 season, a 4–0 victory over Fulham, which began a {{sequence}} of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, {{at the end of which}} the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6–2 victory over West Ham United. Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the 1960 FA Cup Final at Wembley after Dougan scored the winning goal past Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-finals. However, he did not enjoy his time at Ewood Park, and later wrote that [...] "the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that <b>caused</b> <b>me</b> to wake each day regretting that I had to go to the ground. Life was grey and monotonous". This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his [...] "vanity triumphed over common sense". He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. He opened the 1960–61 season with a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Manchester United and went on to withdraw his transfer request.|$|E
