40|$|International audienceA sensitive, {{accurate}} and precise method for the simultaneous determination of nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), T- 2 toxin (T- 2) and HT- 2 toxin (HT- 2) in different food matrices, including wheat, maize, barley, cereal-based infant foods, snacks, biscuits and wafers has been developed. The method, using liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS), allowed unambiguous {{identification of the}} selected trichothecenes at low µg/kg levels in such complex food matrices. A clean up procedure, based on reversed phase SPE Oasis® HLB columns was used, allowing good recoveries for all studied trichothecenes. In particular, NIV recoveries resulted significantly improved as compared with those obtained by using Mycosep® # 227 columns for the clean up of the extracts. Limits of detection in the various investigated matrices, ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 µg/kg for NIV, from 2. 8 to 5. 3 µg/kg for DON, from 0. 4 to 1. 7 µg/kg for HT- 2, from 0. 4 to 1. 0 µg/kg for T- 2. Mean recovery values, obtained from <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> spiked with NIV, DON, HT- 2 and T- 2 toxins at levels from 10 to 1000 µg/kg, ranged from 72 % to 110 % with mean relative standard deviation lower than 10 %.

40|$|Background: Dietary {{patterns}} that promote mild metabolic acidosis {{may have a}} negative effect on bone density. Objective: We investigated the relation between a measure of dietary acid-base load, potential renal acid load (PRAL), and calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) after adjustment for confounders and also compared the results with different estimates of acid-base load. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 14 563 men and women aged 42 - 82 y living in Norfolk, United Kingdom, in which measures of calcaneal BUA and dietary PRAL were estimated by using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk) food-frequency questionnaire. Results: A more acidic dietary intake (high PRAL) was significantly associated with lower calcaneal BUA in women but not in men; there was a difference of 2 % in BUA between the highest and lowest quintiles of PRAL, independent of age, body mass index, smoking habit, physical activity, diagnosed osteoporosis, and history of fracture, and (in women) hormone replacement therapy. No relation was observed between history of fracture or incident fracture and PRAL. Those with the greatest PRAL had higher intakes of meat, fish, eggs, <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> <b>and</b> lower intakes of fruit and vegetables, tea, and coffee. Conclusion: PRAL was inversely associated with bone ultrasound measures in women, but the magnitude of the association was relatively small compared with other known risk factors.

40|$|International audienceDeoxynivalenol in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> is {{controlled}} in the European Community by recent legislation {{with the objective}} of minimizing consumer exposure to this mycotoxin. Relatively few studies have examined the losses of fusarium mycotoxins during processing and whether this is accurately reflected by the processing factors that have been used. The behaviour of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol and zearalenone during extrusion of naturally contaminated wholemeal wheat flour has been examined using pilot scale equipment. Factors examined were temperature and moisture content. Concentrations of the three mycotoxins were little changed by extrusion although the amount of deoxynivalenol decreased at the lowest moisture content. However, this effect {{did not appear to be}} temperature dependent and it is suggested that the apparent loss is either due to binding or inability to extract the residue.

40|$|While {{the concept}} of regular {{equivalence}} is equally applicable to dichotomous as well as valued networks, the identification of regular blocks in regular blockmodels is somewhat problematic when dealing with valued networks. Applying the standard procedure for identifying ties in such blockmodels, a procedure perhaps most suited for dichotomous networks, does tend to generate block images and reduced graphs that differ from intuitive notions of such structures. This paper outlines a formal heuristic procedure for identifying regular ties in valued networks where the “significance” of ties is related to each actor's role sets. Combined with measures for block criteria fulfillment, the procedure yields reduced graphs, which seem more sensitive to patterns, rather than strengths, of ties.

Design A multi-site cross-sectional assessment of food and nutrient composition of food sales. Point-of-sale data were linked to Australian Food and Nutrient Data and compared across study sites and with nutrient requirements. Setting Remote Aboriginal Australia. Subject Six stores. Results Point-of-sale data were readily available and provided a low-cost, efficient and objective assessment of food and nutrient sales. Similar patterns in macronutrient distribution, food expenditure and key food sources of nutrients were observed across stores. In all stores, beverages, <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> <b>and</b> meat and meat products comprised approximately half of food sales (range 49 – 57 %). Fruit and vegetable sales comprised 10 · 4 (sd 1 · 9) % on average. Carbohydrate contributed 54 · 4 (sd 3 · 0) % to energy; protein 13 · 5 (sd 1 · 1) %; total sugars 28 · 9 (sd 4 · 3) %; and the contribution of total saturated fat to energy ranged from 11 · 0 to 14 · 4 % across stores. Mg, Ca, K and fibre were limiting nutrients, and Na was {{four to five times}} higher than the midpoint of the average intake range. Relatively few foods were major sources of nutrients. Conclusions Point-of-sale data enabled an assessment of dietary quality within stores and across stores with no burden on communities and at no cost, other than time required for analysis and reporting. Similar food spending patterns and nutrient profiles were observed across the six stores.

40|$|Background: Processed {{foods are}} major {{contributors}} to population dietary salt intake. Parts of the Australian food industry {{have started to}} decrease salt {{in a number of}} products. A definitive baseline assessment of current sodium concentrations in foods is key to targeting reformulation strategies and monitoring progress. Objectives: Our objectives were to systematically collate data on the sodium content of Australian processed food products and com-pare sodium values against maximum target levels established by the UK Food Standards Agency (UK FSA). Design: Categories of processed foods that contribute the majority of salt to Australian diets were identified. Food-composition data were sought for all products in these categories, and the sodium content in mg/ 100 g (or mg/ 100 mL for liquids) was recorded for each. Mean sodium values were calculated for each grouping and compared with the UK FSA benchmarks. Results: Sodium data were collected for 7221 products in 10 food groups, 33 food categories, and 90 food subcategories. The food groups that were highest in sodium were sauces and spreads (1283 mg/ 100 g) and processed meats (846 mg/ 100 g). <b>Cereal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> (206 mg/ 100 g) and fruit and vegetables (211 mg/ 100 g) were the lowest in sodium. Sixty-three percent of food categories had mean sodium concentrations above the UK FSA targets, and most had wide ranges between the most and least salty product. Conclusions: Many products, particularly breads, processed meats, and sauces, have salt amounts above reasonable benchmarks. The variation in salt concentrations between comparable products sug-gests that reformulation is highly feasible for many foods. Am J Clin Nutr doi: 10. 3945 /ajcn. 2009. 28688...|$|R
40|$|The term &lsquo;vitamin E&rsquo; {{refers to}} a group of eight vitamers (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopherols and tocotrienols). Its primary role is thought to be as an {{antioxidant}} commonly added to a variety of foods, e. g. bakery products. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) procedures are used for the separation and analysis of these tocopherols and tocotrienols in foods. The use of a normal phase column is the preferred approach in such methods, with hexane almost universally utilised as the mobile phase. However there is increasing concern regarding the toxicity of hexane. Here we evaluate the use of heptane as a replacement for hexane in HPLC based vitamin E analysis. The two solvents were compared using samples of bread fortiﬁed with palm oil (as a source of vitamin E). Accelerated solvent extraction procedure followed by HPLC showed the eﬀective separation of the E vitamers in a variety of bread samples using both solvents.

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract represents the first barrier against food contaminants {{as well as}} the first target for these toxicants. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that commonly contaminates cereals and causes various toxicological effects. Through consumption of contaminated <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> human and pigs are exposed to this mycotoxin. Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches, we investigated the effects of DON on the intestinal epithelium. We demonstrated that, in intestinal epithelial cell lines from porcine (IPEC- 1) or human (Caco- 2) origin, DON decreases trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) and increases in a time and dose-dependent manner the paracellular permeability to 4 kDa dextran and to pathogenic Escherichia Coli across intestinal cell monolayers. In pig explants treated with DON, we also observed an increased permeability of intestinal tissue. These alterations of barrier function were associated with a specific reduction in the expression of claudins, which was also seen in vivo in the jejunum of piglets exposed to DON-contaminated feed. In conclusion, DON alters claudin expression and decreases the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. Considering that high levels of DON may be present in food or feed, consumption of DON-contaminated food/feed may induce intestinal damage and has consequences for human and animal health...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypertension is {{the leading}} cause for heart disease and stroke, for {{mortality}} and morbidity worldwide, and a high sodium-to-potassium intake ratio is considered a stronger risk factor for hypertension than sodium alone. Objective: This study aims to evaluate sodium and potassium urinary excretion, and assess the food sources of these nutrients in a sample of Portuguese adolescents. Design: A cross-sectional study with a sample of 250 Portuguese adolescents. Sodium and potassium excretion were measured by one 24 -h urinary collection, and the coefficient of creatinine was used to validate completeness of urine collections. Dietary sources of sodium and potassium were assessed using a 24 -h dietary recall. Results: Valid urine collections were provided by 200 adolescents (118 girls) with a median age of 14. 0 in both sexes (p 0. 295). Regarding sodium, the mean urinary excretion was 3, 725 mg/day in boys and 3, 062 mg/day in girls (pB 0. 01), and 9. 8 % of boys and 22 % of girls met the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for sodium intake.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to present {{the extent to which}} the organisation of marketing channels in cereal circulation has an impact on the competitiveness of Serbia's agri-sector. The paper is based on the application of a range of modern quantitative and qualitative analysis methods. According to the appropriate scientific methods, this research paper clearly identifies the scope of the existing marketing channels in the <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> sector. The performance and development level of Serbia's agriculture are measured by calculating the marketability of cereal circulation using the example of maize, more specifically the average rate of change, the coefficient of variation of the given phenomenon around the calculated average value for a particular activity of a marketing channel. The main research limitation is the small probability that data on all climate factors in the observed period will match the climate data in a different period, as a result of which the research would yield a lower-precision short-term forecast of the development of maize production. This paper contributes to addressing critical problems in the organisation of the supply chain of Serbian cereals in the domestic and international markets, which can provide the prerequisites for increasing the competitiveness of Serbia's agrisystem.

The main aim was to determine the association between folate and vitamin B 12 intake from total diets and food groups, and status. Folate or vitamin B 12 intakes (2 × 24 h multiple pass recalls) and red blood cell (RBC) folate or plasma vitamin B 12 (chemiluminescence immunoassays) concentrations were available at baseline for 731 participants aged 85 from the Newcastle 85 + Study (North-East England). Generalized additive and binary logistic models estimated the associations between folate and vitamin B 12 intakes from total diets and food groups, and RBC folate and plasma B 12. Folate intake from total diets and cereal and cereal products was strongly associated with RBC folate (p < 0. 001). Total vitamin B 12 intake was weakly associated with plasma vitamin B 12 (p = 0. 054) but those with higher intakes from total diets or meat and meat products were less likely to have deficient status.

This study aimed to determine {{factors associated with}} achieving an adequate dietary iodine intake in the Australian population post-fortification, and to assess whether bread consumption patterns affect iodine intake in high-risk groups. Using nationally representative data of repeated 24 -h dietary recalls from the 2011 – 2012 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey, dietary iodine intakes and food group contributions were compared by age, socioeconomic status (SES), and geographical remoteness (N = 7735). The association between fortified bread intake and adequacy of iodine intake (meeting age and sex-specific Estimated Average Requirements) was investigated using logistic regression models in {{women of childbearing age}} 14 – 50 years (n = 3496) and children aged 2 – 18 years (n = 1772). The effect of SES on bread consumption was further investigated in a sub group of children aged 5 – 9 years (n = 488). Main sources of iodine intake {{at the time of the}} survey were <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> followed by milk products and dishes. Differences in iodine intake and dietary iodine habits according to age, SES and location were found (p < 0. 001) for women of child-bearing age. Fortified bread consumption at ≥ 100 g/day was associated with five times greater odds of achieving an adequate iodine intake (OR 5. 0, 95 % CI 4. 96 – 5. 13; p < 0. 001) compared to lower bread consumption in women and 12 times in children (OR 12. 34, 95 % CI 1. 71 – 89. 26; p < 0. 001). Disparities in dietary iodine intake exist within sectors of the Australian population, even after mandatory fortification of a staple food. On-going monitoring and surveillance of iodine status is required...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{based upon}} the {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) {{have been developed for}} distinguishing <b>cereal</b> species <b>and</b> cultivars. DNA isolated from the leaves of germinating seedlings or grain gave similar results. Primers designed to amplify the spacers between 5 S ribosomal RNA genes were able to identify samples of maize, barley, sorghum, rye, rice, oat and wheat without any significant variation within these species. Arbitrary 10 -mers allowed distinction between cultivars of the same species, although some variation was found within cultivars, and some primers gave products characteristic of the cereal species. These methods have potential for application in the analysis of the species <b>and</b> cultivars composition of <b>cereal</b> grain lots <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cereal {{foods are}} a {{fundamental}} {{part of a}} balanced diet and several studies have assigned to wholemeal <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> a protective role in human health, due to their content of bioactive compounds. Within the phytochemicals, lignans are of increasing interest for their potential anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. The aim of this work is {{to contribute to the}} updating of food lignan databases by providing the profile and the amount of lignans in <b>cereals,</b> buckwheat <b>and</b> several <b>cereal</b> based foods commonly consumed in human diets. Values were taken from published papers. Items were divided in different groups, namely grains, brans <b>and</b> flours, bread, <b>cereal</b> staple foods, breakfast <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> other <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> <b>and</b> values for secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol are given. For example, the total average values for the mentioned lignans in grains ranged between 23 μg/ 100 g and 401 μg/ 100 g dry weight. The contribution of each single lignan molecule to the total value of lignans appears to be different for every <b>cereal</b> species. Lignan content <b>and</b> typology in processed foods depends on the raw materials used, their degree of refinement and on processing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Si {{may play}} an {{important}} role in bone formation and connective tissue metabolism. Although biological interest in this element has recently increased, limited literature exists on the Si content of foods. To further our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between dietary Si and human health, a reliable food composition database, relevant for the UK population, is required. A total of 207 foods and beverages, commonly consumed in the UK, were analysed for Si content. Composite samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion with nitric acid and H 2 O 2. The highest concentrations of Si were found in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> especially less refined cereals and oat-based products. Fruit and vegetables were highly variable sources of Si with substantial amounts present in Kenyan beans, French beans, runner beans, spinach, dried fruit, bananas and red lentils, but undetectable amounts in tomatoes, oranges and onions. Of the beverages, beer, a macerated whole-grain cereal product, contained the greatest level of Si, whilst drinking water was a variable source with some mineral waters relatively high in Si. The present study provides a provisional database for the Si content of UK foods, which will allow the estimation of dietary intakes of Si in the UK population and investigation into the role of dietary Si in human health. <br /...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExtrusion {{technology}} is used widely to manufacture {{a range of}} breakfast cereals and snacks for human consumption and animal feeds. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON) in <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products</b> and fumonisins B 1 and B 2 (FB 1 and FB 2) in maize are controlled in the European Community by legislation {{with the objective of}} minimising consumer exposure to these mycotoxins. Relatively few studies have examined the losses of fusarium mycotoxins during processing. The behaviour of FB 1, FB 2 and fumonisin B 3 (FB 3), DON and ZON during extrusion of naturally contaminated maize flour and maize grits has been examined here using pilot scale equipment. Studies of these ingredients show that DON and ZON are mostly stable during extrusion cooking and that the fumonisins are lost to varying degrees. There does however appear to be some loss of ZON when present in low concentration and extruded at higher moistures. The presence of additives such as reducing sugars and sodium chloride can also affect mycotoxin levels. Moisture content of the cereal feed during extrusion is an important factor and has a greater effect than temperature, particularly on the loss of fumonisins at the lower moistures. The effects appear complex and not always easy to explain. However, {{on the basis of these}} studies, the relationship between the concentration of fusarium toxins in the raw product and the finished product vary depending on the toxin present and the process undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to moulds {{and their}} (toxic) {{metabolites}} (mycotoxins) is {{a menace to}} human and animal health. A risk analysis can {{shed light on the}} actual risk of adverse health effects. In a previously published RIVM report (nr. 257852 002) on hazard identification the genera, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Alternaria were designated as the most important genera with respect to contamination of <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>products.</b> This report, forming part of a hazard characterisation, gives an overview of adverse health effects in humans and animals caused by mycotoxins of the previously mentioned genera. Referring to the most recent literature studies, it is obvious that Fusarium toxins, and especially fumonisins and trichothecenes, are being studied extensively at the moment, making their contribution relatively large. Most of the disorders occurring in animals that can be conclusively attributed to mycotoxins have been studied more-or-less extensively in experimental animals. Only a few disorders in humans can be attributed to mycotoxins, although proof is not conclusive. Much research is needed to further investigate the role of mycotoxins in human health. Bioassays can be helpful tools for researching health effects caused by mycotoxins, especially where human disorders are concerned. A (non-exhaustive) overview of bioassays in use in mycotoxin research is also given. Most bioassays, however, are meant for a general toxicity rating and are not suitable for investigating specific health effects. Therefore more specific assays will need to be designed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> based <b>products</b> are an {{important}} source of energy, fi bers and a range of macro- and micronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, minerals etc. Most of the evidences for health benefi ts of cereal foods are related to the fi ber rich wholegrain foods and its role in reducing risk of degenerative chronic diseases, so-called Western diseases (constipation, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, diverticulosis, obesity, and colon cancer).

40|$|The <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>cereal</b> based <b>products</b> {{represents}} {{an essential part}} of the daily diet. Nowadays most of the <b>cereal</b> based <b>products</b> are refined having a lower content of dietary fibres complex, vitamins and minerals. Recent researches showed a remarkable influence of the processing way of <b>cereals</b> on bioavailability <b>and</b> variability of the bioactive components due to the fact that these substances are concentrated in the outer layers of the grains. Phytase is an enzyme that breaks down the undigestable phytic acid (phytate) which is found in higher quantities in the grains. Appling a hydrothermic treatment one can create optimal conditions for phytase activation. This enzyme, once it is activated, hydrolyses the phytate (myo-Inositol- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - hexaphosphate) to myo-inositol, phosphorus and small quantities of myo-inositol tri- and penta-phosphate. It also produces an increase of the bioavailability of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Zn 2 + and Fe 2 + ions. The parameters which should be monitored during the hydrothermic treatment are: the ratio between <b>cereals</b> weight <b>and</b> soaking solution, the pH of the soaking solution, the soaking period, the maintaining period after removing the soaking solution, the temperature of the soaking and maintaining period and the method used to dry the cereals...|$|R
40|$|Some {{foods and}} feeds are often {{contaminated}} by numerous mycotoxins, but most {{studies have focused}} on the occurrence and toxicology of a single mycotoxin. Regulations throughout the world do not consider the combined effects of mycotoxins. However, several surveys have reported the natural co-occurrence of mycotoxins {{from all over the world}}. Most of the published data has concerned the major mycotoxins aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), fumonisins (FUM) and trichothecenes (TCTs), especially deoxynivalenol (DON). Concerning <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> derived <b>cereal</b> <b>product</b> samples, among the 127 mycotoxin combinations described in the literature, AFs+FUM, DON+ZEA, AFs+OTA, and FUM+ZEA are the most observed. However, only a few studies specified the number of co-occurring mycotoxins with the percentage of the co-contaminated samples, as well as the main combinations found. Studies of mycotoxin combination toxicity showed antagonist, additive or synergic effects depending on the tested species, cell model or mixture, and were not necessarily time- or dose-dependent. This review summarizes the findings on mycotoxins and their co-occurrence in various foods and feeds from all over the world as well as in vitro experimental data on their combined toxicity...|$|R
