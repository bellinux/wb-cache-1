50|$|Originally {{intended}} {{to be held in}} Mexico City, the 1968 Summer Paralympics were moved to Tel Aviv due to political unrest and financial issues plaguing the Mexican organising committee. Although there was disappointment expressed at not being able to have to Paralympics in the 'Olympic' city of that year, the Tel Aviv organising committee worked tirelessly to provide a first class experience for the athletes and their support staff, even financing 50% of the Australian team's travel expenses. The Australian team however had to be content with dubious living conditions {{for the duration of the}} competition, being housed in an underground carpark with most of the athletes sleeping on military style <b>camp</b> <b>mattresses.</b> Despite the poor accommodation the athletes performed well, with world records falling and numerous Australian competitors taking home a swag of gold medals (see 'Medalists' table below). In an attempt to depoliticise the games following Israel's Six Day War there was to be no official medal tally in Tel Aviv, however the Australian's haul of 38 medals earned them fourth spot on the 'unofficial' placings.|$|R

5000|$|Many tent {{manufacturers}} indicate capacity by such phrases as [...] "3 berth" [...] or [...] "2 person". These numbers {{indicate how}} many people the manufacturer thinks can use the tent, though these numbers do not always allow for any personal belongings, such as luggage, inflatable <b>mattresses,</b> <b>camp</b> beds, cots, etc., nor do they always allow {{for people who are}} of above average height. Checking the quoted sizes of sleeping areas reveals that several manufacturers consider that a width of 150 cm is enough for three people — snug is the operative word. Experience indicates that camping may be more comfortable if the actual number of occupants is one or even two less than the manufacturer's suggestion, though different manufacturers have different standards for space requirement and there is no accepted standard.|$|R
