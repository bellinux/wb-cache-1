Though typically known for <b>compact</b> <b>cultivation</b> of plants having smaller stature, {{it has been}} used for growing large plants, using buckets ranging in size from 1 gallon to 5 gallons, making use of high-volume pumps such as those in large aquariums, decorative fountains and koi ponds.|$|E

50|$|Mussaenda erythrophylla, {{commonly}} known as Ashanti blood, red flag bush and tropical dogwood, is an evergreen West African shrub. The bracts of the shrub may have different shades, including red, rose, white, pale pink or some mixtures. Mussaenda erythrophylla grows best in warmly temperate or subtropical areas and is semideciduous in cooler parts. In its natural habitat the shrub may scramble up to 10 m, but is kept <b>compact</b> under <b>cultivation.</b> The star-like flowers of the shrub are 10 mm in diameter and have a single, modified sepal.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of different long-term agricultural practices on the mineralogical, physical and micromorphological composition of soils along the Austrian-Hungarian border, where Austrian and Hungarian agricultural soils (3 transects with different soil type and cultivation system) were compared with former uncultivated Iron Curtain refe-rence soils. The mineralogical results indicated that under undisturbed conditions in the reference zone a higher weathering of illite and formation of smectite occurred. The <b>compacting</b> effects of <b>cultivation</b> were reflected in higher bulk density, decrease of total porosity and soil aggregate stability. Pore size distribution showed a stronger decrease of coarse pores, especially in Hungary, where heavy machines were used, but without affecting hydraulic conductivity. Higher biological activity in topsoils of the untillaged areas was observed in all transects, leading to a more crumby structure, whereas in the tillaged soils a subangular, cracky microstructure had developed...|$|R
