40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} various factors on {{delamination}} {{has been studied}} using uni-directional glass fibre and carbon fibre-epoxy specimens with cut <b>central</b> <b>plies.</b> It is con-cluded that the fracture energy is not a material constant. Among the various factors which affect the fracture energy, the specimen thickness and the through thickness normal stress {{are the two most}} significant ones. A simple model is proposed to take account of these two factors. The new model gives excellent correlation with experimental results and is able to account for the effect of through thickness compressive stresses in mode II fracture, which is ignored in conventional fracture mechanics calculations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Detection and {{characterisation}} {{of damage}} in composite structures during in-service loading is highly desirable. Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring of composite components offers a highly sensitive method for detecting matrix cracking and delamination damage mechanisms in composites. AE {{relies on the}} detection of stress waves that are released during damage propagation and using an array of sensors, damage location may be determined. A methodology for damage characterisation based on measuring the amplitude ratio (MAR) of the two primary lamb wave modes; symmetric (in-plane) and asymmetric (out-of-plane) that propagate in plate like structures has been developed. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} series of tensile tests in composite coupons with large <b>central</b> <b>ply</b> blocks. The specimens were monitored using AE sensors throughout loading and once significant AE signals were observed the loading process was stopped. The specimens were removed and subjected to x-ray inspec tion to assess for any damage. The onset of damage was successfully detected using AE and was identified as being matrix cracking using the MAR methodology. The results were validated with x-ray inspection and a strong correlation was observed between the number of significant AE signals recorded and the number of identified matrix cracks...|$|E

Y., were treated to a remarkable mirage, between ten and eleven o'clock, {{on the morning of}} August 16, 1894. It was the city of Toronto with its harbor and small island to the south of the city. Toronto is fifty-six miles from Buffalo, but the church spires could be counted with the greatest ease. The mirage took in the whole breadth of lake Ontario, Charlotte, the suburbs of Rochester, being recognized as a projection east of Toronto. A side-wheel steamer could be seen traveling in a line from Charlotte to Toronto Bay. Two dark objects were at last found to be the steamers of the New York <b>Central</b> <b>plying</b> between Lewiston and Toronto. A sail-boat was also visible and disappeared suddenly. Slowly the mirage began to fade away, to the disappointment of thousands who crowded the roofs of houses and office buildings. A bank of clouds was the cause of the disappearance of the mirage. A close examination of the map showed the mirage did not cause the slightest distortion, the gradual rise of the city from the water being rendered perfectly. It is estimated that at least 20,000 spectators saw the novel spectacle. This mirage is what is known as that of the third order that is, the object looms up far above the level and not inverted, as with mirages of the first and second orders, but appearing like a perfect landscape far away in the sky. — Scientific American, August 25, 1894.

40|$|AbstractTwo novel {{approaches}} are proposed for elimination of stress concentrations in tensile and compressive testing of unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites. An interlayer hybrid specimen type is proposed for tensile testing. The presented finite element {{study indicated that}} the outer continuous glass/epoxy plies suppress the stress concentrations at the grips and protect the <b>central</b> carbon/epoxy <b>plies</b> from premature failure, {{eliminating the need for}} end-tabs. The test results confirmed the benefits of the hybrid specimens by generating consistent gauge-section failures in tension. The developed hybrid four point bending specimen type and strain evaluation method were verified and applied successfully to determine the compressive failure strain of three different grade carbon/epoxy composite prepregs. Stable failure and fragmentation of the high and ultra-high modulus unidirectional carbon/epoxy plies were reported. The high strength carbon/epoxy plies exhibited catastrophic failure at a significantly higher compressive strain than normally observed...|$|R
40|$|Various {{configurations}} of Edge Delamination Tension (EDT) test specimens, of both brittle (T 300 / 5208) and toughened-matrix (T 300 /BP 907) graphite reinforced composite laminates, were manufactured and tested. The mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness, G sub C, {{was measured using}} (30 / 30 sub 2 / 30 / 90 sub N) sub s, n= 1 or 2, (35 /- 35 / 0 / 90) sub s and (35 / 0 /- 35 / 90) sub s layups designed to delaminate at low tensile strains. Laminates were made without inserts so that delaminations would form naturally between the <b>central</b> 90 deg <b>plies</b> and the adjacent angle plies. Laminates were also made with Teflon inserts implanted between the 90 deg plies and the adjacent angle (theta) plies at the straight edge to obtain a planar fracture surface. In addition, interlaminar tension fracture toughness, GIc, was measured from laminates with the same layup but with inserts in the midplane, between the <b>central</b> 90 deg <b>plies,</b> at the straight edge. All of the EDT configurations were useful for ranking the delamination resistance of composites with different matrix resins. Furthermore, the variety of layups and configurations available yield interlaminar fracture toughness measurements needed to generate delamination failure criteria.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of fibre-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) {{under conditions}} of thermal shock was investigated in this study. A series of water-quench tests were carried out on samples of cross-ply and plain- weave (PW) woven Nicalon/CAS (calcium aluminosilicate) composites. Damage modes due to thermal shock were characterised by examining polished surfaces of the quenched materials using optical and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the effect of thermal shock on the mechanical properties of the woven composite was assessed under tensile and flexural loading. Predictions of the critical temperature change (DeltaTc) for the onset of thermal shock fracture in both unidirectional (UD) and 2 -D CMCs (cross-ply and woven) were made. In terms of the critical temperature change, the thermal shock resistance of surfaces with (0 °/ 90 °) 3 s, (90 °/ 0 °) 3 s and woven configurations {{was found to be}} comparable (DeltaTc> 400 +/- 50 °C) with that of UD Nicalon/CAS of similar thickness - the effect of ply architecture was minor. By contrast, surfaces with configurations of much smaller thickness (i. e. (0 °/ 90 °) s, (90 °/ 0 °) s) exhibited significantly higher thermal shock resistance (by > 100 °C) and much smaller crack densities with increasing severity of shock. Damage, unless temperature-induced microstructural changes occurred, was in the form of matrix cracking that left the fibres unaffected, and originated in the <b>central</b> <b>plies</b> of each CMC. Although on application of more severe shocks cracking extended to the outer plies, crack density always exhibited a gradient across the material thickness and was higher towards the central region. All phenomena could be understood in terms of the interaction of temperature gradients of adjacent material surfaces. The orientation and the extent of matrix cracking depended on the type of ply (i. e. longitudinal, transverse or, in the woven CMC, matrix-rich layer-'ply'). Longitudinal and matrix plies contained matrix cracks perpendicular to the horizontal (length) direction and exhibited 'composite' behaviour by virtue of a surface stress transfer mechanism - on application of more severe shocks, cracks increased in number but remained surface features. Matrix cracks in transverse plies ran parallel to the horizontal, and, although always small in number, increased significantly in length and depth at higher temperature differentials. Thus, transverse plies exhibited behaviour similar to monolithic ceramics and particulate CMCs. Thermal shock caused a small and gradual reduction in the mechanical properties of PW woven Nicalon/CAS. the onset of which occurred at higher temperature differentials than the onset of thermal shock damage. It was shown that the reduction in properties was associated with the propagation under load of the shock- induced matrix cracks in transverse plies. Thus, transverse plies were determined to be the weaker elements of the 2 -D materials as they contained cracks that extended significantly in length and depth and affected mechanical properties. The extent of such cracks, as well as of other types of thermal shock damage, was found to be smaller for the woven CMC, perhaps due to the undulating nature of its microstructure. The onset of thermal shock fracture in UD and 2 -D Nicalon/CAS CMCs was analysed by considering the anisotropic nature of the applied stress field as well as the presence of residual thermal stresses. A strength- based criterion, combined with a model for the effect of the biaxial nature of shock-induced stresses on the effective value of the interfacial shear stress, enabled satisfactory predictions to be made of the thermal shock resistance of the surface of UD Nicalon/CAS that contained longitudinal fibres, {{as well as of the}} <b>central</b> longitudinal <b>plies</b> of faces with (90 °/ 0 °) 3 s,(90 °/ 0 °) s and woven configurations. The heat transfer conditions during fracture were also determined. A fracture mechanics-based criterion combined with a modified analytical result from the literature was used to treat the situation of the transverse (end) face of UD Nicalon/CAS, as well as for the <b>central</b> transverse <b>plies</b> of faces with(0 °/ 90 °) 3 s,(0 °/ 90 °) sand woven configurations. The success of this approach depended on accurate knowledge of two material parameters, i. e. the relevant fracture toughness and the critical dimension beyond which thermal shock resistance becomes independent of material dimensions. Based on sufficient knowledge of the critical dimension, a method was also devised that allowed the effect of material dimensions to be incorporated into predictions of the thermal shock resistance...|$|R

To examine the stress state causing the matrix cracking, the maximum principal normal stress in a plane perpendicular to the fiber direction in the -theta ply was calculated in an uncracked laminate. The corresponding shear stress parallel to the fiber was also calculated. The principal normal stress at the laminate edge increased through the ply thickness and reached a very high tensile value at the theta/-theta interface indicating that the crack in the -theta ply may initiate at the theta/-theta interface...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and fatigue}} {{properties}} are important factors when developing design rules {{to optimize the}} reduction of damage {{in the middle of}} a composite component loaded under a three point bending test. The progressive damage which occurs in a composite laminate during fatigue will affect the mechanical properties of the component to an extent which depends on the material type and lay-up of the composite and on the mode of testing. By choosing an appropriate combination of ply materials and ply stacking sequence for the composite laminate, a better static condition, as well as better fatigue behavior of the component is expected under in-service conditions. In order to minimize the through-thickness damage {{in the middle of a}} composite laminate under a short beam shear test, the present work focuses on determining the best stacking sequence, combining two different materials through-thickness of a composite component. The use of an algorithm that has been created to run all possible combinations of angles and materials was the key to finding the best stacking sequence for a composite component. Through the optimization method, two different hybrid laminate lay-ups were obtained for a maximum of 40 % of glass plies within a composite laminate. The laminates developed through the algorithm, which are, the Hybrid Design 1 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 c) 2 /(± 45 g) 2 /(± 45 c) ]s) and Hybrid Design 2 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 4 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 2]s), have shown that the best ply orientations to minimize the damage in the middle of a composite component occur when the value of the variable angle θ in ±θ plies has a maximum value of 90 degrees. The algorithm used showed that best laminates were obtained when glass plies were not used as the <b>central</b> <b>plies</b> in a glass/carbon composite laminate, with a maximum 40 % of glass plies. Static and fatigue tests were performed on both hybrid designs and on a quasi-isotropic composite laminate ([(0 / 45 / 90 /- 45) 3]s) made of carbon plies. The results of the static and fatigue tests have demonstrated that the best design, giving the best static and fatigue behavior is the Hybrid Design 1. Also, it has been demonstrated through experimental tests that 90 degree plies within a composite laminate subject to a three point bending condition will cause the component to be weaker in terms of fatigue and static properties due to the tendency to develop inclined cracks in the through-thickness direction on the 90 degree plies of the composite laminate, causing delamination and loss of stiffness of the component...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} is {{proposed for the}} use of cohesive elements in the analysis of delamination propagation in composite materials under high-cycle fatigue loading. The method is applicable to delamination propagation within the Paris-law regime and is suitable for the analysis of three-dimensional structures typical of aerospace applications. The major advantages of the proposed formulation are its complete independence of the cohesive zone length – which is a geometry-dependent parameter – and its relative insensitivity to mesh refinement. This is only possible via the introduction of three nonlocal algorithms, which provide (i) automated three-dimensional tracking of delamination fronts, (ii) an estimation of direction of crack propagation and (iii) accurate and mesh-insensitive integration of strain energy release rate. All calculations are updated at every increment of an explicit time-integration finite element solution, which models the envelopes of forces and displacements with an assumption of underlying constant cyclic loading. The method was implemented as a user-defined subroutine in the commercial finite element software LS-Dyna and supports the analysis of complex three-dimensional models. Results are presented for benchmark cases such as specimens with <b>central</b> cut <b>plies</b> and centrally-loaded circular plates. Accurate predictions of delamination growth rates are observed for different mesh topologies in agreement with the Paris-laws of the material...|$|R
40|$|Short beam shear testing {{based on}} three-point loading {{has been used}} to {{evaluate}} the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of GFRP made using circular (CGF) and hollow shaped (HSGF) borosilicate glass fibres. Both fibre types were made in-house at the University of Bristol using a bespoke fibre manufacturing facility. Different fibre orientation lay-ups have been investigated to enable a broader study of the effect on through–thickness mechanical properties. Sixteen ply laminates have been manufactured with 0 °/ 0 °, 0 °/ 45 ° and 0 °/ 90 ° mid-plane interfaces using both commercial (E-glass/ 913 epoxy) and in-house (borosilicate glass/ 913 epoxy) preimpregnated tapes. In-house prepregs were used in the <b>central</b> 8 <b>plies</b> where interlaminar shear loading is highest and where failure usually occurs. The diameter of in-house fibres (40 µm for CGF and 51 µm for HSGF) have been chosen to maintain similar cross sectional areas. The test specimens had a 12. 7 mm span, width of 10 mm and a thickness of 2. 5 mm to give a span-thickness ratio of 5. The results indicate that ILSS and energy absorbed at failure increases for HSGF and for non-unidirectional ply interfaces. This suggests that HSGF composites possess a stronger fibre-matrix interface...|$|R
40|$|Several 3 D {{finite element}} {{analyses}} of (0 /theta/-theta) sub s graphite epoxy laminates, where theta= 15, 20, 25, 30, and 45 deg, subjected to axial tension load were performed. The interlaminar stresses in the theta/-theta interface were calculated {{with and without}} a matrix crack in the <b>central</b> -theta <b>plies.</b> The interlaminar normal stress changes from a small compressive stress when no matrix crack is present to a high tensile stress {{at the intersection of}} the matrix crack and free edge.

In order to examine the stress state causing the matrix cracking the maximum principal normal stress in a plane perpendicular to the fiber direction in the -theta ply was calculated in an uncracked laminate. The corresponding shear stress parallel to the fiber was also calculated. The principal normal stress at the laminate edge increases through the ply thickness and reached a very high tensile value at the theta/-theta interface indicating that the crack in the -theta ply may initiate at the theta/-theta interface. Crack profiles on the laminate edge in the -theta ply were constructed from the principal stress directions. The cracks were found to be more curved for layups with smaller theta angles, which is consistent with experimental observations in the literature...|$|R
40|$|We used a variational stress {{analysis}} and an energy release rate failure criterion {{to construct a}} master plot analysis of matrix microcracking. In the master plot, the results for all laminates of a single material are predicted to fall on a single line whose slope gives the microcracking toughness of the material.

40|$|High {{resolution}} Synchrotron Radiation Computed Tomography (SRCT) {{has been}} used to capture fibre damage progression in a carbon–epoxy notched [90 / 0]s laminate loaded to failure. To the authors knowledge this provides the first direct in situ measurement of the accumulation of fibre fractures for a high performance material under structurally relevant load conditions (i. e. fractures within the bulk of an essentially conventional engineering laminate). A high level of confidence is placed in the measurements, as the failure processes are viewed internally at the relevant micromechanical length-scales, as opposed to previous indirect and/or surface-based methods. Whilst fibre breaks are the dominant composite damage mechanism considered in the present work, matrix damage, such as transverse ply cracks, 0 ? splits and delaminations, were also seen to occur in advance of extensive fibre breaks. At loads where fibre break density levels were significant, splitting and delamination were seen to separate the <b>central</b> 0 ? <b>ply</b> in the near notch region from the 90 ? plies. Fibre breaks were initially observed in isolated locations, consistent with the stochastic nature of fibre strengths. The formation of clusters of broken fibres was observed at higher loads. The largest clusters observed consisted of a group of eleven breaks and a group of fourteen breaks. The large clusters were observed at the highest load, at sites with no prior breaks, indicating they occurred within a relatively narrow load range. No strong correlation was found between the location of matrix damage and fibre breaks. The data achieved has been made available online at www. materialsdatacentre. com for ongoing model development and validation...|$|R
40|$|Intraply {{cracking}} and delamination are {{the basic}} modes of damage in composite laminates and their interaction constitutes an important phase in damage development. Such an interaction is investigated in the present work through a two-dimensional finite element analysis of a three-point bending beam model. This configuration is considered to embody the basic characteristics of lowenergy transverse impact of composite laminates, where damage is a major concern. Interleaves are incorporated in the model to evaluate {{their role in the}} damage process. The stacking sequence used is [0 /A/ 90 /A/ 0] (`A' denotes an interleaf), and an intraply crack at 45 [deg] to the loading line is assumed in the <b>central</b> 90 [deg] <b>ply.</b> The damage process is simulated by specifying the delamination growth at the tips of the intraply crack along the beam axis direction. Stress fields and the strain energy release rates are evaluated at different stages of the delamination growth. The results show that before any delamination takes place, there is a significant transverse normal stress concentration at the tips of the intraply crack. Consequently, there is a strong involvement of mode I component of fracture at this stage. However, with the growth of the delamination, a rapid transition occurs in which the transverse normal stress and its corresponding mode I delamination driving force decrease dramatically relative to their shear counterparts. The entire damage process is therefore summarized as primarily a mode II delamination fracture dominated event preceded by a very limited period of mode I driven fracture at the initiation of the delamination by the intraply crack. The results also indicate that soft interleaves do not alleviate the fracture driving forces at the delamination front. It follows that the interleaf technology relies almost entirely on the toughness of the interleaves...|$|R
