40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to calculate economic values for milk (MY), protein (PY) and fat productions (FY) and somatic cell count (SCC) which could be used to compose an economic index to rank animals involved in an international genetic evaluation program of Holstein cattle used in the commercial dairy population in Brazil. The main milk production systems (MPS) prevailing in the South and Southeast were defined based on the feeding management and production level of herds. To <b>calculate</b> <b>feeding</b> costs, energy requirements for the production of one kg of milk with the respective average protein and fat contents of each MPS were <b>calculated.</b> <b>Feeding</b> costs were obtained based on the regional prices of the diets' components. To calculate revenues, milk prices were obtained from the payment tables practiced by seven milk industries. Economic values were calculated from the marginal differences between revenues and costs, for the interest of maximizing the profit, assuming a fixed number of animals in the herd. The average economic values (R$) for MY, PY and FY were 0. 51, 6. 41 and 1. 94, respectively. The economic impact of increasing the original SCC values in the individual records of cows in the population by 1 % was -R$ 1. 40 per cow, per year. Due to changes observed in the last years in the milk market in Brazil, selection for milk components became economically advantageous. As a result, the calculation of economic values and the proposition of an economic index based on these traits became feasible.

Fish reared at the lowest density had significantly higher mean weight and length at the end of the trial. Growth over the 7 -week experiment was modeled as a function of time, and growth rate was inversely proportional to density. The mean increase in total biomass was 63. 14 %, and the mean daily length gain was 0. 23 %. Overall survival was 99. 7 %, and <b>calculated</b> <b>feed</b> conversion rates ranged from 1. 93 to 2. 65. However, feed conversion rates were likely not at maximum levels due to the selection of a relatively high experimental feeding rate (2. 5 % of body weight per day). As a result of excessive commercial harvests, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus popula-tions experienced dramatic declines in abundance across much of their range throughout the late 1800 s.

Under these laboratory conditions, significance {{of the results of}} the Ames test was questionable...|$|E
40|$|Problem Statement: This {{study was}} conduct to compare effects of various {{commercial}} feed additives on performance of laying hens. Approach: To evaluate effects of dietary inclusion of feed additives (Yeasturer, A-Max, Thepax, Fermacto and Biomin) on performance of laying hens, 216 Lohmann LSL-Lite hens were divided in 36 cages (n = 6). Approach Hens in 6 cages (replicates) {{were assigned to}} feed {{on one of the}} 6 iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous experimental diets (ME = 2720 Kcal Kg - 1 and CP = 145 g kg - 1) including control and diets with 0. 5 g kg - 1 of feed additives. Collected data of Feed Intake (FI), Egg Production (EP), Egg Weight (EW), Egg Mass (EM) and <b>calculated</b> <b>Feed</b> Conversion Ratio (FCR) during 6 -week trial period was analyzed based on completely randomized design using GLM procedure of SAS. Results and Conclusions : Dietary additive inclusion significantly affected on EW on 1 - 3 and 3 - 6 weeks. Feed additive did not have significant effect on EP, FCR, FI and EM. There {{was no significant difference in}} EP, EM, FI and FCR among the experimental groups. Hens received Yeasturer or A-Max showed improved EW compared to hens fed the control diet during weeks 1 - 3. Hens fed diets included additives showed improved egg shell weight and thickness compared to hens fed the control diet. There was no significant effect of dietary treatment on blood levels of cholesterol, TG and HDL. Adding Thepax or Biomin to diet significantly reduced blood levels of LDL compared to hens fed the other experimental diets. There was no significant effect of dietary treatment on diacritical counts of white blood cells. Recommendations: According to the results of the present study, probiotic Yesture and A-Max can be included in laying hens diets to improve EM. In addition, the commercial feed additives (Yeasturer, A-Max, Thepax, Fermacto and Biomin) used in this study had beneficial effects on egg shell quality characteristics in terms of shell weight and thickness and to decrease egg abnormalities due to poor shell, these feed additives could be recommendable...|$|E
40|$|Ruminant methane (CH 4) {{production}} contributes ~ 32 % of New Zealand’s total {{greenhouse gases}} (GHG) {{and a reduction}} in emissions is required under the Kyoto Protocol. Under this agreement, New Zealand has pledged to either reduce, or take responsibility for the GHG emissions above those in 1990. GHG emission factors used for inventory need to be accurate, reliable and applicable to animals grazing in New Zealand. Furthermore, identification and implementation of mitigation strategies also depends on accurate and reliable methods for measuring CH 4 emissions. Current techniques to measure CH 4 have to compromise between accuracy and applicability. Respiration chambers are accurate, but do not represent a grazing environment, whilst the Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF 6) technique can be used at grazing, but has more variation than the chambers. Consequently, a new technique known as the Greenfeed system, has been developed to measure CH 4 from grazing animals. The evaluation of this technique applied to grazing animals, with minimal interference from humans, and its evaluation is reported here. In the first experiment, CH 4 measurements were compared from the Greenfeed system with respiration chambers and the SF 6 technique using six dry dairy cows fed a silage-based diet. Intakes were measured and were approximately at maintenance levels and feeding regimens were similar throughout. The mean CH 4 production (g CH 4 /d) ± standard deviation (Murray et al., 2001) from the Greenfeed unit (150 ± 20. 2) was higher and more variable than those from the respiration chambers (134 ± 9. 8) and the SF 6 technique (128 ± 8. 7). Similarly, the CH 4 yield (g CH 4 /kg dry matter intake (DMI)) ± SD was higher from the Greenfeed unit (24. 0 ± 3. 2) than the respiration chambers (21. 9 ± 1. 6) or the SF 6 technique (20. 5 ± 1. 4). Correlations between CH 4 production by individual animals using the Greenfeed system and either respiration chambers or the SF 6 technique were weak (r = - 0. 36 and 0. 13, respectively). The second experiment successfully implemented two Greenfeed units on-farm with 24 lactating cows, including four with rumen fistulae, and evaluated their behavioural interactions and estimated CH 4 production. Seventeen of the 24 cows (approximately 70 %) visited the Greenfeed units, but this could be increased by training so most cows visit. An attractant/reward was used to encourage cows into the units and the cows preferred the Lucerne pellets to the Grain pellets. The mean CH 4 production measured using the Greenfeed units were 340. 3 ± 61. 8 g CH 4 /d, suggesting about 21. 3 g CH 4 /kg DMI (based on <b>calculated</b> <b>feed</b> intakes). It appears that 14 days are needed for cows {{to get used to the}} Greenfeed units, and extending estimates (for five further weeks) did not reduce the variance in CH 4 emissions values within cows. This research has shown that the Greenfeed system seems adequate for estimating CH 4 production of a whole herd. Further estimates are required before standard operating procedures can be determined and that confidence can be placed in the accuracy of CH 4 estimates...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} 100 years, the {{arrival in the}} Pacific Northwest of the {{invasive}} European slug Airon rufus has introduced a potential competitor for the iconic banana slug Ariolimax columbianus, the second largest terrestrial slug in the world. We conducted transect studies in three habitats (cedar forest, Doug fir forest, and grasslands) on San Juan Island, WA, to examine the relative demographics of these slugs and note possible food sources. Utilizing those data, we conducted feeding preference studies across leaves from 16 local plant species, incorporating slugs from the two species from difference source habitats, difference size classes, and both the black and brown morphs of Arion rufus, which tend to specialize in different habitats. We used ImageJ to measure the area eaten from each leaf and <b>calculated</b> <b>feeding</b> rates. The feeding preferences of Ariolimax columbianus were consistent across size classes and source populations., and the two color morphs and various source populations of Arion rufus were also largely consistent within this species. While both species are generalists, they demonstrated feeding preferences the frequently overlapped, indicating that Ariolimax columbianus may compete with Arion rufus for food resources...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) requirement of Korean native ducklings for hatch to 21 d of age. A total of 336 one-day-old male Korean native ducklings were used in a completely randomized design having 8 dietary treatments to provide a range of AME content from 2, 600 to 3, 300 kcal/kg (i. e., 100 kcal/kg disparity). Eight experimental diets containing varying levels of AME were formulated to meet the NRC (1994) nutrient specifications. Ducklings were randomly allocated to 48 pens (6 replicates per treatment and 7 ducklings per pen) and were offered their respective diets on an ad libitum basis for the period of study. Body weight and feed intake were measured weekly to <b>calculate</b> <b>feed</b> conversion ratio, energy intake, and protein intake. Two ducklings per pen (n = 6) were euthanized via cervical dislocation to weigh empty body and drumsticks {{at the conclusion of the}} experiment. Data were fitted to both linear-plateau and quadratic-plateau models for estimation of the AME requirements for Korean native ducklings for hatch to 21 d of age. The estimated AME requirements were 2, 953, 3, 007, and 2, 950 kcal AME/kg diet for maximum daily gain, daily feed intake, and for minimum feed conversion ratio, respectively...|$|R
