5|$|When Barry {{became a}} {{tropical}} cyclone, its convection wrapped around {{roughly half of}} the center. Outflow in the eastern semicircle was good, although due to upper-level wind shear, it was restricted to southeast of the circulation. The cyclone became embedded within a mid- to-upper-level trough between the ridge over the central U.S. and the ridge over the northwestern Caribbean. A strong, upper-level <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> axis extended from just south of Cape Hatteras to near Brownsville, Texas, which prevented Barry from accelerating in forward speed. The ridge over the United States weakened, thus collapsing the steering pattern; {{this resulted in a}} west-southwestward drifting motion of the tropical storm by around August 3. Early on August 3, strong westerly winds prevailed, and separated the center of circulation from what limited convection remained. The storm quickly regained some convection, although maximum sustained winds remained weak, at about 40mph (60km/h). Despite a slight drop in barometric pressure, post-season analysis revealed Barry weakened into a tropical depression early on August 4 due to the persistent wind shear and falling external pressure.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal {{deformation}} in mid-latitude cyclones concentrates temperature gradients—cold {{air from}} the north and warm {{air from the}} south. Horizontal shear has two effects on an air parcel; it tends to rotate the parcel (think of placing a wheel at a point in space and as the wind blows, the wheel rotates) and deform the parcel through stretching and shrinking. In the end, this can also tighten temperature gradient, but most importantly, this rotates a concentrated temperature gradient for example, from the x-axis to the y direction. Within a mid-latitude cyclone, these two key features play an essential role in frontogenesis. On the west side of a typical mid-latitude cyclone, there are northerly winds (associated with cold air) and east of the cyclone, southerly winds (associated with warm air); resulting in horizontal shear deformation. In the end, this results to concentrate a <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> along a line of maximum shear (which in this case is the birth of a cold front). On the eastern side of a cyclone, horizontal deformation is seen which turns into confluence (a result of translation + deformation). Horizontal deformation at low levels is an important mechanism for the development of both cold and warm fronts (Holton, 2004).|$|E

40|$|Near Point Conception, California, the {{atmospheric}} flow separates {{from the coast}} and a large wind stress curl results. Direct spatial wind field observations from 20 aircraft overflights {{in the spring of}} 1983 suggest that Ekman pumping of on average 4 m day 21 contributes to the local dynamics. During strong and persistent upwelling events the curl-driven Ekman pumping reaches up to 20 m day 21. A single complex empirical orthogonal function explains more than 72 % of the spatial and temporal wind stress variance. It reveals large wind stress curl {{at the center of the}} western Santa Barbara Channel entrance. This dominant mode correlates strongly (r 2 5 0. 79) with the wind stress observed at a moored buoy. The location of largest Ekman pumping in the ocean indicated by this mode coincides with the location of a laterally <b>sheared,</b> <b>cyclonic</b> flow. Cold upwelled waters enter the Santa Barbara Channel along its southern perimeter while warm, and thus buoyant, waters from the Southern California Bight exit the channel along its northern perimeter. Buoy wind stress and lateral current shear at 30 -m depth correlate significantly at periods of about 3. 5 and 6 days with phase lags of about 0. 5 and 2 days, respectively. Hydrographic observations from 1983 do not, however, indicate effects of Ekman pumping on the internal mass field as winds vary in speed and direction at daily timescales. This contrasts with 1984 observations that do indicate strong doming of isopycnals over the center of the channel at its western entrance.

40|$|Abstract In {{the morning}} hours of 29 June 1998, a line of severe {{convective}} storms traversed central Iowa, producing a wide swath of straight-line wind damage (several gusts exceeding 50 m s- 1) and isolated weak-to-moderate intensity tornadoes (F 0 -F 2). This quasi-linear convective system evolved into a severe squall line with three high-precipitation (HP) supercells and multiple well-defined mid-level mesocyclones embedded within it. Although scattered wind damage was reported across many sections of the entire line, this paper focuses {{on the evolution of}} one particularly active portion associated with a nearly continuous swath of severe straight-line winds and tornadic activity beginning 40 km northwest of Des Moines and extending through the metropolitan area. One of the embedded HP supercells contained several mid-level rotating centers that exhibited descending vortex characteristics between 1716 and 1806 UTC; their strongest <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shears</b> persisted at mid levels of the circulation. As the storm approached the Des Moines metropolitan area between 1806 and 1833 UTC, the outflow-dominated HP supercell further matured and several non-descending tornadic and non tornadic mesovortices occurred along a very progressive outflow boundary.

Over {{twice as many}} named tropical systems (hurricanes {{and tropical}} storms) accompany equatorial 850 -mb westerly anomalies than accompany equatorial easterly anomalies, and the systems that do exist are stronger. Hurricanes are over four times more numerous during westerly phases of the MJO than during easterly phases. The current study constructs a composite life cycle of the MJO during May–November 1979 – 95 using an index based on the 850 -mb equatorial zonal wind. Equatorial Kelvin waves propagating eastward from convective regions of the western Pacific Ocean alter dynamical conditions over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Westerly (easterly) equatorial 850 -mb wind anomalies are accompanied by enhanced (suppressed) convection over the eastern Pacific hurricane region.

To do so, the evolution of finite-amplitude synoptic cyclones in various baroclinic zonal flows is analyzed. Baroclinic zonal flows with uniform horizontal shears are first considered. While the anticyclonic shear allows a much more efficient and sustainable extraction of potential energy than the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear,</b> {{the growth of the}} lower-layer eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is shown to be highly dependent on the choice of the parameter values. An increased vertical shear leads to a more rapid EKE increase in the anticyclonic shear than in the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> whereas increasing the vertically averaged potential vorticity gradient or the barotropic shear stabilizes the EKE more in the former shear than in the latter. Finally, vertical velocities arising from the nonlinear interaction between synoptic cyclones are shown to favor EKE growth in the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> rather than in the anticyclonic one. The evolution of cyclones initialized on the warm side of a meridionally confined baroclinic jet is then investigated. The lower-layer cyclone crosses the jet axis and undergoes two distinct growth stages. The first growth stage results from the classical baroclinic interaction and is mainly driven by linear interaction between the cyclones and the jet.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{idealized}} nonlinear life cycle experiments is performed to compare changes in life cycle behavior caused by upper-level and near-surface meridional shear {{of the initial}} zonal wind. It is shown that both the eddy kinetic energy and the zonal flow accelerations produced during a cycle of growth and equilibration respond primarily to the meridional shear of the zonal wind near the surface and only weakly to shear near the tropopause. Near the critical shear for transition from anticyclonic to cyclonic life cycle behavior, the zonal flow accelerations are minimized and the eddy persistence is maximized. Above this critical shear, eddy breaking on the poleward side of the jet increases and strong cyclonic zonal wind shears are generated. The influence of baroclinic shears is minimized by using dipolar wind anomalies that are zero {{near the center of}} a basic baroclinic jet and by taking advantage {{of the fact that the}} life cycle response is very sensitive to small changes in the magnitude of initial meridional shear. The small baroclinic shears contribute to the differences in the sense that a <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> decreasing with height is slightly more effective in inducing cyclonic behavior than is a barotropic <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> with the same surface value. Upper-tropospheric eddy momentum fluxes by linear normal modes are also much more sensitive to lower-tropospheric meridional shear than to upper-tropospheric meridional shear.

Observations in the 20 th century also show that over the warmer continent and the nearby western South Atlantic Ocean, the lower-layer equatorial westerly wind (LLEWW) strengthens with the initiation of tropical cyclones (TCs). The warmer-continent-related LLEWW can result from the Coriolis-force-induced deflection of the cross-equatorial flow (similar to the well-known heat-island effect on sea breeze) driven by the enhanced land-sea contrast between the warmer urbanized continents and relatively cold oceans. This study focuses on the processes relating the warmer-continent-related LLEWW to the TC initiation and demonstrates that the LLEWW embedded in trade easterlies can directly initiate TCs by creating <b>cyclonic</b> wind <b>shears</b> and forming the intertropical convergence zone.

The associated vertical wavenumber frequency spectrum of strain, when viewed in an isopycnal-following frame, displays a clear spectral gap at low vertical wavenumber, separating the quasigeostrophic (vortical) strain field and the superinertial internal wave continuum. This gap enables both model and linear-filter-based methods for separating the submesoscale and internal wave strain fields. These fields are examined independently in six field programs spanning the period 1983 - 2002. Vortical and internal wave strain variances are often comparable in the upper thermocline, of order 0. 2. However, vortical strain tends to decrease with increasing depth (decreasing buoyancy frequency as N 2 = -g/ρ(dρ/dz) ~(N 2) 1 / 2, while internal wave strain variance increases as ~(N 2) 1 / 2, exceeding vortical variance {{by a factor of}} 5 - 10 at depths below 500 m.

The analyses show that a series of small circulations formed along a persistent <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> boundary; at times as many as three misocyclones were present with vertical vorticity values as large as 0. 1 /s using a 0. 25 km grid interval. The strength of the circulations suggests the possibility of accompanying tornadoes or funnels, although none were observed. Dual-Doppler analyses show that strong, small-scale downdrafts develop in close proximity to the misocyclones. A midlevel mesocyclone formed in the same general region of the storm where the misocylones later developed. The observations are compared with numerical simulations from a three-dimensional cloud model initialized with sounding data from the same day...|$|E
40|$|No {{hurricane}} {{is detected}} in the tropics off the Brazilian coast {{due to the lack}} of initial conditions (e. g., the weak vertical shear of horizontal wind) despite that high sea surface temperature is available. According to previous studies, the initial conditions (as the ingredients of hurricane's embryo) are related so that the thick warm-and-moist layer (due to the updraft vapour) below a cold-and-dry layer frames the convective instability which enhances diabatic processes accompanied by tropical cyclones with the weak vertical shear. So the basic question is how, starting with an internal-disturbance-free balance-situation, external forces create the rapidly-upward acceleration of moist air at the warm sea surface. The answer is revealed by the vertical-momentum equation which shows that boosted by the external-force-induced significant lower-layer equatorial westerly wind (LLEWW), the upward (unit-mass) acceleration could be as significant as the midlatitude Coriolis force. Besides creating cyclonic vortices through the upward acceleration and diabatic processes, the external-force-induced significant-LLEWW could directly create <b>cyclonic</b> wind <b>shears</b> along with easterly jets for the low-level cyclonic vorticity through reducing the peak value of zonally-homogeneous trade easterlies (centered at the Equator between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere subtropical high-belts). We emphasize external forces to avoid the ''chicken-and-egg'' problem accompanying nonlinear interactions of internal-forcing processes. The external-force-induced significant-LLEWW could result from the deflection of the cross-equatorial flow characterized by the seasonal shift coincident with that of locations of most embryos. This significant cross-equatorial flow is driven by the significant differential heating between the largest continent with the highest plateau and the largest ocean with the warm pool located to the east and on the equatorward side of the continent on the rotating Earth. Unfortunately, in the tropics off the Brazilian coast, the differential heating is weak between the relatively-small ocean and land mostly covered by tropical rainforest. No significant-LLEWW means no hurricane's embryo. A warm spawning ground without the embryo means no hurricane. Our investigation suggests that the external-force-induced significant-LLEWW embedded in the significant trade easterlies over the warm ocean be necessary and sufficient for making the embryo originate in an internal-disturbance-free balance-situation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} {{a first step}} in understanding the impact of hydrodynamic features on the zooplankton dynamics in the Algerian Basin (southwestern Mediterranean Sea). The mesoscale distribution of mesozooplankton abundance, biomass, specific composition and size structure was investigated during ELISA- 1 campaign (1997) in the framework of the program ELISA (Eddies and Leddies Interdisciplinary Study off Algeria, 1997 – 1998), partly dedicated to study the mesoscale features during 1997. Physical, biogeochemical and biological measurements were made on transects through two hydrodynamic features, one anticyclonic eddy and a small secondary <b>shear</b> <b>cyclonic</b> eddy. The use of combined zooplankton descriptors, i. e. biomass, abundance, size structure (e. g. NB-SS slope) and taxonomic structure, and of cumulative function allowed us to extract spatial trends in the anticyclonic eddy (AE 96 - 1). It is hypothesized here that the eastern edge of AE 96 - 1, characterized by thick layer of chlorophyll (between 100 and 150 m) due to the downward entrainment of chlorophyll down to 200 m, was favorable for small organisms (Paracalanus/Clausocalanus, Calocalanus, and Calanus) while higher abundance of large active swimmer such as chaetognaths was observed in the center. In the cyclonic eddy, the highest abundance of filter-feeders (ostracods, cladocerans, doliolids and salps) was related to enhance trophic conditions, i. e. highest chlorophyll concentration (4 – 8 mgm 3). These results show that cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies strongly influence the mesoscale characteristics of zooplankton in the Algerian basinZooplankton distribution related to the hydrodynami...|$|R
40|$|Sea surface {{temperatures}} in the tropical Indian Ocean {{have been shown to}} be inversely related to South African summer rainfall, making advanced predictions of this rainfall practicable. Such predictability has enormous potential economic benefits. However, these predictions have been purely statistical; very little is currently known about the marine-atmospheric processes in the Indian Ocean tropics. To address this lack of information, the structure of the upper ocean and lower atmosphere as well as the surface heat fluxes in the tropical Indian Ocean have been investigated. This was done by a special measurement programme on a research cruise in the region. Global gridded meteorological data have been used to complement the shipboard observations. Heat fluxes have been computed from the cruise observations and related to the main atmospheric patterns at the time. These patterns were identified from principal components analysis. Air-sea interaction could thus be estimated over the full tropical Indian Ocean. It is found that the thermocline depth is linked to the <b>cyclonic</b> ocean current <b>shear</b> and to the overlying distribution of wind stress curl. The meridional advection of air into the central Indian Ocean region is shown to modulate the characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer in the tropical Indian Ocean. The maximum turbulent heat and moisture transports to the atmosphere are found near cyclonic atmospheric disturbances. These are the first reliable observations of the heat and moisture fluxes in that part of the tropical Indian Ocean implicated in South African rainfall. It is clear from this investigation that the synoptic atmospheric systems and the meridional flow of air are critical to enhanced atmospheric convection in the region...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{vorticity}} (or PV) {{has become}} an important tool for the diagnosis and modeling of the Earth's atmospheric and oceanic circulations. More recently, the application of PV thinking to numerical simulations and spacecraft observations of other atmospheres, including those of Mars, Venus, and Titan, has encouraged the hope for a unified understanding of planetary circulation regimes encompassing {{a wide range of}} rotation, stratification, and forcing parameters. Specifically, the accumulated evidence suggests that zonal-mean winds and temperatures at upper tropospheric levels approximate a state of zero potential vorticity within the bounding latitudes of the westerly jets, while the poleward regions of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> conform to a PV state that is well mixed with respect to its polar limit. This review of the prospects for conceptual planetary circulation models will explore the possibility that the zonal-mean state of an atmosphere can be calculated in terms of a simple link between the latitudinal PV and potential temperature variation at an upper baroclinic steering level...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{interactions}} between stable oval structures (spots) using the Voyager 2 cylindrical projection mosaics. In {{contrast with the}} solitary wave type of interaction, collisions between spots are irreversible. Most interactions (23 out of 27 cases) lead to merging of the two original spots. The other type of interaction (4 out of 27 cases) is simply a near miss—the spots pass around each other. Interactions of spots with filamentary regions, which are actively changing and more amorphous than spots, usually lead to {{the disappearance of the}} spot. Filamentary regions are also the major source of spots. Stable spots do not produce other spots. Instead, spots destroy each other by merging. Most spots are anticyclonic and sit in anticyclonic shear zones. Filamentary regions are cyclonic and sit in <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> zones. Larger spots are more elliptical than smaller ones.

40|$|Cyclonic {{barotropic}} shear of incrementally increasing magnitude {{is imposed}} on an idealized midlatitude jet, {{and the life}} cycles of baroclinically unstable wavenumber 6 perturbations growing on these jets are studied. When the barotropic shear parameter passes a critical value, the life cycle makes an abrupt transition from anticyclonic to cyclonic behavior. The abrupt transition in behavior is most evident in the barotropic decay of eddy kinetic energy, {{in the structure of}} the eddies as seen in potential vorticity maps, and in the nature of the zonal flow accelerations produced during the life cycle. It is suggested that the abrupt transition can be interpreted as arising from a positive feedback between eddy propagation and eddy-induced zonal flow accelerations. Dependences on the zonal scale of the eddy are also investigated. Wavenumber 8 exhibits cyclonic behavior, while wavenumber 4 exhibits anticyclonic behavior for all values of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>shear</b> considered. This dependence on zonal scale is consistent with predictions of linear WKB wave propagation theory. The sharpness of the transition in life cycle behavior has implications for medium-range predictability and for the generation of low-frequency variability in the atmosphere. 1...|$|E
40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} oil depletion only recovers 20 – 50 % original oil in place (OOIP), so {{large amount of}} oil is still trapped in the reservoir after conventional processes. To recover more oil, tertiary methods are used {{to increase the amount}} of oil that can be extracted from an oil field. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a tertiary method used to maximize oil recovery from the reservoirs. There are many different EOR methods, however, polymer injection and polymer flooding is the most important chemical EOR method used in sandstone reservoirs. It has been found that polymer flooding can recover from 2 – 5 % OOIP over traditional water flooding. Polymers are long chain molecules, often, with high molecular weight. These molecules increase the viscosity of the injection water and improve the mobility ratio, which is the mobility of the displacing phase divided by the mobility of the displaced phase. A mobility ratio of 1 between water and oil will increase the sweep efficiency. However, one of the main problems with polymer flooding is that polymers are very shear sensitive. During polymer injection, shear is especially to be found in process equipment, like fluid flow devices (valves, pumps), but also in the reservoir. When polymers are subjected to shear, they are readily broken down and degraded, which results in irreversible loss of viscosity and inefficient oil recovery. There are however low shear technologies and equipment which purpose is to reduce mechanical degradation of polymers during injection. Some of the state of the art low shear techniques rely on pipes and coils, while other relies on cyclonic principles. It is thought, that a reduction in pressure drop over a longer length (spiral) or in a bigger volume (<b>cyclonic)</b> will reduce <b>shear</b> forces, hence mechanical degradation of polymers. This thesis consists of and is part of two industry projects, a pre-project and a main project between Typhonix, Total and the International Research institute of Stavanger (IRIS) and the Research Council of Norway. The aim of the pre-project and the ongoing main project is to study mechanical degradation of polymers by low shear valves and fluid flow devices, especially low shear Typhoon technologies. Typhonix AS, which is a company with knowledge within low shear process equipment, have patented a <b>cyclonic</b> low <b>shear</b> valve, the Typhoon Valve, and a low shear spiral fluid flow control device, the Shark. Both devices have proven to have a positive effect on oil in water emulsions, due to less shear forces and turbulence. In the Typhoon Valve, the pressure drop is reduced in a bigger volume than in a conventional valve, while in the Shark, the pressure drop is reduced over a longer length, resulting in less shear forces and turbulence. From previous study, it is to believe that a new low shear process for EOR polymer flooding can increase the recovery rate from 3 to 7 %. The Typhoon Valve was tested at Total’s division for polymer injection in Lacq, France (PERL). The Shark was tested at Typhonix’s own laboratory at Varhaug, together with a small scale Typhoon Valve and a standard valve. In both test programs, a high concentration polymer solution was pumped through a test-rig where the Typhoon Valve (France) or the Shark, small scale Typhoon Valve or standard valve were installed (Varhaug), at different flow rates and pressure drops. Different configurations of the Shark were tested, to see if different lengths and diameters had influence on polymer degradation. Samples were taken downstream the test-section, and the viscosity of the samples was measured with a rheometer. % degradation was then calculated, and the Typhoon Valve, the Shark, and the Typhoon configuration were compared to the results with the Standard valve. The testing in France with the 2 ” Typhoon Valve did not give the positive results that were expected. It was observed that the degradation with the Typhoon Valve was in the same range as with the Standard Valve. It was also seen that the degradation was a function of both pressure drop and flow rate, as they increased, the degradation also increased. Especially with high pressure drop was % degradation in both valves was high (> 60 %). It was found that the internals in the Typhoon Valve was not optimized for the test conditions, so this may be the reason for the disappointing results. However, the testing at Varhaug with the different Shark configurations, gave very promising results. It was not observed any degradation of the solution, with any of the different cones and spirals, even at the highest pressure drop, and % degradation remained low. It was seen that the shear rates in the cones and spiral were less than the critical shear rate of the polymer. The viscosity did differ a little at very low shear rates when viscosity measurements were conducted, but this can be explained by high uncertainties and sound at low shear rates. Also, with the Typhoon configuration, the results were promising. It was observed that the valve gave less degradation of the polymer solution compared to a standard valve, especially at high pressure drops, and % degradation was lower than with the standard valve. The experiments conduced, both in France and at Varhaug, gave knowledge about shear rates and shear degradation of polymer solutions in mechanical facilities. From the results further suggestions and further tests are planed to be conducted, for both the Typhoon Valve and the Shark. The Typhoon Valve are planed to be tested with new internals, such that optimized capacity is achieved. This testing is going to take place at Total’s facilties in Lacq in autumn 2013. Further tests with the Shark are also suggested. Tests with smaller diameter coils, and higher flow rates, to initiate shear should be conducted. The results should be compared to the shear degradation with a Standard valve. The shark can be constructed to have shear rates which is under the critical shear rate of the polymer, which means that polymer degradation is avoided.
