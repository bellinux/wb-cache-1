5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the <b>Chimney</b> <b>Sweep,</b> the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E

50|$|Ashley was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of prohibiting the employment of boys as <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps.</b> Many climbing boys were illegitimate who had been sold by their parents. They suffered from scorched and lacerated skin, their eyes and throats filled with soot, with the danger of suffocation and their occupational disease—cancer of the scrotum. In 1840 a Bill was introduced into the Commons outlawing the employment of boys as <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps,</b> and strongly supported by Ashley. Despite being enforced in London, elsewhere the Act did not stop the employment of child <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> and this led to the foundation of the Climbing-Boys' Society with Ashley as its chairman. In 1851, 1853 and 1855 Shaftesbury introduced Bills into Parliament to deal with the ongoing use of boy <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> but these were all defeated. He succeeded in passing the Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864 but like its predecessors it remained ineffectual. Shaftesbury finally persuaded Parliament to pass the Chimney Sweepers Act 1875 which ensured the annual licensing of <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> and the enforcement of the law by the police. This finally eradicated the employment of boys as <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps.</b>|$|R

25|$|Set in {{a fictional}} {{version of the}} {{industrial}} age, the story begins with William Blackmore, a professional <b>chimney</b> <b>sweep,</b> leaving his family {{to take a job}} under a powerful industrialist, the Baron. A few months later, with William having failed to return and the family deep in debt, the four Blackmore children (Albert, Agatha, Abigail, and Archibald) are forced into apprenticeships by the Baron's agents, leaving the youngest, Charlie, alone with his mother Agnes. A few weeks later, a pigeon arrives with a letter from Albert, who reveals that the Baron has split up him and his siblings, forcing them to work as slaves. Charlie subsequently sets out to rescue them, recruiting a friendly hobo named Levi to help him set up a hideout in an abandoned section of the Royal Train Station, where a strike has forced the station's management to use Albert and other children as coal shovelers.|$|E

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to soot, rich in {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), {{has been associated with}} increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, our knowledge about PAH exposure and early markers of CVD remains limited. In this cross-sectional study of 151 <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> and 152 controls, we investigated occupational {{exposure to}} PAH and early markers of CVD. Blood pressure (BP) (<b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> only), urinary PAH metabolites and serum biomarkers were measured (C-reactive protein, homocysteine, gamma-glutamyltransferase, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides). <b>Chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> had up to 7 times higher concentrations of PAH metabolites in urine than controls (P < 0. 001) : Median concentrations (adjusted for specific gravity) for 1 -hydroxypyrene, 2 -hydroxyphenanthrene, 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, and 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]anthracene were 0. 56 μg/L, 0. 78 μg/L, 4. 75 ng/L, and 6. 28 ng/L, respectively. Compared with controls, <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> had increased homocysteine, cholesterol, and HDL (β = 3. 4 μmol/L, 0. 43 mmol/L, and 0. 13 mmol/L, respectively, P ≤ 0. 003, adjusted for age, BMI, and smoking). In <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps,</b> PAH metabolites correlated positively with the percentage of soot sweeping (P < 0. 001). 2 -hydroxyphenanthrene, 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, and 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]anthracene were positively associated with diastolic BP (P < 0. 044, adjusted for age, BMI, and smoking). PAH exposure among <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> resulted in elevated levels of markers for CVD risk. These findings stress the need to reduce occupational exposure to PAH...|$|R

500|$|In 1854, {{he built}} Washington New Hall, {{a few miles}} south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1872 an {{illegally}} young <b>chimney</b> <b>sweep,</b> aged 7, died in a chimney in the Hall. Bell promptly moved into the newly built Rounton Grange near Northallerton, leaving Washington Hall empty for nineteen years until he donated it as a home for poor children, named at his request [...] "Dame Margaret's Hall". According to his granddaughter's biographer Georgina Howell, he was [...] "a formidable giant of a man" [...] and somewhat abrasive. The family prepared a Christmas alphabet in 1877 at Rounton Grange, including [...] "C is the Crushing Contemptuous Pater", which Bell's daughter Elsa later annotated [...] "Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell". In Howell's view, another event also hinted at Bell's character: one cold winter's night, his coachman was found, according to some papers found in Mount Grace Priory, [...] "frozen stiff on the box-seat of his carriage". Howell notes that the coachman could simply have had a heart attack, and not have died of exposure at all, but still, in her view [...] "consideration for others was not, perhaps, Lowthian's principal quality".|$|E
500|$|The film {{draws upon}} many sources of {{inspiration}} that were {{important in the}} production of the film. McCarthy writes that a research trip was not specifically undertaken for the film, but says Miyazaki's Heidi sketchbooks were useful for the scenery. Miyazaki would cite Italian Mountain Cities and the Tiber Estuary from Kagoshima Publishing as influencing the production of the film. The film included elements that were seen in other Arsène Lupin works, including La Justice d'Arsène Lupin by Boileau-Narcejac, involving the discovery of a tremendous stash of forged franc notes with which World War I–era Germany had planned to destabilize the French economy. Maurice Leblanc's The Green-eyed Lady also featured a secret treasure hidden {{at the bottom of a}} lake. The castle is visually influenced by that of the original 1952 unfinished release of The Shepherdess and the <b>Chimney</b> <b>Sweep.</b> Greenberg writes, [...] "Cagliostro also borrowed many narrative and visual elements from Grimault's film: the basic plotline of disrupting the wedding of an evil tyrant and a beautiful innocent girl, the tyrant's luxuriously-decorated palace that is also full of traps, and a gang of henchmen serving the tyrant – both oversized goons and ninja-like assassins..." [...] The staff added personal touches to the film, the most iconic being Lupin's car, the Fiat 500, was the car of head animator Yasuo Ōtsuka. [...] Clarisse's car in the chase scene is a Citroen 2CV, which is Miyazaki's first car.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a cohort}} {{study of the}} {{mortality}} among <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> in Copenhagen, Denmark, during 1958 - 77. Nearly all the <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> started in the trade around the age of 15, and so this age gives the time of first exposure to the environmental conditions of the trade. The analysis applies a continuous time model with stratification by cause of death (cancer, non-cancer), time and age, where cumulative mortality rates are derived from current mortality tables. For each stratum of interest the observed/expected mortality ratio (0 /E ratio) is calculated and a test performed, based on the normal distribution. The main result is a significantly higher cancer mortality for the 40 — 69 year age class compared with {{the population at large}} (0 /E ratio = 3. 9). Ever since Pott 1 in 1775 published his findings of cases of cancer of the scrotum among <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps,</b> it has been widely recognized that <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeps</b> are exposed to work-related environmental hazards that result in higher mortality than that of comparable unexposed individuals.
