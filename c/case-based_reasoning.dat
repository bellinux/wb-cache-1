2500|$|Casuistry {{dates from}} Aristotle (384–322 BC), yet the zenith of casuistry was from 1550 to 1650, when the Society of Jesus used <b>case-based</b> <b>reasoning,</b> {{particularly}} in administering the Sacrament of Penance (or [...] "confession"). The term casuistry quickly became pejorative with Blaise Pascal's {{attack on the}} misuse of casuistry. In Provincial Letters (1656–7) he scolded the Jesuits for using casuistic reasoning in confession to placate wealthy Church donors, while punishing poor penitents. Pascal charged that aristocratic penitents could confess their sins one day, re-commit the sin the next day, generously donate the following day, then return to re-confess their sins and only receive the lightest punishment; Pascal's criticisms darkened casuistry's reputation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Case-based</b> <b>Reasoning's</b> (CBR) origins were {{stimulated by}} a desire to {{understand}} how people remember information and are in turn reminded of information, and that subsequently it was recognized that people commonly solve problems by remembering how they solved similar problems in the past. Thus CBR became an appropriate way to find out the most suitable solution method for a new problem based on the old methods for the same or even similar problems. The research highlights how to use CBR to aid biologists in finding the best method to cryo preserve algae. The study found CBR could be used successfully to find the similarity percentage between the new algae and old cases in the case base. The prediction result showed approximately 93. 75 % accuracy, which proves the CBR system can offer appropriate recommendations for most situations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of cueing on {{learning}} transfer among pre-professional, health profession undergraduates engaged in a <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> exercise. Methods: The study design was a quasi-experimental, randomized post-test design. Volunteer undergraduate pre-professional health profession students (N = 192) were assigned to either an experimental group, which received two written clinical cases with cues or the control, which received the same cases, but no cues. After participants read the cases, a target case was provided for solution based on the previous cases. Target case solutions were scored by content experts for extent of transfer of a structural principle and optimal treatment method implicitly embedded in the comparison cases. Results: Cued participants (n = 98) demonstrated significantly more learning transfer (t (175. 91) = 2. 65; p =. 009; d =. 39) of the structural principle than non-cued participants (n = 94). However, no significant difference was found for cued and non-cued groups for transfer of the optimal treatment method (t (190) =. 874; p =. 39; and a small effect size (d =. 13) was present. Conclusion: Learning transfer improves among pre-professional health profession undergraduates when cued during a <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> experience. The findings support and extend previous multiple <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> study outcomes indicating that multiple patient cases with cueing should be utilized over single case examination with or without cueing to promote transfer of learning. Improvements in learning transfer may lead to improved quality of patient care...|$|R

40|$|Context. One of {{the most}} common {{instructional}} methods utilized in allied health and medical education to promote learning transfer is examination of a single patient case. However, in non-healthcare settings this practice has shown to be less effective in promoting learning than examination of multiple cases with cueing. Objectives. To examine the extent of learning transfer of cued versus non-cued pre-professional healthcare undergraduates engaged in a <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> exercise and to determine what factors may explain variance in transfer outcomes. Additionally, the outcomes of this study will provide the athletic training educator and ATEP administrators 2 ̆ 7 rationale and methods for implementing a <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> pedagogical approach to improve learning transfer. Method. Quasi-experimental randomized post-test design. Participants included 192 pre-professional undergraduates (83 men, 109 women; mean age = 19 y, range = 17 – 33 y, SD = 1. 73). Cued participants (n = 98) received written cues to compare two heat-illness cases for solution of a hypothermic case, whereas non-cued participants (n = 94) received no cueing. Independent-sample t-test analysis and effect size of mean difference was calculated to assess extent of transfer on a scale of 0 – 3 for cued and non-cued participants. Results. Cued participants (M = 230, SD =. 89) demonstrated significantly more transfer (t(175. 91) = 2. 65; p =. 009; CI 95 = (. 10, 0. 68); d =. 39) of the structural principle than non-cued participants (M = 2. 14, SD =. 86). There was no statistical difference in transfer of treatment method between cued (M = 1. 9, SD = 1. 14) and non-cued (M = 2. 03, SD =. 90) participants (t(190) =. 874; p =. 38; CI 95 = (− 0. 14, 0. 36); d =. 13). Conclusion. Learning transfer is improved among pre-professional undergraduate students during a <b>case-based</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> process when they are cued to look for the shared structural principle common to the worked cases. Students exposed to multiple case examination with cueing may be more apt to recall their learning and apply it when faced with novel cases in the clinical environment.

This paper {{presents}} an algorithm called IBP that combines <b>case-based</b> and model-based <b>reasoning</b> for an interpretive CBR application, predicting {{the outcome of}} legal cases. IBP uses a weak model of the domain to identify the issues raised in a case, and to combine the analyses for these issues; it reasons with cases to resolve conflicting evidence related to each issue. IBP reasons symbolically about the relevance of cases and uses evidential inferences. Experiments {{with a collection of}} historic cases show that IBP’s predictions are better than those made with its weak model or with cases alone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the extent to which the {{different}} teaching approaches applied in the Baccalaureus Curationis programme adequately prepare graduating learners for professional competence. The research methodology was a quantitative approach, based on descriptive research, with a clinical competence development model to guide the data collection procedure. The target population of the study included a sample of 250 learners in the four-year B. Cur programme, that extended from first-to-fourth-year. Stratified random sampling was applied to select the sample learners for this research and data were collected by means of a five-point Likert scale questionnaire. Data were organised and managed using the SAS statistical software package. Descriptive statistics were gathered with measures of central tendency and dispersion included, and their findings were illustrated on descriptive tables. A correlation technique was applied to determine the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The results of the study indicated that progression in competence did not occur as learners progressed through higher levels of their training, except during the third-year of study. However, the study’s results confirmed the strengths of the <b>Case-based</b> clinical <b>reasoning</b> approach to teaching and learning. This approach is able to combine the strengths of the traditional methods, which dealt with large class sizes and that had a focus on learner centred learning, with a focus on clinical practice. This approach provides realistic opportunities for learners to experiment with solutions to dilemmas encountered in real life situations, from the protected and safe environment of the classroom. The first-year learners who were observed in this study, who although novices, were exposed to Case-based teaching approaches and showed more self-perceived competence than learners in later years. This occurred in spite of the limited exposure of the first-year learners to real life clinical situations. The outcome of this study recommends that more studies are conducted, in the School of Nursing at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), to explore teaching and learning approaches that fully maximise the clinical and theoretical competencies of the learners. The outcome further recommends that learner-centred teaching approaches, such as Case-based method, are applied to all year levels of study in the B. Cur programme, due to its proven value when it was applied to first-year learners. The <b>Case-based</b> clinical <b>reasoning</b> approach to learning, that has been implemented at the school, promotes competence and self confidence in learners and has enhanced their sense of responsibility to be actively involved in their own learning. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{appropriately}} {{utilize the}} rapidly growing amount of data and information is a big challenge for people and organizations. Standard information retrieval methods, using sequential processing combined with syntax-based indexing and access methods, {{have not been able}} to adequately handle this problem. We are currently investigating a different approach, based on a combination of massive parallel processing with <b>case-based</b> (memory-based) <b>reasoning</b> methods. Given the problems of purely syntax-based retrieval methods, we suggest ways of incorporating general domain knowledge into memory-based reasoning. Our approach is related to the properties of the parallel processing microchip MS 160, particularly targeted at fast information retrieval from very large data sets. Within this framework different memory-based methods are studied, differing in the type and representation of cases, and in the way that the retrieval methods are supported by explicit general domain knowledge. Cases can be explicitly stored information retrieval episodes, virtually stored abstractions linked to document records, or merely the document records themselves. General domain knowledge can be a multi-relational semantic network, a set of term dependencies and relevances, or compiled into a global similarity metric. This paper presents the general framework, discusses the core issues involved, and describes three different methods illustrated by examples from the domain of medical diagnosis. 1...|$|R
