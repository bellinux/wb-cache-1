2500|$|The {{innermost}} {{of these}} are the Kuiper-belt objects, called [...] "objects" [...] partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets. They {{are thought to be}} predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids. Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei. (The much more distant Oort cloud is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) Other recent observations, such as the analysis of the <b>cometary</b> <b>dust</b> collected by the Stardust probe, are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids, suggesting [...] "a continuum between asteroids and comets" [...] rather than a sharp dividing line.|$|E

2500|$|Hoyle and Wickramasinghe {{have speculated}} that several {{outbreaks}} of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic, and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. [...] For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that <b>cometary</b> <b>dust</b> brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Hoyle also speculated that HIV came from outer space. After Hoyle's death, The Lancet published {{a letter to the}} editor from Wickramasinghe and two of his colleagues, in which they hypothesized that the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens. The Lancet subsequently published three responses to this letter, showing that the hypothesis was not evidence-based, and casting doubts on the quality of the experiments referenced by Wickramasinghe in his letter. A 2008 encyclopedia notes that [...] "Like other claims linking terrestrial disease to extraterrestrial pathogens, this proposal was rejected by the greater research community." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{the absence}} of {{supporting}} material in ice-core studies (such as the Greenland Dye-3 and Vostok cores) has removed any basis for the proposition of a global catastrophe of the proposed dimension within the later Holocene period. However, tree-ring expert Mike Baillie would give credit to Velikovsky after disallowing the impossible aspects of Worlds in Collision: [...] "However, I would not disagree with all aspects of Velikovsky's work. Velikovsky was almost certainly correct in his assertion that ancient texts hold clues to catastrophic events in the relatively recent past, within the span of human civilization, which involve the effects of comets, meteorites and <b>cometary</b> <b>dust...</b> But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets... He {{did not know about}} the hazard posed by relatively small objects... This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth... In other words, we can get down to his main thesis, which is that the Earth experienced dramatic events from heavenly bodies particularly in the second millennium BC." ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{results of}} Earth based {{observations}} and in situ measurements cometary nuclei are intensive sources {{of both the}} gaseous and the dusty matter. Investigations {{of the interaction between}} gas-dust <b>cometary</b> atmospheres and <b>dust</b> grains of the Zodiacal dust cloud reveals the presence of two principally possible mechanisms: meteor-like and explosive-type ones. The meteor-like mechanism is connected with bombardment of zodiacal <b>dust</b> particles by <b>cometary</b> molecules when the temperatures T = 2000 to 3000 K are developed. This mechanism can create over-saturated vapors of refractory elements (Fe, Si, C etc.) in cometary heads. The explosion-type mechanism is connected with high-velocity impacts between <b>cometary</b> and zodiacal <b>dust</b> particles resulting in the generation of high-temperature plasma (T = 10 (exp 5) to 10 (exp 7) K) and, hence, of x ray radiation and multicharged ions, i. e., with the processes not yet realized in the laboratory conditions...|$|R

40|$|Crystalline silicates {{identified}} in the laboratory examinations of <b>cometary</b> interplanetary <b>dust</b> particles, in Stardust particles, and in the IR spectra of comets and protoplanetary disks typically have high Mg and low Fe contents. In contrast, the amorphous silicates in IDPs and comets are predominantly Fe-rich. Mg-rich crystalline silicates are hypothesized to form by heating of amorphous silicates at temperatures above 1000 K. Annealing {{does not change the}} stoichiometry, i. e., the chemistry of the grains. Therefore, annealing is not expected to change an Fe-bearing amorphous silicate into a Mg-rich crystal. We discuss this challenge to the annealing scenario, review the condensation scenarios, and discuss the possibility that Fe reduction, a process thought to contribute in chondrule-formation, is the missing link between Fe-rich amorphous silicates and Mg rich crystalline silicates. We discuss the time scales for these processes in terms of time dependent 2 D models of disks (by Gail & collaborators) and in terms of shocks. We mention the Stardust sample return results on Mg-rich crystalline silicates...|$|R

40|$|Distinctive <b>cometary</b> {{components}} (<b>dust,</b> ions, and radicals) are studied on {{the basis}} of 2 D, narrow-band CCD images of Comet Wilson (1987 VII). The fact that Comet Wilson showed no significant structures in the neutral coma during its first perihelion passage is additional evidence for the hypothesis that dynamically new comets do not show a heterogeneous nucleus, but still have a relatively uniform surface. The deviations from the 1 /rho law for the decrease of surface brightness as a function of nuclear distance are explained by a combination of short-term variations in the dust production and the effects of solar radiation pressure. The C 2 production rate remains basically constant during the whole observational period, while the CN production rate decreases with increasing heliocentric distance. It is inferred that the formation of C 2 might be due both to photolytic destruction of some parent molecules as well as to chemical reactions between other species...|$|R
40|$|We have reexamined the {{arguments}} {{for the existence of}} liquid water on comets, and believe that recent cometary flybys along with pre-Giotto data support its presence on short-period comets. Liquid water would affect cometary dynamics, leaving distinct signatures in precession, orbital dynamics, and potential splitting of comets. Liquid water geysers would affect <b>cometary</b> atmosphere, <b>dust</b> evolution, and non-gravitational forces that perturb the orbit. Liquid water would affect the composition of both the interior and exterior of the comet, producing geologic effects consistent with recent flyby photographs. And most importantly, liquid water suppork the growth of lifeforms, which would make a comet a biofriendly incubator for interplanetary transport. The major objection against liquid water is the necessity of a pressure vessel to prevent sublimation into space. We discuss how such a pressure vessel could naturally evolve as a pristine comet makes its first journey inside the orbit of Mars, and suggest that this type of vessel was observed by Giotto, Deep Space I, and Stardust...|$|R

The activity persists for a month or several out of each 5-6 year orbit, and is presumably due to ice being uncovered by minor impacts in the last 100 to 1000 years.

30|$|As {{was shown}} in Fig. 2, there is a {{noticeable}} difference {{in the degree of}} linear polarization produced by the independently scattering particles and regoliths consisting of such particles. Therefore, the coincidence in the NPB of comets and C-type asteroids cannot be interpreted in terms of common properties of their dust particles. Moreover, the similarity in the polarization curves of comets and asteroids must testify to a large difference between <b>cometary</b> and as-teroidal <b>dust.</b> On the other hand, this conclusion is inconsistent with the well-established similarity between IDPs originating in comets and asteroids (e.g., Brownlee, 1985); so, the resemblance in the negative polarization of comets and asteroids needs to be re-examined.|$|R
