They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell <b>cytokine</b> secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell <b>cytokine</b> profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (<b>cytokine</b> response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
50|$|Part of the {{difficulty}} with distinguishing <b>cytokines</b> from hormones {{is that some of}} the immunomodulating effects of <b>cytokines</b> are systemic rather than local. For instance, to use hormone terminology, the action of <b>cytokines</b> may be autocrine or paracrine in chemotaxis or chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen. Further, as molecules, <b>cytokines</b> are not limited to their immunomodulatory role.|$|R
40|$|Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is {{characterized}} by multiple areas of inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration. Infiltrating Th 1 CD 4 + T cells secrete proinflammatory <b>cytokines.</b> They stimulate the release of some <b>cytokines,</b> expression of adhesion molecules and these <b>cytokines</b> may cause damage to the myelin sheath and axons. In this study, we analyzed plasma levels and gene expressions of five important <b>cytokines</b> in the new diagnosed MS Patients by ELISA and Real time PCR. PCR amplifications were performed to determine the IL- 17, IL- 23, IL- 10, IL- 27 and TGF-β mRNA expression levels using the SYBR Green PCR Kit. Our results showed significant decrease in IL- 10, IL- 27 and TGF-β {{but there was no}} significant difference in the IL- 17 and IL- 23 between patients and healthy controls. Altogether, our results indicated that dysregulation of <b>cytokines,</b> mainly increased expression of pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> and decreased expression of inhibitory <b>cytokines</b> occurred in MS patients. This study may shed light to the probable role of these <b>cytokines</b> in neurodegeneration mechanism and current or future use of <b>cytokines</b> in managing and treatment of multiple sclerosis...|$|R

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the <b>cytokine</b> TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
25|$|These <b>cytokine</b> {{factors are}} {{released}} into general circulation, where they {{migrate to the}} circumventricular organs of the brain due to easier absorption caused by the blood–brain barrier's reduced filtration action there.

40|$|The {{neoplastic}} Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) {{cells in}} Hodgkin's disease are surrounded in vivo by abundant reactive cells, {{the function of}} which may be attributed in part to their elaboration of various <b>cytokines.</b> Thus, a study of the interaction of H-RS cells with exogenous <b>cytokines</b> may provide information as to the mechanism of the clinical and histopathologic changes observed in Hodgkin's disease. This study examined the effect of various <b>cytokines,</b> and of phorbol ester (TPA) and retinoic acid, on the differentiation and proliferation of cultured H-RS cells (cell lines HDLM- 1 and KM-H 2). In addition, it was determined whether these cells were able to secrete <b>cytokines</b> after being treated with exogenous <b>cytokines.</b> The <b>cytokines</b> used included various types of interleukins (1, 2, and 3), colony-stimulating factors (GM, G, and M), interferons (alpha, beta, and gamma), and tumor necrosis factor (alpha). It was found that these <b>cytokines,</b> used alone or in combination, were not effective in modulating the proliferation and differentiation of cells, or the production of <b>cytokines,</b> in cultured H-RS cells. In contrast, this study revealed that retinoic acid can potentiate TPA-induced growth inhibition in cultured H-RS cells. Retinoic acid, when used alone, exhibited a minimal effect on cell differentiation. No synergistic effects of <b>cytokines</b> and retinoic acid on H-RS cells were observed. The failure of cultured H-RS cells to respond to exogenous <b>cytokines</b> suggests that, during the course of neoplastic transformation, of progression of disease, or of establishment of the cells in culture, H-RS cells lose their dependence on <b>cytokines,</b> although they retain the capacity to produce various <b>cytokines...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{interactions}} between cytokines from the Th1/Th2 {{model can be}} more complicated in some animals. For example, the Th2 <b>cytokine</b> IL-10 inhibits <b>cytokine</b> production of both Th subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and <b>cytokine</b> production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate plasma cells, ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the Th2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab (trade name Remicade, among others) is a mouse-human {{chimeric}} antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a <b>cytokine</b> in the inflammatory response.

30|$|Inflammation is an {{essential}} tool to defend oneself against infectious organisms. However, it becomes detrimental when it is prolonged or attacks self antigens. (Simi et al. 2007) After brain injury, pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> are quickly and extensively upregulated (Huang et al. 2006; Nilupul et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007). Pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> stimulate and aggravate the inflammatory response. The most prominent <b>cytokines</b> after brain injury are interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),and IL- 6 (Hossmann 2006; Lai and Todd 2006). On the other hand, anti-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> and reduce inflammation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL- 10 belong to this category and are most studied (Vitkovic et al. 2001). However, <b>cytokines</b> can not unequivocally be divided into pro- or anti-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> and may exert neurotoxic as well as neuroprotective effects (Sriram and O'Callaghan 2007; Kadhim et al. 2008). The balance between deleterious and beneficial effects of <b>cytokines</b> {{will depend on the}} physiological and biochemical context in the brain (Ceulemans et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|<b>Cytokines</b> are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} that regulates inflammation, cell signaling, and various cell processes such as growth and survival. Chemokines are a subset of <b>cytokines</b> that regulate cell migration, such as attracting immune cells to a site of infection or injury. Various cell types in the brain may produce <b>cytokines</b> and chemokines such as microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and other glial cells. Physiologically, chemokines and <b>cytokines</b> function as neuromodulators that regulate inflammation and development. In the healthy brain, cells secrete <b>cytokines</b> to produce a local inflammatory environment to recruit microglia and clear the infection or injury. However, in neuroinflammation, cells may have sustained release of <b>cytokines</b> and chemokines which may compromise the blood-brain barrier. Peripheral immune cells are called {{to the site of}} injury via these <b>cytokines</b> and may now migrate across the compromised blood brain barrier into the brain. Common <b>cytokines</b> produced in response to brain injury include: interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced during astrogliosis, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which can induce neuronal cytotoxicity. Although the pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> may cause cell death and secondary tissue damage, they are necessary to repair the damaged tissue. For example, TNF-α causes neurotoxicity at early stages of neuroinflammation, but contributes to tissue growth at later stages of inflammation.|$|R
