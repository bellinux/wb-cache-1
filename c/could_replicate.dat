The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> their studio sound. Lead guitarist Alan Kendall had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until Mr. Natural. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s. Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, harpsichord, electric piano, organ, mellotron and bass guitar, as well as mandolin and Moog synthesiser, now confined himself to bass onstage.|$|E

Harris strove to incorporate items of current interest to engage with the children and keep them interested in the show. Harris also recalled watching pop group, the Spice Girls, who she believed were dancing moves of a standard which preschoolers <b>could</b> <b>replicate.</b> The creators saw the need for [...] "life-affirming" [...] television for rapidly maturing preschoolers, and found that most children learned from shows which incorporated movement and song.|$|E
500|$|To test if the xx <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> {{their debut}} album's viral success, Young Turks' parent label XL Recordings {{approached}} technology companies {{and agreed to}} a deal with Microsoft to create a visualisation that could track sharing of the album's stream. The xx collaborated with designers from Internet Explorer and 9elements on the project. It was designed to show lines on a global map as Coexist is shared and was inspired by media artist Aaron Koblin's visualisation of flight patterns in the US. The album's stream was posted on a host site upon its release and shared with a fan in London through Facebook. The stream's host site crashed within 24 hours after the stream had been shared with millions of users. It subsequently reached social news site Reddit, where fans campaigned to share the album to every country possible. Label executive Adam Farrell of Beggars Group, Young Turks' distributor, cited it as [...] "one {{of the most significant}} album premieres we've ever done".|$|E

500|$|Louis Leterrier, {{who enjoyed}} the TV series {{as a child}} and liked the first film, had {{expressed}} interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation. Jon Favreau had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent. Leterrier's primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Hulk: Gray (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film. Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him, while Feige added the film would explore [...] "that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself". Arad also said the film would be [...] "a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross".|$|E
500|$|His {{early years}} in Philadelphia though were {{dominated}} by writing. Initially Evans intended to write a pamphlet to assist millers {{in the construction of}} milling machinery, as well as promoting his own automated designs. However, Evans became so engrossed in the project that he ultimately devoted several years to writing a comprehensive book on milling technology that included long chapters on the basic principles of physics, hydraulics and mechanics; at times neglecting his family's financial security in order to complete it. The Young Mill-wright and Miller's Guide when it appeared consisted of five parts: 'Principles of Mechanics and Hydraulics', 'Of the different Kinds of Mills', 'Description of the Author's Improvements', 'On the Manufacturing of Grain into Flour', 'Ellicott's Plans for Building Mills', and a lengthy appendix in which Evans detailed various ideas for other inventions, such as a hot-air system of central heating. Thomas Ellicott, whose family were early adopters of Evans's designs in Baltimore, contributed a section on mill construction. Much of the theoretical work of the book was based on earlier scientific work on mechanical principles, yet Evans insisted that theoretical sections align with observations in the practical sections, and hence often revised standing theories to comport with experiments he conducted and observations he made. For example, he found what was written on the theoretical mechanical principles of waterwheels did not match what he <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> in practice, so he revised them based on observation to form a [...] "true theory" [...] and concluded that [...] "neither the old or new theories agree with practice, therefore we must suspect that they are founded on error. But if, what I call the true theory, should continue to agree with practice, the practitioner need not care on what it is founded." ...|$|E

Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends and the waitress who lives across the hall. The role requires Parsons to [...] "rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows." [...] Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon's lines.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, modern marching {{bands are}} most {{commonly}} associated with performing during American football games. The oldest American college marching band, the University of Notre Dame Band of the Fighting Irish, was founded in 1845 and first performed at a football game in 1887. Many American universities had marching bands prior to the twentieth century, which were typically associated with military ROTC programs. In 1907, breaking from traditional rank and file marching, the first pictorial formation on a football field was the [...] "Block P" [...] created by Paul Spotts Emrick, director of the Purdue All-American Marching Band. Spotts had seen a flock of birds fly in a [...] "V" [...] formation and decided that a band <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> the action {{in the form of}} show formations on a field.

2500|$|Leone never {{intended}} to direct Duck, You Sucker!, and wanted the film to be directed by someone who <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> his visual style. Peter Bogdanovich, his original choice for director, soon abandoned the film due to perceived lack of control. Sam Peckinpah then agreed to direct the film after Bogdanovich's departure, only to be turned down for financial reasons by United Artists. Donati and Vincenzoni, noting the director's frequent embellishment of the facts concerning his films, claim that Peckinpah did not even consider it - Donati stated that Peckinpah was [...] "too shrewd to be produced by a fellow director". Leone then recruited his regular assistant director, Giancarlo Santi, to direct, with Leone supervising proceedings, and Santi was in charge for the first ten days of shooting. However, Rod Steiger refused to play his role as Juan unless Leone himself directed, and the producers pressured him into directing the film. Leone reluctantly agreed, and Santi was relegated to second unit work.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Broadchurch series two {{was shot}} on {{location}}. Chibnall felt location shooting {{was critical to}} the mood and tone of series two, {{much as it was}} for series one. While many crime dramas are shot in gritty, urban locations, Chibnall believed that the bucolic Jurassic Coast setting signalled to viewers that Broadchurch was not a typical detective programme. Producer Richard Stokes said that the Dorset area provided [...] "that sense of the extraordinary, [...] the tragic and the terrible [...] happen in a rather beautiful and moving environment." [...] Early in the pre-production process, the producers and location managers discussed filming in locations other than Dorset. Among the areas considered were cliff locations near Bristol; Essex; Hastings in East Sussex; Kent; and Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. But the producers felt none of the locations <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> the look of the Jurassic Coast, {{and the quality of the}} light in each area was different than in Dorset.|$|E

2500|$|However, Aderca {{was also}} {{inclined}} {{to question the}} absolute validity of synchronistic tenets: suggesting that the pursuit of innovation as a goal could prove undermine a one's originality, he cautioned that such imperatives <b>could</b> <b>replicate</b> {{the negative consequences of}} public commands. His belief that formal conventions needed to be questioned whenever necessary was nuanced by Lovinescu, who replied that good literature could still be conventional in style. Aderca also fell short of Lovinescu's principles about Romanian novelists eventually needing to discard lyricism for an objective approach to writing. An additional debate came in 1937, when Aderca, writing for Adevărul, rebuked Lovinescu for having ignored the contributions of Urmuz, [...] "the extraordinary, peculiar, unique and brilliant [...] ". Aderca, seen by Cernat as one of several modern Romanian poets who took on the offices of critics while rejecting all displays of critical authority, took a stand against all academic intervention in the area of literature. He described such intrusions as restrictive, compared professional critics to barbers, and argued that critical empathy was more desirable than theoretical purism. His Mic tratat declared itself interested in what [...] "the aesthetic phenomenon" [...] was not, rather than what it was. It ridiculed the various schools of interpretation, stating Aderca's regret at ever having contributed to literary criticism.|$|E
