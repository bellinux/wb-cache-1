40|$|THE IMPACT OF EDUCATION MODEL “GI-PSI-SEHAT” (NUTRITIONPSYCHOSOSIAL-HEALTH) FOR MOTHER ON FOOD CONSUMPTION AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN UNDER TWO YEAR The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and to analyze the education wholistic model (NutritionPsychosocial-Health) in order to build good food consumption pattern for children through the improvement of mother’s behaviour. A quasi experiment, nonrandomized control group pretest -posttest design study, of the impact of the education model “GI-PSI-SEHAT” (NutritionPsychosocial-Health) has been carried out at urban area in Bogor, West Java. The total of respondent are 131 primiparous mothers of children of 0 - 11 months, who are selected by purposive sampling technique, which consist of 66 mothers in control group and 65 mothers in intervention group, who participated in the intervention programme. During five months, education model “GI-PSI-SEHAT” was conducted by face to face method, in groups or individually, with combination of teaching techniques i. e. speech, discussion, simulation, practical and home visit. Teaching aids i. e. booklets, flip-chart, food-models, and real things was used in order to increase the effectiveness of the programme. The study reveals that the intervention of “GI-PSI-SEHAT” improves food consumption pattern, whether in punctuality, food diversification, or the frequency of food consumption. In eight months time, the intervention enable the increase of the Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) as an overall measure of the nutrient adequacy. The impact of the intervention of “GI-PSI-SEHAT” is decrease of z-score of weight-for-age and height-for-age of the intervention group is lower than the control group, especially for children under 12 month. Classification and regression tree statistical analysis demonstrated that independent variables have strong association with response variables. Nutritional status of mother based on Body Mass Index (BMI) is the dominant variable associated with nutritional status of children based on z-score of weight for age, on the other hand Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) is the dominant variable associated with nutritional status of children based on z-score of height for age. Wholistic education model “GI-PSI-SEHAT” for mothers with some modification may applicable at another area, especially for community with low education level.

40|$|RevueEating is {{essential}} for survival, and we are born well equipped to ensure proper food ingestion. However, learning to eat has to occur quickly, because the mode of feeding evolves dramatically during {{the first years of}} life, from tube <b>feeding</b> to family <b>foods,</b> through milk and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Moreover, <b>food</b> likes and dislikes are not inborn, except the enjoyment of the sweet taste: food preferences are learned, essentially during the first years of life. Eating habits established during early years will {{contribute to the development of}} subsequent eating habits. For this reason, it is fundamental to understand the most important early periods for the development of eating habits and the drivers of this development. The role of pleasure in eating is central, especially during childhood when cognitive drivers of food choices may be less prominent than during later stages in life. We will describe that food sensory properties, food rewarding properties and context of eating contribute to drive eating in the youngest and contribute to learnt preferences through experience. The learning process of food likes may start during pregnancy and lactation, through the exposure of the infant to flavours from the mother’s diet. Beyond these first flavour discoveries, the most important phase for learning to eat is likely to be the transition from milk feeding to a diversified diet, i. e. the beginning of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> At this moment, infants start to discover the sensory (texture, taste and flavour) and nutritional properties (energy density) of the foods that will ultimately compose their adult diet, and parents are still in charge of providing appropriate foods, timing, context for eating. Infants learn concurrently food taste and energy density, which contribute to shape their ability to control food intake, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view...|$|R

Methods: Descriptive study with a qualitative approach, {{developed in a}} Primary Health Unit located {{in the city of}} Maranguape-CE, with 14 first-time mothers of children aged 6 to 24 months, who were receiving <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> and were resident in the District of Tabatinga between the months of July and October 2009, through participant observation and semi-structured interview. After reading, careful description of the interviews and classification of speech, the following categories emerged: <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> and breastfeeding; <b>food</b> offered to children; and determinants of the healthy infant feeding. Results: Although mothers have basics knowledge of how a healthy diet should be, they continued introducing harmful foods to children, showing lack of control over food education. Mothers are aware that feeding the child could be based on nutritious foods; nevertheless, they prefer choosing those that feature ease of supply. Conclusion: The introduction of new foods was performed incorrectly and nutritional quality is inadequate for children. The mother appears in charge of the child development; however, for this process to be successful, she must become conscious of this subject, since a healthy diet directly influences the child’s organism, as it acts in all body systems...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Food {{insecurity}} may {{be associated}} with poor nutrition, which in turn can increase the risk of adverse nutrition and health outcomes among infants and toddlers. This study was undertaken in 2008 to gain an insight of mothers' views on <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> practices and <b>food</b> security. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, data were collected through 10 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with groups of mothers who had under two-year-old children in the urban areas of Damavand (7 FGDs; n= 51) and Varamin (3 FGDs; n= 29). Each FGD was held {{in the presence of a}} moderator, two note takers, and an observer. All notes were collected, and the emerging themes were reported. Results: In the study, nine general themes were identified: 1) The mothers viewed adequate food as a food, which is useful for health in both quality and quantity; 2) Households have limited access to adequate food because they cannot afford it; 3) In hard situations, household’s strategies are: changing the type and amount of food, and buying cheaper foods; 4) In case of poverty, mothers abstain from eating to save food for their children; 5) The mothers viewed <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> as soft, simple and light foods, which are especially made for children; 6) The best time for introducing <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> was 6 months of age; 7) There were no complementary local foods in the region; 8) For under one-year-old children, a different type of food was separately prepared; 9) Home-made complementary food was preferred over the readymade type. Conclusions: Despite mothers' sufficient knowledge about the advantages of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> the majority of them had not good performance. This qualitative study provides a foundation and valuable information for future studies on the nutritional health of children in food insecure households.

40|$|This {{position}} paper on <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> summarizes evidence for {{health effects of}} complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. <b>Complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> (ie, solid <b>foods</b> and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants considered at increased brisk {{for the development of}} allergy or in those not considered to be at increased risk. During the <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> period, > 90 % of the iron requirements of a breast-fed infant must be met by complementary foods, which should provide sufficient bioavailable iron. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron and should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, although small volumes may be added to complementary foods. It is prudent to avoid both early (= 7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, inasmuch as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Infants and young children receiving a vegetarian diet should receive a sufficient amount (similar to 500 mL) of breast milk or formula and dairy products. Infants and young children should not be fed a vegan diet. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Arguably, the most influential has been the 2008 commentary of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition, which recommended that complementary foods should be introduced to all infants between 17 and 26 weeks. We challenge the validity of ESPGHAN’s position, questioning {{the adequacy of the}} literature search, the interpretation and evidence used to reach their conclusions and the balance of an approach that focuses on disease prevention, with scant consideration of growth and neuromotor development. We contend that ESPGHAN’s position should be understood as an expert opinion that may be influenced by conflicts of interest. In our view, the ESPGHAN position paper is not evidence based and does not justify a change of the current public health recommendation for 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. At an individual level, health professionals should understand that developmental readiness for starting solid foods has an age range like other developmental milestones; that fewer infants will probably be ready to start <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> before, rather than after, 6 months; and that their role is to equip parents with the confidence and skills to recognise the signs of developmental readiness.

40|$|<b>Complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> {{is central}} to an infant’s growth and development. There are two main {{approaches}} to complementary feeding: baby-led and traditional. The baby-led approach allows the infant to <b>feed</b> themselves solid <b>foods</b> during the family mealtime. The traditional approach involves parents feeding the infant pureed foods. This study aimed to explore mothers’ approaches to and experiences with <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Thirteen mothers completed the two-phase study, ﬁrst utilising photo-voice to collect photographs of their <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> experience, followed by participating in a focus group. Focus groups were segregated according to <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> approach (baby-led or traditional) based on content analysis of participant photographs and were audio-taped and transcribed. Interpretive thematic analysis of the baby-led and traditional transcripts occurred separately, then compared for similar and divergent themes. Four main themes emerged: (1) Infant centred complementary feeding; (2) Mother centred complementary feeding; (3) Redeﬁning the baby-led approach; and (4) Research and advice. While mothers adopting both approaches discussed all themes; those using a baby-led approach discussed the infant centred <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> theme further.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> and associated factors among mothers with children aged 6 – 23 months in Lalibela District. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 01 to April 29, 2015. Four hundred twenty-one mother-child pairs were selected by the systematic random sampling technique. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95  % Confidence Interval (CI) was computed to assess the strength of association, and variables with a P-value of < 0. 05 were considered as statistically significant in the multivariable analysis. Results The study demonstrated that, the prevalence of timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> was 63  %. In addition, mother’s education [AOR[*]=[*] 4. 33, 95  % CI: 1. 99, 9. 40], antenatal care follow up [AOR[*]=[*] 5. 90, 95  % CI: 2. 45, 14. 21], and institutional delivery [AOR[*]=[*] 2. 54, 95  % CI: 1. 33, 4. 82] were found key determinants of timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Conclusion In this community, timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> was lower than the World Health Organization cut-off point for good practice of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Therefore, intensifying utilization of antenatal care and institutional delivery helps to improve the coverage of timely initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Furthermore, the focus needs to be on uneducated women...|$|R

40|$|Background In term infants, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that early <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Therefore, timely introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> during infancy is necessary. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) both developed recommendations for the start of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> for term-born infants. However, these guidelines cannot be directly translated to preterm infants. Recent literature looking at the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> in preterm infants gives contrasting information. Given these contrasting reports on the introduction of solid foods in premature born infants, a systematic review is needed. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of the time starting <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> on overweight (including obesity) in preterm infants. Methods An electronic systematic literature search with pre-defined terms will be conducted in Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL. There will be no restriction for time period. Primarily, data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be included in this systematic review. Search terms will include preterm infants, <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> overweight, and their synonyms. Article selection, including risk of bias assessment, will be performed by three reviewers independently. Body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS or BMI-Z-score) will be used to compare studies.

Meanwhile, the age of first administration of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> the texture of foods, the variation of foods and a portion of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> were not associated with nutritional status children aged 12 - 24 months. Conclusion: Advice can be given that mothers who have children 6 - 24 months should give more attention to the provision of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> in accordance with the recommended WHO through counseling, information, education and communication related nutrition and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> practices of infants and children...|$|R
40|$|In term infants, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that early <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Therefore, timely introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> during infancy is necessary. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) both developed recommendations for the start of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> for term-born infants. However, these guidelines cannot be directly translated to preterm infants. Recent literature looking at the introduction of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> in preterm infants gives contrasting information. Given these contrasting reports on the introduction of solid foods in premature born infants, a systematic review is needed. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of the time starting <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> on overweight (including obesity) in preterm infants. An electronic systematic literature search with pre-defined terms will be conducted in Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL. There will be no restriction for time period. Primarily, data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be included in this systematic review. Search terms will include preterm infants, <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> overweight, and their synonyms. Article selection, including risk of bias assessment, will be performed by three reviewers independently. Body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS or BMI-Z-score) will be used to compare studies. The consistency of results across the studies will influence the decision whether or not to combine results in a meta-analysis. Studies that cannot be included in the meta-analysis will be described in a narrative analysis. This systematic review will give an overview of the existing knowledge on the timing of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> in preterm infants and the effect on overweight. It will form a basis for future guidelines for <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> for preterm infants. PROSPERO CRD 4201501421...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intervention {{targeting}} exclusive breastfeeding and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> has {{the greatest}} impact on child survival. In view of these facts a formative research was conducted in rural Varanasi with objectives -To assess the status of IYCF practices prevailing in the experimental area and to demonstrate the effect of intervention among selected mothers for improved IYCF practices. Methodology: Follow up intervention study, on 2 types of cohort (0 - 6 and 7 - 36 months old mother & child pair) conducted for the period of November 2011 - October 2012.   Cohorts were followed for a period of 3 months, using a formative research methodology. A total of 293 mother & child pair were enrolled for intervention using appropriate sampling methodology. WHO Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) and a child feeding index (CFI) were created. The latter consisted of five components: breastfeeding, use of bottle, dietary diversity, food frequency and meal frequency which were adjusted for three age groups: 7 - 24 and 25 - 36 months Results: There was inadequacy of optimal breastfeeding and sub optimal Practice regarding <b>Complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Measurement of anthropometric Indies indicates that 46. 7 % were stunted, 35. 5 % are wasted and 29. 6 % are underweight. Inferential analysis for Difference in exclusive breast <b>feeding</b> and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> Index during pre and post TIPs intervention phase indicated a significant (p= 0. 001) change in exclusive breast and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Conclusion: Study indicated, it is possible to change short-term child-feeding behaviours to promote exclusive breast <b>feeding</b> and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> using TIPs methodology. However, long-term sustainability of these changes requires further study, and the effect of increased <b>feeding</b> of <b>complementary</b> <b>foods,</b> intakes of breast milk and total daily consumption of energy & nutrients requires further research. </p...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundInfants {{and young}} {{children}} are at an increased risk ofmalnutrition from six months of age onwards, when breastmilk alone is no longer sufficient to meet all their nutritionalrequirements and <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> should bestarted. Hence this study was undertaken to assess thepractices of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> MethodThis hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted attwo private hospitals – Dr TMA Pai Hospital Udupi and DrTMA Pai Hospital Karkala and a public hospital, RegionalAdvanced Paediatric Care Centre, Mangalore, of coastalsouth India for a two-month period from August 2010 toOctober 2010. Two-hundred mothers of children betweensix months and two years attending the paediatricoutpatient departments of the above-mentioned hospitalsfor growth monitoring, immunisation and minor illnessessuch as upper respiratory tract infections were selected forthe study. The subjects were selected for the study by theorder of their arrival to the outpatient department duringthe study period. ResultsIn the present study 77. 5 % mothers had startedcomplementary feeding at the recommended time of sixmonths. Only 32 % of mothers were giving an adequatequantity of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeds.</b> The association ofinitiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> with socio-economicstatus, birth order, place of delivery and maternal educationwas found to be statistically significant. However thepractice of giving an adequate quantity of complementaryfeeds was significantly associated only with the place ofdelivery. ConclusionIn the present study, initiation of <b>complementary</b> <b>feeding</b> atthe recommended time of six months was seen in themajority of children. However the quantity ofcomplementary feeding was insufficient.
