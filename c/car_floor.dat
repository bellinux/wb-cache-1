25|$|The Red Line, Blue Line, and Orange Line run {{rapid transit}} cars and use {{stations}} with high platforms {{level with the}} <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> providing easy access for the disabled. The Green Line is a trolley/streetcar line and has {{used a variety of}} streetcars.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA has {{followed}} the worldwide trend of operating low-floor streetcars. As an ongoing project, not complete in 2012, platforms are being raised slightly to about {{the height of a}} street curb. Low-floor cars have remotely controlled bridge plates at the center doors to allow wheelchairs and strollers to reach the <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> a few inches higher.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2002, Ayat al-Akhras {{was driven}} to the Kiryat HaYovel {{supermarket}} in Jerusalem by the recently recruited Tanzim member Ibrahim Sarahne, who had once worked in the supermarket. The neighborhood {{is home to a}} mostly young population, young couples, students at the Ein Kerem medical campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, professors and teachers. The two crossed an Israeli checkpoint with the bomb in a bag on the <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> at Akhras' feet.|$|E

25|$|Short {{platforms}} {{level with}} <b>car</b> <b>floors,</b> accessed by ramps, were installed just {{before or after}} selected stations. Because the car door arrangement required a large gap between the platform and the car, a bridge plate attached to the raised platform had to be positioned after the train stopped with a door at that platform.|$|R
25|$|Only {{emergency}} and police vehicle may use blue lights. This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units. All {{other kinds of}} blue lights (e.g. <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> lighting or cab interior lights) are illegal on public roads. Flashing blue lights and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of {{emergency and}} order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. Blue lights alone {{may be used to}} secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|It {{features}} accessible low platforms {{that match}} the 350mm high <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> or tram {{stops at the}} same height as the pavement. Much of the track is dedicated tramway, with some sections shared with other road vehicles, including some of the same roads served by the previous generation of tram. [...] The off-street track includes new rights-of-way, adapted former railway lines and one section running alongside a Network Rail line. [...] Part of the formation between Mitcham and Hackbridge was originally used by the Surrey Iron Railway, the world's first public railway, authorised by Act of Parliament in 1803.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} height measurements above the railhead: platform height, traditional floor height, downstairs floor height and upstairs floor height. Platform height determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Platform height is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> height matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest floor height is primarily {{determined by the}} thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest floor height is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry floor height must match the platform height. Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs floor height already matches the platform height. Despite the name [...] "bilevel" [...] or [...] "double-decker", for maximum compatibility the rail car will have up to four different floor heights. High platform design (Using outside steps to avoid having a level entry from the platform) is troublesome.|$|E
50|$|The Watford Joint Tube Stock {{was built}} for the service to Watford along both the Bakerloo tube and the London North Western Railway. As a result, the cars were owned by both the Underground and the London North Western Railway. To be able to operate on both lines, the <b>car</b> <b>floors</b> were 4.5 in higher than other tube cars. This was a {{compromise}} height between the platform heights on the two lines.|$|R
5|$|Readville {{station is}} fully {{handicapped}} accessible, although accessible routes are only {{available from the}} Hyde Park Avenue entrance. Every platform includes a 1-car length ("mini-high") high-level platform, which allows passengers to board level with the train <b>car</b> <b>floors.</b> The platforms are all connected by a system of pedestrian bridges which include accessible ramps. , the MBTA is considering the addition of elevators to supplement the ramps and add an accessible route to the Milton Street parking lot.|$|R

2500|$|The Askin Government {{was sworn}} in by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Eric Woodward, on 13 May at Government House. [...] It {{was the first to}} be headed by the Liberal Party since the main non-Labor party in the state adopted the Liberal banner; being one of only three Liberals to win power from Labor, and the only of that three not to have his tenure ended by an ICAC hearing. [...] Askin, who served as his own Treasurer, heavily {{involved}} himself in the business of Government, while also maintaining a range of social agendas and regular outings to the racetrack or Rugby League games. One of the privileges of office was the access to a Ministerial car and personal driver, which became particularly important for Askin, who did not drive. On one occasion when Askin was supposed to drive a new Holden from the factory assembly line during a visit, Askin arranged for his driver, Russ Ferguson, to be hidden on the <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> working the controls while Askin held the wheel.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dome car}} can include {{features}} of a lounge car, dining car, and an observation car. [...] Within the United States, the primary manufacturers were The Budd Co.(Stainless Steel construction), The Pullman Co (Steel construction), and ACF(American Car & Foundry. Aluminum construction). [...] A portion of the car, usually in the center, is split between two levels, with stairs leading both up and down from the train's regular passenger <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> level. [...] The lower level of the dome usually consisted of a small lounge area, while the upper portion was usually coach or lounge seating within a [...] "bubble" [...] of glass on the car's roof. [...] Budd Co. dome cars used curved class, whereas Pullman company cars used flat panels of glass that were positioned at different angles above the roofline. [...] Passengers in the upper portion of the dome {{were able to see}} in all directions from a vantage point above the train's roof line. [...] On some dome cars, the lower portion was built as a galley, where car attendants used dumbwaiters to transfer items between the galley and a dining area in the dome portion of the car(within the USA, the Union Pacific, prior to Amtrak, was the primary owner/user of 'dome dining cars.')

The <b>car's</b> <b>floor</b> mats were found in the trunk of the car, where owners had been advised to put them as part of the recall. According to the police report, the driver {{suffered}} from epilepsy, but investigators could not rule out either a vehicle defect or the possibility that the driver had suffered a seizure.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} passenger accommodation, {{almost all}} electrical equipment is mounted {{either on the}} roof (pantograph) or under the <b>car</b> <b>floors</b> (starting resistors, compressors, etc.) All underfloor equipment is enclosed in cabinets with removable spring-latched access panels {{to protect it from}} blowing dust and snow. Some of the auxiliary equipment (including some high-voltage equipment such as the electric meter) is placed in cabinets inside car vestibules. Control equipment is concentrated in the engineer's cab. Numerous changes were made during the production run (see below), which caused variations in equipment layout.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{original}} 1976 Marriott's Great America ride, Rue Le Dodge, {{is known}} as the world's largest operating bumper <b>car</b> <b>floor.</b> An exact copy of the ride under the same name opened at California's Great America in Santa Clara, California. In 2005, however, its bumper <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> became a one-way traffic ride (as most bumper car floors have started doing). To determine the flow of traffic, a concrete island was added {{to the center of the}} floor, removing floor space. This left Rue Le Dodge at present-day Six Flags Great America as the largest operating bumper <b>car</b> <b>floor</b> in the world. The floor currently sits at 51 feet 9 inches × 124’9" [...] or 6455 sq ft. Six Flags Great Adventure's Autobahn is the largest bumper <b>car</b> <b>floor,</b> but it has not operated since 2008.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{the car had}} one difference, {{which was}} focused on the rear {{so-called}} 'double-decker diffuser'. The diffuser is {{at the rear of the}} car and is a route to get downforce by using the airflow under the <b>car's</b> <b>floor.</b> The BGP 001 had a different central channel to its diffuser with the shape of the structure being used to create advanced type of double-decker design. The diffuser's controversial aspect was the hole in the rear which increases the speed of airflow as it heads towards the higher rear venturi section, where it expands and creates more downforce. Other teams argued that the presence of the hole is against the regulations.|$|R
25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the <b>car's</b> <b>floor</b> level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|R
