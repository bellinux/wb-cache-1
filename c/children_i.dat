5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. I still live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact with the <b>children.</b> <b>I</b> want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Testament of Gad {{begins with}} Gad's hatred for Joseph. Chapter 2 begins with Gad talking about loving one another. He says 'and now, my <b>children,</b> <b>I</b> exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love'. The moral of Gad {{is to not}} hate one another and love all your brethren.|$|E
25|$|I {{really do}} not think that we should have homosexuals guiding our <b>children.</b> <b>I</b> think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize a lot of people do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill <b>children,</b> <b>I</b> believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|These is {{the only}} <b>children</b> <b>I</b> have as Citizens of this Nation, and as the time I may be called to die is uncertain, My desire is to have them as free {{citizens}} of this nation. Knowing what property I may have, is to be divided amongst the Best of my friends, how can I think of them having bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh to be called their property, and this by my imprudent conduct, and {{for them and their}} offspring to suffer for generations yet unborn, is a thought too great a magnitude for me to remain silent any longer.|$|E
25|$|My beloved <b>children,</b> <b>I</b> do {{not know}} what you await to shake off the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2007, Cant {{was named}} as the best-loved voice from UK children's television, {{in a poll}} of over 1,200 people for Underground Ernie magazine. Cant came ahead of Bagpuss and Ivor the Engine narrator Oliver Postgate in second place, with David Jason (Danger Mouse) polling third. On 28 November 2010, he {{received}} the special award at the Children's BAFTAs {{for his work in}} children's television. [...] During his acceptance speech he said, [...] "When <b>I</b> was a <b>child</b> <b>I</b> spake as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> understood as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> thought as a <b>child.</b> When <b>I</b> became a man I spake as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> understood as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> thought as a child, and they paid me for it...!" ...|$|R

500|$|... "My kids don't call me Mom because I don't {{want them}} to. They're Michael's {{children}}. It's {{not that they}} are not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father. People make remarks, 'I can't believe she left her children.' Left them? I left my <b>children?</b> <b>I</b> did not leave my children. My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be. I didn't do it to be a mother... If he called me tonight and said let's have five more , I'd do it in a heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} Kirchherr and {{business}} partner Krüger have operated the K photography shop in Hamburg, offering custom vintage prints, books and artwork for sale.

5000|$|Although {{the setting}} is classical, the address to the Judaeo-Christian god is {{suggested}} by the section beginning [...] "" [...] ("When I was a child"): the use of [...] is distinctive, and by it Goethe evokes the Lutheran translation of Saint Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, 13:11: [...] "" [...] ("When <b>I</b> was a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> spoke as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> understood as a <b>child,</b> <b>I</b> thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things").

500|$|... "I haven't {{really been}} focused {{as much as}} I {{should be on the}} music part of my career because this movie has just {{consumed}} every inch of me. Between that and my four <b>children,</b> <b>I</b> don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1991, Gore {{announced}} that his son's accident {{was a factor}} in his decision not to run for president during the 1992 presidential election. Gore stated: [...] "I would like to be President. But I am also a father, and I feel deeply about my responsibility to my <b>children.</b> <b>I</b> didn't feel right about tearing myself away from my family to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign." [...] During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text which became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You touch my <b>children,</b> <b>I</b> will kill you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective {{of the things she}} has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her main concern is Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it {{is the best way to}} look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E

[...] Quebec's Governor Frederick Haldimand was so upset at Butler's inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing [...] "such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting." [...] Butler continued to insist in later writings that he was not at fault for the events of the day.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for <b>children.</b> <b>I</b> can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
