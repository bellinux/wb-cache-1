5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original <b>cultivator,</b> but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled {{on the wall of}} the village school.|$|E

5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura <b>Cultivator</b> praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it {{was as good as}} anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would be welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the genesis of the {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and <b>cultivator</b> of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|The Land Estates Act of 1908 {{was passed}} by the Madras Government in order to protect {{cultivators}} in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent occupants of the land. However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the <b>cultivator</b> to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal serfdom. In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.|$|E
40|$|In Suriname, the Maroons have practiced {{shifting}} cultivation for generations, {{but now the}} increasing influence of modern society is causing a trend of decreasing fallow periods with potentially adverse effects for the vulnerable tropical soils. Adoption of appropriate soil fertility management (SFM) practices is currently slow. Combining methods from cultural ecology and environmental psychology, this study identifies two groups with divergent behavioral intentions which we term semi-permanent <b>cultivators</b> and shifting <b>cultivators.</b> Semi-permanent <b>cultivators</b> intend to practice more permanent agriculture and experiment individually with plot-level SFM. Shifting <b>cultivators</b> rely on traditional knowledge that is not adequate for their reduced fallow periods, but perceive constraints that prevent them practicing more permanent agriculture. Semi-permanent <b>cultivators</b> act as a strong reference group setting a subjective norm, yet feel no need to exchange knowledge with shifting <b>cultivators</b> who {{are in danger of}} feeling marginalized. Drawing on a political ecology perspective, we conclude that cultural ecological knowledge declined due to negative perceptions of external actors setting a strong subjective norm. Semi-permanent <b>cultivators</b> who wish to enter the market economy are most likely to adopt SFM. We conclude that any future SFM intervention must be based on an in-depth understanding of each group’s behavior, in order to avoid exacerbating processes of marginalization...|$|R

5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average <b>cultivator,</b> the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E
25|$|In froth flotation, the <b>cultivator</b> aerates {{the water}} into a froth, and then skims the algae from the top.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, mixed algae {{cultures}} {{can work}} well for larval mollusks. First, the <b>cultivator</b> filters the sea water to remove algae which are too large for the larvae to eat. Next, the <b>cultivator</b> adds nutrients and possibly aerates the result. After {{one or two days}} in a greenhouse or outdoors, the resulting thin soup of mixed algae is ready for the larvae. An advantage of this method is low maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{modification}} of a plant's growth habit is called training. Indoor <b>cultivators</b> employ many training techniques to encourage shorter plants and denser canopy growth.

25|$|Oysters {{have been}} cultured {{for well over}} a century. The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) is {{presently}} the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form 'seed oysters'. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the <b>cultivator</b> putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or rack to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Many Japanese {{settlers}} {{were interested}} in acquiring agricultural land in Korea even before Japanese land ownership was officially legalized in 1906. Governor-General Terauchi Masatake facilitated settlement through land reform, which initially proved popular {{with most of the}} Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a system of absentee landlords, only partial owner-tenants and cultivators with traditional (but no legal proof of) ownership. Terauchi's new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof (deeds, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation; these turned out to be mostly high-class and impartial owners who had only traditional verbal <b>cultivator</b> rights. Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations such as the Oriental Development Company. Many former Korean landowners, as well as agricultural workers, became tenant farmers, having lost their entitlements almost overnight.|$|E
25|$|An elderly <b>cultivator,</b> {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, almost {{as if she were a}} servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E
