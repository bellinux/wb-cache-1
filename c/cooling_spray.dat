40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and John Mitchell. The performance of the condenser cooling cycle of a steam cycle power plant is examined for the Columbia Generating Station of the Wisconsin Power & Light Company located near Portage, Wisconsin. The Columbia station is a coal fired power plant with a capacity of 1000 MW. A closed circuit cooling system is used for heat rejection that consists of a cooling pond and two cooling towers. Pond and towers are connected in a parallel arrangement. To study {{the behavior of the}} cooling system, computer models of the components are developed. The cooling tower model is based on the analogy approach of a cooling tower and an heat exchanger. An effectiveness-Ntu method is employed to predict the cooling tower performance with respect to ambient and load conditions. For the calculation of cooling capacity of the cooling pond surface, a semi-empirical approach is selected that is based on the combination of free and forced convection. The water flow in the pond is approximated by a plug flow model. From the energy transfer and flow model a simulation program is developed that is capable of predicting cooling pond temperatures dependent on meteorological conditions and heat load on the pond. The possibility of adding different cooling devices to the system is examined. A simple model of an atmospheric <b>cooling</b> <b>spray</b> is employed. A comparison between cooling tower and <b>cooling</b> <b>spray</b> performance is performed to study if the addition of a <b>cooling</b> <b>spray</b> can be an advantage for the system performance. The impact of dredging the pond to a greater depth is evaluated. To link the cooling system to the steam cycle performance a condenser model is introduced that predicts the condenser back pressure for a given circulating water temperature and plant iv load. From an empirical relation the influence of condenser back pressure on the steam cycle heat rate is determined. The performance of the cooling system is then evaluated economically. The modular system simulation program TRNSYS is used to analyze the behavior of the cooling system in combination with the power generation unit. Transient simulations are performed in hourly time steps to examine the impact of weather conditions on the whole system and to study diurnal fluctuations. A simulation program usable by the plant operators is a product of this work.

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of the sizes and the velocities of droplets relies upon widespread and well-established techniques, but characterizing their temperature and their composition remains challenging. The lack of standard methods is particularly detrimental, {{given the importance of}} these parameters for validating models and numerical simulations of many spray processes. Heat and mass transfers are dominant aspects in applications such as spray combustion in IC engines, spray <b>cooling,</b> <b>spray</b> drying, wet scrubbers in which liquid sprays capture gas pollutants and also the preparation of nanoparticles via spray route. This paper provides a review of the main techniques available to optically measure the temperature and chemical compositions of single droplets and sprays. Most of these techniques are based on phenomena related to light interaction with matter. Photoluminescence processes like fluorescence and phosphorescence have temperature and composition dependences which can be exploited, while other methods rely on light scattering by the droplets. In particular, the angular position of the rainbow is very sensitive to the refractive index and then to both the temperature and composition. Less widely used diagnostic methods include Raman scattering, thermochromic liquid crystals, thermographic phosphors, infrared thermography, morphology-dependent resonances and their subsequent effects on the stimulated emission of dye molecules. In this review, the emphasis is mainly placed on two groups of techniques—methods based on laser-induced fluorescence and those based on light scattering—but details about alternative methods will be also provided.

The purpose of encapsulation is often to stabilize an active ingredient, control its release rate and/or convert a liquid formulation into a solid which is easier to handle. A range of edible materials {{can be used as}} shell materials of encapsulates, including polysaccharides, fats, waxes and proteins (see Chap. 3 of this book). Encapsulates for typical industrial applications can vary from several microns to several millimetres in diameter although there is an increasing interest in preparing nano-encapsulates. Encapsulates are basically particles with a core-shell structure, but some of them can have a more complex structure, e. g. in a form of multiple cores embedded in a matrix. Particles have physical, mechanical and structural properties, including particle size, size distribution, morphology, surface charge, wall thickness, mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, degree of crystallinity, flowability and permeability. Information about the properties of encapsulates is very important to understanding their behaviours in different environments, including their manufacturing processes and end-user applications. E. g. encapsulates for most industrial applications should have desirable mechanical strength, which should be strong enough to withstand various mechanical forces generated in manufacturing processes, such as mixing, pumping, extrusion, etc., and may be required to be weak enough in order to release the encapsulated {{active ingredients}} by mechanical forces at their end-user applications, such as release rate of flavour by chewing. The mechanical strength of encapsulates and release rate of their food actives are related to their size, morphology, wall thickness, chemical composition, structure etc. Hence, reliable methods which can be used to characterize these properties of encapsulates are vital.

40|$|Spray {{water cooling}} {{is widely used}} in many {{industrial}} processes to control heat removal from a hot material surface. In order to control heat transfer rates and obtain desired surface temperature distributions, {{a deeper understanding of}} fundamental spray cooling dynamics and more accurate estimation of spray heat transfer rates is needed. In this thesis, a new technique combining experiment and computational modeling has been developed for measuring the steady-state heat transfer extracted locally by water sprays or air-mists impinging on the surface of a hot metallic sample. 	The experimental apparatus was developed by A. C. Hernandez B., H. Castillejos E, and F. A. Acosta Gat CINVESTAV, Mexico, and is designed to be able to employ spray water to cool the metallic sample accommodated inside a copper coil with an alternating current as induction heating goes on inside the sample. Control of total input power from the wall maintains each desired sample thermocouple temperature. A computational model developed using the commercial finite-element package COMSOL Mutiphysics uses a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the electromagnetics and heat-conduction equations to balance the heat extracted from the sample surface by the boiling water droplets. Measurement of the RMS current flowing through the copper coil enables the model to estimate the heat extracted to the <b>cooling</b> <b>spray</b> by matching the sample thermocouple temperature measurement. Heat transfer coefficients and fluxes are quantified for spray cooling of a platinum sample at temperatures ranging from 100 - 1200 ???C, using typical air-mist nozzles and conditions relevant to steel continuous casting, and also compared with transient measurement results of spray cooling and Nozaki empirical correlation. The results reveal the flexibility of the technique to investigate different aspects of spray cooling. The spray heat transfer coefficients extracted range from 1 kW/m 2 K to 27 kW/m 2 K, and heat fluxes rang from 0. 5 MW/m 2 to 5 MW/m 2 as the sample surface temperature varies from 80 oC to 1185 oC Heat removal hysteresis exists during the spray heating-cooling cycle.

Reliability of electronic products lies on the thermal management and understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of the most commonly used thermal management schemes such as <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> Many experiments have been done to understand the heat transfer mechanisms associated with <b>spray</b> <b>cooling.</b> However, most of them have relied on comprehensive <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> experiments where multiple physical variables are at play simultaneously. Furthermore, experiments with single streams of droplets {{have not been able to}} elucidate the effects of the onset of boiling (ONB) during the droplet impingement process. Therefore, efforts have been undertaken to consider the effects of using three droplet streams arranged in a triangulated fashion. The effects of using triangulated multiple droplet impingements on the suppression or enhancement of boiling on heated surfaces has been investigated. Moreover, the effects of using screen laminated on the suppression of ONB during the droplet impingement process has been studied in detail. The main goal of this project is to study the effects of multiple droplet impingement on the flat heater surface in the <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> with and without the use of metallic screen laminates. Single and triple droplet impingement experiments have been performed to understand the droplet behavior in <b>spray</b> <b>cooling</b> systems where multiple droplets simultaneously impact a heated surface. The experiments consisted of using a stainless steel screen laminate over a sample surface to observe the suppression or enhancement of pool boiling which tends to occur at the periphery of each droplet impingement zone. An infrared-based imaging technique was used to measure surface temperature during droplet impingement. The heat transfer performance has been evaluated in terms of heat flux, droplet frequency and volume flow rate. The results indicate that droplet stream spacing and the use of copper meshes can enhance surface cooling significantly. Specifically, droplet stream spacing of 1000 ?m with copper meshes with a 6 mm hole and gap of 0. 2 mm lead to enhanced surface cooling during the multiple droplet impingement process.
