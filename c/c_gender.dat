The current study examined whether: (a) parental rearing-styles predicted psychosocial adjustment in young-adulthood, (b) this relationship was mediated by attachment styles, and (<b>c)</b> <b>gender</b> differences occur in these relationships. Two hundred and forty (103 male and 132 female) university students completed measures assessing parental rearing-style, current attachment style, romantic relationship satisfaction, friendship quality, self-esteem, and social competence. Multigroup structural equation modelling, conducted separately by gender, revealed that parental rearing-style predicted psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood. Further, {{there was also}} evidence of gender differences and that self-models and other-models of attachment mediated this relationship. Together, these findings reinforce the importance of perceived parental rearing-style for subsequent psychosocial adjustment...|$|E

The relation between child, family, and institutional factors (i. <b>c</b> <b>gender,</b> age, socioeconomic status (SES), family background (native/non-native), teacher education, teacher experience, and preschool quality) and vocabulary development was studied. Structural Equation Modeling revealed that initial vocabulatylevel was mainly predicted by child and family factors, such as age, SES and family background, and that later vocabulary and vocabulary growth were additionally predicted by preschool factors. Interactions between preschool factors and family background indicated that with a highly educated teacher non-native children had higher vocabulary scores, and that using an Early Childhood Education (ECE) program resulted in higher vocabulary scores for children from a native Dutch background...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to examine whether and to what extent {{parenting}} practices create a suitable ground and/or enhance Greek adolescents’ involvement in cyberbullying either as cyber-bullies or cyber-victims and whether adolescents’ gender and parents’ educational level are differentiating factors of cyberbullying at puberty. The results with a sample of 396 secondary school students showed that: (a) parenting style was not a statistically significant predictor of adolescent cyber victimization; on the contrary, seemed to be a significant predictor of cyberbullying manifestation, since adolescents with authoritative parents exhibited the lowest levels of cyberbullying behaviors while adolescents with authoritarian parents the highest; (b) adolescents with authoritative parents tended to communicate more frequently to them the cyberbullying experiences they might have than adolescents with permissive, neglectful or authoritarian parents; (<b>c)</b> <b>gender</b> and parents’ educational level were not a significant differentiating factor of cyberbullying behavior...|$|E

ELT conceives of learning as a four-stage cycle including four learning modes: concrete experience, re ective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation. The learning style inventory (LSI) invented from ELT provides a framework for examining one’s approach to learning situations. The aim {{of the present study}} was to collect data with the LSI and present: (a) the test–retest reliability coef cients for the different learning modes; (b) the correlation between different learning modes and age; (<b>c)</b> <b>gender</b> differences in the learning modes; and (d) homogeneous groups of students with different learning styles.

40|$|Karl Barth’s gender {{perspective}} is often analysed {{with reference to}} his so-called “theoethics” or “creational theology”. This perspective perpetuates an asymmetry in gender relations that was prevalent in Biblical times, throughout Christianity {{and to some extent}} still is visible today. He based his view on the subordination of women on an exegesis of Genesis 1 : 27 as “intertext” of Ephesians 5 : 22 - 23. Barth’s asymmetrical {{gender perspective}} is a product of his embedment in Western Christian tradition which in turn, is rooted in early Christian patriarchal theology. The aim {{of this article is to}} focus on Barth’s ontological reframing of the traditional understanding of the Biblical notion of human beings as created in the “image of God”.

40|$|Both {{individual}} cognitive-behavioural {{therapy and}} short-term psychoeducational courses have {{shown to be}} effective in reducing hypochondriacal complaints. However, it is unknown which patients benefit from treatment. The aim of the present study is to explore which variables predict treatment outcome in a pooled group of 140 participants of a psychoeducational course. Predictor variables were a) pretreatment hypochondriasis, b) age, <b>c)</b> <b>gender,</b> d) level of education, e) duration of hypochondriacal complaints, f) severity of depressive complaints, g) severity of trait anxiety, and h) treatment expectation. The target scores were residual gain scores of hypochondriacal complaints. Results showed that more severe hypochondriacal complaints at pre- and post-test correlated significantly with more severe hypochondriacal complaints later. Furthermore, higher trait anxiety and older age predicted less treatment gain in hypochondriacal complaints. More research of which variables can predict treatment outcome is needed.

40|$|Ghrelin, {{produced}} in the stomach, acts on growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHSRs) in hypothalamic neurons to potently increase food intake. However, male mice with deletions of ghrelin (Ghrl–/– mice) or GHSR (Ghsr–/– mice) display normal growth and regulation of food intake. Furthermore, adult Ghrl–/– mice display a normal sensitivity to high-fat diet–induced obesity. These findings from early studies raised {{the question as to}} whether the ghrelin system is an essential component for the regulation of food intake and body weight homeostasis. However, recent studies by Wortley et al. and Zigman et al. demonstrate that Ghrl–/– and Ghsr–/– mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity when fed a high-fat diet during the early post-weaning period.

40|$|The EU {{constitutional}} {{process has}} ascribed {{a new role}} to civil society {{not only as a}} partner in governance but also as a constituent of the emerging EU polity. Civil society appears in this process primarily as the structure of voice that is articulated in relation to EU governance and that claims to represent European citizens. The article proposes an analytical framework and a methodology of how to analyze civil society as ‘social constituency’. The research agenda is linked to the intermediary and the representative function of organised civil society as a transmission belt of legitimatory discourse on the EU. In order to reconstruct how interests, identities and normative ideas relating to the legitimacy of an EU constitutional order are contested within national politics, our research draws on a survey of German civil society organisations in three sectors: a) consumer interest organisations, b) churches and religious organisations, and <b>c)</b> <b>gender</b> equality groups. civil society; constitution building; discourse; Germany; governance; legitimacy; polity building; treaty reform...|$|E

Three theoretical perspectives were used to develop hypotheses: (a) needs and opportunities, (b) normative preferences, and (<b>c)</b> <b>gendered</b> involvement of grandparents. The findings showed that needs and opportunities informed involvement of grandparents but that the availability of formal child care did not predict grandparents' involvement. Maternal grandparents were more likely to provide child care than paternal grandparents, and grandmothers were more likely to do so than grandfathers. Involvement of both maternal and paternal grandparents in turn increased the likelihood of additional child births. The authors conclude that grandparental child care may be part of an emerging reproductive strategy.
