5000|$|It does so by iteratively marking as {{composite}} (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, {{starting with}} the first prime number, [...] The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime.

50|$|The Battle Round {{was taped}} in September, 2011 in Berlin and is emitted from the 15th to the 23rd of December in four telecasts.

50|$|For a 3-digit {{number in}} base 10, this number has a {{relatively}} simple divisibility test. The <b>candidate</b> <b>number</b> is split into groups of four, starting with the rightmost four, and added up to produce a 4-digit number. If this 4-digit number is of the form 1000a + 100b + 10a + b (where a and b are integers from 0 to 9), such as 3232 or 9797, or of the form 100b + b, such as 707 and 808, then the number is divisible by 101.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους), one of {{a number}} of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient {{algorithm}} for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, i.e., not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each <b>candidate</b> <b>number</b> for divisibility by each prime.|$|E

50|$|As Str8ts {{belongs to}} the same class of puzzles as Sudoku the puzzle can {{demonstrate}} {{a wide spectrum of}} relative difficulty. The grade is determined by a combination of opportunities to solve at each stage and the difficulty of the strategy that grants each solution. An easier puzzle will have many places where a logical deduction can place a solution or eliminate a <b>candidate</b> <b>number.</b> When the whole puzzle is assessed in this way, plus some heuristics, a score can be determined. Over a large number of puzzles (>10,000) a bell curve of scores can be produced. This can be quartiled to group puzzles into specific grades.|$|E
