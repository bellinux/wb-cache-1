One of the stringent design requirements of these systems is a flat top ripple of less than ± 0. 5 %. Both injection systems are composed of 4 travelling wave kicker magnets of 2. 7 m length each, powered by pulse forming networks (PFN's). To achieve the required kick strength of 1. 2 Tm, a low characteristic impedance has been chosen and <b>ceramic</b> <b>plate</b> <b>capacitors</b> are used to obtain 5 Omega.

The demon has to work harder than this to avoid the situation of perpetual motion, but the question is how? We explore the concept of a moving <b>plate</b> <b>capacitor,</b> driven by noise, a step further by examining the case where the restoring force on the <b>capacitor</b> <b>plates</b> is provided by a simple spring, rather than some unknown demon.
