500|$|One of {{the prime}} {{examples}} of the deficiencies in its former franchise structure can be illustrated by the relationship between Burger King and a Louisiana-based franchisee. Chart House, owned by brothers Billy and Jimmy Trotter, opened its first BK franchise in that state in 1963. By 1970 the Trotters' company had grown to over 350 stores across the country, with its own purchasing system, training program and inspection system. In 1973 Chart House attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for , but Pillsbury declined. The Trotters then put forth a second plan that would have Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate jointly <b>controlled</b> <b>company,</b> which Pillsbury also declined. After the failed bids, the relationship between Pilsbury and the Trotters soured. When Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for not respecting their contractual {{right of first refusal}} and won, preventing the sale. The two parties eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. In the early 1980s Chart House spun off its Burger King restaurants to focus on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury [...] in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E

50|$|Under German tax law, {{separate}} {{companies may}} {{be treated as}} integrated fiscal units for tax purposes (Organschaft). In an integrated fiscal unit, a legally independent company (the <b>controlled</b> <b>company)</b> agrees under a profit and loss pooling agreement to become dependent on another business (the controlling company) in financial, economic and organisational terms. The <b>controlled</b> <b>company</b> undertakes to pay over its entire profits to the controlling company. Another requirement is that the controlling company has to hold the majority of voting rights in the <b>controlled</b> <b>company.</b>|$|E

40|$|Under profit-based {{transfer}} pricing methods, {{the selection of}} comparable companies is essential if detection of transfer price manipulation is to be reliable. Comparative advantage as embedded in internalisation theory argues that foreign <b>controlled</b> <b>companies</b> should, in the long run, display greater profitability than domestic <b>controlled</b> <b>companies.</b> In high tax host countries {{transfer pricing}} manipulation theory predicts an opposite effect on profitability. Applying a refined set of tests to a large sample of firms operating in a high tax country such as Italy offers {{strong support for the}} internalisation prediction. Furthermore, the analysis of the inter-quartile range of our measure of profitability indicates that only a low percentage of foreign <b>controlled</b> <b>companies</b> would be subject to fiscal enquires, as implied by the OECD guidelines, under the suspicious of transfer pricing manipulation. These results suggest that current comparability tests are likely to fail the identification of transfer pricing practices in countries where the comparative advantage of foreign <b>controlled</b> <b>companies</b> is particularly pronounced and question the reliability of these tests...|$|R
