5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron,</b> the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
25|$|Several {{extensions}} of the theorem are known, in which the polyhedron that realizes a given graph has additional constraints; for instance, every polyhedral graph is the graph of a <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> with integer coordinates, or the graph of a <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> all of whose edges are tangent to a common midsphere.|$|E

25|$|A {{three-dimensional}} solid is a convex set if {{it contains}} every line segment connecting {{two of its}} points. A <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> is a polyhedron that, as a solid, forms a convex set.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} existence and uniqueness of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBM's) in <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedrons.</b> Loosely speaking, such a process has a semimartingale decomposition such that {{in the interior of}} the polyhedron the process behaves like a Brownian motion with a constant drift and covariance matrix, and at each of the (d Γ 1) -dimensional faces that form the boundary of the polyhedron, the bounded variation part of the process increases in a given direction (constant for any particular face), so as to confine the process to the polyhedron. For historical reasons, this &quot;pushing &quot; at the boundary is called instantaneous reflection. For simple <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedrons,</b> we give a necessary and sufficient condition on the geometric data for the existence and uniqueness of an SRBM. For non-simple <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedrons,</b> our condition is shown to be sufficient. It is an open question as to whether our condition is also necessary in the non-simple case. From the uniqueness, it follows that an SRBM defines a strong Markov process. Our results have application to the study of diffusions arising as heavy traffic limits of multiclass queueing networks and in particular, the non-simple case has application to multiclass fork and join networks. Our proof of weak existence uses a patchwork martingale problem introduced by T. G. Kurtz, whereas uniqueness hinges on an ergodic argument similar to that used by L. M. Taylor and R. J. Williams to prove uniqueness for SRBM's in an orthant...|$|R

25|$|For another example, any <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> is homeomorphic to the {{three-dimensional}} ball, so its surface is homeomorphic (hence homotopy equivalent) to the two-dimensional sphere, which has Euler characteristic2.

25|$|A zonohedron is a <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> {{in which}} every face is a polygon that is {{symmetric}} under rotations through 180°. Zonohedra can also be characterized as the Minkowski sums of line segments, and include several important space-filling polyhedra.|$|E
25|$|Euler's {{formula is}} also valid for convex polyhedra. This is no coincidence: every <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> {{can be turned}} into a connected, simple, planar graph by using the Schlegel diagram of the polyhedron, a {{perspective}} projection of the polyhedron onto a plane with the center of perspective chosen near the center of one of the polyhedron's faces. Not every planar graph corresponds to a <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron</b> in this way: the trees do not, for example. Steinitz's theorem says that the polyhedral graphs formed from convex polyhedra are precisely the finite 3-connected simple planar graphs. More generally, Euler's formula applies to any polyhedron whose faces are simple polygons that form a surface topologically equivalent to a sphere, regardless of its convexity.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} proofs of Euler's formula. One {{was given by}} Cauchy in 1811, as follows.

25|$|Geometrically, {{the linear}} {{constraints}} define the feasible region, {{which is a}} <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron.</b> A linear function is a convex function, which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum; similarly, a linear function is a concave function, which implies that every local maximum is a global maximum.|$|E
25|$|The other, more difficult, {{direction}} of Steinitz's theorem states that every planar 3-connected graph is {{the graph of}} a <b>convex</b> <b>polyhedron.</b> There are three standard approaches for this part: proofs by induction, lifting two-dimensional Tutte embeddings into three dimensions using the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, and methods using the circle packing theorem to generate a canonical polyhedron.|$|E

In graph theory, the term fullerene refers to any 3-regular, planar graph with all faces of size 5 or 6 (including the external face). It follows from Euler's polyhedron formula, V−E+F=2 (where V, E, F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces), that there are exactly 12 pentagons in a fullerene and V/2−10 hexagons.|$|E
