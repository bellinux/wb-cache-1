Furthermore, a technique for generating different stress histories in the specimen is explored by varying the initial clearance between the cylindrical specimen and the confining ring. In order to confirm the result obtained from the <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test,</b> spherical indentation experiments in which high hydrostatic pressure is generated in the plastic zone underneath the indenter are carried out with the same PMMA material.

In {{order to be able to}} see the individual particles of the sample with out the usage of sophisticated and expensive equipment, roasted chick peas were used to model granular material. The chick peas were chosen because of their size and availability. A series of uniaxial <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were run on the chick peas to check different aspects of the fragmentation. All the samples used in the tests were prepared the same way having the same initial height and mass. The samples also had uniform gradation. An initial test was run on the chick peas to an applied vertical load of 3 kN. This test was used to create a void ratio versus the logarithm of the stress curve. From the curve constructed from the results of the first test four applied vertical loads were chosen. These four applied vertical loads were used throughout the research. The first set of uniaxial <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were used to determine how many chick peas were broken during compression. The next set of uniaxial <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were used to run sieve analysis on each sample and to determine how the gradation of the sample changed as the applied vertical load increased. Another <b>confined</b> uniaxial <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> was run to a selected load to determine how the crushing occurred internally. Through out the research several pictures were taken with a digital camera to help illustrate the crushing inside and outside the samples.

A fractal analysis was done using the results of the sieve analysis for each sample. Fractal fragmentation dimensions were calculated to determine the degree of crushing at each of the applied vertical loads.

40|$|Elucidation of the {{load-bearing}} {{mechanism of}} the nucleus pulposus (NP) facilitates understanding of the mechanical and metabolic functioning of the intervertebral disc and provides key data for mathematical models. Negatively charged proteoglycans in the NP generate an ionic osmotic pressure, πi, which contributes to the tissue's resistance to load and, moreover, is the main mechanism by which the unloaded disc rehydrates. Functionally important, πi has seldom been investigated in situ and, crucially, its variation with strain has not been reported. In a <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> apparatus, we aimed to apportion the strain-dependent load-bearing {{mechanism of the}} NP at equilibrium to the tissue matrix and ionic osmotic pressure; and to determine whether any proteoglycan loss occurs during <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>testing.</b> Forty-eight <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> experiments were conducted in isotonic (0. 15 M NaCl) and hypertonic (3. 0 and 6. 1 M NaCl) external solutions in single and multiple step-strain protocols.

This study investigates the feasibility of porous titanium particles (TiP) to replace bone particles (BoP) and to compare mechanical properties of TiP and a commercially available porous ceramic bone graft extender (CeP). Impactability and time-dependent mechanical properties (stability and stiffness during physiologic loading (0. 1 - 2. 5 MPa)) were assessed by standardized impaction and a <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> Loaded samples were used for particle release analysis. FINDINGS: TiP were more impactable than BoP and created a stable, highly entangled macroporous construct. CeP were crushed during impaction, resulting in non-cohesive specimens of small ceramic particles. TiP showed very little deformation {{at the end of}} physiological loading. Impacted TiP were stiffer than BoP but more elastic than CeP. TiP generated a low volume of microparticles (0. 2 % of original TiP weight) with a bimodal size distribution (diameter range, 7 - 2000 microm).

To simulate crustal faulting processes, including {{the evolution of}} fault-zone properties, a rheological model must incorporate concepts such as damage rheology that describe the various stages of the seismic cycle (strain localization, subcritical crack growth and macroscopic failure) while accounting for material degradation and healing and off-fault deformation. Here we study the fundamental patterns of strain-localisation {{within the framework of}} a continuum damage rheology by performing a shear band analysis (linear instability analysis) and comparing predictions of shear band orientations with numerical results of the nonlinear problem. We find (analytically and numerically) that the angle between the shear band and the less compressive (transverse) direction is between 47 in compression tests with a strain ratio of 0. 25 (highly <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test),</b> and 60 for a strain ratio higher than 1. 4 (axial compression and transverse extension).

40|$|International audienceCompaction of {{concrete}} is physically {{a collapse of}} the material porous microstructure. It produces plastic strains in the material and, at the same time, an increase of its bulk modulus. This paper presents two experimental techniques aimed at obtaining the hydrostatic response {{of concrete}} and mortar. The first one is a uniaxial <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> which is quite simple to implement and allows to reach hydrostatic pressures of about 600 MPa. The specimen size is large enough so that concrete with aggregate sizes up to 16 nam can be tested. The second one is a true hydrostatic test performed on smaller (mortar) specimens. Test {{results show that the}} hydrostatic response of the material is elasto-plastic with a stiffening effect on both the tangent and unloading bulk moduli. The magnitude of the irreversible volumetric strains depends on the initial porosity of the material. This porosity can be related in a first approximation to the water/cement ratio. A comparison of the hydrostatic responses obtained from the two testing techniques on the same material show that the hydrostatic response of cementitious materials cannot be uncoupled from the deviatoric response, as opposed to the standard assumption in constitutive relations for metal alloys. This feature should be taken into account in the development of constitutive relations for concrete subjected to high confinement pressures which are needed in the modelling of impact problems...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a combined experimental-numerical {{framework for the}} biomechanical characterization of highly hydrated collagen hydrogels, namely with 0. 20, 0. 30 and 0. 40  % (by weight) of collagen concentration. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix of animals and humans. Its intrinsic biocompatibility makes collagen a promising substrate for embedding cells within a highly hydrated environment mimicking natural soft tissues. Cell behaviour is greatly influenced by the mechanical properties of the surrounding matrix, but the biomechanical characterization of collagen hydrogels has been challenging up to now, since they present non-linear poro-viscoelastic properties. Combining the stiffness outcomes from rheological experiments with relevant literature data on collagen permeability, poroelastic finite element (FE) models were developed. Comparison between experimental <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> available in the literature and analogous FE stress relaxation curves showed a close agreement throughout the tests. This framework allowed establishing that the dynamic shear modulus of the collagen hydrogels is between 0. 0097  ±  0. 018  kPa for the 0. 20  % concentration and 0. 0601  ±  0. 044  kPa for the 0. 40  % concentration.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of the compaction of granular materials {{is an area}} of active research. One approach is to use deformable discrete elements of the individual particles using a 2 D finite element (FE) mesh, see e. g. [1] and [2]. In this work, the axial compression of iron ore pellets inside a steel cylinder is studied and the individual particles are discretized with a coarse FE mesh in 3 D. One possibility of this model is to study the stresses and strains inside the granular particles. Experiment and {{simulation of}} iron ore pellets in a <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> are done. The experiment consists of an upper and lower piston of thick circular steel plates surrounded by a 2 mm steel cylinder containing the iron ore pellets. The total mass of the iron ore pellets is 46. 0 kg. During a test, an axial load is applied on the lower piston to a certain level and then unloaded. Measured data are the force and displacement of the lower piston. In addition, strain gauges are measuring the circumferential strain {{in the middle of the}} steel membrane. Experimental compression tests between two plates of 18 randomly chosen iron ore pellets were done in order to characterize the load displacement behaviour of the individual pellets. FE models of the experimental tested pellets were carried out and simulated. Each pellet was discretized with an eight-node FE mesh. An elasto-plastic material model with linear hardening is used. The Young’s modulus, the plastic hardening modulus, and the yield stress of the material model were found by inverse modelling. Different material parameters were tested systematically in the FE model and compared with the experimental results until the same load displacement curve was obtained. A multi particle finite element model (MPFEM) was used to simulate the <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> The iron ore pellets are represented in a quarter-model of the real experimental setup by 4756 discretized particles (7 - 16 mm) with a normal distribution measured from size distribution in the experiment. The contacts are modelled with the penalty stiffness method. The pistons are considered rigid in the simulation and the steel cylinder is modelled with thin elastic shell elements. The compression is simulated in two steps. In the first step, the iron ore pellets models are randomly sparse placed the cylinder and a gravity driven simulation is carried out where the pellets are arranged in the cylinder. In the second step, the compression is simulated by a prescribed displacement of the upper piston. Compared data from the experiment and simulation are; fill density, force-displacement curve and circumferential strain. A relation between the global stress state from the loading of the piston and the maximum stresses inside the individual iron ore pellets was carried out from the simulation. References [1] A. T.

The amperage curve was used to determine the parameters of particle agglomeration (phase time, phase volume and phase adhesion) and the mechanism of particle agglomeration through an indirect measurement of the adhesion force which develops during the wet agglomeration process. The granule strength was determined by a <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test,</b> and the granule strength curve was used to analyze the particle agglomeration in conjunction with the amperage curve. Both the amperage curve and granule strength analysis indicated the involvement of capillary phenomena in particle agglomeration throughout the wet massing process. Surface tension was found to affect particle agglomeration and granule strength by affecting both the liquid requirement and the particle distance of the agglomerates. Different degrees of polymer concentration were all found to produce similar particle agglomeration in the wet massing stage, but had a significant effect on granule strength in the dried stage. Particle size showed a significant effect on particle agglomeration in the wetting and bridge formation stage and also on granule strength in dried stage. The increase of granule strength depends on particle size. Particle surface roughness showed a significant effect on particle agglomeration and granule strength and dominated the differences in the chemical nature, particle size and shape of the powders. Surface roughness needed to be smoothed out to increase the available particle-particle contact area before particle-liquid-particle interactions. Granule strength varied inversely with particle surface roughness. Particle shape showed different particle-particle interactions induced by capillary phenomena depending on the particle 2 ̆ 7 s geometric parameters.

Soil type and matric suction, loading type, maximum applied stress and number of loading cycles significantly affected log [K-g], void ratio e, and AFP. The Significance of the loading cycle's number implies that though the up, of the soil was not exceeded, the soil physical properties were considerably changed. A gradual transition from elastic-to-plastic deformation was observed on the stress-strain curves obtained from CCT. The stress-strain curves of the SCCT were sharp at sigma(pc) due to the semi-confined condition, which allows lateral deformation during loading. Cyclic loading was not always accompanied by significant irreversible strain but this could result in up to 10 times the decrease in K-g. For the fine-textured soils, CCT resulted in a significantly greater reduction in K-g, a and AFP when compared with KCT. The opposite trend was observed for the coarse-textured soils. The KCT homogenised the pore system and resulted in more decrease of K-g when compared with CCT at matric suctions of 10 and 20 kPa. However, at the matric suctions of 50 and 80 kPa, KCT created an open microstructure, which led to relatively higher values of K-g. The results show that the sigma(pc) might not be a real critical stress from a view of soil physical quality indices (i. e. K-g and AFP), especially at low matric suctions. Thus, the characterisation of soil compaction may not be completely accounted by a bulk property such as void ratio, but additional information about pore characteristics are needed to describe the effect of compaction on soil physical quality.

40|$|Introduction: Apple {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} horticultural crops of Iran. Its production in the country stands in the second place after citrus. Iran holds the fourth place in the world production of apples and gains a major share in the export of this product. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the quantity and quality of the fruit in order to maintain and promote its position among the countries importing this product from Iran. Most of the mechanical damages to fruits and vegetables occur due to contact stresses under static, quasi-static and impact loading. To obtain stress distribution inside the fruit we can use finite element analysis. The aim of this study was to simulate the behavior of the apple as a viscoelastic body subjected to quasi-static loading and also to determine the failure criteria (maximum normal stress or shear stress) of apple flesh to estimate its susceptibility to mechanical bruising. Materials and methods: In this study, Golab kohanz apple was used. Two samples were removed from each apple using a core sampler, one was used for uniaxial compression and the other was used for <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> using Instron universal tension and compression machine. Spherical indenter and parallel plate tests were performed in order to study apple susceptibility to bruising at four deformation levels (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm) and the bruise volume was then measured after 24 hours. Stress-strain curves were plotted and then, the elastic and viscoelastic properties were obtained. Then, by using the data obtained from apple properties, the apple was modeled in Abaqus software as spherical and cylindrical shapes with viscoelastic behavior subjected to quasi-static loadings. Results and Discussion: The normal stress distribution of the modeled apple in the shape of a cylindrical sample is shown in Fig. 4. The value of maximum normal stress was obtained (0. 51 MPa) at the contact point of the loading plate with the sample. Experimental and modeled stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 5. Up to the bio-yield point, the two curves are nearly matched; and beyond that point, there are some overestimations in the predicted stress values. The location and pattern of failure have often been used to explain the cause of failure in fruits. When specimens of fruit are subjected to a uniaxial compression, the failure often occurs the maximum shear stress plane. Failure patterns in the tested samples indicate that the failure occurs due to shear stresses. Another explanation that has been used by researchers for shear failure is the bruising position inside the fruit after loading. The position of bruising in most of the tested apples was a distance away from the apple surface (Fig. 7). According to the experiments results at the three deformation levels of 2, 3, and 4 mm, the maximum generated normal stress inside the apple was above the point of failure of the cylindrical samples. Based on the empirical results, the bruising was almost zero for the apples subjected to one or two mm deformation (Fig. 9 a). The experimental value of the shear strength of the Golab kahanz apple was obtained to be 0. 23 MPa. The maximum shear stress inside the modeled apple due to the two mm deformation was 0. 195 MPa, which was lower than the shear strength of the apple. On the other hand, by applying three and four mm of deformation, the maximum shear stresses were obtained to be 0. 24 and 0. 26 MPa, respectively, indicating that the induced stress exceeded the shear strength of apple flesh; therefore, the bruising was observed in the flesh of these apples. The location of the maximum shear stress corresponds to the location of bruising in the tested samples as shown in Fig. 9 b. According to the obtained results from the modeling in the finite element software, we can use this software in order to recognize and investigate the damages in agricultural products during different loading conditions (Harvesting, transportation, packaging and storage). Conclusions: In this work, Golab apple was considered as a viscoelastic material and its behavior under quasistatic loading was modeled using finite element method. Elastic, viscoelastic properties and shear strength of apple flesh were obtained and used in the simulation. Comparison of modeling and experimental results shows that the model simulates the behavior of apples during quasistatic loading well. The location of bruise occurrence in the flesh of tested apple and the location of maximum shear stress in the simulated apple was the same. Therefore, the maximum shear stress criterion can be used to estimate the susceptibility of apple varieties to internal bruising under quasistatic loading. Modeling of apple as a viscoelastic sphere in Abaqus software assuming constant bulk modulus could properly simulate apple behavior under quasistatic loading...|$|E
40|$|The inelastic {{pressure}} dependent compressive behaviour of bovine trabecular bone is investigated through {{experimental and}} computational analysis. Two loading configurations are implemented, uniaxial and <b>confined</b> <b>compression,</b> providing two distinct loading paths in the von Mises-pressure stress plane. Experimental results reveal distinctive yielding {{followed by a}} constant nominal stress plateau for both uniaxial and <b>confined</b> <b>compression.</b> Computational simulation of the experimental tests using the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb plasticity models fails to capture the <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> behaviour of trabecular bone. The high pressure developed during <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> does not result in plastic deformation using these formulations, and a near elastic response is computed. In contrast, the crushable foam plasticity models provide accurate simulation of the <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests,</b> with distinctive yield and plateau behaviour being predicted. The elliptical yield surfaces of the crushable foam formulations in the von Mises-pressure stress plane accurately characterise the plastic behaviour of trabecular bone. Results reveal that the hydrostatic yield stress {{is equal to the}} uniaxial yield stress for trabecular bone, demonstrating the importance of accurate characterisation and simulation of the pressure dependent plasticity. It is also demonstrated in this study that a commercially available trabecular bone analogue material, cellular rigid polyurethane foam, exhibits similar pressure dependent yield behaviour, despite having a lower stiffness and strength than trabecular bone. This study provides a novel insight into the pressure dependent yield behaviour of trabecular bone, demonstrating the inadequacy of uniaxial testing alone. For the first time, crushable foam plasticity formulations are implemented for trabecular bone. The enhanced understanding of the inelastic behaviour of trabecular bone established in this study will allow for more realistic simulation of orthopaedic device implantation and failure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSyntactic foams (hollow glass {{microspheres}} {{embedded in}} a polymeric matrix) are being used increasingly for thermal insulation purpose in ultra-deep water. A {{better understanding of the}} damage mechanisms of these materials under such a hydrostatic loading condition would be useful in determining actual material limits, improving phenomenological modeling and developing novel formulations in the future. To achieve this goal, a study based on X-ray microtomography was performed on various syntactic foam materials (epoxy/PP/PU matrix). Spatial resolution of (0. 7 µm) 3 and in situ non-destructive scanning allowed unique qualitative and quantitative analysis of the composite microstructure during stepwise <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> in the dry state. It is shown that in the three materials, the thickness of the spheres is rather constant while their diameter is strongly distributed. The adherence is strong between PU and glass and rather weak between both PP and epoxy and glass. In the two foams where the matrix is more compliant (PU and PP), damage is homogeneously distributed and affects mainly the larger spheres, while in the stiff and strong epoxy material, damage is localized in bands...|$|R

Uniaxial stress and uniaxial strain experiments were conducted at strain rates ranging from quasistatic to 10 4 sec - 1 for a highly filled, HTPB-based, cast-cure, explosive simulant. Analysis of samples recovered from high strain-rate <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> evidenced the fracture of the particulate filler in some of the items. Furthermore, the parameters derived from these experiments, along with a series of numerical simulations using a two-dimensional hydrocode, were used to derive a macroscopic material model consisting of a nonlinear viscoelastic equation of state with linear viscoelastic deviatoric components. This model was validated using inverse impact experiments of "explosive"-filled penetrators and further exercised in simulations of generic explosive-filled penetrators impacting hardened targets at various velocities. Such a model is also a valuable tool for studying the response of propellant and explosive-filled hardware in accident scenarios which might occur during transport and handling...|$|R
40|$|From {{pharmaceutical}} powders {{to agricultural}} grains, a great {{proportion of the}} materials handled in industrial situations are granular or particulate in nature. The variety of stesses that the matierals may experience and the resulting bulk behaviours may be complex. In agricultural engineering, a better understanding into agricultural processes such as seeding, harvesting, transporting and storing will help to improve the handling of agricultural grains with optimised solutions. A detailed understanding of a granular system is crucial when attempting to model a system, whether it is on a micro (particle) or macro (bulk) scale. As numerical capabilities are ever increasing, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is becoming an increasingly popular numerical technique for computing the behaviour of discrete particels for both industrial and scientific applications. A look into the literature shows a lack of validation of what DEM can predict, specifically with respect to bulk behaviour. In addition, when validation studies are conducted, discrepancies between bulk responses in physical tests and numerical predictions using measured particles properties may arise. The aire {{of this research is}} to develop a methodology to calibrate DEM models for agricultural grains using data meaured in bulk physical tests. The methodology will have a wider application to granular solids in general and will advance understanding in the area of DEM model calibration. A contrasting set of granular materials were used to develop the methodology including 3 inorganic solids (single and paired glass beads, and polyethylene terephthalate pellets) and two organic materials (black eyes beans and black kidney beans). The developed methodology consists of three steps: 1. The development of bulk physical tests to measure the bulk responses that will be used to calibrate the DEM models, 2. The creation of the numerical dataset that will describe how the DEM input parameters influence the bulk responses, and 3. The optimisation of the DEM parameters using a searching algorithm and the results from Step 1 and 2. Two laboratory devices were developed to provide calibration data for the proposed methodology: a rotating drum and an <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> These devices were chosen as they can produce bulk responses that are repeatable and easy to quantify, as well as generate discriminating results in numerical simulations when DEM parameters are varied. The bulk response determined from the rotating drum device was the dynamic angle of repose Ør formed when the granular material in a 40 % filled drum is rotating at a speed of 7 rpm. the confined compression apparatus was used to determine the bulk stiffness of a system by monitoring the change in void ratio from the stress applied during a loading and unloading cycle. The gradient of the loading and unloadng curves termed λ and κ respectively were chosen as the bulk responses to calibrate the DEM models. The experimental results revealed that the dynamic Ør was significantly influences by the particle aspect ration and boundary conditions. The stiffness parameters were found to be predominantly influences by the initial packing arrangement. The numerical dataset describing how the DEM input parameters influence the numerical bulk responses was created by simulating the bulk physical tests, varying selected DEM parameters and monitoring the effects on bulk parameters. To limit the number of simulations required, design of experiment (DOE) methods were used to determine a reduced factorial matrix of simulations. In additions, an extensive parametric investigation on the non-optimised parameters as well as a scaling sensitivity study was carried out. The final step in determining the optimised parameters is to use a searching algorithm to infer the DEM parameters based on the numerical dataset and used the experimental results as calibration data. To perform a comparative study, tow searching algorithms were explored: the first was a simple method based on Microsoft Excel's Solver algorithm coupled with a weighted inverse distance method. The second made used of the statistical analysis program Statistica. It was shown that the Excel Solver algorithm is simpler and quicker to use but for the present first implementation, could only perform an optimisation based on two bulk responses. Statistica required the creation of a staistical model based on the numerical dataset before using the profiling and desirability searching technique, but was able to optimise the parameter using all three bulk responses. A verification and validation of the optimisation methodology was conducted using the optimised parameters for the black eyed beans. A verification was cnducted by simulating the two calibration experiments using the optimsed parameters and comparing these with the experiments. In addition, a validation was peformed by predicting the response of ta shallow footing penetration on a bed of black eyed beans. It was found that DEM simulations using optimised parameters predicted vertical stress on the footing during penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy for industrial applications (< 10 %) at penetration depths up to 30 mm.

Methods and Results Using an automated instrument to allow epifluorescence microscopy analysis during <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> on cartilage samples, the equilibrium <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> modulus (HA 0) was found to vary markedly with depth (z= 0 – 1500 μm) from the articular surface. HA 0 increased from 1. 16 ± 0. 20 MPa in the superficial (0 – 125 μm) layer to 7. 75 ± 1. 45 MPa in the deepest (1250 – 1500 μm) layer tested, and was fit by the expression, HA 0 (z) [MPa]= 1. 44 exp(0. 0012 ·z [μm]). Also, in successive slices of cartilage extending from the articular surface to the middle–deep regions, the bulk modulus (K 0) and fixed charge density (FCD) increased, consistent with previous findings. While HA 0, K 0, and FCD each varied with depth from the articular surface, the dependence of HA 0 and K 0 on depth {{did not appear to}} be completely related to variations in FCD. Conclusions The <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> modulus of normal aged human femoral head articular cartilage increases markedly with depth from the articular surface, a trend similar to that observed for articular cartilage from other joints in animals but with an absolute amplitude that is several-fold higher. The compressive properties were not simply related to FCD at different depths from the articular surface, suggesting that other as yet undefined factors also contribute to compressive properties...|$|R
40|$|Suffusion erosion {{may occur}} in sandy gravel dam {{foundations}} that use suspended cutoff walls. This erosion causes {{a loss of}} fine particles, degrades the soil strength and deformation moduli, and adversely impacts the cutoff walls of the dam foundation, {{as well as the}} overlying dam body. A comprehensive evaluation of these effects requires models that quantitatively describe the effects of fine particle losses on the stress-strain relationships of sandy gravels. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme for studying these types of models, and then perform triaxial and <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> {{to determine the effects of}} particle losses on the stress-strain relationships. Considering the Duncan-Chang E-B model, quantitative expressions describing the relationship between the parameters of the model and the particle losses were derived. The results show that particle losses did not alter the qualitative stress-strain characteristics of the soils; however, the soil strength and deformation moduli were degraded. By establishing the relationship between the parameters of the model and the losses, the same model can then be used to describe the relationship between sandy gravels and erosion levels that vary in both time and space...|$|R

In addition, the subchondral bone region has a hydraulic permeability which is markedly increased in osteoarthritis. Thus, {{the effects of}} the depth-varying properties of articular cartilage and of the permeability of the deep boundary on the biomechanical behavior of cartilage were determined for oscillatory <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> both experimentally and using a poroelastic multi-layer model. Homogeneous (a) and inhomogeneous (b) sample structures were both experimentally tested as well as simulated in two <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> setups, one with an impermeable base (I) and a freely-permeable base (II) at 15 % offset. The model and experimental results demonstrate that the high modulus and low permeability of the deep layer of cartilage normally provide a sealing effect, such that fluid pressurization and dynamic stiffness are maintained much more similarly for conditions Ib and IIb than for conditions Ia and IIa, with these differences between I and II diminishing at lower frequencies for both sample structures. In the simulation, strain and solid stress were more distributed throughout the sample depth and propagated deeper into the tissue from permeable boundary conditions in Ia and IIa than in Ib and IIb. In summary, the depth varying properties of the inhomogeneous sample and an impermeable deep boundary provide increased fluid pressurization capability that when combined have a cumulative effect, effectively shielding the tissue from large strain and stress level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRapid {{and large}} {{deformations}} of snow are mainlycontrolled by grain rearrangements, which occur through thefailure of cohesive bonds {{and the creation}} of new contacts. We exploit a granular description of snow to develop a discrete element model based on the full 3 -D microstructurecaptured by microtomography. The model assumes that snowis composed of rigid grains interacting through localized contacts accounting for cohesion and friction. The geometry ofthe grains and of the intergranular bonding system are explicitly defined from microtomographic data using geometrical criteria based on curvature and contiguity. Single grains are represented as rigid clumps of spheres. The model is applied to different snow samples subjected to <b>confined</b> <b>compression</b> <b>tests.</b> A detailed sensitivity analysis shows that artifacts introduced by the modeling approach and the influence of numerical parameters are limited compared to variations due to the geometry of the microstructure. The model shows that the compression behavior of snow is mainly controlled by the density of the samples, but that deviations from a pure density parameterization are not insignificant during the first phase of deformation. In particular, the model correctly predicts that, for a given density, faceted crystals are less resistant to compression than rounded grains or decomposed snow. For larger compression strains, no clear differences between snow types are observed...|$|R
