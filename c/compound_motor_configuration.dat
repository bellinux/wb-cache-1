40|$|International audienceWhat can a robot {{learn about}} the {{structure}} of its own body when he does not already know the semantics, the type and the position of its sensors and motors? Previous work has shown that an information theoretic approach, based on pairwise Crutchﬁeld's information distance on sensorimotor channels, could allow to measure the informational topology of the set of sensors, i. e. reconstruct approximately the topology of the sensory body map. In this paper, we argue that the informational sensors topology changes with <b>motor</b> <b>conﬁgurations</b> in many robotic bodies, but yet, because measuring Crutchﬁeld's distance is very time consuming, {{it is impossible to}} remeasure the body's topology for each novel <b>motor</b> <b>conﬁguration.</b> Rather, a model should be learnt that allows the robot to predict Crutchﬁeld's informational distances, and thus anticipate informational body maps, for novel <b>motor</b> <b>conﬁgurations.</b> We present experiments showing that learning motor dependent Crutchﬁeld distances can indeed be achieved...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel 12 / 10 stator/rotor pole bearingless flux-switching {{permanent}} magnet (BFSPM) motor is proposed {{to overcome the}} drawbacks of rotor {{permanent magnet}} type bearingless motors. The basic <b>motor</b> <b>configuration,</b> including <b>motor</b> <b>configuration</b> and winding configuration, is introduced firstly. Then, {{based on the principle}} of reverse direction magnetization for symmetrical rotor teeth, the radial suspension forces generation principle is analyzed in detail. Finally, decoupling performances between suspension force windings and torque windings are investigated. The results show that the proposed BFSPM not only ensures the merits of high torque output capability compared with conventional 12 / 10 stator/rotor pole FSPM motor, but also achieves stable radial suspension forces which have little mutual effect with torque. The validity of the proposed structure has been verified by finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|R

The simulations show that when larger air-gaps than that of a commercial IM unit are used it is possible to use SMBs in the IM.
