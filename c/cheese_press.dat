25|$|Another stone at {{the farm}} may {{represent}} the remains a primitive <b>cheese</b> <b>press.</b> It is an expertly carved 'trough' with various holes, grooves and three vertical sides. The groove running horizontally along the 'back' may have helped support a wooden frame above the 'trough'. It may have been re-used for a different purpose {{at a later date}} and is unlikely to {{have been part of the}} 1760 press.|$|E
40|$|Dhaka {{cheese is}} a semihard artisanal variety made mainly from bovine milk, using very simple {{pressing}} methods. Experimental <b>cheeses</b> were <b>pressed</b> at gauge pressures up to 31 kPa for 12 h at 24 Â°C and 70 % RH. These cheeses were subsequently examined for their compositional, textural and rheological properties plus their microstructures investigated by confocal laser microscopy. The <b>cheese</b> <b>pressed</b> at 15. 6 kPa {{was found to}} have the best compositional and structural properties...|$|R

60|$|On {{asking for}} a further explanation, Rollo learned that the mountaineers were {{accustomed}} to drive their herds up the mountains in the summer to places too cold to be inhabited all the year round, and to live there with them in these little huts during {{the two or three}} months while the grass was green. The men would bring up their milking pails, their pans, their churns, their <b>cheese</b> <b>presses,</b> and their kettles for cooking, and thus live in a sort of encampment while the grass lasted, and make butter and cheese to carry down the mountain with them when they returned.|$|R
25|$|Excavations {{were carried}} out in 1978 and in 1990/1991. Unfortunately much of the fort is located beneath the town of Chester-le-Street so little remains to be seen, except {{for a portion of}} the {{excavated}} officer's quarters left on display. Finds included pottery, fine table wares, coins, animal bones, a <b>cheese</b> <b>press</b> and curiously even a tile with a dog's footprint on it. Altars found range from the war god Mars and the sun god Apollo, to Celtic and German ones such as Digenis and Vitiris. The large (3 out of 8) number of altars dedicated to patron deities concerned with the wellbeing of veteran soldiers would seem to suggest the inhabitants of Concangis had a high proportion of ex-military men. Two large stones in the buttress of the parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert have lewis holes which indicate they were recycled from the Roman fort.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, the Old House {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden <b>cheese</b> <b>press.</b> More children would have slept in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).|$|E
2500|$|Most sources, e.g. Dobie {{state that}} [...] "Barbara's Gilmours <b>cheese</b> <b>press</b> {{can still be}} seen today at 'The Hill'", however the <b>cheese</b> <b>press</b> here is dated 1760 and she died in 1732. The design of the press, with a heavy 'lintel' stone having a screwed shaft passing through it {{attached}} to a frame, allowed the dead weight of the stone to be lowered onto the cheese progressively, improving the overall drainage of the whey and the firming up of the curd.|$|E
60|$|The row of cribs was {{separated}} {{from the floor of}} the passage way by a sort of trench, about {{a foot and a half}} wide and ten inches deep, and outside this trench, and also within it, at the entrances to the cribs, were arrayed a great number of utensils employed in the work of the dairy, such as tubs, cans, <b>cheese</b> <b>presses,</b> moulds, and other such things. These were all beautifully made, and being mounted with brass, which had received the highest polish by constant rubbing, they gave to the whole aspect of the place an exceedingly gay and brilliant appearance.|$|R
50|$|Savoury dumplings {{made from}} balls of dough {{are part of}} {{traditional}} British and Irish cuisine. Traditionally dumplings are made from twice the weight of self raising flour to suet, bound together by cold water to form a dough and seasoned with salt and pepper. Balls of this dough are dropped into a bubbling pot of stew or soup, or into a casserole. They sit, partly submerged in the stew, and expand as they are half-boiled half-steamed for ten minutes or so. The cooked dumplings are airy {{on the inside and}} moist on the outside. The dough may be flavoured with herbs, or it may have <b>cheese</b> <b>pressed</b> into its centre.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, farmer cheese (also farmer's {{cheese or}} farmers' <b>cheese)</b> is <b>pressed</b> cottage <b>cheese,</b> an unripened cheese made by adding rennet and {{bacterial}} starter to coagulate and acidify milk. Farmer cheese {{may be made}} from the milk of cows, sheep or goats, with each giving its own texture and flavor.|$|R
60|$|Rollo and {{his uncle}} spent {{half an hour}} at this hotel. For {{refreshment}} they had some very excellent and rich Alpine milk, which they drank from very tall and curiously-shaped tumblers. They also amused themselves in looking at some specimens of carved work, such as models of Swiss cottages--and figures of shepherds, and milkmaids with loads of utensils on their backs--and groups of huntsmen, with dogs leaping up around them--and chamois, or goats, climbing about among the rocks and mountains. Rollo had bought a pretty good supply of such sculptures before; {{but there was one}} specimen here that struck his fancy so much that he could not resist the temptation of adding it to his collection, especially as Mr. George approved of his making the purchase. It was a model of what is called a chalet,[15] which is a sort of hut that the shepherds occupy in the upper pasturages, in the summer, where they go to tend the cows, and to make butter and cheese. The little chalet was made in such a manner that the roof would lift up like a lid, and let you see all there was within. There was a row of cows, with little calves by them, in stalls {{on one side of the}} chalet, and on the other side tables and benches, with pans of milk and tubs upon them, and a churn, and a <b>cheese</b> <b>press,</b> and other such like things. There was a bed, too, for the shepherd, in a sort of a garret above, just big enough to hold it.|$|E

40|$|After solid - state {{fermentation}} on {{wheat bran}} under optimum conditions of production, the acid protease ofAspergillus niger FFB 1 extracted with sterile distilledwater (1 : 5 w/v) presented milk-clotting activity of 600 SU/g bran and {{a ratio of}} coagulant to proteolytic activities 4. 7; was applied {{in the production of}} unripened <b>cheese</b> <b>pressed</b> using cow milk. Cheese yields obtained by the commercial preparation(control) {{on the one hand and}} the milk - curdling enzyme of A. niger FFB 1 on the other hand; differ by 2. 8 % of product weight, which are higher in the case of commercial rennet. This difference results from a loss more or less important proteins(11 %) and fat(4 %) during the draining, induced by the proteolytic activity of the fungal enzyme extract. The organoleptic qualities of the two hard cheeses produced are very similar...|$|R
