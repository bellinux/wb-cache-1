5|$|The third {{match was}} between Gene Snitsky and Kane (with Lita). The match was a Weapons of Choice match, {{for which a}} steel chain gained 41% of the vote. The match began with Kane using a chain on Snitsky. Snitsky grabbed the chain and choked Kane with it. The match ended when Snitsky came off the second rope onto a steel <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> was wrapped around Kane's neck and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{focused on}} her family full-time, and {{continued}} to concentrate on her interior design business. Several of her clients came from the NASCAR community. She also started a company called Happy Chairs in the Matthews area of Charlotte where she creates her own furniture and redesigns old chairs. It came after Robinson looked for furnishings in a national furniture chain store and discovered a display <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> she liked. She begins the process of renovating old chairs by searching for those that are in poor condition but are structurally intact and are architecturally appealing. Robinson dismantles the chair and starts reconstructing it. Her work has received critical acclaim from online magazines and customers. Robinson names designer Trina Turk and several clothing companies as her influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Steel cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Triple H and Randy Orton. During the {{beginning}} of the match, Triple H gained the advantage over Orton, as he performed a High Knee on Orton. Orton came back with a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and attempting to escape through the cage door but Triple H prevented him from escaping. Triple H took control as he took out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as Triple H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on Triple H's head, however, Triple H grabbed the chair and hit Orton with it. Triple H followed up by executing a pedigree. Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E

25|$|After Anthony {{retired as}} {{president}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Carrie Chapman Catt, her chosen successor, began working toward an international women's suffrage association, one of Anthony's long-time goals. The existing International Council of Women could not be expected to support a campaign for women's suffrage because it was a broad alliance whose more conservative members would object. In 1902, Catt organized a preparatory meeting in Washington, with Anthony as <b>chair,</b> <b>that</b> was attended by delegates from several countries. Organized primarily by Catt, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was created in Berlin in 1904. The founding meeting was chaired by Anthony, who was declared to be the new organization's honorary president and first member.|$|E

Since 2007 an Annual Water Sector Review (AWSR) is carried out which helps to foster the alignment of donor projects among other things.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric <b>chair.</b> <b>That</b> evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and on the <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> she had been sitting in. This led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 19thcentury, the Tinker family lived at Shepley Carr. Ebenezer Tinker was {{responsible}} for building Tinker's Monument near Hill Top above New Mill. Deeds held at the West Yorkshire Archive Centre in Wakefield suggest that the original house at Shepley Carr dates from the 16thcentury and was owned by the Armytage Family of Kirklees Hall. The house was owned by the Bentley family from 1947 until 2002 after Harry Lawton Bentley, a local textile manufacturer, bought the hamlet by auction. Family members {{still live in the}} hamlet. Shepley Carr is now owned and occupied by the Wimpenny family, who own the historic Huddersfield building firm of the same name. Locals believe that Oliver Cromwell marched his army through Shepley Carr during the English Civil War 1642–1649. Roundheads, as the soldiers were known, were probably in Kirkburton, and at Catlin or Catling (now Cat Hill) Hall near Penistone, the latter having a holding post in the cellars upon which royalist prisoners were chained. Inside the parish church at Upper Cumberworth, there is a <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have sat in.|$|E

500|$|Art {{director}} Randy McIlvain led the set re-creation for the Enterprise and K7, {{describing the}} excitement over {{working on the}} episode as [...] "contagious". McIlvain spent {{a fair amount of}} time getting the window angles correct on the sets. Mike Okuda re-created the graphics seen on the Enterprise sets using a computer, whilst others were re-drawn by artist Doug Drexler. Some sets were not re-created in full, such as the bridge, which required parts of it to be later added digitally. The captain's chair from the bridge re-creation was later one of the Star Trek items to be auctioned by Christie's. Set designer Laura Richarz watched [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] carefully looking for small details to replicate on the new sets, such as the legs of benches in the bar on K7. However, she said her biggest challenge was tracking down the chairs seen on the space station. She contacted John M. Dwyer, who had worked on the original episode. He explained to her that the company which created the original chairs had gone out of business. After searching shops selling retro furniture, the production team found a single <b>chair</b> <b>that</b> matched those seen in the original episode.
