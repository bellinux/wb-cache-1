40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of breathing type and body position on sternocleidomastoid and suprahyoid electromyographic (EMG) activity. The sample included 18 subjects with upper <b>costal</b> <b>breathing</b> type (study group) and 15 subjects with costo-diaphragmatic breathing type (control group). All individuals had natural dentition and bilateral molar support. EMG recordings at rest and while swallowing saliva were carried out by placing surface electrodes on the left sternocleidomastoid and left suprahyoid muscles. EMG activity was recorded while standing, seated upright, and in the lateral decubitus position. Upper <b>costal</b> <b>breathing</b> type subjects showed a significantly higher suprahyoid EMG activity at rest than costo-diaphragmatic subjects in all body positions studied (mixed model with unstructured covariance matrix). In the lateral decubitus position, both breathing types showed a significantly higher sternocleidomastoid EMG activity at rest and while swallowing saliva. The suprahyoid muscles demonstrated a significantly higher EMG activity at rest as well as in the lateral decubitus position (mixed model with unstructured covariance matrix). These results are relevant because sternocleidomastoid and suprahyoid muscles play an important role in controlling the head posture and mandible dynamics. The neurophysiological mechanisms involved are discussed...|$|E

Methodology: This study included 50 healthy male subjects with complete natural dentition, and {{no history of}} orofacial pain or craniomandibular-cervical-spinal disorders. Subjects were classified into two groups: upper <b>costal</b> <b>breathing</b> type, and costo-diaphragmatic breathing. Bipolar surface electrodes were located on sternocleidomastoid, diaphragm, external intercostal, and latissimus dorsi muscles. Electromyographic activity was recorded during the following tasks: (1) normal quiet breathing; (2) speaking the word ‘Mississippi’; (3) swallowing saliva; and (4) forced deep breathing. Results: Sternocleidomastoid and latissimus dorsi EMG activity was not significantly different between breathing types, whereas diaphragm and external intercostal EMG activity was significantly higher in the upper costal than costo-diaphragmatic breathing type in all tasks (P, 0. 05; Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test). Conclusion: Diaphragm and external intercostal EMG activity suggests {{that there could be}} differences in motor unit recruitment strategies depending on the breathing type. Dentaid S.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} why Japanese people are poor at {{speaking}} English is that they are unaware of {{the difference between the two}} ways of breathing: abdominal breathing and <b>costal</b> <b>breathing.</b> When each Japanese letter is pronounced, it almost always comes with a vowel sound in which case the vocal chords vibrate. On the other hand, when the English language is pronounced, a lot of consonant sounds are used on their own, i. e. they do not come with vowel sounds in which case the vocal chords do not vibrate. Because Japanese people vibrate their vocal chords when they speak their own language, abdominal breathing is not necessarily used; in other words, when Japanese people speak Japanese, their speaking does not require them to inhale a lot of air and store it inside their abdomen or exhale the air without vibrating their vocal chords. However, since native speakers of English use a lot of consonant sounds, they frequently use abdominal breathing, which requires them to store a lot of air inside their abdomen and exhale it with a gust of air without vibrating their vocal chords. Consequently, while reading English aloud, Japanese people inhale and exhale air more frequently than the native speakers of English because the former do not frequently use abdominal breathing to utter sounds; instead, they vibrate their vocal chords. This difference in the ways of breathing makes it difficult for Japanese people to utter English sounds. Since Japanese people also use abdominal breathing while doing physical exercise, singing a song, performing a play on the stage, etc., singing English songs in English is a good way for Japanese people to learn how native speakers of English breathe, which leads to good pronunciation of English language for Japanese people. 資...|$|E
40|$|Swimmers {{depend on}} {{accessory}} breathing muscles for adequate ventilation. Pectoralis minor is an accessory breathing muscle. The daily repetition of gleno-humeral flexion and medial rotation results in adaptive shortening of Pectoralis, a common phenomenon in competitive swimmers. If Pectoralis minor is shortened the scapula {{is in an}} anteriorly tipped position. This anteriorly tipped position will affect scapula kinematics {{as well as the}} strength of Pectoralis minor to function as an accessory breathing muscle. One of the risk factors contributing to shoulder dysfunction in competitive swimmers is an altered scapular position. The study aimed to determine if lateral <b>costal</b> <b>breathing</b> dissociation exercises in conjunction with scapular retraining exercises had an effect on the position of the scapula in competitive swimmers. A comparative parallel group longitudinal design was used in this study. During a six week supervised intervention period the intervention group (n= 28) and control group (n= 30) did retraining of the scapula stabilisers and stretching of Pectoralis minor. The intervention group did breathing dissociation exercises to facilitate lateral <b>costal</b> <b>breathing.</b> No specific breathing exercises were facilitated within the control group. Pectoralis minor length and thoracic expansion had been measured. The function of the scapula stabilisers was evaluated. The resting as well as dynamic scapula positions were evaluated. Evaluations were done at baseline, six weeks and five months post intervention. Treatment groups were compared with respect to change from baseline to six weeks and baseline to five months in PMI, FVC and thoracic expansion utilizing analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates baseline reading. The intervention group showed an increase in the Pectoralis minor Index (PMI) of 0. 5 (left & right) and the control group reflected an increase of 0. 5 (left) and 0. 7 (right). The intervention group reflected continuous improvement in PMI and the control group showed deterioration. In addition to the PMI upper thoracic, expansion decreased and lower thoracic expansion increased in the intervention group. The control group showed a decrease in upper and lower thoracic expansion. Groups were compared with respect to change from baseline to six weeks and five months respectively for categorical parameters, muscle function and scapula position (resting and dynamic) using Fisher’s exact test. After six weeks the intervention group showed significantly (p< 0. 04) less winging of the distal third of the scapula on the left side when compared to the control group. After five months the scapula showed significantly less tipping (p< 0. 02) during gleno-humeral flexion, on the left side. The McNemar test for symmetry had been applied to determine if any within group changes occurred. Within the intervention group ten of the thirteen markers used to determine the resting position of the scapula, reflected significant improvement compared to the six markers in the control group. Only the intervention group reflected remarkable improvement in function of the lower fibres of Trapezius muscle. Serratus anterior and middle fibres of Trapezius muscles showed significance within group improvement in function for both groups. The scapula showed significantly less dysrhythmia within the intervention group on the left and right sides (p< 0. 0209) when compared to the control group. After five months the resting scapula position reflected deterioration for both groups. Dysrhythmia and winging of the scapula deteriorated from six weeks to five months for both groups. The muscle function of the lower fibres of Trapezius showed significance within group changes for both groups from six weeks to five months. The ability to contract Serratus anterior and the middle fibres of Trapezius agonistically was maintained from six weeks to five months. However the eccentric control and ability to contract the muscle without fatigue within the Serratus anterior and middle fibres of Trapezius showed deterioration from six weeks to five months for both groups. Conclusion: The increase in PMI and increase in lower thoracic expansion for the intervention group could favour swimmers to breathe more effectively. An increase in Pectoralis minor length resulted in a more posteriorly tipped scapula. This better positioned scapula promotes optimum function of the lower fibres of Trapezius. Contracting from a stable scapula, Pectoralis minor can fulfil its function as an accessory breathing muscle more effectively.
