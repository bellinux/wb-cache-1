50|$|A <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> is a non-planar wing {{that uses}} a {{continuous}} surface, eliminating the <b>wing</b> tips. <b>Closed</b> <b>wing</b> designs include the annular wing (commonly known as the cylindrical or ring wing), the joined wing, the box wing and spiroid tip structures.|$|R
50|$|An {{aircraft}} was also designed and constructed with a <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> in Belarus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>wing</b> {{surfaces}} feature several {{structural and}} aerodynamic properties. The boxplane may achieve minimal induced drag {{for a given}} lift, wingspan, and vertical extent. Annular and joined wings can achieve span efficiencies greater than 1, and the annular wing exhibits half the vortex drag of a monoplane wing of the same span and lift. However, the concept of eliminating the influence of tip vortices through use of <b>closed</b> <b>wings</b> is an ill-conceived notion, according to Dr. Ilan Kroo, Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. There {{appears to be no}} particular advantage to a fully closed design; despite a decrease in local loading on any given point on the wing, the circulation is constant, thereby causing no change in the wake, and thereby the lift and interference drag associated with the surface. For this reason, <b>closed</b> <b>wings</b> remain mostly confined to the realms of studies and conceptual designs, as the engineering challenges of developing a strong, self-supporting <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> for use in the large airliners which would benefit most from increases in efficiency have yet to be overcome. The C-wing benefits from many of the drag-reducing benefits of a <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> design without the downsides of being a fully closed system.|$|R

50|$|A <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> can {{be thought}} of as the maximum {{expression}} of a wingtip device, which has the aim of eliminating the influence of the wingtip vortices which occur at the tips of conventional wings. These vortices form a major component of wake turbulence and are associated with induced drag, which negatively affects aerodynamic performance in most regimes. A <b>closed</b> <b>wing</b> surface has no wingtips whatsoever, and thus is capable of greatly reducing or eliminating wingtip drag, which has great implications for the improvement of fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Some {{variants}} may {{be duplicated}} under {{more than one}} heading, due to their complex nature. This is particularly so for variable geometry and combined (<b>closed)</b> <b>wing</b> types.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Satyrinae in the family Nymphalidae. A similar species is the meadow brown; the two species can be difficult to distinguish with <b>closed</b> <b>wings</b> since the underwing markings are very similar.

At the conceptual design stage a large number of variants are created, from which, after being analyzed, the base variant is selected.
