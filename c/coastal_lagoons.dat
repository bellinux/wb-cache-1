5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in facies of <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but a few are preserved within sandy units.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, swampy <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} at 10 enzyme loci was analysed in Elysia timida sacoglossan mollusc samples, {{originating from}} both <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoon</b> and marine sites. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0. 390 (Los Urrutias) to 0. 277 (Tabarca). Marine and <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoon</b> populations were characterised by exclusive alleles. Examination of the spatial structure was performed using Nei’s distances and F-statistics, and indicated significant genetic differences between marine groups and <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoon</b> populations. Multivariate analysis of allele frequencies {{also suggested that}} different arrays of genotypes prevail in <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoon</b> samples compared to marine ones. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5|$|Starting {{early on}} May 29, the outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Barbara brought torrential rains to several states and power outages to Oaxaca, Chiapas, Guerrero, and Veracruz. Rainfall {{in the country}} peaked at 19 in (470mm). In Ocosingo, 10 in (220.5mm) fell in a 24‑hour period. Upon making landfall, Barbara struck a largely undeveloped stretch of <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> {{containing}} small fishing villages. In Acapulco, however, torrential rains caused severe flooding on roads leading to resorts, while damaging some highways. In all, considerable damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E

25|$|Five {{terrestrial}} ecoregions extend {{across the}} state. The Southern Pacific dry forests {{lie on the}} southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly deciduous during the long dry season. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic orchids, butterflies, and birds. The Balsas dry forests lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including jaguarundi, coati, ocelot, and collared peccary. The northernmost {{part of the state}} includes portions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin.

50|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> form along gently sloping coasts where {{barrier islands}} or reefs can develop off-shore, and the sea-level is rising {{relative}} to the land along the shore (either because of an intrinsic rise in sea-level, or subsidence of the land along the coast). <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> do not form along steep or rocky coasts, or if the range of tides is more than 4 m. Due to the gentle slope of the coast, <b>coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are shallow. They are sensitive to changes in sea level due to global warming. A relative drop in sea level may leave a lagoon largely dry, while a rise in sea level may let the sea breach or destroy barrier islands, and leave reefs too deep under water to protect the lagoon. <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are young and dynamic, and may be short-lived in geological terms. <b>Coastal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are common, occurring along nearly 15 percent of the world's shorelines.
