5000|$|... 14. The CAG {{says that}} {{competitive}} bidding {{could have been}} introduced in 2006 by amending the existing administrative instructions. This premise of the CAG is flawed.15. The observation of the CAG {{that the process of}} competitive bidding could have been introduced by amending the administrative instructions is based on the opinion expressed by the Department of Legal Affairs in July and August 2006. However, the CAG's observation is based on a selective reading of the opinions given by the Department of Legal Affairs.16. Initially, the Government had initiated a proposal to introduce competitive bidding by formulating appropriate rules. This matter was referred to the Department of Legal Affairs, which initially opined that amendment to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act would be necessary for this purpose.17. A meeting was convened in the PMO on 25 July 2005 which was attended by representatives of coal and lignite bearing states. In the meeting the representatives of state governments were opposed to the proposed switch over to competitive bidding. It was further noted that the legislative changes that would be required for the proposed change would require considerable time and the process of allocation of coal blocks for captive mining could not be kept in abeyance for so long given the pressing demand for coal. Therefore, it was decided in this meeting to continue with the allocation of coal blocks through the extant Screening <b>Committee</b> <b>procedure</b> till the new competitive bidding procedure became operational. This was a collective decision of the centre and the state governments concerned.18. It was only in August 2006 that the Department of Legal Affairs opined that competitive bidding could be introduced through administrative instructions. However, the same Department also opined that legislative amendments would be required for placing the proposed process on a sound legal footing. In a meeting held in September, 2006, Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs categorically opined that having regard to the nature and scope of the relevant legislation, it would be most appropriate to achieve the objective through amendment to the Mines & Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act.|$|E

A comparison of bill committee activity {{in the first decade}} of the twenty-first century with the last comprehensive examination undertaken in 1974 shows that significant changes have taken place; bill committees appear to be working harder than ever before but this is not reflected in terms of the rela-tive impact they are making on government legislation.

40|$|In parliaments, {{the tasks}} of {{drafting}} legislation and conducting oversight are accomplished by means of complex chains of spoken, written and multimodal texts. In these genre chains, information is recontextualized from one text to another before being debated in sittings of the houses of parliament. This study employs {{the point of view}} afforded by linguistic ethnography to investigate critically the ways in which meanings are recontextualized in one section of such a genre chain, namely the process by which committees of South Africa's National Assembly oversee the budgets of government departments and state-owned entities. It does this to identify possible sources of communication difficulties in this process and suggest ways in which these can be minimized. In so doing, it develops a theoretical model of the discursive effects of recontextualization informed by Latour's (1987) notion of black-boxing as well as Maton's (2011) Legitimation Code Theory. This model uses Interactional Sociolinguistics and elements of Systemic Functional Linguistics, including APPRAISAL and Transitivity as tools to describe the realization of these effects in language. This study finds that ideational and interpersonal meanings are condensed and decondensed at particular points in the genre chain in ways that lead to some MPsâ€™ voices being recontextualized more accurately than othersâ€™. It also shows that common sources of communication difficulties in the committee process include differences in political background and understandings of <b>committee</b> <b>procedure</b> and participant roles. It recommends that representatives of departments and entities reporting to the committees should receive a fuller prebriefing on their roles; that MPs should receive training on asking clear, focused questions; and that the role of committee secretaries as procedural advisors should be strengthened...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{arrangements}} concluded between European institutions contribute to the separation of powers underlying the European Unionâ€™s political system. The point of departure is an analysis of different separation of powers models. The author posits that the European Unionâ€™s political system is best interpreted against the background of a â€˜separation of institutionsâ€™, implying that no European institution should exercise its legal powers in an unchecked manner. This approach builds on the Court of Justiceâ€™ institutional balance doctrine. It differs from the more traditional constitutional law theory known as â€˜trias politicaâ€™ according to which no government authority ought to combine two â€˜governmental functionsâ€™. Seen from this perspective, separation of powers is a matter of autonomous institutions subject to â€˜checks and balancesâ€™. Some checks and balances find their basis in EU law. However, many others are based on arrangements between the European institutions. Many of such arrangements are not based on law. An enquiry into the possible general legal bases for such interinstitutional agreements finds all of them unsound. Driessen argues that interinstitutional arrangements without a legal basis (â€˜interinstitutional conventionsâ€™) cannot be legally enforceable. Although there are differences, to a certain extent they can be equated to the â€˜constitutional conventionsâ€™ known in British constitutional law. An analysis of such interinstitutional conventions suggests their omnipresence in European constitutional practice. The study analyses the effects of interinstitutional arrangements on different fields of EU law. This includes, inter alia, an analysis of the political responsibility of the Commission and of its members towards the European Parliament, of the interinstitutional conventions that govern the Parliamentâ€™s rights of oversight, and those governing legislative procedures, the budgetary procedure and external relations. The analysis shows that many interinstitutional conventions are important instruments for the daily management of the Union. Other interinstitutional conventions concern the details of the relations between the institutions. They can tangibly affect the balance of influence between the European institutions. For example, in the budgetary field, the European Parliament successfully used interinstitutional agreements to ensure that about one half of expenditure is subject to its approval as non-compulsory expenditure. Additionally, it acquired some control over the remainder through the financial perspectives, which are equally based on interinstitutional conventions. Driessen researches the limitations on the use of such interinstitutional arrangements. Although they certainly cannot replace the procedures foreseen in European law, they can affect such them. Jurists often fail to notice {{the extent to}} which this happens. The study is based on current law but also takes on board the changes proposed in the Constitutional Treaty.

The mediating factors that influenced the developmental processes included the participants and their perceptions, their decisions and factors influencing their decisions. The Curriculum and Instruction Advisory Committee of the Texas Learning Technology Group was selected as the subject of this study which used qualitative data collection methods. Data collection included participant observation of curriculum meetings followed by structured interviews of the participants. Document analyses were triangulated with the observations and interviews to ascertain influences on decision-making processes.

40|$|By what means can {{legislative}} committees exercise {{influence on}} policy outputs? How {{and why do}} committees in different countries differ in their abilities to do so? This dissertation argues that legislative committee power is a multidimensional concept. <b>Committee</b> <b>procedures</b> can be distinguished into three analytic dimensions: 1) committees' positive agenda power, their power to ensure the placement of legislative versions preferred by them on the floor; 2) committees' negative agenda power, their power to delay or block the progress of legislation; and 3) committees' information capacity, institutional incentives granted to them to gather and transmit information. These distinct dimensions benefit different legislative actors. Therefore, they reflect different features of a political system, {{and may not be}} consistently strong or week. Based on an original cross-national data set, the dissertation shows that <b>committee</b> <b>procedures</b> cluster empirically in these three distinct dimensions. Furthermore, the dissertation also demonstrates how legislators' electoral incentives, the composition of multiparty governments, preexisting authoritarian incumbents' uncertainty and bargaining power, and the changes in legislative memberships affect different dimensions of committee power.
