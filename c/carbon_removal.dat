Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after anaerobic treatment (cases of water reuse with nutrients). If maximal energy recovery is desired, a single anaerobic process will be always superior to a combination with a membrane process.|$|E

50|$|RCBR {{technology}} is totally a water biological treatment system, {{able to make}} more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> and, at the same time, the ammonium nitrification. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).|$|E

Removals and {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) were calculated along the whole forest sector, including the forest ecosystem, the industrial processing of wood and the stages of use and final disposal of forest products. The greenhouse gas balance was calculated by subtracting to the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal,</b> the fossil carbon emissions and the additional emissions of carbon as CH 4. Two different approaches were applied for estimating the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> in the sector: the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approach. The global greenhouse gas balance was a net removal of carbon that varied between 401 and 1033 Gg Ceq yr- 1, respectively with the stock-change and the atmospheric-flow approaches. The difference between the two estimates is equivalent to the carbon exported in wood and forest products. Both forest and forest products were carbon sinks, as their stocks have been increasing. About 94 % of the total change in carbon stocks in the sector was due to forest, whereas paper was the forest product with the major contribution to the increase of carbon stocks. Fossil carbon emissions accounted for 13 % of the total carbon emissions in the sector and decreased the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> by 18 and 34 %, respectively with the atmospheric-flow and the stock-change approaches. Carbon emitted as CH 4 was of minor importance and, consequently, was responsible for a decrease in the net <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> of only 4 and 8 %, respectively with the atmospheric-flow and the stock-change approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalyst}} Ru/TiZrO 4 {{was applied}} in the degradation of Isophorone by catalytic wet air oxidation. Mathematical models {{for the effects of}} reaction conditions on the Isophorone degradation by catalytic wet air oxidation were developed using a response surface methodology. A model was obtained for each response with multiple regression analysis and then was refined. Analysis of variance revealed that the models developed were adequate. The validity of the models was also verified by experimental data. Analysis of response surface showed that total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> and Isophorone conversion were significantly affected (P <= 0. 01) by reaction time, temperature and their interactions, and affected (P <= 0. 05) by the square of reaction time. The point of zero charge of Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst was about 1. 72. The total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> and Isophorone conversion had a great association with the zeta potential of Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst. Finally, the degradation pathway of Isophorone in catalytic wet air oxidation was proposed. Within 410 h, the total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removal</b> remained above 95 %, indicating that the Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst had a good stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods: Adult female sheep (n = 6, 33. 8 ± 5. 2 kg) {{were subjected to}} intratracheal cotton severe smoke insufflation to a mean carboxyhemoglobin level of 83 % ± 3 %. Twenty-four hours after injury, a low-resistance 2. 5 m 2 membrane oxygenator {{was placed in a}} carotid-to-jugular pumpless arteriovenous shunt at unrestricted flow to allow complete <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> and reductions in ventilator support. Animals remained conscious, and heart rate, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure were measured at baseline, after injury, and daily during support with the arteriovenous <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> circuit for 7 days. Results: All animals survived the study period. <b>Carbon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> ranged from 99. 7 ± 13. 7 to 152. 2 ± 16. 2 ml/min, and five (83 %) of the six animals were successfully weaned from the ventilator before day 7. During full support with the arteriovenous <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> circuit, shunt flow ranged from 1. 24 ± 0. 06 to 1. 43 ± 0. 08 L/min and accounted for 20. 1 % ± 1. 4 % to 25. 9 % ± 2. 4 % of cardiac output.
