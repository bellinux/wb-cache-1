5|$|During the 1920s {{there was}} a dirt {{airstrip}} known as Dutch Flats {{in what is now}} the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma. That is where <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> first tested and flew his airplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, which had been built in San Diego by the Ryan Aeronautical Company. A U.S. Post Office now located on the site contains several historic plaques commemorating Dutch Flats and Lindbergh.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed the He 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM.

5|$|On November 21, 2006, Meader {{was awarded}} the title of honorary member of the American Geographical Society and was invited to sign her name on its Fliers' & Explorers' Globe. This {{was part of a}} {{tradition}} spanning back to the 1920s in which noted explorers are asked to place their signature on the Globe. Meader was the 79th to do so. Other signers of the globe include <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh,</b> Amelia Earhart, Sir Edmund Hillary, Robert Peary, Richard Byrd, and the astronauts on Apollo 8. Meader was one of only three people to sign it twice; across East Africa and the Andes.|$|E
5|$|The airport opened July 8, 1929, {{on a site}} {{selected}} by <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh,</b> as the eastern air terminus of the Transcontinental Air Transport air-rail New York to Los Angeles transcontinental route. Passengers traveled overnight on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Airway Limited from New York to Columbus; by air from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma; by rail again on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe from Waynoka to Clovis, New Mexico; and by air from Clovis to Los Angeles. The original terminal building and hangars are still in use; the hangars are still in use, but the old terminal sits derelict.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|The land, sited at two {{sharp bends}} in the McCloud River, was named by {{financial}} adviser Edward Clark {{for the local}} Native American tribe of the Wintun people. Beginning as a humble fishing resort, the land was improved {{by a series of}} people, notably San Francisco attorney Charles Stetson Wheeler, his client Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and her son William Randolph Hearst who disputed with his cousin over ownership. Prominent structures, noted for their architecture, have been built on the land, some lost to fire, while other multimillion-dollar buildings were planned, but not built. Famous visitors to Wyntoon include Clark Gable, <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh,</b> Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and his son John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1904 World's Fair, {{ballooning}} {{was demonstrated}} {{as a viable}} means of transportation; in October 1907, the second Gordon Bennett Cup, an international balloon racing event, {{was held in the}} city. The first airplane flight occurred in late 1909, and by the next year, an airfield had been established in nearby Kinloch, Missouri. In October 1910, St. Louis hosted President Theodore Roosevelt, who became the first president to fly in an airplane after departing from the field. In 1925, local entrepreneur Albert Lambert purchased Kinloch Field, expanded its facilities, and renamed it Lambert Field. In May 1927, <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> departed from Lambert Field en route to New York to begin his solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. In early 1928, the city of St. Louis purchased the airport from Lambert, making it the first municipally owned airport in the United States; Lambert remains the area's primary airport.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh,</b> who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Museum is {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} visitor's center, in the renovated Olmsted Hall {{on the grounds of}} the former Ladycliff College. Originally opened to the public in 1854, the West Point Museum is the oldest military museum in the country. During the summer months, the museum operates access to the Fort Putnam historic site on main post and access to the 282 acre Constitution Island. Some of the most notable items on display at the museum are George Washington's pistols, Napoleon's sword, a dagger carried by Hermann Goering when he was captured, a revolver that belonged to Goering, and a silver-plated party book, signed by <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh,</b> Herbert Hoover and Mussolini, among others. Arguably, the most prized artifact on display is a gold-plated pistol that belonged to Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds. When <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by <b>Charles</b> <b>Lindbergh</b> revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|E
