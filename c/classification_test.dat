Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General <b>Classification</b> <b>Test</b> (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E

After {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War in June 1950, he became Inspector General, United Nations Command in Korea. Called upon to investigate the poor performance of the 24th Infantry, he attributed it not to the regiment being predominantly African-American, but to the fact that 62 percent of its men were in categories IV and V on the Army General <b>Classification</b> <b>Test</b> - the lowest scores. Zundel recommended that units of the Far East Command, including those fighting in Korea, be racially integrated by assigning replacements to units regardless of race.|$|E
25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable <b>classification</b> <b>test</b> {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology—through {{the armed forces}} and in the new Office of Strategic Services intelligence agency. University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941, and [...] "the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the United States Government." [...] Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy. The Army rolled out its new General <b>Classification</b> <b>Test</b> and engaged in massive studies of troop morale. In the 1950s, the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency to fund research on psychological warfare.

40|$|Reckase (1983) {{proposed}} a widely used method of applying the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT; Wald, 1947) to computerized <b>classification</b> <b>testing</b> with item response theory. This method formulates the classification problem {{as a point}} hypothesis that an examinee’s ability, θ, is equal to a point, θ 1, below the cutscore or a point, θ 2, above the cutscore. The current paper argues that the actual goal of <b>classification</b> <b>testing</b> is a composite hypothesis (Weitzman, 1982) that an examinee’s ability θ is {{in the region of}} θ either above or below the cutscore, rather than equal to an arbitrarily defined point.

40|$|Computerized {{adaptive}} tests (CATs) {{were originally}} developed {{to obtain an}} efficient estimate of the examinee’s ability, {{but they can also}} be used to classify the examinee into one of two or more levels (e. g. master/non-master). These computerized <b>classification</b> <b>tests</b> have the advantage that they can also be tailored to the individual student’s ability. Computerized <b>classification</b> <b>tests</b> require a method that decides whether testing can stop and which decision with the desired confidence can be made. Furthermore, a method to select the items is required. In <b>classification</b> <b>testing</b> for unidimensional constructs, items are often selected that attempt to measure optimal at either the cutoff point(s) or the student’s current ability estimate. Four methods were developed that combined the efficiency of the first approach with the adaptive item selection of the second approach. Their efficiency and accuracy was investigated using simulations. Several methods are available to make the classification decisions for constructs modeled with an unidimensional item response theory model. But if the construct is multidimensional, few classification methods are available. A classification method based on Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test was developed for application to CAT with a multidimensional item response theory model in which each item measures multiple abilities. Seitz and Frey’s (2013) method to make classifications per dimension, when each item measures one dimension, was adapted to make classifications on the entire test and on parts of the test. Kingsbury and Weiss’s (1979) popular unidimensional classification method, which uses the confidence interval surrounding the ability estimate, was also adapted for multidimensional decisions. Simulation studies were used to investigate the efficiency and accuracy of the classification methods. Comparisons were made between different item selection methods, between different classification methods and between different settings for the <b>classification</b> methods. <b>Tests</b> can be used for formative assessment, formative evaluation, summative assessment, and summative evaluation.

40|$|Computer-adaptive <b>classification</b> <b>tests</b> {{focus on}} {{classifying}} respondents in different proficiency groups (e. g., for pass/fail decisions).

Results of two simulation experiments with generated and real responses (N 2, 000) to established personality scales of different length (12, 20, or 29 items) demonstrate that adaptive item presentations significantly reduce the number of items required to make such classification decisions while maintaining a consistent classification accuracy.
