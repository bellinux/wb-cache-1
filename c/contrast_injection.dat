40|$|SUMMARY The {{applications}} of {{digital subtraction angiography}} (DSA) in neurologic diagnosis have been evolving as clinical experience with this technology accumulates. Initial enthusiasm with the intravenous <b>contrast</b> material <b>injections</b> has been tempered by often equivocal results. Intravenous DSA (IV-DSA) is still an accurate screening technique for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis, comparable to duplex ultrasound. Intracranial imaging is less satisfying with intravenous injections but reliable information {{is available in the}} assessment of the venous sinuses and parasellar internal arteries. The future of DSA lies with intraarterial <b>contrast</b> <b>injections,</b> as this technique substantially decreases the risks and costs of definitive cerebrovascular investigation...|$|R

2500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} imaging techniques {{are used to}} demonstrate PSS. Ultrasonography is a rapid, convenient, non-invasive, and accurate method for diagnosis of PSS. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of congenital PSS depends on finding an anomalous vessel either in the liver or just caudal to the liver in the dorsal abdomen, usually draining into the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography {{can also be used}} to estimate hepatic volume and vascularity, and to identify related lesions affecting other abdominal structures, such as urinary calculi. Computed tomography (CT) may be considered when ultrasound expertise is lacking or ultrasonography is considered sub-optimal (e.g. because of the conformation of the patient). Control of respiration and careful timing of CT acquisition after <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> is necessary for optimal depiction of PSS. Rectal portal scintigraphy using 99mtechnetium pertechnetate, a technique of imaging involving detection of gamma rays emitted by radionuclides absorbed through the rectum and into the bloodstream, demonstrates the blood vessel bypassing the liver. [...] In certain institutions, scintigraphy is the preferred diagnostic technique, but this leaves the patient radioactive for 24h, which may be inconvenient depending on nursing needs. Portal venography is the definitive method for demonstrating PSS, but is invasive, hence it is best reserved for animals with a known shunt or those considered highly likely to have a shunt that was not detectable by ultrasonography.|$|E

40|$|Patent foramen ovale (PFO) {{is found}} in 27 % of the {{population}} and although mostly asymptomatic, PFO has been associated with e. g. cryptogenic stroke and, rarely, also with oxygen desaturation. PFO and atrial septal defects may nowadays be closed percutaneously without open heart surgery. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition, characterised by cessation of ventilation due to collapse of the upper airways and oxygen desaturation of varying degree. The availability for percutaneous closure was studied in 66 consecutive patients with an indication for closure of an interatrial shunt and 58 % of the patients were found to be available. A descriptive study on 51 consecutive patients with atrial septal defect hypothesised that balloon sizing of the defect during percutaneous closure can be replaced by the size measured with pre-catheterisation transesophageal echocardiography. The results showed that the differences between measurements were too large for substituting pre-catheterisation size for balloon sizing. The influence of PFO on the frequency of oxygen desaturations in proportion to the frequency of ventilation disturbances in obstructive sleep apnea was studied in a case control study. The presence of a PFO was assessed with contrast transesophageal echocardiography and ≥ 20 bubbles passing over to the left atrium was considered as a large PFO. The prevalence of large PFOs was 9 out of 15 (60 %) cases with frequent desaturations, versus only 2 out of 15 controls (13 %) (p= 0. 02) with infrequent desaturations, in proportion to the frequency of ventilation disturbances. The effect of increasing numbers of <b>contrast</b> <b>injections</b> during transesophageal echocardiography, on the sensitivity for PFO detection, was studied. The sensitivity increased with increasing numbers of <b>contrast</b> <b>injections</b> and to safely rule out the presence of a PFO, up to five <b>contrast</b> <b>injections</b> were needed. In conclusion, interatrial shunts can often be closed percutaneously and balloon sizing {{is an important part of}} the procedure. Nocturnal oxygen desaturation occurred proportionally more often in obstructive sleep apnea subjects with a PFO than in subjects without a PFO, indicating the importance of right-to-left shunting in obstructive sleep apnea subjects with a concomitant PFO. Furthermore, sensitivity for PFO detection increased with increasing numbers of <b>contrast</b> <b>injections</b> during transesophageal echocardiography...|$|R

METHODS: Contrast was injected twice during each of 10 provocations to 30 patients screened for PFO. Injections were given during quiet respiration, early Valsalva (starting 3 - 5 seconds before injection), late Valsalva (starting 3 - 5 seconds after injection), Mueller maneuver, coughing, bed tilt during early Valsalva, after nitroglycerin spray during both quiet respiration, and early Valsalva. RESULTS: The number of detected PFOs increased {{as the number of}} injections increased (r = 0. 79, P <. 01). Five injections per patient detected all 11 large PFOs. To eventually detect all 14 PFOs among the 30 study patients required a total of 11 injections per patient.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To measure {{myocardial}} perfusion {{using an}} estimate of intramyocardial vascular volume obtained by electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in an animal model; to assess the feasibility and validity of measuring regional myocardial perfusion in human volunteers using the techniques developed and validated in the animal studies.  METHODS—Measurements of myocardial perfusion with EBCT employing intravenous <b>contrast</b> <b>injections</b> were compared with radioactive microsphere measurements (flow 57  to 346  ml/ 100 g/min) in seven closed chest dogs. Fourteen human volunteers then underwent EBCT scans using intravenous <b>contrast</b> <b>injections.</b>  RESULTS—Mean (SEM) global intramyocardial vascular volume by EBCT was 7. 6  (1. 1) %. The correlation between global EBCT (y) and microsphere (x) perfusion was y =  0. 59 x +  15. 56  (r =  0. 86) before, and y = 0. 72 x +  6. 06  (r =  0. 88) after correcting for intramyocardial vascular volume. Regional perfusion correlation was y =  0. 75 x +  23. 84  (r =  0. 82). Corresponding improvements in agreement between the two techniques were also seen using Bland-Altman plots. In the human subjects, mean resting global myocardial flow was 98  (6) ml/ 100 g/min, with homogeneous flow across all regions. In 10  of these subjects, perfusion was studied during coronary vasodilatation using intravenous adenosine. Global flow increased from 93  (5) ml/ 100 g/min at rest to 250  (19) ml/ 100 g/min during adenosine (p <  0. 001), with an average perfusion reserve ratio of 2. 8  (0. 2). Similar changes in regional perfusion were observed and were uniform throughout all regions, with a mean regional perfusion reserve ratio of 2. 8  (0. 3).  CONCLUSIONS—Accounting for intramyocardial vascular volume improves the accuracy of EBCT measurements of myocardial perfusion when using intravenous <b>contrast</b> <b>injections.</b> The feasibility of providing accurate measurements of global and regional myocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve in people using this minimally invasive technique has also been demonstrated.    Keywords: electron beam computed tomography; cardiac imaging; myocardial blood flow; indicator dilutio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} assess the impact of <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> and {{harmonic}} imaging, on the measure by echocardiography of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. BACKGROUNDLeft ventricular remodeling is a precursor of LV dysfunction, but the impact of <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> and harmonic imaging on the accuracy or reproducibility of echocardiography is unclear. METHODSWe prospectively collected LV images by using simultaneous methods. Then, LV volumes were measured off-line, in blinded manner and in random order. The accuracy of echocardiography was determined in comparison to electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 26 patients. The reproducibility of echocardiography was assessed by three blinded observers with different training levels in 32 patients. RESULTSEnd-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF), as measured by EBCT (195 ± 55, 58 ± 24 and 137 ± 35 ml and 71 ± 5 %, respectively) and echocardiography with harmonic imaging and <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> (194 ± 51, 55 ± 20 and 140 ± 35 ml and 72 ± 4 %, respectively), showed no differences (all p > 0. 15) and excellent correlations (all r > 0. 87). In contrast, echocardiography using harmonic imaging without <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> underestimated the EBCT results (all p 0. 18). Consequently, intrinsic patient differences represented a larger and almost exclusive proportion of global variability with <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> for EDV (94 vs. 79 %), ESV (93 vs. 82 %), SV (87 vs. 53 %) and EF (84 vs. 41 %), as compared with harmonic imaging without <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> (all p < 0. 005). CONCLUSIONSFor assessment of LV remodeling, echocardiography with harmonic imaging and <b>contrast</b> <b>injection</b> improved the accuracy and reproducibility, as compared with imaging without <b>contrast</b> <b>injection.</b> With <b>contrast</b> <b>injection,</b> variability was almost exclusively due to intrinsic patient differences.
