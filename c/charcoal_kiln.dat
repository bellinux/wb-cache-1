50|$|The Cottonwood <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns,</b> {{traditional}} {{stone masonry}} 'beehive' <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns,</b> were built to transform wood from trees in Cottonwood Canyon above the lake into charcoal, {{to feed the}} Cerro Gordo mines' silver and lead smelters across the lake at Swansea. The ruins are located on the southern side of the lakebed near Cartago. They were similar to the nearby Panamint <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns</b> near Death Valley. The kilns are identified as California Historical Landmark #537.|$|R
5000|$|The Wildrose <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns</b> (completed 1877) are {{ruins of}} <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> located near Wildrose Canyon in the {{northern}} range and within Death Valley National Park. They were built in 1877 by the Modock Consolidated Mining Company, to provide fuel for smelters near their lead and silver mines in the Argus Range. The ten beehive shaped masonry structures, about 25 ft tall, are the best known surviving examples of such <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> in the western U.S.|$|R

40|$|Charcoal was {{the primary}} fuel used for iron {{smelting}} and processing {{until the end of}} the 19 th century. It was produced through burning piles of wood called <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns.</b> The aim of the study was to identify and record traces of <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> related to past ironworks in the valley of the River Czarna (Małopolska Upland, Central Poland). Detailed analysis was conducted in areas adjacent to historical centres of iron processing in Maleniec, Kołoniec and Machory. A quantitative analysis of the traces of <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> in the topography was done based on DEM from airborne LiDAR. Soil profiles were analysed at the sites where traces of <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> were identified from DEM. Radiocarbon dating and palaeobotanical analyses were performed for selected <b>charcoal</b> from <b>kiln</b> remnants. In the study area we identified over 11, 500 <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns.</b> The radiocarbon age of these charcoals indicate that the <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> under study were used in the 15 th, 18 th and 19 th century. Thus the results suggest that the iron industry in the studied area is c 100 years older than the historical written sources indicate. Palaeobotanical analyses show that coniferous trees were used for charcoal production. The large number of traces of <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> and their wide spatial distribution indicate that past charcoal production has had a significant impact on the environment and landscape change in the River Czarna valley and adjacent areas...|$|R

50|$|A {{charcoal}} pile is {{a carefully}} arranged pile of wood, covered by turf or other layer, inside which a fire is lit {{in order to}} produce charcoal. The pile is tended by a charcoal burner. It is similar to a <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln,</b> but the latter is usually a permanent structure made of e.g. stone.|$|E
50|$|Making {{charcoal}} is {{a tradition}} that goes back {{a long time in}} the Siegerland, owing mainly to another long tradition, iron smelting. In Walpersdorf is found the Siegerland's only <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln</b> that is still used. The charcoal is made out of oak, birch and beech, yielding roughly one tonne of charcoal for every four of wood.|$|E

50|$|The logging industry, as a {{commercial}} venture, became well established in Piedmont as well. Moses Byrne constructed <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> in Piedmont during 1877. Five in total were built, {{at a cost of}} fifteen hundred dollars. Quaking aspen and pine logs were hauled by ox teams to the kilns where they were burned into charcoal. The Union Pacific Railroad Company used the charcoal as fuel for the passenger cars. The three surviving Piedmont <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns</b> were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.|$|R
50|$|She rarely {{thought of}} {{anything}} besides making mischief. The colliers in Kilsbergen {{were afraid to}} go to sleep because as soon as she saw an unguarded <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln,</b> she would sneak in and puff on the fire so that it would start burning brightly. If the ore transporters were late transporting their ore from Laxå and Svartå, Ysätters-Kajsa would create so much dark fog that both people and horses would get lost and end up driving into nearby marshes and swamps.|$|E
5000|$|The Walker <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kiln</b> is a {{structure}} in the Prescott National Forest near the ghost town of Walker, Arizona. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A sign posted near the kiln reads, [...] "This kiln was constructed around 1880 by Jake and Joe Carmichael to convert oak wood into charcoal for use at nearby smelters. The surrounding forest was cut so heavily for charcoal and mine props in the late 1800s {{that it is just}} now becoming productive again." ...|$|E

Their principal features are orchards and cereals of yesteryear; botanical, medieval, and herb gardens; beehives; dry stone walls; and a <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln.</b> The gardens contain a range of local heirloom plants including more than 60 varieties of vines; 23 types of olive trees; fruits and berries including arbutus, elderberry, jujube, loquat, and mulberry; and vegetables from the Middle Ages including cabbage, chicory, leeks, lettuce, onions, spinach, turnips, and white beans.|$|E
50|$|The Tybo <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns</b> are {{a pair of}} <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> located 4 mi {{north of}} Tybo, Nevada. Both kilns are 30 ft tall and 25 ft in {{diameter}} and were built from rocks and mud. The kilns each have three openings: a top opening, a door at ground level, and a rear window with a ramp for wood wagons. The kilns were among 15 built in 1874 for the Tybo Consolidated Company. The company, which mined the region's silver, used charcoal to fuel its smelting furnace. To acquire its fuel, it imported wood from nearby hills, which it then converted to <b>charcoal</b> in the <b>kilns.</b>|$|R

Cutting in the period 1876 - 1879 is indicated by tree-ring dating for 26 trees presumed to have been utilized as material for the nearby <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Kilns...</b>|$|R
50|$|The two “chequy” {{fields are}} a {{reference}} to the village’s former allegiance to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim. The charge in dexter base, the cutaway view of a <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln,</b> refers to Langweiler’s more recent history after the Thirty Years' War; Langweiler was then said to be the village of charcoal makers and lumberjacks. The charge in sinister chief is an old baptismal font, named in the German blazon simply as a Gefäß (“vessel”). This once stood in the local church, and is about 150 cm tall. It can now be found standing in the local graveyard.|$|E
50|$|In {{yet another}} venture in 1873, Toponce and three {{partners}} built a canal from the Malad River south into Corinne. The canal mostly provided power for a grist mill in the town, {{although there was}} some flow left over for irrigation. Toponce and another set of partners also started a <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln</b> in Wyoming, shipping the fuel to the lead-silver smelters operating east of Salt Lake City. In 1878-1881, the Utah and Northern Railway finally connected northern Utah with Butte, Montana. During the years of construction, the railroad steadily took business away from the animal-powered freight companies. Thus, {{over the course of}} the decade, Toponce had phased out that part of his business, although he continued to lease trains to other operators.|$|E
50|$|Even {{in ancient}} times, {{charcoal}} was manufactured in kilns. Logs were {{arranged in a}} conical heap (a <b>charcoal</b> <b>kiln</b> or pile) around posts, a fire shaft was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the fire shaft and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350 °C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the kiln, the charcoal burner could assess {{the state of the}} carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the mines}} {{themselves}} were worked intermittently until about 1900, {{there is no}} clear evidence that the <b>charcoal</b> <b>kilns</b> were operational after 1879. They were restored by Navajo Indian stonemasons from Arizona in 1971.|$|R
