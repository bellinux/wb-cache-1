[...] Pryce claimed that through notes, Despard had offered him unlimited sums of money in exchange for advice on making underground bombs. [...] Despard, it was alleged, had sent him a diagram of boxes with spring locks containing three powder barrels surrounded by balls and metal spikes. [...] These were to be buried under the road and detonated by <b>connecting</b> <b>wire.</b> [...] Bombs were {{to be placed in}} three locations: the road to Windsor Castle, between Buckingham House and Hyde Park gate, and an exit of Buckingham House, opposite the gate into the lower part of Green Park.|$|E

So also, {{when the}} {{conductor}} n was connected {{only with the}} muriatic acid gas apparatus, {{it was found that}} the discharge was more facile when the small ball s was negative than when positive; for in the latter case, much of the electricity passed off as brush discharge through the air from the <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> p but in the former case, it all seemed to go through the muriatic acid.|$|E
6000|$|... 1066. As {{the superiority}} of a helix over a wire is {{important}} to the philosophy of the effect, I took particular pains to ascertain the fact with certainty. A wire of copper sixty-seven feet long was bent in the middle so as to form a double termination which could be communicated with the electromotor; one of the halves of this wire was made into a helix and the other remained in its extended condition. When these were used alternately as the <b>connecting</b> <b>wire,</b> the helix half gave by much the strongest spark. It even gave a stronger spark than when it and the extended wire were used conjointly as a double conductor.|$|E

6000|$|I may {{be allowed}} under these {{circumstances}} to remark, that I experimented on this subject several years ago, and have published results. (See Quarterly Journal of Science for July 1825, p. 338.) The following also is an extract from my note-book, dated November 28, 1825: [...] "Experiments on induction by <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> of voltaic battery:--a battery of four troughs, ten pairs of plates, each arranged side by side--the poles connected by a wire about four feet long, parallel to which was another similar wire separated from it only by two thicknesses of paper, {{the ends of the}} latter were attached to a galvanometer:--exhibited no action, &c. &c. &c.--Could not in any way render any induction evident from the connecting wire." [...] The cause of failure at that time is now evident (79.).--M.F. April, 1832.|$|E
6000|$|... 1090. The {{double helix}} (1053.) was {{arranged}} {{so that it}} should form the <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> between the plates of the electromotor, in being out of the current, and its ends unconnected. In this condition it acted very well, and gave a good spark {{at the time and}} place of disjunction. The opposite ends of ii were then connected together so as to form an endless wire, i remaining unchanged: but now no spark, or one scarcely sensible, could be obtained from the latter at the place of disjunction. Then, again, the ends of ii were held so nearly together that any current running round that helix should be rendered visible as a spark; and in this manner a spark was obtained from ii when the junction of i with the electromotor was broken, in place of appearing at the disjoined extremity of i itself.|$|E

Sulphate of soda in {{solution}} was then experimented with, {{for the purpose}} of ascertaining with respect to it, whether a certain electrolytic intensity was also required for its decomposition in this state, in analogy with the result established with regard to water (974). The apparatus was arranged as in fig. 85; P and Z are the platina and zinc plates dipping into a solution of common salt; a and b are platina plates connected by wires of platina (except in the galvanometer g) with P and Z; c is a <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> of platina, the ends of which can be made to rest either on the plates a, b, or on the papers moistened in solutions which are placed upon them; so that the passage of the current without decomposition, or with one or two decompositions, was under ready command, as far as arrangement was concerned. In order to change the anodes and cathodes at the places of decomposition, the form of apparatus fig. 86, was occasionally adopted. Here only one platina plate, c, was used; both pieces of paper on which decomposition was to be effected were placed upon it, the wires from P and Z resting upon these pieces of paper, or upon the plate c, according as the current with or without decomposition of the solutions was required.|$|E

50|$|Resistors above about 1 ohm {{in value}} can be {{measured}} {{using a variety of}} techniques, such as an ohmmeter or by using a Wheatstone Bridge. In such resistors, the resistance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result.|$|R
6000|$|... 1195. The {{inductive}} apparatus described is evidently a Leyden phial, {{with the}} advantage, however, {{of having the}} dielectric or insulating medium changed at pleasure. The balls h and B, with the <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> i, constitute the charged conductor, upon the surface of which all the electric force is resident by virtue of induction (1178.). Now though the largest portion of this induction is between the ball h and the surrounding sphere aa, yet the wire i and the ball B determine {{a part of the}} induction from their surfaces towards the external surrounding conductors. Still, as all things in that respect remain the same, whilst the medium within at oo, may be varied, any changes exhibited by the whole apparatus will in such cases depend upon the variations made in the interior; and these were the changes I was in search of, the negation or establishment of such differences being the great object of my inquiry. I considered that these differences, if they existed, would be most distinctly set forth by having two apparatus of the kind described, precisely similar in every respect; and then, different insulating media being within, to charge one and measure it, and after dividing the charge with the other, to observe what the ultimate conditions of both were. If insulating media really had any specific differences in favouring or opposing inductive action through them, such differences, I conceived, could not fail of being developed by such a process.|$|E

50|$|In 1800, Volta stacked several {{pairs of}} {{alternating}} copper (or silver) and zinc discs (electrodes) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in brine (electrolyte) {{to increase the}} electrolyte conductivity.

Since terminal blocks are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that <b>connecting</b> <b>wires</b> is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{solutions}} that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's Disengaging Gear in 1881, and this system {{was still in}} use in the late 20th century.The Robinson's Disengaging Gear consists of three mechanisms. There are two disengaging hooks, one {{at each end of}} the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two disengaging hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the disengaging release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> rope is called the [...] "Fore and After". The disengaging hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each disengaging hook.|$|E

Before Kettering can finish, Alice exits the spiral cone and appears on the scaffolding. Kettering climbs up to rescue her, but being possessed, she refuses to come with him. She pulls a pistol and shoots him, and he falls to his death. Glenn fires the harpoon gun, making the connection to the overhead transmission lines, which engulfs the grounded metal cone in high-voltage sparks. Alice collapses as the parasites inside the object are electrocuted. Sen. Powers and Glenn crawl inside and verify that the menace has been eliminated. Later, as Glenn and Elaine walk away from the site, they embrace.|$|E

50|$|The support-point of the {{connection}} turns with the Earth and is depicted as freely suspended above the Earth. The plane of the pendulum swing does not turn with the support point and is not affected by the turning of the support point. The bob is free to swing in any direction {{in relation to the}} support (refer to a Charron chuck). For a pendulum at the pole, the plane of swing remains aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. A spot on the bob, however, turns with the support since the bob is not independent of the support point. The spot on the bob does not remain aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. This occurs whether the pendulum is swinging or not. If the bob is not allowed to turn with the support-point one twist of the <b>connecting</b> <b>wire</b> will occur in one day at the pole. If {{the connection}} apparatus of the pendulum to the bob and to the support were in a fixed relationship (and the connection not allowed to twist, for example, using a rigid rod pinned into place between two sides of the support), then once the plane of the pendulum swing is established in one direction, that plane would be forced to turn with the support and connection. The Earth's rotation would not be observable in relation to the pendulum swing with this type of connection.|$|E
