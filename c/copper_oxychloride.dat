50|$|Most {{diseases}} {{come from}} the uncharacteristic growing conditions of vanilla. Therefore, conditions such as excess water, insufficient drainage, heavy mulch, overpollination, and too much shade favor disease development. Vanilla is susceptible to many fungal and viral diseases. Fusarium, Sclerotium, Phytophthora, and Colletrotrichum species cause rots of root, stem, leaf, bean, and shoot apex. These diseases can be controlled by spraying Bordeaux mixture (1%), carbendazim (0.2%) and <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> (0.2%).|$|E
50|$|Control {{is mainly}} {{attempted}} via regular protective application of copper fungicides, specifically copper hydroxide and <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride.</b> Increased application schedules are recommended in moist climates and seasons.Benomyl, the systemic benzimidazole fungicide, {{has also been}} used as a means to control mango scab infection, but has been out of production since 2001. Reduction of inoculum is also essential for control of this disease. Due to its saprotrophic lifestyle, inoculum can survive on fallen leaves and dead twigs long term, which necessitates the removal or destruction of dead plant material to prevent disease spread.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control is}} often {{necessary}} to conserve yield. Chemical control targets the initial inoculum, {{reducing the amount}} of mycelium and sporangia present. In west Africa chemicals are applied using spray tanks. Fungicides such as <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> Mancozeb, and Metalaxyl+Mancozeb are typically used. Mixtures of these chemicals can be used to prevent the pathogen from acquiring resistance to certain chemical compounds. Spraying is recommended four times a year from the last week of May {{to the end of the}} growing period. Growing a cocoa variety with resistance has an additive control effect with chemical control.|$|E
5000|$|A copper {{pesticide}} is {{a copper}} compound {{used as a}} pesticide or fungicide. In the UK the Soil Association (one of the organic certification authorities) permits farmers to use some copper fungicides on organic land used {{for the production of}} certified organic crops only if there is a major threat to crops. [...] The compounds permitted are copper sulfate, copper hydroxide, cuprous oxide, <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> copper ammonium carbonate (at a maximum concentration of 25 g/l), and copper octanoate. According to the Soil Association the total copper that can be applied to organic land is 6kg/ha/year. This limit is designed so that the amount of copper in the soil does not exceed the limits specified in the Soil Association standards for heavy metals.|$|E
50|$|Damping off can be {{prevented}} or controlled in several different ways. Sowing seeds in a sterilized growing medium can be effective, although fungal spores may still be introduced to the medium, either on the seeds themselves or after sowing (in water or on the wind). To reduce survival of the pathogens, remove and discard diseased plants, and sterilize containers to remove dust, planting medium, and soil particles in which spores can survive. Maintaining drier conditions with better air circulation helps {{prevent the spread of}} the disease, although it can also prevent or slow down germination. Spraying or drenching the soil with a recommended anti-fungal treatment (such as <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride)</b> also helps suppress the disease. Homemade solutions (including ones made from chamomile tea or garlic) are used by some gardeners for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Aspergillus ochraceus is a mold {{species in}} the genus Aspergillus known to produce the toxin {{ochratoxin}} A, {{one of the most}} abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins, and citrinin. It also produces the dihydroisocoumarin mellein. It is a filamentous fungus in nature and has characteristic biseriate conidiophores. [...] Traditionally a soil fungus, has now began to adapt to varied ecological niches, like agricultural commodities, farmed animal and marine species. In humans and animals the consumption of this fungus produces chronic neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Its airborne spores are one of the potential causes of asthma in children and lung diseases in humans. The pig and chicken populations in the farms are the most affected by this fungus and its mycotoxins. Certain fungicides like mancozeb, <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> and sulfur have inhibitory effects on the growth of this fungus and its mycotoxin producing capacities.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practices}} of managing olive peacock spot disease aim to have consistent suppression {{by keeping the}} levels of inoculum low and through preventative measures. This is {{because there is no}} way to treat this disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed onto the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, and so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> tribasic copper sulfate, and copper oxide. A few of these have been legally classified as organic.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control Fungicides {{that may}} be used to {{effectively}} control N. galligena are limited. Infection by N. galligena often occurs through wounds in the autumn and spring-summer period, therefore, it is recommended that fungicides be applied at these times. The application of fungicides will prevent or decrease the sporulation of existing cankers, which in turn decreases the inoculum available to spread the pathogen. Fungicides may also protect trees from N. galligena through a fungitoxic deposit over favorable infection sites. A mixture of carbendazim and a scab fungicide, such as dithianon, is the suggested treatment in areas with a severe canker problem. In areas with a reduced risk of canker, it is recommended that a scab fungicide be applied in the spring-summer and <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> applied at leaf-fall to avoid infection. Although scab fungicides are commonly used for managing apple scab, cankers are also controlled when applied at the correct time. Thiophanate-methyl is another fungicide that is highly effective because it protects trees against the pathogen and suppresses sporulation of already infected plants. However, the application of thiophanate-methyl is limited due to its harm on organisms such as mites.|$|E
50|$|In 1761, the {{experiment}} was expanded, and the 32-gun frigate HMS Alarm was ordered to have her entire bottom coppered, {{in response to the}} terrible condition in which she had returned from service in the West Indies. HMS Alarm was chosen because, in 1761, a letter had been sent regarding the ships condition, saying that the worms from the waters had taken a significant toll on the ship’s wooden hull. Before the copper plates were applied, the hull was covered with Soft stuff, which was simply hair, yarn and brown paper. The copper performed very well, both in protecting the hull from worm invasion and in preventing weed growth for, when in contact with water, the copper produced a poisonous film, composed mainly of <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> that deterred these marine organisms. Furthermore, as this film was slightly soluble, it gradually washed away, leaving no way in which marine life could attach itself to the ship. However, it was soon discovered by the Admiralty that the copper bolts used to hold the plates to the hull had reacted with the iron bolts used {{in the construction of the}} ship, rendering many bolts nearly useless. In 1766, because of the poor condition of the iron bolts, Alarms copper was removed.|$|E
50|$|ULV fogging {{machines}} {{can be used}} in {{a number}} of different industries. Some applications includes pest control: mosquito control, bird control, agricultural applications such as grain storage, disinfectant purposes such as hospitals and laboratories, mold control and surface decontamination. A specific application for ULV machines that have been well researched is protecting avocado trees from different diseases. The most common diseases that these trees are prone to suffer from includes Cercospora spot, anthracnose and stem-end rot. The diseases affecting the avocado trees are controlled by applying high volume <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> fungicides to the trees. The original application techniques included the use of a hand gun sprayer. This technique posed the problem of high run-off of the formulation. The use of ULV machines for the application of the pesticide formulation yielded more than 80 percent healthy fruit that was free from Cercospora spot. These results compared very favorably with the traditional method of using a hand gun sprayer. Another industry that have benefited substantially from the technology provided by ULV fogging machines is the chicken industry. This industry suffers great losses due to the litter beetle and Aspergillus fungi. ULV fogging machines offers great solutions to kill both these pests in chicken houses.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides like mancozeb, <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride,</b> and sulfur inhibit Aspergillus ochraceus {{growth at}} {{appropriate}} doses, temperature and time. These fungicides also decrease {{the capacity of}} this fungus to produce the mycotoxin OTA. Ozonated air {{can be used to}} prevent the growth of this fungus on foods products like sausages. In another study they found that, gamma irradiations are useful in the detoxification and inactivation of ochratoxin A (OTA). The ethonolic extracts from the bark of the tree Clausena heptaphylla, has shown to inhibit the growth of this fungus as well. Fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs), extracted from Linum usitatissimum seeds, have been found to reduce the radial hyphal growth of Aspergillus ochraceus, even though slightly less than [...] "Aspergillus flavus". In a very similar fashion, some essential oils extracted from aromatic plants, have shown to have fungicidal effects on Aspergillus ochraceus that colonized pulses. In animals too, {{attempts have been made to}} cure (OTA) toxicosis. For example, in the White Leghorn cockerel, chronic haematological damage caused by (OTA) exposure can be reduced by exogenous supplementation using a combination of L-carnitine and vitamin E. Recently an alcohol producing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to inhibit the growth of OTA. Transcriptional regulation of OTA biosynthetic gene was the inhibitory mechanism used by the bacteria to do so. Dietary exposure to OTA today is mainly a result of failures during processing and conservation procedures used by food industries. Improper agricultural technology, storage and transport practices as well as method of processing food are key checkpoints to avoid toxic consumption of OTA.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus licheniformis strain SB3086 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a biological control agent of mango anthracnose infection, and also shows some antagonistic effects toward powdery mildew infections when applied in combination with <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride.</b> One current issue with the use of B. licheniformis as a control agent is that no reliable means has been developed for maintaining the bacterial population over the long term. The other major issue with the use of this species as a biopesticide is that it has been potentially identified as causing illnesses such as food poisoning in humans, as well as several other diseases in animals. It is currently approved in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in controlling fungal diseases on ornamental plants and turf, but cannot be applied to any crop intended for consumption by animals or humans. Ampelomyces quisqualis is another biological control agent, this being a fungus that is capable of parasitizing O. mangiferae. It was registered with the EPA as a biopesticide in 1994, used for powdery mildew control on various fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops. It has been deemed safe for use on crops intended for human and animal consumption, with no adverse side effects anticipated. It is marketed with the trade name “AQ10”, and is available in powder format. Several varieties of A. quisqualis that are resistant to commonly used fungicides are also available, so that regular fungicide applications may also be used in combination with the biopesticide. Pycnidia are produced within the mycelia and conidiophores of the powdery mildew, leading to reduced growth or colony death. The limitation of this parasite as a biocontrol agent is that it requires that some of the pathogen be present to act as a host for its growth. In plant species and cultivars with little or no powdery mildew resistance, the small amount of pathogen growth may cause an unacceptable amount of damage before A. quisqualis can control the fungus.|$|E

In an experiment lasting 8 weeks, newly hatched earthworms of the species E. fetida were exposed to <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> mixed into a urine-free cattle manure substrate. Four groups of 10 worms were used per concentration level (control (4. 02), 8. 92, 15. 92, 39. 47, 108. 72, 346. 85 mg Cu kg substrate- 1). The following life-history parameters were measured: earthworm growth in consecutive weeks, survival rate, maturation time, cocoon production, reproduction success, total number of hatchlings produced, and incubation time. Earthworm growth and cocoon production were significantly reduced at <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure concentrations of 8. 92 mg kg- 1 and higher.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Botany and Zoology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2001. <b>Copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> (Cu 2 CI(OH) 3) is a broad-spectrum fungicide, intensively sprayed in many South African {{vineyards}} and orchards. It {{is necessary}} to find accurate and effective methods of monitoring {{the effects of this}} fungicide on the biota of the agricultural environment. The use of biomarkers may be a possible method to employ for this purpose. This study investigated the effects of copper, as a result of <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure, on the biology of the common garden snail Helix aspersa, as welI as a number of cellular responses to exposure to the fungicide. The possible use ofthese responses as biomarkers was also investigated. Two groups of snails were exposed to 80 and 240 tJg g-! <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> respectively, for six weeks. A third group served as control. On a weekly basis, body mass, number of eggs produced, neutral red retention (NNR) times of haemocytic lysosomes, and body copper concentrations were determined for each individual. At the end of the experiment, the digestive glands, ovotestes and hermaphrodite ducts of a number of snails were prepared for histological analysis. The following parameters were investigated: tubule area, epithelium height and area in the digestive gland, spermatozoan area in the vesicula seminalis and ovotestis, as wen as oocyte numbers in the ovotestis. To test the validity of the laboratory results, a field survey was conducted. Snails were colIected from an uncontaminated vineyard and on two occasions from a contaminated vineyard in the Western Cape. The same cellular responses were investigated as in the laboratory study. The results showed that growth, egg production and hatching success in Helix aspersa were affected by experimental exposure to <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride.</b> In both the laboratory study and field survey, copper in the body of H. aspersa was shown to be compartmentalized and the digestive gland was the most important site of copper accumulation. NNR times of haemocytic Iysosomes were shown to be affected by <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure, already {{during the first week of}} exposure. A time evolution of copper accumulation and lysosomal damage existed. Epithelium height and area of digestive gland tubules, and spermatozoan and oocyte densities in the ovotestis, were also affected by <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure and the concomitant copper burdens in the respective organs. Through the field survey it was ascertained that these histopathological changes were largely dependent on exposure time. It was concluded that lysosomal response of H. aspersa haemocytes, as measured by the NNR time assay, could be considered a useful biomarker of <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure, since it provides an early warning of stress induced by this fungicide. Changes in digestive gland epithelium cells, and gametes in the ovotestis, can also possibly serve as biomarkers of <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> exposure. However, these can not serve as an early warning. All of the cellular responses identified in the present study can be used in combination with other cellular and physiological parameters and toxicological endpoints in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of interpretations regarding cause and effect...|$|E

Lag phases and growth rates were determined for each fungicide at different doses, at 15 ºC and 25 ºC and at 0. 97 aw. Mancozeb at 40 mg L- 1 inhibited fungal growth and provided lag phases > 24 days at 10 - 20 mg L- 1 and 15 ºC. OTA was observed only at 25 ºC and doses <b>copper</b> <b>oxychloride</b> > sulfur and was lower at 25 ºC than at 15 ºC. OTA accumulation was affected by the fungicide, dose, temperature and time. The efficacy of these fungicides on the growth of A. carbonarius and A. ochraceus and OTA production in barley-based medium is assessed for the first time...|$|E
