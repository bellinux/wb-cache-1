Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic <b>chloride</b> <b>ion.</b> Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates {{produce their}} {{pharmacological}} effects {{by increasing the}} duration of <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel opening at the GABAA receptor (pharmacodynamics: This increases the efficacy of GABA), whereas benzodiazepines increase {{the frequency of the}} <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel opening at the GABAA receptor (pharmacodynamics: This increases the potency of GABA). The direct gating or opening of the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel is the reason for the increased toxicity of barbiturates compared to benzodiazepines in overdose.|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} coefficient for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> and the diffusion decay coefficient for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> are essential variables for a service life evaluation of concrete structures. They {{are influenced by}} water-binder ratio, exposure condition, curing temperature, cement type, and the type and use of mineral admixture. Mineral admixtures such as ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash, and silica fume have been increasingly used to improve resistance against <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> penetration in concrete structures built in an offshore environment. However, {{there is not enough}} measured data to identify the statistical properties of diffusion decay coefficient for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in concrete using mineral admixtures. This paper is aimed at evaluating the diffusion decay coefficient for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> of concrete using ordinary Portland cement or blended cement. NT BUILD 492 method, an electrophoresis experiment, was used to measure the {{diffusion coefficient}} for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> with ages. It was revealed from the test results that the diffusion decay coefficient for <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> was significantly influenced by W/B and the replacement ratio of mineral admixtures...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{is prone}} to {{corrosion}} induced by <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> which is {{a serious threat to}} reinforced concrete structures, especially in marine environments. In this work, we report a novel capsule-based selfrecovery system that utilizes <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> as a trigger. These capsules, which are functionalized via a smart response to <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> are fabricated using a silver alginate hydrogel that disintegrates upon contact with <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> and thereby releases the activated core materials. The experimental results show that the smart capsules respond to a very low concentration of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> (0. 1 wt%). Therefore, we believe that this novel capsule-based self-recovery system will exhibit a promising prospect for self-healing or corrosion inhibition applications.

40|$|<b>Chloride</b> <b>ions</b> {{attack is}} the main factor leading to the {{degradation}} of concrete durability, while the diffusion process would be significantly aggravated under the dynamic flexural loading and dry-wet cycles. In this paper, the influence coefficients of dynamic flexural loading on chloride/water diffusion coefficients were established, based {{on the relationship between}} the dynamic flexural loading and the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> diffusion coefficient of concrete. Based on the model of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> transporting in dry-wet cycle environment, the transport model of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in concrete under the dynamic flexural loading and dry-wet cycles was established. The effects of different factors on the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> transport law in concrete were analyzed through laboratory test. The results showed that the model was in good agreement with the experimental results. The theory and assumptions proposed applied in the model of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> transport in concrete under the dynamic flexural loading and dry-wet cycles had certain rationality and scientificity...|$|R
25|$|During {{postnatal}} development, KCC2 {{levels are}} strongly upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) {{than it would be}} at rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.|$|E
25|$|There is cross {{tolerance}} between alcohol, the benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, and corticosteroids, {{which all}} act by enhancing the GABAA receptor's function via modulating the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel {{function of the}} GABAA receptor.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} H+ from the HCl {{produces}} the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion,</b> Cl−, the conjugate {{base of the}} acid. The addition of H+ to the H2O (acting as a base) forms the hydronium ion, H3O+, the conjugate acid of the base.|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} {{congenital}} myotonia {{due to a}} mutation in CLCN1, the ion channel admits too few <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> into the cell. This shortage of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> causes prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia.|$|R
50|$|Differences in {{transport}} number {{arise from}} differences in electrical mobility. For example, {{in a solution}} of sodium chloride, {{less than half of}} the current is carried by the positively charged sodium ions (cations) and more than half is carried by the negatively charged <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> (anions) because the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> are able to move faster, i.e., <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> have higher mobility than sodium ions. The sum of the transport numbers for all of the ions in solution always equals unity.|$|R
40|$|Detection of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> {{is crucial}} to {{accurately}} access the concrete structure durability[1]. The existing electrochemical method of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> detection in concrete, potentiometry[1], is not suitable for in-situ measurement due to the long term stability issue of conventional reference electrode (RE) inside concrete...|$|R
25|$|Alcohol is {{classified}} as a sedative hypnotic drug. Alcohol produces a sedative effect by acting on receptors of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. GABA receptors contain a binding site for the chemical, GABA, a <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel, and an additional binding site for alcohol molecules.|$|E
25|$|Friedel–Crafts {{alkylation}} {{involves the}} alkylation of an aromatic ring with an alkyl halide using a strong Lewis acid catalyst. With anhydrous ferric chloride as a catalyst, the alkyl group attaches {{at the former}} site of the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion.</b> The general mechanism is shown below.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the reduction potentials in reactions 2 and 4, {{the reduction of}} <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> is favored. Thus, if the Cl− ion is favored for reduction, then the water reaction is favored for oxidation producing gaseous oxygen, however experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the corrosion behavior of Cu 37 Zn brass in borate buffer solutions at various pH, with and without the addition of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> The results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} anodic current densities depend on pH and <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> The current density increased in pH interval from 8. 0 to 9. 3 in borate buffer solutions without <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> In a sodium tetraborate solution with the addition of Cl- ions, current density decreased in pH interval from 8. 0 t...|$|R
50|$|In this process, the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> at the anode are {{converted}} to chlorine gas.

40|$|In order do {{decrease}} the penetrability of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in concrete {{the use of}} paintings based on polymers {{can be a good}} solution. The use of acrylic paintings is recommended because they have good resistance to ultraviolet radiation. It is important to quantify the decrease of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> penetrability obtained by the use of this kind of paintings. The durability of the polymeric paintings is another aspect that needs to be analysed. In this study an acrylic painting was used to protect the concrete and {{decrease the}} penetrability of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> The concrete used was a C 12 / 15, with a cement content of 280 kg/m 3 and a water-cement ratio of 0. 60. The acrylic painting was applied in concrete specimens 28 days after casting. In order to have a better protection we applied two coats separated by 5 hours. The penetrability of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> was measured following the ASTM standard C 1202 – 94. Before the penetrability tests, some specimens were exposed to UV radiation. The exposition to the light occurred by cycles consisting of alternating periods of 8 hours of UV radiation at 60 ºC and 16 hours without UV radiation at 50 ºC. Three kinds of exposition were made consisting on 5, 10 and 15 cycles. The results showed always a high penetrability of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> This occurred because a poor concrete was used. The protection by an acrylic painting decreases the penetrability of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions.</b> The charge passed decreased about 32 %. However, is not possible to achieve low <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> penetrability only with the use of acrylic paintings. It is necessary also the use of a good concrete with low porosity. After the exposition to the UV radiation the penetrability of <b>chlorides</b> <b>ions</b> did not increase. It seems that the UV radiation does not affect the properties of the acrylic painting...|$|R
25|$|Both KCC2 isoforms {{can form}} homomultimers, or heteromultimers with other K-Cl symporters {{on the cell}} {{membrane}} to maintain chloride homeostasis in neurons. Dimers, trimers, and tetramers involving KCC2 {{have been identified in}} brainstem neurons.

25|$|At the {{subcellular}} level, KCC2 {{has been}} found in membranes of the somata and dendrites of neurons, with no evidence of expression on axons. KCC2 has also been shown to colocalize with GABAA receptors, which serve as ligand-gated ion channels to allow <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> movement across the cell membrane. Under normal conditions, the opening of GABAA receptors permits the hyperpolarizing influx of chloride ions to inhibit postsynaptic neurons from firing.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam modulates {{specific}} GABAA receptors via the benzodiazepine {{site on the}} GABAA receptor. This modulation {{enhances the}} actions of GABA, causing an increase in opening frequency of the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> channel which results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the GABAA receptors. Quazepam, unique amongst benzodiazepine drugs selectively targets type1 benzodiazepine receptors which results reduced sleep latency in promotion of sleep. Quazepam also has some anticonvulsant properties.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{shows that}} the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> {{enhancement}} ratio is {{of the order of}} 3 to 7, which is 2 to 3 times greater than that produced by oxygen during irradiation. Adding sodium chloride to food patient increases the amount of water, and the amount of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> inside the tumor cells. This process provides excellent route for hydroxyl radical production during irradiation. The present work suggests that <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> must add to patient food at the highest concentration allowed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the nucleation of copper on glassy carbon from acid sulphate solutions was studied by measuring potentiostatic current transients (the chronoamperometry method). It {{was found that}} instantaneous nucleation occurred at the surface for solutions without additives. The initial stage of copper nucleation did not change on addition of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> but gradually changed from progressive nucleation to instantaneous nucleation at increasing potentials {{in the presence of}} PEG. <b>Chloride</b> <b>ions</b> and PEG increase the nucleation rate and the nuclear number density of nuclei at the surface...|$|R
50|$|It was {{discovered}} that mercury thiocyanate can improve detection limits in the determination of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in water by UV-visible spectroscopy. This technique was first suggested in 1952 {{and has been a}} common method for determination of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in laboratories worldwide ever since. An automated system was invented in 1964 and then a commercial chloroanalyzer was made available in 1974 by Technicon (Tarrytown, NY, USA). The basic mechanism involves the addition of mercury thiocyanate to a solution with unknown concentration of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> and iron as a reagent. The <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> cause the mercury thiocyanate salt to dissociate and the thiocyanate ion to bind Fe(III), which absorbs intensely at 450 nm. This absorption allows for the measurement of concentration of the iron complex. This value allows one to calculate the concentration of chloride.|$|R
25|$|Alcohol {{acts as a}} {{positive}} allosteric modulator and therefore amplifies the transmitter’s inhibitory effects. When alcohol molecules bind to its site on the GABA receptor, they lengthen {{the time that the}} receptor’s <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> pore remains open, resulting in an even greater hyperpolarization of the membrane. Additionally the binding of alcohol causes the GABA transmitter to bind to its receptors more frequently, and therefore augments the transmitter’s ability to inhibit cell activity.|$|E
25|$|Optical phonons are {{out-of-phase}} {{movements of}} the atoms in the lattice, one atom moving to the left, and its neighbour to the right. This occurs if the lattice basis consists {{of two or more}} atoms. They are called optical because in ionic crystals, like sodium chloride, they are excited by infrared radiation. The electric field of the light will move every positive sodium ion {{in the direction of the}} field, and every negative <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> in the other direction, sending the crystal vibrating.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} has one big disadvantage, {{namely that}} the product is more nucleophilic than the reactant due to the electron donating alkyl-chain. Therefore, another hydrogen atom is substituted with an alkyl-chain, which leads to overalkylation of the molecule. Also, if the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> is not attached to a tertiary carbon atom or secondary carbon atom, then the carbocation formed (R+) will undergo a carbocation rearrangement reaction. This reactivity {{is due to the}} relative stability of the tertiary and secondary carbocation over the primary carbocations.|$|E
40|$|Many {{articles}} {{have shown that}} polyethylene glycol (PEG), when combined with <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> is a strong suppressor of copper overpotential deposition (OPD) on a copper substrate. However, few {{articles have}} explored the roles of PEG and <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in copper underpotential deposition (UPD) when the cathodic substrate was polycrystalline gold. The individual roles and the interactions of PEG and <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> during Cu UPD on a polycrystalline gold electrode were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV). According to the CV patterns, {{a small amount of}} <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> strongly facilitated the Cu UPD at a more positive potential; PEG alone exhibited a similar CV pattern to that of the additive-free case. PEG significantly promoted the accelerating effect of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> on Cu UPD, a result that is the opposite of what occurred during Cu OPD. A mechanism by which PEG-Cl accelerates Cu UPD was proposed. This mechanism also indirectly suggests that the suppressor of Cu OPD should be PEG-Cu+-Cl, which could not form during Cu UPD on the polycrystalline gold electrode...|$|R

The concrete ages at the coating installation and its moisture conditions were addressed; where, these two factors may play a dominant role for the effectiveness of the used materials. Rapid <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> penetration test (RCPT) was conducted at different ages and moisture conditions according to the relevant standard. In addition, the contaminated area and the penetration depth of the <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> were investigated immediately after the RCPT test using chemical identifier, 0. 1 M silver nitrate AgNO 3 solution.

25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, {{which in turn}} increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water in}} a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing <b>chloride</b> <b>ion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the <b>chloride</b> <b>ion</b> is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E

In this study, ultrasound was used to detect the presence and binding of <b>chloride</b> <b>ions</b> in cement pastes that contained supplementary cementing materials. Four cement pastes with w/c ratio of 0.55 were prepared and cast into cylindrical specimens that were moist cured for 254  days before being oven dried at 105  °C.

The results indicated exponential relationships between energy/amplitude weighted average frequency and the amount of chloride chemically bound by the cement pastes.|$|R
40|$|Photocatalytic {{degradation}} of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) was studied in a continuous-flow set-up using a titanium microreactor with an immobilized double-layered TiO 2 nanoparticle/nanotube film. <b>Chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> formed during the degradation process, negatively affect the photocatalytic efficiency {{and at a}} certain concentration (approximately 0. 5 mM) completely stop the reaction in the microreactor. Two proposed mechanisms of inhibition with <b>chloride</b> <b>ions,</b> competitive adsorption and photogenerated-hole scavenging, have been proposed and investigated by adsorption isotherms and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements.
