40|$|One of {{the most}} debated {{questions}} {{in the literature on}} modern bureaucracies is whether their formal, impersonal rules of decision endow them (rightly or not) with a specific autonomy vis‐à‐vis special interests. We study the case of the Bureau de Commerce, a small, modernizing agency within the illiberal Ancien Régime French monarchy, in charge i. a. of supporting private entrepreneurs. Decision making was founded on the articulation between a vertical administrative organization aimed at collecting information and consulting stakeholders, and two colleges of experts, which discussed cases on a <b>consensual,</b> peers’ <b>basis.</b> We ask whether the relative openness of this procedure led to outright capture by outside rent‐seeking interests, or whether the Bureau could balance them and reach relatively autonomous and consistent decisions. We analyzed how it handled and decided 246 submissions for privileges, or rents, made between 1724 and 1740. We show that the decision to reject, accept entirely or curtail individual submissions was shaped within the administrative procedure – rather than by cliques and clienteles. Each main and competing voice had a significant though differentiated impact on outcomes; and substantive arguments, for or against each application, also had a specific impact...|$|R

The focus is on the debate and the deliberations taken by the main institutional actors (government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chamber of Deputies and Senate with their respective Foreign Affairs Commitee), while the role played by social actors like the anti-apartheid movements or the trade unions and by political parties remains in the background (and analysed in other chapters of the book). The study of official documents points to [...] main conclusions: (1) the link established by Italy on a <b>consensual,</b> bipartisan <b>basis,</b> between peace and security in Southern Africa and the domestic developments in South Africa herself; in such context Italy {{played a major role in}} the granting of development aid to the Front Line States as well as in supporting them diplomatically; (2) Italy tried to strike a balance between her proactive role towards FLS and European consensus; (3) while actively engaged in Mozambique and in the region, Italy was more timid in her policy towards apartheid, notwithstanding the pressure from the opposition in parliament and the anti-apartheid movement in society; (4) that was particulary clear as far as sanctions against the apartheid regime were concerned, Italy simply followed the consensus reached in the EU.

5000|$|Effect must be given, {{in other}} words, to the parties' common intention: [...] "that is to say, to what {{both of them}} {{intended}} upon entering into the contract, and not to what the {{one or the other}} had {{in the back of his}} or her mind." [...] This dictum suggests that the courts take a [...] "factual or historical-psychological approach to interpretation, i.e. one which seeks to establish the intention of the parties as a fact existing at the time of contracting." [...] This more or less accords with the subjective and <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of the rest of the South African law of contract, but it gives rise to a paradox, since the subjective intentions of the parties must be established with reference to certain objective factors, most obviously the words printed on the contract.|$|E
50|$|There is, therefore, a clear {{disconnect}} {{between theory and}} practice in this area of the law, although judicial support has been expressed for a more liberal approach to interpretation. The oft-quoted assertion that “the rule of interpretation is to ascertain, not what the parties’ intention was, but what the language used in the contract means, i.e. what their intention was as expressed in the contract,” has been treated very circumspectly. The principle tends to obscure the <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of the South Africa law of contract, it is said, and is not inflexible, but subject to qualification. The words employed in a contract cannot be viewed in isolation, divorced from the matrix of facts in which they are set, if the intention of the parties is to be ascertained. While the first step in construing a contract is still to ascertain the ordinary, grammatical meaning of the words used, “it should be recognised that very few words have a single meaning, and even the ‘ordinary’ meaning of a word may vary according to, or be qualified by, the factual context in which it is used.” A court should therefore be alive to the various possible meanings of the words, and should not approach the matter on the basis that a particular meaning predominates. It should also have regard to the nature and purpose of the contract, as well as the context of the words in the contract as a whole.|$|E

40|$|Approaches to {{biodiversity}} and catchment planning increasingly {{recognize the importance}} of the 'wider countryside' rather than the more site-specific focus of traditional environmental management programmes. Biodiversity depends on the viability of ecosystems across the whole countryside, and not only in designated reserves; equally, {{the quantity and quality of}} inland waters reflect overall conditions within river catchments, as well as the hydrological conditions of specific river channels. However, planning of these wider areas involves partnerships and agreements between a range of actors, which generally must be negotiated on a <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> and are vulnerable to subsequent dissent. This paper examines the actor-networks which have arisen in some innovative examples of 'wider countryside' planning and assesses their durability and contribution to the attainment of environmental objectives. ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate {{governance}} is exercised, {{controlled and}} made accountable through formal processes, as {{set out in}} the Corporations Act (2001). Many meetings operate on a <b>consensual</b> <b>basis.</b> Notwithstanding, the rules are there as a fundamental position which is used as a resort when consensuality fails.

Without such knowledge on the part of all participants such meetings may be ineffective or subverted. This article argues the need not only for knowledge of formal procedures, but also sensitivity toward the human element in meetings. It is argued that the values of civilised conduct in meetings are not only worthy in their own right but also are conducive to efficiency of decision-making, and to speed of process. They are also an enhancer of the quality of both business and social life. ...|$|E
40|$|Trafficking {{in women}} for {{prostitution}} remains a modern form of slavery. Paradoxically, governments and legal systems tend {{to target the}} victims (trafficked women) instead of the criminal traffickers. The present study attempted to investigate the roots of such a lenient social response. Following a consensus perspective, it was first hypothesized that this offense was considered by the public to be a relatively nonserious offense because it involved prostitutes, and second, as in other cases of male violence against women, {{it was hypothesized that}} the public views toward this offense were affected by traditional gender-role attitudes toward women. To this end, respondents from a national sample were asked to evaluate hypothetical short crime scenarios representing cases of trafficking in women and other offenses. The findings indicate that the public perceives such criminal acts as serious, both for egalitarian and traditional respondents. This finding challenges the <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of the lenient approach toward traffickers in women. The implications of the findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s Italy {{has been}} going through changes and {{experiments}} concerning modes and tools of urban government. New methods, based on public-private partnership, on a <b>consensual</b> <b>basis,</b> were progressively adopted, overcoming the traditional authoritative mechanisms and role of public actors. The contribution of Community policies such as initiatives on urban areas, has been crucial in creating new tools, influencing the existing ones and activating new approaches to planning. This paper builds some theoretical considerations on the contributions the European Programmes’ implementation has given to {{the changes in the}} conception of urban interventions and the debated shift in urban policies between “government” to “governance”. The aim is to build a critical analysis about how the Urban 1 initiative acted as a “catalyst” for the evolution of urban practices, accelerating the innovation of the planning cultures and practices. The article examines three cities where Urban 1 Programme has been developed: Genoa, Naples and Palermo.

40|$|Legitimacy {{is central}} to nearly all human {{relationships}} and, in turn, to most social science theories. The concept was invented to help account for social order in large societies. Since it is too costly to attain order {{in the long run}} on the basis of sanctions (whether derived from incentives or naked coercion), {{it stands to reason that}} order must also rest, in part, on the consent of the governed. Legitimacy provides a means of referencing the <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of social order. Yet, it is seldom discussed by social scientists because it is “squishy, ” vague, impossible to define precisely or operationalize in any neat fashion. Whereas compliance is often observable, how can we know whether it is due to the threat of sanctions or to consent? To the extent that social scientists do take up the concept of legitimacy, they typically employ a procedural or formal-legal conception in which lawful office is understood to confer authority on an actor. For example, one day Arnold Schwarzenegger is simply a wealthy actor, the next he is the Governor with the right to sign or veto legislation, appoint people to various commissions and departments, and represent the State of California. This formal-legal conception may be adequate in established politica...|$|E

It explores who has the authority to make decisions in China today and who will have this authority as new leaders take control of the Politburo in 2002. The thesis also examines the role that the People's Liberation Army plays in national security and foreign policy decision-making during times of crisis. The April 2001 EP- 3 incident is examined to assess high-level decision-making in the Communist Party, the leve of military involvement, {{and the role of the}} media.

The thesi also concludes that the military plays a smaller role than is often presumed in the decision-making process during times of crisis. Decision-making in the PRC may be expected to become more decentralized in the future. Although no theoretical or legal framework exist to guide the current process, it is likely that the process will become more efficient and structured over time. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|In Abstract Right and the Possibility of a Nondistributive Conception of Contract: Hegel and Contemporary Contract Theory, Peter Benson {{criticizes the}} authors {{presentation}} of a consent theory of contract, in part, {{on the ground that}} it 2 ̆ 2 refers only to the empirical facts of the requirements of human needs and fulfillment. Like [Charles] Fried 2 ̆ 7 s [account], his conception of the <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of a contract does not preserve the required standpoint of abstraction. 2 ̆ 2 On this basis Professor Benson concludes that the author 2 ̆ 7 s approach fails to 2 ̆ 2 provide an adequate elucidation of a nondistributive conception of contract. By explaining contractual obligation as intelligible ownership based in a relation of wills, independent of the content of those wills, Professor Benson 2 ̆ 7 s approach can be viewed as formal or abstract. In contrast, the author 2 ̆ 7 s account of a consent theory of contract has been twofold: (a) by understanding contractual obligation as arising when persons manifest an intention to transfer alienable rights, a consent theory of contract (as compared with other available theories) helps us to better understand and sometimes to modify such problematic contract doctrines as the objective interpretation of consent, promissory estoppel, specific performance, and undisclosed agency; (b) this criteria of contractual obligation plays an important social function and is ignored at our peril. Benson does not address the first more explanatory and reformatory aspect of the author 2 ̆ 7 s {{presentation of a}} consent theory of contract; it is the second of these two aspects of the author 2 ̆ 7 s presentation that Benson characterizes as empirical and insufficiently abstract. Professor Benson takes a Hegelian approach that the author states he is not qualified to evaluate from within. In this essay the author assumes arguendo that both Hegelian legal theory and Benson 2 ̆ 7 s use of it are sound. However, without questioning either the merits of Benson 2 ̆ 7 s analysis or the methodology he employs, the author thinks that elaborating a distinction between internal and external conceptual analyses will permit him to put both Benson 2 ̆ 7 s presentation and his criticism of the author 2 ̆ 7 s in perspective...|$|E
40|$|The unifying {{theme of}} the {{chapters}} presented in this thesis is that intra-group interaction impacts on in-group identity content, and this content provides a foundation for social action and social behaviour. The primary goals of this thesis are first, to demonstrate that social realities can be established and transformed through interaction; and second, to investigate why the process of intra-group interaction can spark and exacerbate social conflict. In Chapter 1, I review and attempt to theoretically integrate the disparate literatures on group discussion, identity and action. In Chapter 2, I investigate the effect of interaction on the positive-negative asymmetry effect (PNAE). In Study 2. 1, participants {{were more likely to}} discriminate on rewards than fines, and find allocating rewards to be a more legitimate and pleasant act than allocating fines. Conversely, participants thought allocating fines would have a more negative effect on recipients and felt more negative about allocating fines than rewards. In Study 2. 2, when in-group advancement was obstructed, no PNAE was found: obstruction was sufficient justification for out-group punishment in its own right. When in-group advancement was not obstructed, the PNAE reversed after group discussion, such that more hostility occurred when participants administered fines than when they awarded rewards. This reversal was mediated by processes of norm formation. In Chapter 3, I describe three studies which show that consensual intra-group discussions about a negatively regarded out-group increased inter-group hostility. Study 3. 1 compared group discussion about immigrants with individual reflection. Results showed that group discussion informed the content of stereotypes, which led to support for anti-immigrant policies. In Study 3. 2, participants discussed either an irrelevant topic, the out-group stereotype, or the out-group stereotype plus what concrete actions should be taken towards that group. Only discussion of the stereotype significantly increased hostility, suggesting that the psychological products of discussion per se (cohesion, identification, etc.) are not solely responsible for hostility. Rather, social validation of the stereotype explained why its discussion increased hostility. Study 3. 3 replicated these results with a behavioural measure. In Chapter 4, I present two studies which controlled for the content of interaction by showing participants short films of similar others having a group discussion. Study 4. 1 investigated the paradoxical finding that when groups discuss potential courses of action against an out-group, {{they are less likely to}} act than when they discuss simply the out-group stereotype (Chapter 3). Results suggested that when group discussions imply that there is social consensus about a course of action, even the advocacy of extreme actions can increase support for (more moderate) social action. Study 4. 2 manipulated whether or not the discussants consensualised on the out-group stereotype, whilst controlling for discussion content. Only when the discussion ended in consensus did participants identify with the discussants and perceive norms for social action. In Chapter 5, I address how social identities and their associated (self-) stereotypes can disadvantage members of low status groups, but how they can also promote social change. The data demonstrates that consensualisation in small groups can transform (or reconfirm) such stereotypes, thereby eliminating (or bolstering) stereotype threat effects. In Study 5. 1, female participants were asked why men are (or are not) better at maths. They generated their answers individually or through group discussion. Stereotype threat was undermined only when they collectively challenged the stereotype. Content analyses suggest that discussions redefined in-group and out-group stereotypes, providing the basis for stigma reversal or confirmation. In Study 5. 2, male and female participants confirmed or challenged the stereotype in same-gender discussion groups or no discussion, baseline conditions. After a discussion that confirmed the stereotype, women displayed signs of stereotype threat and men’s performance was “lifted”. When they challenged the stereotype, the difference between men and women on the maths test was eliminated. Overall, the results reported in this thesis suggest that intra-group interaction enables group members to develop an understanding of their common ideology, which may establish the <b>consensual</b> <b>basis</b> of their identity content. If such consensualisation occurs, this provides them with a sense that their perceptions of reality are socially valid, and gives rise to (implicit or explicit) in-group norms. This provides individuals with a solid foundation upon which they may act. The implications of these conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6.
