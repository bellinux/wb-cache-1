25|$|Ancient slag is {{difficult}} to date. It has no organic material with which to perform radiocarbon dating. There are no cultural artifacts like pottery shards in the slag with which to date it. Direct physical dating of slag through thermoluminescence dating {{could be a good}} method to solve this problem. Thermoluminescence dating is possible if the slag contains crystal elements such as quartz or feldspar. However, the complex composition of slag <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> technique difficult unless the crystal elements can be isolated.|$|E
25|$|Several {{security}} concerns arose in late 2014. Previously, researchers {{became aware that}} NTP servers can be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks unless packets are cryptographically signed for authentication. The computational overhead involved <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> impractical on busy servers, particularly during denial of service attacks. NTP message spoofing {{can be used to}} move clocks on client computers and allow a number of attacks based on bypassing of cryptographic key expiration. Some of the services impacted by fake NTP messages identified are TLS, DNSSEC, various caching schemes (such as DNS cache), BGP, Bitcoin and a number of persistent login schemes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then {{he pulled out the}} pages that we'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E

[...] The review noted that, [...] "Flight of the Conchords deserves the buzz it is slowly building. This is a very funny show." [...] Blogcritics reviewer Daniel J. Stasiewski noted that the series was different for HBO, writing, [...] "Flight of the Conchords isn’t Entourage or Sex in the City or even Extras. It’s different. And sometimes different is just good." [...] Stasiewski, however, did note that {{the availability of the}} band's music on video sites like YouTube meant that watching the series was not worth the cost of a cable subscription. Further more, Stasiweski noted that while [...] "the fun, quirky music videos that pop-up <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> long half-hour worth watching [...] the 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren’t groundbreaking comedy." [...] Chris Schonberger from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the new series [...] "the funniest hour of comedy on television" [...] and noted that the performance of Rhys Darby as Murray Hewitt was excellent, calling his character [...] "scene-stealing". Finally, Schonberger positively compared the episode to the 2004 comedy film Napoleon Dynamite, writing, [...] "Indeed, the whole pilot vaguely reminded me of Napoleon {{in the way that the}} characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd activities".|$|E

2500|$|Given {{a smooth}} map [...] and a vector field X on M, {{it is not}} usually {{possible}} to identify a pushforward of X by φ with some vector field Y on N.

Also, if φ is not injective there may be more than one choice of pushforward at a given point.

2500|$|The {{following}} criterion by Riemann {{decides whether}} or not a given complex torus is an abelian variety, i.e. {{whether or not}} it can be embedded into a projective space. Let X be a g-dimensional torus given as X = V/L where V is a complex vector space of dimension g and L is a lattice in V. Then X is an abelian variety if and only if there exists a positive definite hermitian form on V whose imaginary part takes integral values on L'L. Such a form on X is usually called a (non-degenerate) Riemann form. [...] Choosing a basis for V and L, one <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> condition more explicit.

2500|$|Players {{attempt to}} arrive at the ruck first, drive forward and bind onto the opposition. [...] Once a ruck is formed the {{defenders}} cannot use their hands, making it easier for the attacking team to retain possession. The defenders try to slow the ball from coming out of the ruck, which allows their team more time to organise their defence. This may not be done by using their hands, or lying over the ball, or going to ground deliberately. Such infringements result in penalties if seen by the referee, although the number of bodies involved in the ruck <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> difficult. A legal method used to slow the ball down is counter-rucking, when the defenders drive players back over the ball. If this is done well, the defenders can gain possession of the ball. This is called a turnover.|$|E
2500|$|These {{differences}} were perceived by Mazakmat who returned home and promulgated the religion despite {{resistance from the}} Catholic and Methodist missions. He met up with an old friend, Michael Homerang, who was a highly respected malanggan carver and clan leader (maimai) {{in the village of}} Madina, on the north shore of New Ireland Province in the far north east. Momerang later said [...] "I saw a white man and woman come to my village and sit down to eat and talk with us. They even slept in our houses. … Only the Almight <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> happen…" [...] Then they met with clan leaders and elders of the community and early in 1958 there were a further 10 conversions who elected the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Papua New Guinea, followed by 30-40 more converts {{over the next four years}} in two villages. 1958 is considered the founding year of the Bahá'í community in Papua New Guinea.

I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen.
