40|$|Degrees {{of freedom}} {{refers to the}} number of {{independent}} spatial coordinates that must be specified to determine the position of a body. If the body is a point mass, only three coordinates are required to determine its position. On the other hand, if the body is extended, such as an aircraft, three position coordinates and three angular coordinates are required to completely specify its position and orientation in space. Kinematic Constraints In many situations the number of independent coordinates will be reduced below this number, either because the number of spacial dimensions is reduced or because there are relationships specified among the spatial <b>coordinates.</b> When <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> problems for solution it is useful to think of these relationships as constraints. For example, if a point mass is constrained to move in a plane (two dimensions) the number of spatial coordinates necessary to describe its motion is two. If instead of being a point mass, this body has extended dimensions, such as a flat plate confined to a plane, it requires three coordinates to specify its position and orientation: two position coordinates and one angular coordinate. 1 If a particle is confined to move on a curve in either two or three dimensions, such as a bead moving on a wire, the number of independent coordinates necessary to describe its motion is one. Another source of constraints on the motion of particles is connections between them. For example, the tw...|$|R

(1) to (4). Equations (1) to (4), the Galilean transformations, are the only transformations of space and time that retain the classical meaning of space and time. Thus it is assumed in both the Lorentz theory and the theory proposed herein that coordinate representations of time and space transform via Eqs. (1) to (4), but modifications of measuring instruments caused by motion through the ether cause moving observers to infer incorrect coordinate systems for their moving frames. Note {{that this is the first}} crucial conceptual difference between relativity and the absolute theories. Relativity assumes that time and space are transformed by relative motion, and that all observers are on an equal footing with regard to determinations of space and time. Absolute theories assume a fixed space and one universal time with one well-defined simultaneity. Since absolute theories assume a single well-defined space and time, no transformations of these concepts are allowed. It is possible, however, to transform to a moving coordinate system and use such a system to describe the single space and time. In absolute theories one can <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a <b>coordinate</b> system in a moving frame via a Galilean transformation, but this is not a transformation of space; rather, it is a transformation of the coordinate system used to define the one existing space.|$|R
