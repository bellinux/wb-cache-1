5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St <b>Clears</b> and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; <b>clears,</b> carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

When Balu is finally revealed as JB, Geetha, again not knowing what to believe, thinks the wedding plans are yet another of Balu's practical jokes and tries to run away.

5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely <b>clears</b> objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E

5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally <b>clears.</b>|$|E
40|$|Intrahepatic <b>clear</b> cell {{bile duct}} adenoma is {{extremely}} rare, with only 3 previous cases {{reported in the}} literature.

Distinguishing <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma from other <b>clear</b> cell tumors, particularly <b>clear</b> cell cholangiocarcinoma, can be challenging. Previous studies have shown loss of CD 10 expression and focal CD 56 expression in cholangiocarcinoma.

On immunohistochemical staining, the neoplastic cells demonstrated staining for CK 7, CA 19 - 9, polyclonal CEA, CD 10 (apical), CD 56 (focal), and vimentin. Ki- 67 highlighted less than 2 % of tumor cell nuclei. This is the first report to study the etiology of cell <b>clearing</b> in <b>clear</b> cell bile duct adenoma.

40|$|Payments {{systems are}} {{typically}} characterized by {{some degree of}} tiering, with upstream firms (<b>clearing</b> agents) providing settlement accounts to downstream institutions that wish to <b>clear</b> and settle payments indirectly in these systems (indirect clearers). <b>Clearing</b> agents provide their indirect clearers with an essential input (<b>clearing</b> and settlement services), while also competing directly {{with them in the}} retail market for payment services. The authors construct a model of a <b>clearing</b> agent with an indirect <b>clearer</b> to examine the <b>clearing</b> agent. s incentives to lever off its upstream position to gain a competitive advantage in the retail payment services market.

Jarl Eirik attacks the flank and forces his vessel, the Iron Ram, up against the last ship of Olaf's line, which he <b>clears</b> with a fierce attack and then proceeds onto the next ship.

5|$|After the CIA <b>clears</b> them, {{they return}} to England to attend the wedding of Baxter's eldest daughter. Rick reveals he sold Alvo's villa and signed the others' name without permission.

Meanwhile, a wheelchair-bound Dominic tracks the four down and arrives with his gang, with all members wearing Blair masks. After initially evading the gang, Baxter accidentally kills Carmen, mistaking her for an assassin. The four drive to one of Rick's contacts at a beach, only to be surrounded and executed by the gang upon arrival. In a state of Limbo, their souls leave the beach. Baxter spots one of the assassins, who removes the Blair mask to reveal a sinister version of himself. Their car drives past an unfinished interchange, and it plunges, where the four would meet their end.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, <b>clears</b> much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
