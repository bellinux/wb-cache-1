25|$|H. Boyd Woodruff (1917-2017), soil {{microbiologist}} {{who discovered}} actinomycin and developed industrial production by fermentation of many natural products, including <b>cyanocobalamin</b> (a synthetic form of Vitamin B12), the avermectins {{and other important}} antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{reacts with}} cyanide to form <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> {{which can be}} safely {{eliminated}} by the kidneys. This method {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> and since it is little more expensive than <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{requires}} {{intrinsic factor}} from the gastric mucosa to be absorbed. In {{patients with a}} small gastric pouch, {{it may not be}} absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in pernicious anemia and neuropathies. Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite common after gastric bypass surgery with reported rates of 30% in some clinical trials. Sublingual B12 (<b>cyanocobalamin)</b> appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B12 does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{is mostly}} {{manufactured}} by industrial fermentation {{of various kinds}} of bacteria, which make forms of <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> which are further processed to generate the ingredient included in supplements and fortified foods. The Pseudomonas denitrificans strain was most commonly used as of 2017. It is grown in a medium containing sucrose, yeast extract, and several metallic salts. To increase vitamin production, it is supplemented with sugar beet molasses, or, less frequently, with choline. Certain brands of B12 supplements are vegan.|$|E
25|$|After surgery, {{patients}} feel fullness after ingesting {{only a small}} {{volume of}} food, followed soon thereafter {{by a sense of}} satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (<b>cyanocobalamin)</b> supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} Smith's {{permanent}} residency status was {{the claim that}} she owned a $900,000 mansion, which she said was given to her by a former boyfriend, real estate developer Gaither Ben Thompson of South Carolina. Thompson asserted that he loaned Smith the finances to purchase the property, but that she failed to repay the loan, and was attempting {{to regain control of}} the property. Thompson sued to evict Smith from the property in Bahama Court, and received a default judgment against her when she failed to respond to the eviction, or appear in court on November 28, 2006. Ford Shelley, son-in-law of G. Ben Thompson, claimed that methadone was found in Anna's bedroom refrigerator while the mansion was being reclaimed. A photograph provided by TMZ shows a large bottle of methadone along with vials of injectable vitamin B12 (<b>cyanocobalamin)</b> in her refrigerator and diet product Slimfast.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Cyanocobalamin</b> is {{one such}} form, i.e. [...] "vitamer", of B12 {{because it can be}} metabolized in the body to an active {{coenzyme}} form. The <b>cyanocobalamin</b> form of B12 does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B12 are avid binders of cyanide (–CN) which they pick up in the process of activated charcoal purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the <b>cyanocobalamin</b> form of B12 is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B12 for food additives and in many common multivitamins. Pure <b>cyanocobalamin</b> possesses the deep pink color associated with most octahedral cobalt(II) complexes and the crystals are well formed and easily grown up to millimeter size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{core of the}} {{molecule}} vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a corrin structure (depicted in red) with at its center a cobalt ion. Several vitamins exist with different cobalt ligands but the total synthesis concerned the one with a cyano ligand called <b>cyanocobalamin.</b> The corrin rim is lined with methyl groups (8) and lined with amide groups (6) linked through C1 and C2 spacers. [...] A seventh amide group is N-alkylated by a large tail consisting of an isopropanol group, a phosphate group, a ribose group and a dimethylbenzimidazole group. One of the nitrogen atoms on the imidazole is a fifth nitrogen ligand for the cobalt atom. A total of nine carbon atoms on the corrin frame are chiral, adding another challenge to the synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Riboflavin {{deficiency}} (also called ariboflavinosis) {{results in}} stomatitis including painful red tongue with sore throat, chapped and fissured lips (cheilosis), and {{inflammation of the}} corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis). [...] There can be oily scaly skin rashes on the scrotum, vulva, philtrum of the lip, or the nasolabial folds. [...] The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot and sensitive to light. [...] Due to interference with iron absorption, even mild to moderate riboflavin deficiency results in an anemia with normal cell size and normal hemoglobin content (i.e. normochromic normocytic anemia). [...] This is distinct from anemia caused by deficiency of folic acid (B9) or <b>cyanocobalamin</b> (B12), which causes anemia with large blood cells (megaloblastic anemia). Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in birth defects including congenital heart defects and limb deformities.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{death was}} {{ultimately}} ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate that became increasingly lethal {{when combined with}} other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four benzodiazepines: Klonopin (Clonazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), Serax (Oxazepam), and Valium (Diazepam). Furthermore, she had taken Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) and Topamax (Topiramate), an anticonvulsant AMPA/Kainate antagonist, which likely contributed to the sedative effect of chloral hydrate and the benzodiazepines. Although the individual levels {{of any of the}} benzodiazepines in her system would not have been sufficient to cause death, their combination with a high dose of chloral hydrate led to her overdose. The autopsy report indicates that chloral hydrate was the [...] "toxic/lethal" [...] drug, {{but it is difficult to}} know whether chloral hydrate ingestion alone would have killed her, since Dr. Perper indicated (in the March 26 press conference) that she had built up a tolerance to the drug and took more than the average person. He indicated that she took about three tablespoons, whereas the normal dosage is between one and two teaspoons. Chloral hydrate, first synthesized in 1832, was the first depressant developed for the specific purpose of inducing sleep. The infamous [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] or [...] "knockout drops" [...] was a solution of alcohol and chloral hydrate that was popular in Victorian England and in that era's literature. When used properly, and without the introduction of alcohol or other depressants, chloral hydrate is effective in easing sleeplessness due to pain or insomnia. But according to Avis (1990), the effective dose and lethal dose of chloral hydrate are so close that the sedative should be considered dangerous. Today, the use of chloral hydrate has declined as other agents, including barbiturates and benzodiazepines, have largely replaced them. Despite rumors of methadone use due to its involvement in Smith's son's death, Dr. Perper only found methadone in her bile, indicating it could only have been ingested 2–3 days prior to her death and therefore was not a contributing factor. The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks (presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> as well as human growth hormone), and viral enteritis were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cyanocobalamin</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{manufactured}} vitamers in the vitamin [...] family (the family of chemicals that function as [...] when put into the body), because <b>cyanocobalamin</b> is the most air-stable of the [...] forms. It is the easiest to crystallize and therefore easiest to purify after it is produced by bacterial fermentation, or synthesized in vitro. It can be obtained as dark red crystals or as an amorphous red powder. <b>Cyanocobalamin</b> is hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121 C. The vitamin [...] coenzymes are unstable in light.

In dogs, this figure is about 90 percent, and only about 50 percent of dogs have this deficiency. Cats may suffer from Vitamin K deficiencies. If there is bacterial overgrowth in the intestine, antibiotics should be used, especially if treatment is not working. In dogs failing to gain weight or continuing to show symptoms, modifying the diet to make it low-fiber and highly digestible may help.

50|$|Cobalamins are {{characterized}} by a porphyrin-like corrin nucleus that contains a single cobalt atom bound to a benzimidazolyl nucleotide and a variable residue (R) group.

Cobalamins circulate bound to serum proteins called transcobalamins (TC) and haptocorrins. Hydroxocobalamin has a higher affinity to the TC II transport protein than <b>cyanocobalamin,</b> or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin.
