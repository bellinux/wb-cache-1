40|$|Background & objectives: Anopheles stephensi, an {{important}} vector of malaria {{continues to be}} distributed widely in the Indian subcontinent. This vector species has developed resistance for various insecticides. Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternate strategy, which does not involve resistance. In order to develop such strategy, it is mandatory that genetic studies of concerned vector species should be established. This paper describes the isolation and genetic studies of an eye <b>colour</b> <b>mutant,</b> ruby-eye (ru), and linkage studies involving another autosomal recessive mutant greyish brown larva (grb ru) in A. stephensi. Methods: The stocks of mutants ruby-eye (ru), greyish brown (grb ru) and wild type mosquitoes were maintained in the laboratory. Crosses were made between the wild type and mutant to determine the mode of inheritance of ruby-eye. For linkage studies crosses were made between the mutant ruby-eye and another autosomal recessive mutant greyish brown larva. The percentage cross over was calculated for the genes linkage relationship for ru and grb ru. Results: Results of crosses between mutant and wild type show that the inheritance of ruby-eye in A. stephensi is monofactorial in nature. The ru allele is recessive to wild type and is autosomal. The linkage studies showed no linkage between grb and ru. Interpretation & conclusion: The mutant ru represents an excellent marker for A. stephensi as it expresses in all the life stages with complete penetrance and high viability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A wild {{strain of}} Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, was {{submitted}} to three mu-tagenic agents: gamma radiation, ultraviolet light and nitrous acid. Survival curves were obtained and mutants were selected using different mutagenic doses which gave 1 to 5 % survival. Morphological and auxotrophic mutants were isolated. Morphological mutants were grouped {{in a class}} with yellow conidia and other with pale vinaceous conidia {{as opposed to the}} green wild type conidia. Auxotrophic mutants had requirements for vitamin and aminoacid biosynthe-sis. More than 58 % of the total auxotrophk mutants required proline/aipnine. Gamma radiation showed to be the most efficient mutagenic agent giving 0. 2 % of auxotrophk mutants followed by ultraviolet light (0. 12 %) and nitrous acid (0. 06 %).

40|$|A {{series of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to find cases in which heterokaryons show adaptative response to environmental change. Comparisons have also been made between the phenotypes of heterokaryons and corresponding heterozygotes.

Adaptation was achieved in heterokaryons carrying different mutant alleles conferring resistance to: (a) acriflavine, (b) actidione and (c) p-fluorophenylalanine. Comparison with the heterozygote in case (a) suggested a highly localised action of the allele determining resistance. A similar comparison for (b) suggested a non-localised action.

The following conclusions {{are based on}} observation of Neurospora on fire-scorched sugar cane in agricultural fields, and reconstruction experiments using a <b>colour</b> <b>mutant</b> to inoculate sugar cane burned in the laboratory. The fungus persists in soil as heat-resistant dormant ascospores. These are activated by a chemical(s) released into soil from the burnt substrate. The chief diffusible activator of ascospores is furfural and the germinating ascospores infect the scorched substrate. An invasive mycelium grows progressively upwards inside the juicy sugar cane and produces copious macroconidia externally through fire-induced openings formed in the plant tissue, or by the mechanical rupturing of the plant epidermal tissue by the mass of mycelium. The loose conidia are dispersed by wind and/or foraged by microfauna. It is suggested that the constant production of macroconidia, and their ready dispersal, serve a physiological role: to drain the substrate of minerals and soluble sugars, thereby creating nutritional conditions which stimulate sexual reproduction by the fungus. Sexual reproduction in the sugar-depleted cellulosic substrate occurs after macroconidiation has ceased totally and is favoured by the humid conditions prevailing during the monsoon rains. Profuse micro-conidiophores and protoperithecia are produced simultaneously in the pockets below the loosened epidermal tissue.

Vps 33 p homologues contain a Sec 1 domain and belong to the family of Sec 1 /Munc 18 (SM) proteins that regulate fusion of membrane-bound organelles and interact with other vps proteins and also SNARE proteins that execute membrane fusion in all cells. We demonstrated recently that mutations in VPS 33 B cause ARC syndrome (MIM 208085), a lethal multisystem disease. In con-trast, mutations in other Vps 33 p homologues result in different phenotypes, e. g. a mutation in Drosophila melanogaster car gene causes the carnation eye <b>colour</b> <b>mutant</b> and inactivation of mouse Vps 33 a causes buff hypopigmentation phenotype.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of pH in cellular compartments {{is crucial for}} intracellular trafficking of vesicles and proteins and the transport of small molecules, including hormones. In endomembrane compartments, pH is regulated by vacuolar H+-ATPase 1 (V-ATPase), which, in plants, act together with H+-pyrophosphatases 2 (PPase), whereas distinct P-type H+-ATPases in the cell membrane control the pH in the cytoplasm and energize the plasma membrane 3. Flower <b>colour</b> <b>mutants</b> have proved useful in identifying genes controlling the pH of vacuoles where anthocyanin pigments accumulate 4, 5. Here we show that PH 5 of petunia encodes a P 3 A-ATPase proton pump that, unlike other P-type H+-ATPases, resides in the vacuolar membrane. Mutation of PH 5 reduces vacuolar acidification in petals, resulting in a blue flower colour and abolishes the accumulation of proanthocyanindins (condensed tannins) in seeds. Expression of PH 5 is directly activated by transcription regulators of the anthocyanin pathway, in conjunction with PH 3 and PH 4. Thus, flower coloration, a key-factor in plant reproduction, involves the coordinated activation of pigment synthesis and a specific pathway for vacuolar acidification...|$|E
40|$|During {{unfavourable}} conditions, many arthropods {{have the}} ability to enter into diapause and synchronize their development and reproduction to seasonal patterns. Diapause or winter hibernation in insects and mites is set off by a number of cues, with photoperiod being the most well-defined and strongest signal. This review focuses on the current knowledge of '-omics' data and the genetics of diapause in the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, {{a member of the family}} Tetranychidae (Arthropoda: Chelicerata: Arachnida: Acari). This species is a serious polyphagous pest and females undergo a reproductive facultative diapause when immature stages are exposed to long nights. Winter hibernation induces different physiological processes characterized by a metabolic suppression, different energy use, increased stress tolerance and the production of cryoprotectants, all initiated by a complex signal transduction pathway. Keto-carotenoids are known to cause the deeply orange colour typical for diapausing females. Furthermore, research with <b>colour</b> <b>mutants</b> of T. urticae has shown the need for carotenoids with respect to the induction of diapause, even though the molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying these colour phenotypes are still unknown. In addition, marked latitudinal variation in diapause incidence among populations has been observed in nature, with modes of inheritance ranging from recessive to dominant, as well as monogenic to polygenic. We end by highlighting the emerging opportunities for functional studies that aim to unravel the complex factors underlying diapause in spider mites...|$|E

The natural vigour of the species combined with its new tolerance, indeed resistance to insecticides has made it obligatory that we look for control methods involving genetic manipulation. Hence, there is an immediate need for {{greater understanding of the}} genetics of this vector species. One of the requirements for such genetic studies is the establishment of naturally occurring mutants, establishment of the genetic basis for the same and use of such mutants in the genetic transformation studies and other genetic control programme(s). This paper describes the isolation and genetic studies of a larval <b>colour</b> <b>mutant,</b> green thorax (gt), and linkage studies involving another autosomal recessive mutant ruby-eye (ru) in An. stephensi. Methods: After the initial discovery, the mutant green thorax was crossed inter se and pure homozygous stock of the mutant was established. The stock of the mutant ruby-eye, which has been maintained as a pure stock in the laboratory. Crosses were made between the wild type and mutant, green thorax to determine the mode of inheritance of green thorax. For linkage studies, crosses were made between the mutant green thorax and another autosomal recessive mutant ruby-eye. The percentage cross-over was calculated for the genes linkage relationship for gt and gt ru. Results: Results of crosses between mutant and wild type showed that the inheritance of green thorax (gt) in An. stephensi is monofactorial in nature. The gt allele is recessive to wild type and is autosomal. The linkage studies showed no linkage between ru and gt. Interpretation & conclusion: The mutant gt represents an excellent marker for An. stephensi as it is expressed in late III instar stage of larvae and is prominent in IV instar and pupal stages with complete penetrance and high viability. The said mutant could be easily identified without the aid of a microscope. This mutant can be used extensively to conduct basic and applied research.

However, {{the identity of the}} gene encoding this enzyme, as well as its molecular properties, have not yet been established.

All cloned and expressed candidates exhibited relatively high thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities and low activity towards 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene, characteristic of Omega class GSTs, whereas only CG 6781 catalysed the synthesis of PDA in vitro. The molecular mass of recombinant CG 6781 was estimated to be 28  kDa by SDS/PAGE and 56  kDa by gel filtration, indicating that it is a homodimer under native conditions. Sequencing of the genomic region spanning CG 6781 revealed that the se 1 allele has a frameshift mutation from ‘AAGAA’ to ‘GTG’ at nt 190 – 194, and that this generates a premature stop codon. Expression of the CG 6781 open reading frame in an se 1 background rescued the eye colour defect as well as PDA synthase activity and drosopterins content. The extent of rescue was dependent on the dosage of transgenic CG 6781. In conclusion, we have discovered a new catalytic activity for an Omega class GST and that CG 6781 is the structural gene for sepia which encodes PDA synthase...|$|R

Therefore, fruit pigmentation {{is one of}} the most important quality traits and berries with variation in color that range from deep purple to yellow are available, depending on anthocyanin composition. The leading pathway is genetically determined by several structural and regulatory genes 1, some of which were characterized at molecular level 2 but none from enzymatic point of view in raspberries. The polyphenol composition of raspberries consists mainly on ellagitannins, followed by anthocyanins (in red raspberries) with smaller amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins 3. Yellow forms obviously lack anthocyanidins, and some yellow varieties where reported to lack also flavonols 4. Apart from the lack of anthocyanins, previous reports didn’t show other significant differences in the polyphenol compositions and antioxidant protection ability of yellow raspberries, which seems to indicate a deviation of secondary metabolism into other directions. In this work, the differences in raspberry fruit pigmentation where studied by transcriptional and analytical approaches. The differential transcriptional profiles of genes of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (CHS, CHI, F 3 H, DFR, UFGT, LAR, FHT, ANS and ANR) were analyzed in raspberry varieties with different colors by qRT-PCR.

When reconstructed from confocal serial sections, fluorescent plaques formed by hCx 26 –EYFP and hCx 30 –EYFP appeared irregular, often with long protrusions or deep invagination. Similar plaques were observed following immunostaining both in cells transfected with hCx 26 –pIRES and in HeLa cells stably transfected with mouse Cx 26. Tissue conductance (Tgj) displayed significantly smaller values (28. 8 ± 1. 8 nS) for stably transfected mCx 26 than transiently transfected hCx 26 (43. 5 ± 3. 3 nS).

40|$|Summary. Staphylococcus aureus mutants lacking pigment, or expressing only {{low levels}} of pigment, were more {{sensitive}} to oleic acid than were the parent strain and mutants making more pigment than the parent. One class of <b>mutants</b> (<b>colour</b> index 5), although possessing significant levels of pigment, were nevertheless quite sensitive to oleic acid. This suggested that only certain carotenoids in the biosynthetic pathway were capable of imparting resistance to fatty acids. The phenotypic expression of pigment also affected the sensitivity of a strain to oleic acid. The parent S. aureus strain 182, when grown to express its maximal pigment potential, was more resistant to oleic acid than when it was grown to express minimal levels of pigment...|$|R
50|$|Chaetomium atrobrunneum is a darkly pigmented, {{predominantly}} mycelial fungus. Colonies of C. atrobrunneum {{typically are}} dark grey to black in colour with a woolly appearance. It forms sexual fruiting structures called perithecia that are spherical to oval in shape, measuring between 70-150 µm in width when fully matured at 10 days. The perithecia are covered sparsely with straight, finely-blistered, dark brown hairs that become occasionally become broadly branched with age. The perithecia contain asci within which are 8 ascospores that spindle-shaped, {{have a single}} sub-apical germ pore and are brown to grey in <b>colour,</b> although a <b>mutant</b> with colourless ascospores has been reported. The ascospores of this species are smooth-walled and measure 9-11 µm in length by 4.5-6 µm in width.|$|R
40|$|The {{developing}} {{eye of the}} cockroach, Periplaneta americana, and the locust, Schistocerca gregaria, {{was chosen}} for an experimental investigation of factors involved {{in the development of}} nervous tissue and the formation of ordered nerve connections. Grafting experiments between eye <b>colour</b> <b>mutants</b> of P. americana showed that the retina develops postembryonically from a region of head epidermis which differs from other larval head epidermis in being competent to respond to a recruiting signal produced by adjacent eye tissue. Recruited cells divide and segregate into clusters which differentiate into ommatidia. The specific fate of individual cells is probably assigned according to their position within the cluster. Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation and death in the compound eye of S. gregaria under normal and experimental conditions showed that the retina develops normally {{in the absence of the}} optic lobe. In the absence of innervation from the retina, lamina ganglion cells are generated normally but do not differentiate and subsequently degenerate. Experiments on S. gregaria in which spatial or temporal relationships between retina and lamina were altered, showed that axons tend to grow along the paths of immediately adjacent axons, with no indication of specificity for their normal target sites. The following model was proposed for the development of the retina-lamina projection. Formation of the retina by recruitment of epidermis ensures that sensory axons develop in an orderly spatiotemporal sequence. Newly-formed axons grow along preceeding ones and, in turn, provide a conducting tract for suceeding axons, so that the orderly pattern of axon outgrowth is maintained in the pattern of axon arrival in the lamina. As both retina and lamina grow anteriorly, new axons arrive among new lamina cells. Lamina cells innervated by retinal axons differentiate into discrete synaptic units; excess, uninnervated cells degenerate. The relevance of the model to the initial formation of the projection, and to the formation of other nerve connections in insects, was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Four new species, Aspergillus eucalypticola, A. neoniger, A. fijiensis and A. indologenus are {{described}} and illustrated. Aspergillus eucalypticola was isolated from Eucalyptus leaf from Australia, and {{is related to}} A. tubingensis and A. costaricaensis, but could clearly be distinguished from them based on either β-tubulin or calmodulin sequence data. Aspergillus eucalypticola produced pyranonigrin A, funalenone, aurasperone B and other naphtho-γ-pyrones. Aspergillus neoniger is also a biseriate species isolated from desert sand in Namibia, and mangrove water in Venezuela, which produces aurasperone B and pyranonigrin A. Aspergillus fijiensis is a uniseriate species related to A. aculeatinus, and was isolated from soil in Fiji, and from Lactuca sativa in Indonesia. This species is able to grow at 37 °C, and produces asperparalines and okaramins. Aspergillus indologenus was isolated from soil, India. This species also belongs to the uniseriate group of black aspergilli, and {{was found to be}} related to, but clearly distinguishable from A. uvarum based on β-tubulin, calmodulin and ITS sequence data. Aspergillus indologenus produced the insecticidal compounds okaramins A, B, H, and two types of indol-alkaloids which have not been structure elucidated. Two other species, A. violaceofuscus and A. acidus, are revalidated based on molecular and extrolite data. Aspergillus violaceofuscus was found to be related to A. japonicus, and produced some of the same interesting indol-alkaloids as A. indologenus, and also produced several families of partially characterised extrolites that were also found in A. heteromorphus. Aspergillus acidus (previously known as A. foetidus var. pallidus and A. foetidus var. acidus) is also a valid species, while A. foetidus is a synonym of A. niger based on molecular and physiological data. Two other species described previously, A. coreanus and A. lacticoffeatus, were found to be <b>colour</b> <b>mutants</b> of A. acidus and A. niger, respectively. Methods which could be used to distinguish the two closely related and economically important species A. niger and A. awamori are also detailed. Although these species differ in their occurrence and several physiological means (elastase activities, abilities to utilise 2 -deoxy-D-glucose as sole carbon source), our data indicate that only molecular approaches including sequence analysis of calmodulin or β-tubulin genes, AFLP analysis, UP-PCR analysis or mtDNA RFLP analysis can be used reliably to distinguish these sibling species.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade do emprego isolado e simultâneo dos mutantes rin, norA, og c e hp em heterozigose, em genótipos de tomateiro, visando à melhoria da qualidade pós-colheita dos frutos. Foram avaliados 18 genótipos que diferem quanto às combinações entre estes locos em dois diferentes {{backgrounds}} (FloraDade e background experimental). Contrastes não ortogonais foram estabelecidos para quantificar os efeitos dos alelos mutantes, isoladamente ou combinados em um mesmo genótipo, em dois backgrounds, sobre a produção total e produção precoce de frutos, massa média, firmeza, coloração externa, teores de licopeno e betacaroteno dos frutos. Os alelos norA e rin em heterozigose, no background FloraDade, desaceleraram a taxa de perda de firmeza e reduziram os teores de licopeno e betacaroteno nos frutos maduros. As combinações heterozigotas entre o mutante rin e os mutantes norA, og c e hp aumentaram a firmeza dos frutos. O efeito do genótipo rin+/rin nor+/norA sobre a firmeza dos frutos foi o somatório dos efeitos individuais dos locos. O alelo rin mostrou-se, individualmente, mais eficiente do que norA, em prolongar a firmeza dos frutos. Os genótipos og c+/og c e hp+/hp, juntos ou isolados, aumentaram a coloração dos frutos rin+/rin. Recomenda-se a utilização dos genótipos rin+/rin nor+/norA no desenvolvimento de híbridos longa vida, buscando-se, contudo, backgrounds que sofram prejuízo menor sobre a coloração dos frutos e adicionando-se mutantes og c+/og c e hp+/hp. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to assess the}} viability of single and simultaneous use of rin, norA, og c and hp as heterozygotes in tomato genotypes in order to improve post-harvest fruit quality. Eighteen genotypes differing in combinations among these loci in two backgrounds (Floradade and experimental background) were evaluated. Contrasts were used to quantify the effects of single and simultaneous application of mutant loci, in two different backgrounds, on the total and early fruit yield, fruit mean mass, fruit firmness, development of external fruit color, lycopene and beta-carotene fruit contents. The norA and the rin alleles, used as heterozygotes in the FloraDade background, delayed the fruit softening and reduced lycopene and beta-carotene contents of mature fruit. All heterozygous combinations between rin and the mutants norA, og c and hp increased fruit firmness. The effect of the rin+/rin nor+ /norA genotypes on fruit firmness was roughly the sum of the individual effects of each locus. The rin allele was more efficient than norA to keep fruit firmness. The og c+/og c and hp+/hp genotypes, singly or in combination, improved colour of rin fruits. The combination rin+/rin and nor+/norA can be used in breeding for long shelf life tomatoes; however, genotypic backgrounds where fruit colour is less adversely affected should be sought or, alternatively, the <b>colour</b> <b>mutant</b> heterozygotes og c+/og c and hp+/hp should be used...|$|R
40|$|A wild {{strain of}} Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, was {{submitted}} to three mutagenic agents: gamma radiation, ultraviolet light and nitrous acid. Survival curves were obtained and mutants were selected using different mutagenic doses which gave 1 to 5 % survival. Morphological and auxotrophic mutants were isolated. Morphological mutants were grouped {{in a class}} with yellow conidia and other with pale vinaceous conidia {{as opposed to the}} green wild type conidia. Auxotrophic mutants had requirements for vitamin and aminoacid biosynthesis. More than 58 % of the total auxotrophk mutants required proline/aipnine. Gamma radiation showed to be the most efficient mutagenic agent giving 0. 2 % of auxotrophk mutants followed by ultraviolet light (0. 12 %) and nitrous acid (0. 06 %).

40|$|The {{corn snake}} (Pantherophis guttatus) {{is a new}} model species {{particularly}} appropriate for investigating the processes generating colours in reptiles because numerous <b>colour</b> and pattern <b>mutants</b> have been isolated {{in the last five}} decades. Using our captive-bred colony of corn snakes, transcriptomic and genomic next-generation sequencing, exome assembly, and genotyping of SNPs in multiple families, we delimit the genomic interval bearing the causal mutation of amelanism, the oldest colour variant observed in that species. Proceeding with sequencing the candidate gene OCA 2 in the uncovered genomic interval, we identify that the insertion of an LTR-retrotransposon in its 11 th intron results in a considerable truncation of the p protein and likely constitutes the causal mutation of amelanism in corn snakes. As amelanistic snakes exhibit white, instead of black, borders around an otherwise normal pattern of dorsal orange saddles and lateral blotches, our results indicate that melanocytes lacking melanin are able to participate to the normal patterning of other colours in the skin. In combination with research in the zebrafish, this work opens the perspective of using corn snake colour and pattern variants to investigate the generative processes of skin colour patterning shared among major vertebrate lineages...|$|R
