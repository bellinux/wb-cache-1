She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{focused on}} her family full-time, and {{continued}} to concentrate on her interior design business. Several of her clients came from the NASCAR community. She also started a company called Happy <b>Chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Matthews area of Charlotte where she creates her own furniture and redesigns old chairs. It came after Robinson looked for furnishings in a national furniture chain store and discovered a display chair that she liked. She begins the process of renovating old chairs by searching for those that are in poor condition but are structurally intact and are architecturally appealing. Robinson dismantles the chair and starts reconstructing it. Her work has received critical acclaim from online magazines and customers. Robinson names designer Trina Turk and several clothing companies as her influences.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially {{had dark}} wood panels and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, and tables and <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E

25|$|In 1686 Spener {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the court-chaplaincy at Dresden, which opened to him a wider though more difficult sphere of labor. In Leipzig, a society of young theologians was formed under his influence for the learned study and devout application of the Bible. Three magistrates belonging to that society, {{one of whom was}} August Hermann Francke, subsequently the founder of the famous orphanage at Halle (1695), commenced courses of expository lectures on the Scriptures of a practical and devotional character, and in the German language, which were zealously frequented by both students and townsmen. The lectures, however, aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of Leipzig, and Francke and his friends left the city, and with the aid of Christian Thomasius and Spener founded the new University of Halle. The theological <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new university were filled in complete conformity with Spener's proposals. The main difference between the new Pietistic Lutheran school and the orthodox Lutherans arose from the Pietists' conception of Christianity as chiefly consisting in a change of heart and consequent holiness of life. Orthodox Lutherans rejected this viewpoint as a gross simplification, stressing the need for the church and for sound theological underpinnings.|$|E
25|$|During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the {{principal}} merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved {{in a way}} hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and rococo (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, {{to say nothing of}} bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps {{the upper part of the}} panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But Thomas Chippendale, Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.|$|E
25|$|At the University's {{foundation}} in 1451, {{there were four}} original faculties: Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The Faculty of Divinity became a constituent school of the Faculty of Arts in 2002, while the Faculty of Law was changed in 1984 into the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 2005 became the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences. Although {{one of the original}} faculties established, teaching in the Faculty of Medicine did not begin formally until 1714, with the revival of the Chair in the Practice of Medicine. The Faculty of Science was formed in 1893 from Chairs removed from the Faculties of Arts and Medicine, and subsequently divided in 2000 to form the three Faculties of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Computing Science, Mathematics and Statistics (now Information and Mathematical Sciences) and Physical Sciences. The Faculty of Social Sciences was formed from <b>Chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Faculty of Arts in 1977, and merged to form the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences in 2005, the two having operated as a single 'resource unit' since 2002. The Faculty of Engineering was formally established in 1923, although engineering had been taught at the University since 1840 when Queen Victoria founded the UK's first Chair of Engineering. Through a concordat ratified in 1913, Royal Technical College (later Royal College of Science and Technology and now University of Strathclyde) students received Glasgow degrees in applied sciences, particularly engineering. It was in 1769 when James Watt's engineering at Glasgow led to a stable steam engine and, subsequently, the Industrial Revolution. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the University in 1949 and gaining independent Faculty status in 1969. The Faculty of Education was formed when the University merged with St Andrew's College of Education in 1999.|$|E

They drive past two young boys on bicycles who are distributing religious tracts. Dollface asks for a tract. The boy asks if she's a sinner and she replies, [...] "sometimes". The strangers drive away, as the pin-up girl states, [...] "it'll be easier next time".

500|$|Balzac's {{trademark}} realism {{begins on}} the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on {{the opposite end of the}} social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: [...] "Les ténèbres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants." [...] ("Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.") Descriptions of her meager quarters are– as usual in Balzac's work– an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains [...] "les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe" [...] ("the illusory appearance of sham luxury"), from the shabby <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.|$|E

Knowing that the gods can be killed by evergreen wood, Sam and Dean stab them to death with branches of the Christmas tree. Later on, Dean is surprised to find that Sam has decorated their motel room with Christmas paraphernalia. They exchange gifts, all which were bought from the local gas station, and happily watch a football game on TV.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated {{in an interview with}} her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
500|$|According to Janet Reitman, in {{the late}} fall of 2004 Miscavige called {{together}} 70 senior Church executives {{in a pair of}} double-wide trailers normally used as the international management team's offices. They were ordered to play a game of musical <b>chairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management conference room. Those who failed to get a chair when the music stopped would be [...] "offloaded" [...] from the base to be sent away from their spouses and children to languish in the most remote and unpleasant locations in Scientology's empire. As Queen's Greatest Hits was played, the competition for seats became increasingly fierce: [...] "By the time the number had dwindled to twenty, people were throwing one another against the walls, ripping seats from one another's hands, wrestling one another to the floor." [...] At the end of the contest, Miscavige ordered that all the executives were to stay in the conference room and sleep under the tables until further notice. They stayed there for the next few days, with occasional deliveries of food, before being released. The Church's then chief spokesman, Tommy Davis, has acknowledged that the [...] "musical chairs" [...] incident occurred and says that it was [...] "intended to demonstrate how disruptive wholesale changes could be on an organization" [...] but dismisses the accounts of threats and violence.|$|E
