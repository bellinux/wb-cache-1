25|$|On {{the other}} hand, dry season starts in November, with {{rainfall}} subsiding in intensity, and altogether ceasing in January, February, March and April. March and April are the driest period, with <b>cloudless</b> skies and parched earth characterizing the general area.|$|E
25|$|Bahir Dar has a {{borderline}} tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw), {{very close}} to a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). Afternoon temperatures are very warm to hot year-round, and morning temperatures cool; however, the diurnal range is much larger in the largely <b>cloudless</b> dry season.|$|E
25|$|Under <b>cloudless</b> conditions, more {{interesting}} than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the California Central Valley to the distant Sierra Nevada, finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.|$|E
25|$|The town of Opotiki is {{situated}} exactly on latitude 38° South. The climate is temperate. Summer temperatures reach the mid-20s (Celsius, mid-70s Fahrenheit) {{on the coast}} and encourage {{a continuation of the}} beach culture of the Bay of Plenty. Winter days are often <b>cloudless,</b> the daytime temperature never drops below freezing but there may be a mild frost at night. Winter snow falls along the crest of the ranges, and on the higher peaks (over 1000 m) may remain for a few weeks. Rain occurs at any season. Severe localised rainstorms ('cloudbursts') may occur in the high country and have caused flash flooding including past inundations of Opotiki township.|$|E
25|$|Brittany {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate, similar to Cornwall. Rainfall occurs regularly but sunny, <b>cloudless</b> days are also common. In the summer months, {{temperatures in the}} region can reach , yet the climate remains comfortable, especially {{when compared to the}} French regions located south of the Loire. The temperature difference between summer and winter is about fifteen degrees, but it varies depending on the proximity of the sea. The weather is generally milder on the seacoast than inland but rainfall occurs with the same intensity on both. The Monts d'Arrée, despite their low elevation, have much more rainfall {{than the rest of the}} region. The south coast, between Lorient and Pornic, enjoys more than 2,000 hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
25|$|The dawn mist {{cleared and}} fine weather and <b>cloudless</b> skies promised much German activity. The Kent Sector Operations Room {{received}} {{news of a}} German build-up over Calais. Two convoys were in the Channel in the 11 Group area but the controllers waited. At 07:20 it became clear as the convoys passed the Dover Strait that Dover was the target and 11 Spitfires from 41 Squadron were ordered to attack the right flank and 12 Hurricanes of 501 Squadron from Hawkinge, the German left. The formation consisted of 48 Ju87s from six Staffeln of IV.(Stuka)/LG 1, II./StG 1 and II./StG 3. The escort consisted of 80 Bf109s from JG 51 and III./JG 26, the former led by Galland as Mölders was recovering from the wound received the day before.|$|E
25|$|Diffuse sky {{radiation}} is solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere. It is also called skylight, diffuse skylight, or {{sky radiation}} and {{is the reason for}} changes in the color of the sky. Of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation when the sun is high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation. When the sun is at the zenith in a <b>cloudless</b> sky, with 1361W/m2 above the atmosphere, direct sunlight is about 1050W/m2, and total insolation about 1120W/m2. This implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70W/m2 out of the original 1361W/m2.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter in}} Seoul is {{controlled}} by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the winter. Frequently the weather is <b>cloudless,</b> clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4°C (27°F). January, is the coldest month in Seoul.|$|E
25|$|Natives of Buka and Bougainville at the {{northern}} Solomon Islands in Melanesia and the Chopi people of Mozambique in the southeast coast of Africa have darker skin than other surrounding populations. (The native people of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, {{have some of the}} darkest skin pigmentation in the world.) Although these people are widely separated they share similar physical environments. In both regions, they experience very high UVR exposure from <b>cloudless</b> skies near the equator which is reflected from water or sand. Water reflects, depending on colour, about 10 to 30% of UVR, that falls on it. People in these populations spend long hours fishing on the sea. Because it is impractical to wear extensive clothing in a watery environment culture and technology does little to buffer UVR exposure. The skin takes a very large amount of UVR radiation. These populations are probably near or at the maximum darkness that human skin can achieve.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a <b>cloudless</b> atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E

500|$|In northwestern India region, {{virtually}} <b>cloudless</b> conditions {{prevail in}} October and November, resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings; {{as in much}} of the Deccan Plateau, they register at 16–20°C (61–68°F). However, from January to February, [...] "western disturbances" [...] bring heavy bursts of rain and snow. These extra-tropical low-pressure systems originate in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They are carried towards India by the subtropical westerlies, which are the prevailing winds blowing at North India's range of latitude. Once their passage is hindered by the Himalayas, they are unable to proceed further, and they release significant precipitation over the southern Himalayas.|$|E
500|$|In October 2005 a {{group of}} {{students}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a [...] wooden ship at a range of around 100feet (30m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been <b>cloudless</b> and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target. Again some charring occurred, along {{with a small amount of}} flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its autoignition temperature, which is around 300°C (570°F).|$|E
500|$|Due to Florida's low {{latitude}} and subtropical climate, temperatures cold {{enough to support}} significant snowfall are infrequent and their duration is fleeting. In general, frost is more common than snow, requiring temperatures of 32°F (0°C) or less at [...] above sea level, a <b>cloudless</b> sky, and a relative humidity of 65% or more. Generally, for snow to occur, the polar jet stream must move southward through Texas and into the Gulf of Mexico, with a stalled cold front across the southern portion of the state curving northeastward to combine freezing air into the frontal clouds. While light snowfall occurs a few times each decade across the northern panhandle, {{most of the state}} is too far south of the cold continental air masses responsible for generating snowfall {{in the rest of the}} country. The mean maximum monthly snowfall in most parts of Florida is zero. The only other areas in the continental United States with this distinction are extreme southern Texas and parts of coastal southern California.|$|E
500|$|The {{climate in}} San Diego, {{like most of}} Southern California, often varies {{significantly}} over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates. In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the [...] "May gray/June gloom" [...] period, a thick [...] "marine layer" [...] cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within {{a few miles of}} the coast, but yields to bright <b>cloudless</b> sunshine approximately [...] inland. Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence.

Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest.

The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
