The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how soil vertical cutting with minimum soil disturbance and mowing affect the growth and competitive ability of E. repens in a grass–clover crop. <b>A</b> tractor-drawn prototype <b>with</b> vertical disks was used to fragment E. repens rhizomes with minimal soil and crop disturbance. In experiments performed in 2014 and 2015 at a field site close to Uppsala, Sweden, the rhizomes were fragmented before crop sowing (ERF), during crop growth (LRF), or both (ERF+LRF). Fragmentation was <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> repeated mowing (yes/no) and four companion crop treatments (none, Italian ryegrass, white clover, and grass/clover mixture). The results showed that in the grass–clover crop, rhizome fragmentation reduced E. repens rhizome biomass production and increased Italian ryegrass shoot biomass. ERF and LRF both reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 38 % compared with the control, while ERF+LRF reduced it by 63 %. Italian ryegrass shoot biomass was increased by 78 % by ERF, 170 % by LRF and 200 % by ERF+LRF.

The challenge facing groundwater managers is how to identify and assess ecosystems that have a dependency on groundwater, and how to incorporate environmental groundwater requirements into aquifer management plans. The Alstonville Plateau Basalt Groundwater Management Area (GWMA 804) located on the far north coast of New South Wales {{was used as a}} case study to develop a methodology to assess the environmental dependencies on a groundwater resource. The original subtropical rainforest on the dissected Tertiary basaltic plateau was cleared from the late 19 th century for dairying and sugar cane. From the 1970 s, horticultural enterprises such as macadamias, avocadoes and stone fruits started to expand. Today, less than 1 % of the original rainforest remains on the plateau. The intensification of horticulture, <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rapidly <b>growing</b> regional population, has increased the demand for water. Increased groundwater allocations with the possibility of over-extraction and contamination, resulted in the plateau being designated a Groundwater Management Area in 1985. This requires an assessment of the sustainable yield of the groundwater resource, including an understanding of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), the components of the environment that have a dependency based on the permanent or temporary presence of groundwater. There is a high degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water on the plateau. The permeable krasnoze...|$|R

30|$|Based on explorative factor analysis, three {{different}} orientations {{revealed by the}} Delphi panel suggest three visions of what urban passenger transport may look like in 2050. We should perhaps underscore once more {{that this is not}} an indicator of the desired future, but rather what are seen as the most likely visions. The first and most dominant is of a future in which urban passenger transport will be actively transformed through efficient public transport solutions for all urban citizens. The transition, however, will demand active legislation and taxation to prohibit use of fossil-fueled vehicles and use of individual CO 2 quotas – a “controlled mobility” vision of the future urban environment. This approach envisages a city region controlled by a political authority where terrorism and criminality are more widespread, and demanding strong security measures at transport hubs. There is thus the hint of a more dystopian development in this dominant vision, a vision that comes close to what Urry and others have described as a “controlled mobility future” [33]. There are some interesting paradoxes, however. While on the one hand it describes strong measures to curb use of private cars in cities, on the other hand long-distance commuting between large cities will become more widespread. The controlled mobility vision is in many ways a continuation of policies today, where transformation to more eco-friendly transport is <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rapidly <b>growing</b> globalization of passenger transport and freight.|$|R

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of recent technological developments which have stimulated the use of telecommunication technologies in healthcare delivery to persons with chronic illnesses. Although the potential of this approach has been well recognised since the early 1960 s, limitations of early telecommunication technologies (such as absence of common protocols), restricted accessibility, and high cost prevented their widespread use.

Renewed interest in these arts have also led to various individuals to pursue on their own whatever education they can obtain, whether through distance learning courses from foreign universities, or via books and magazines. In addition, privately funded students have also been obtaining arts education and training at undergraduate and graduate levels in international universities.More indirectly, artists also get the opportunity to meet foreign artists through the tourism trade when foreign artists visit the country as tourists. This provides the much needed contact with artists that is so necessary to the development of any art form.Until recently, fine arts in the Maldives have been usually defined as the various crafts and skills of craft making.

5000|$|The first {{phrase in}} turn {{led to the}} second phrase, the [...] "advance" [...] of growing {{prosperity}} that lasted until 1530. After 1530, Le Roy Ladurie maintained that the [...] "stubborn inelasticity" [...] of farming practices in Languedoc <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> population led to a period of economic decline that lasted {{for the rest of}} the 16th century. Peasants planted more grain, but owing to combination of cultural conservatism, a short of capital and a refusal to innovate, could not increase the productivity of the land to match the increasing population. The growing numbers of mouths to feed together with the [...] "stubborn inelasticity" [...] of Languedoc farming methods led a period of social misery with more and more struggling to survive on less and less. Many peasants moved to other provinces in a search of a better life while those that remained in Languedoc tended to get married at a later age in order to limit family size. In the 16th century, ordinary people in Languedoc were all too aware that they were living in very tough times, but Le Roy Ladurie wrote that they were [...] "preoccupied to the point of self-immolation" [...] with religious issues. The Reformation had badly divided ordinary people, and during the French Wars of Religion, Protestants and Catholics fought one another over social domination of Languedoc society. Between 1562-1598, a series of civil wars took place in France between Catholics and Huguenots to determine whatever France would be a Catholic or Calvinist nation, and as such Frenchmen went about killing each other with much passion and fury; both sides were convinced that their faith was the one true faith and literally France's salvation was in the balance. The Reformed Church had made great gains in the south of France, and as such Languedoc like many provinces in the south was the scene of especially vicious fighting during the Wars of Religion. Le Roy Ladurie argued that it was the devastating effect of the civil wars in France that gave birth to both anti-tax revolts as the peasants objected to the increased taxes that the series of civil wars entitled and a widespread belief in witchcraft, which held out the promise of a more just society. Le Roy Ladurie wrote that witchcraft represented the lingering survival of the beliefs of the ancient pagan religion before Languedoc had been converted to Christianity. The ancient Celts had thrown valuable objects into the water to appease the powerful water spirits that were believed to live in the waters while later on the Romans had imported the belief in Dryads (woodland nymphs) and Naiads (water nymphs). Despite becoming nominally Christian, people in Languedoc for centuries afterwards continued to throw valuable objects into the water to please the spirits that were believed to reside in the waters. Peasant folklore had it that certain favored young women could be invited to join the sisterhood of the Naiads and that if they accepted the invitation by diving nude into the magical waters, they would be transformed into a sensuous Naiad who would be forever young. Le Roy Ladurie suggested that these folktales about young women turning into Dryads or Naiads reflected both female fantasies of escape from the patriarchal society of 16th century Languedoc and a way of the peasants of explaining away young women who had run away. [...] Given the prevalence of such beliefs, many peasants took it for granted that certain women were witches who had magical powers and could talk to the spirts of the forest and the waters. During the period of the Wars of Religion, that for many ordinary people repulsed in equal measure both by the brutal fanaticism of the Catholics and the Huguenots turned to these women who claimed to have magical powers, both as a rejection of the bloody mayhem caused by the Wars of Religion and of the existing social order which Christianity, whenever it be Protestantism or Catholicism upheld. Le Roy Ladurie wrote that the appeal of witchcraft with its glorification of sensuous pleasures of the human body held out the promise of a [...] "social inversion", which it failed to deliver upon. In studying cultural and religious history of Languedoc, Le Roy Ladurie was very different from many other Annales historians who usually ignored these aspects of history. Le Roy Ladurie wrote that by the end of the 16th century, the [...] "Malthusian curse" [...] had befallen Languedoc as the heavy population growth was not matched by increased productivity of the land to provide enough food for the all the extra mouths to feed.|$|E

Recently, however, under ballot initiatives four states in the US have legalised commercial, non-medical (recreational) cannabis markets. Several other states will initiate similar ballot measures attached to the 2016 election that will also appoint a new President. As {{the first state to}} implement the legislation in 2014, Colorado is an important example to begin investigating early consequences of specific policy choices while other jurisdictions consider their own legislation although the empirical evidence base is only beginning to accrue. Method: This paper brings together material sourced from peer reviewed academic papers, grey literature publications, reports in mass media and niche media outlets, and government publications to outline the regulatory model and process in Colorado and to describe {{some of the issues that}} have emerged in the first 20 months of its operation.

Population ageing (mainly due to increasing life expectancy) <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> constant <b>growing</b> rate of individuals living in collective households, leads to a substantial increase of demand of collective households (Vandresse & Bureau, 2013).

Furthermore, the stringent European performance environmental regulations for the building sector require that by 2020, all new construction are zero or nearly zero energy, (equivalent to 15 kWh/m 2 /year), with 60 % efficient on-site coverage by renewable energy.

A thirty years old overcapacity <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>growing</b> market led to a steadily eroding profitability of steel companies, particularly in developed economies. These factors determined an industry profile delineated by a relentless quest for cost cutting and efficient operations. Regarding innovation, the approach of {{the steel industry}} has been reactive, basically following market requirements. The industry has historically found itself far from its customers businesses and has struggled to find innovative products and services that could meet an unperceived or unarticulated need so as to propose higher value and grow its market. Two important customers of the steel industry are the oil and gas and the automotive industries, two mature businesses as well. Even when changes in these two steel users have also been relatively slow, the more recent technological trends analyzed in this work suggest an upcoming faster pace of change. This thesis examines these recent technological trends in the oil and gas and automotive industries with regards to the potential impact in the steel industry. Some of the technological gaps that might be encountered in those trends are visited, in particular where substitution of lighter materials for steel is a possible avenue. Other cases where the new technological trend may affect consumption of steel are also analyzed. Following these lines, the thesis goes on analyzing the steel general approach to innovation and R&D and speculates on provocative alternatives to that approach that could put the industry in a better position for the future. by Marco M.

This {{economic}} impact assessment follows on from that report by assessing the growth potential for the Creative Sector in the Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s Western Region resulting from recommendations made by Creative West and has attempted to measure the outcome of these actions through consultation with the sector. This economic impact assessment demonstrates {{the potential impact of}} the growth of the sector alone. It also attempts to gauge the spillover impacts of the sector in the region and beyond. Ultimately, this is an extremely difficult exercise such is the far reaching and deeply ingrained nature of creativity in social, economic and cultural senses. In line with the Creative West report, we recognize that the creative sector stimulates innovation in other sectors, plays a key social role and can stimulate both rural and regional development. With this in mind, the region should turn its attention to estimating the costs of not investing in its creative sector. What are the quality of life implications of a place that neglects its creativity? How will it look to outsiders (tourists and business investors) if it fails to <b>combine</b> natural talent <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> economic sector? What of its lived environment? Without a vibrant local industry, one as forward looking (in terms of conservation and innovation) what will appeal to the youth to stay in the region and help build its economy, society and community...|$|R
5000|$|Using {{community}} recycling from {{yard and}} kitchen waste utilizes a local area's commonly available resources. These {{resources in the}} past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites, are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming. Other practices includes <b>growing</b> <b>a</b> diverse number of perennial crops in a single field, each of which would grow in separate season {{so as not to}} compete with each other for natural resources. This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil. Nitrogen fixation from legumes, for example, used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth, helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will <b>grow</b> for <b>a</b> season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate, and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest.Monoculture, <b>a</b> method of <b>growing</b> only one crop at a time in a given field, is a very widespread practice, but there are questions about its sustainability, especially if the same crop is grown every year. Today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them. This <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>growing</b> <b>a</b> mixture of crops (polyculture) sometimes reduces disease or pest problems [...] but polyculture has rarely, if ever, been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years (crop rotation) with the same overall crop diversity. Cropping systems that include a variety of crops (polyculture and/or rotation) may also replenish nitrogen (if legumes are included) and may also use resources such as sunlight, water, or nutrients more efficiently (Field Crops Res. 34:239).|$|R
