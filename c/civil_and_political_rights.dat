Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of McCarthy, the word McCarthyism has entered American speech as a general term {{for a variety of}} practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism. McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.|$|E

He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights,</b> granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed {{out of the hospital}} and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Duties of {{citizens}} {{were added to}} the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. However, many of these are non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on <b>Civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Rights,</b> and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{rights in}} Ethiopia under Selassie's regime were poor. <b>Civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> were low with Freedom House giving Ethiopia a [...] "Not Free" [...] score for both <b>civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> {{in the last}} years of Selassie's rule. Common human right abuses {{included}} imprisonment <b>and</b> torture of <b>political</b> prisoners <b>and</b> very poor prison conditions. The Ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the Eritrean separatists. This was due to a policy of destroying Eritrean villages that supported the rebels. There were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late 1960s and early '70s.|$|R

5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} their analysis of {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E

40|$|Using panel data {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the effects of}} institutions {{on the success of}} reforms and integration in the Maghreb. Institutional quality measures are developed using fuzzy-set based transformations of <b>civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights.</b> We posit that these transformations are quite appropriate given the nature of freedom indicators. We show that using fuzzy-set transformed measures provides useful insights regarding the quality of institutions in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that institutions {{play a significant role in}} the success or failure of economic reforms. This conclusion is in clear contrast to views that propose a sequencing in which <b>civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights</b> should come after economic reforms are already in place and fully operational...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} women’s <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> citizenship <b>rights</b> in the post-Good Friday Agreement {{period in}} Northern Ireland. It argues that while The Good Friday Agreement offered an initial potential to expand these rights, these rights {{have not yet}} been realised. In particular, women’s <b>political</b> citizenship <b>rights,</b> explicitly addressed in the Good Friday Agreement, are lagging. Three possible explanations for this situation are examined including: the slow pace of equality and gender mainstreaming, reluctance on the part of political parties to take up available (United Kingdom) legislation to advance women’s candidature for <b>political</b> office <b>and</b> the limits of a rights based discourse in Northern Ireland. Some possibilities for working beyond the Good Friday Agreement to advance women’s <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> citizenship <b>rights</b> in Northern Ireland are proposed and considered...|$|R

40|$|Latin America is commemorating 30 {{years of}} the deepest and far {{reaching}} democratization process that has ever {{taken place in the}} region. The transition from authoritarianism and dictatorships fostered a widespread electoral euphoria which was accompanied by much looked-for <b>and</b> needed <b>civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights.</b> As a result democracy became {{the only game in town}} (except for Cuba). However, after three decades of, for the most part, free and fair elections unsatisfied social aspirations and needs, remain reflected in the steady levels of poverty and inequity, which exert pressure on the <b>political</b> systems <b>and</b> constitute a challenging scenario for governability and for the enjoyment of not only <b>civil</b> liberties <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>rights,</b> but also social, economic and cultural rights.

50|$|In 1709, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, {{ruler of}} the Habsburg Monarchy, issued a decree {{allowing}} Jews to return to Inner Austria. Nevertheless, Jews in that time settled almost exclusively in the commercial city of Trieste and, to a much smaller extent, {{in the town of}} Gorizia (now both part of Italy). The decree was overturned in 1817 by Francis I, and Jews were granted full <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>right</b> only with the Austrian constitution of 1867. Nevertheless, the Slovene Lands remained virtually without a consistent Jewish population, with the exception of Gorizia, Trieste, the region of Prekmurje, and some smaller towns {{in the western part of}} the County of Gorizia and Gradisca (Gradisca, Cervignano), which were inhabited mostly by a Friulian-speaking population. According to the census of 1910, only 146 Jews lived in the territory of present-day Slovenia, excluding the Prekmurje region.|$|R
