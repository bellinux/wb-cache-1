5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same basic {{configuration}} (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with {{a different type of}} fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

500|$|Robinson founded E-Tech in 1978, which {{developed}} heat pump technology and high-technology related to energy conservation, energy conversion, and solar energy. When interviewed about E-Tech's founding, Robinson said [...] "I like to pioneer new fields, to start small businesses." [...] E-Tech acquired Scientific Atlanta's Special Products Division, which included staff, research contracts, patented products in solar energy, and specialized equipment. Its first product was an {{electric heat pump}} water heater, the Efficiency II, that reduced water heating bills by 50% and provided an equipment payback of three years. E-Tech worked {{on a range of}} United States Department of Energy contracts in the field of solar energy. In 1986, E-Tech merged with Crispaire Corporation, which specialized in <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> for telecommunications systems, school classrooms, and commercial/industrial structures. The merger resulted in Robinson taking over the new entity, which also operated under the trade name Marvair.

2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a bimetallic strip {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> to respectively add or remove heat to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|E

2500|$|While the stadium's minimalist design {{allowed for}} very good sight lines, it also exposed both spectators and players {{to the full}} brunt of Tampa's {{subtropical}} climate. [...] This was especially true after the stadium was fully enclosed for the Bucs' 1976 inaugural season, cutting off breezes which had flowed through the open endzones. While fans could retreat under the grandstands to {{the shade of the}} wide concourses where concessions and restrooms were located, players and personnel on the field had no such recourse. <b>Cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> was usually placed near the sideline benches. [...] The Buccaneers were also allowed to wear their white jerseys at home, forcing their opponents to suffer in their darker (and hotter) jerseys. During the summer and early autumn, events in the stadium were often scheduled in the evening hours to avoid the often oppressive afternoon heat and humidity. In another nod to local weather, the natural grass playing surface was highly crowned to provide rapid drainage during Tampa's intense thunderstorms, with the sidelines almost 18 inches lower than the center of the field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|In a BWR, the {{containment}} strategy {{is a bit}} different. [...] A BWR's containment consists of a drywell where the reactor and associated <b>cooling</b> <b>equipment</b> is located and a wetwell. [...] The drywell is much smaller than a PWR containment and plays a larger role. During the theoretical leakage design basis accident the reactor coolant flashes to steam in the drywell, pressurizing it rapidly. [...] Vent pipes or tubes from the drywell direct the steam below the water level maintained in the wetwell (also known as a torus or suppression pool), condensing the steam, limiting the pressure ultimately reached. [...] Both the drywell and the wetwell are enclosed by a secondary containment building, maintained at a slight sub-atmospheric or negative pressure during normal operation and refueling operations. The containment designs are referred to by the names Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III. The Mark I is the oldest, distinguished by a drywell containment which resembles an inverted lightbulb above the wetwell which is a steel torus containing water. The Mark II was used with late BWR-4 and BWR-5 reactors. It is called an [...] "over-under" [...] configuration with the drywell forming a truncated cone on a concrete slab. Below is a cylindrical suppression chamber made of concrete rather than just sheet metal. Both use a lightweight steel or concrete [...] "secondary containment" [...] over the top floor which is kept at a slight negative pressure so that air can be filtered. The top level is a large open space with an overhead crane suspended between the two long walls for moving heavy fuel caskets from the ground floor, and removing / replacing hardware from the reactor and reactor well. The reactor well can be flooded and is straddled by pools separated by gates on either side for storing reactor hardware normally placed above the fuel rods, and for fuel storage. A refueling platform has a specialized telescoping mast for lifting and lowering fuel rod assemblies with precision through the [...] "cattle chute" [...] to the reactor core area.|$|E
