50|$|An AXIN2 {{mutation}} (1966C>T) {{detected in}} a Finnish family {{was associated with}} both tooth agenesis and <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> In essence, the mutation seems to disrupt tooth development early in life and later contributes {{to the emergence of}} polyps and eventually colon cancer, an observation that suggests that the lack of permanent teeth may be an indicator of colon cancer susceptibility. Dentists may at the very least need to remain aware of the possible association, to be able to detect such cases of tooth agenesis and forward the patient to more complete genetic diagnostic examinations. This is a simple example of how molecular genetic discoveries today interact with traditional disciplines (Longtin, 2004).|$|E
40|$|Background A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} has suggested that metformin potentially reduces the risk of cancer. Objective We performed a meta-analysis of available studies to better define the effect of metformin on <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (cancer and polyps) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods Medical literature searches for human studies were performed through December 2015, using suitable keywords. Pooled estimates were obtained using fixed or random-effects models. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with the Cochran Q test whereas the likelihood of publication bias was assessed by constructing funnel plots. Their symmetry was estimated by the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test and by the Egger's regression test. In addition subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results A total number of 709, 980 patients, with type 2 diabetes, were included in 17 studies eligible for meta-analysis [1 RCT and 16 observational studies (13 cohort and 3 case–controls) ]. The risk of <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> was significantly lower among metformin users than controls (non-metformin users) [pooled RRs (95 % CI)  =  0. 75 (0. 65 – 0. 87), test for overall effect Z = −  3. 95, p <  0. 001]. This observation applied separately for colon cancer [0. 79 (0. 69 – 0. 91), Z = −  3. 34, p <  0. 001] and for colon polyps [0. 58 (0. 42 – 0. 80), Z = −  3. 30, p <  0. 001]. Conclusion This meta-analysis shows that the use of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with significantly lower risk of <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Peritoneal washing is {{now part}} of the {{standard}} clinical practice in several abdominal and pelvic neoplasias. However, in colorectal cancer surgery, intra-peritoneal free cancer cells (IFCC) presence is not routinely investigated and their prognostic meaning is still unclear. When peritoneal washing results are positive for the presence of IFCC a worse outcome is usually expected in these colorectal cancer operated patients, but it what is not clear is whether it is associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. It is authors' belief that {{one of the main reasons}} why IFCC are not researched as integral part of the routine staging system for colon cancer is that there still isn't a diagnostic or detection method with enough sensibility and specificity. However, the potential clinical implications of a routine research for the presence IFCC in <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasias</b> are enormous: not only to obtain a more accurate clinical staging but also to offer different therapy protocols, based on the presence of IFCC. Based on this, adjuvant chemotherapy could be offered to those patients found to be positive for IFCC; also, protocols of proactive intraperitoneal chemotherapy could be applied. Although presence of IFCC appears to have a valid prognostic significance, further studies are needed to standardize detection and examination procedures, to determine if there are and which are the stages more likely to benefit from routine search for IFCC...|$|R

Cow milk contains sphingomyelin, butyric acid, conjugated linoleic acid, calcium, vitamin A, carotene and vitamin D. All of these components are known to inhibit the process of carcinogenesis. Our objective was to determine the effect of cow milk and water buffalo milk on the development of <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasias</b> in an experimental model of carcinogenesis in rats induced with 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Three-month-old Wistar male rats with an average body weight of 180 g were given a nutritionally adequate diet and drinking water ad-livitum, cow milk or water buffalo milk. The milk diets were provided two weeks before the first DMH treatment and their administration was continued during the 10 weeks of DMH treatment. Milk administra-tion finished two weeks after the last DMH doses treatment. Four months after the last carcinogen injection, all surviving animals were sacrificed and examined for intestinal tumors. The number, size, and location of the tumors were recorded and gross pathology was described. Small tumors (< 2. 5 mm) were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

40|$|Regional {{increases}} in DNA methylation occur in normally unmethylated cytosine-rich areas in neoplastic cells.

One-hundred and two patients were enrolled, and 100 patients (61 males and mean age 63 years) were finally analyzed. The total number of polyps detected by FICE and white light colonoscopy was 65 and 45, respectively. The miss rate for all polyps with FICE (24 %) was significantly less than that with white light (46 %) (P = 0. 03).

40|$|O 6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA {{repair enzyme}} {{with the ability}} to protect cells from DNA {{mutations}} by removing alkyl groups from the O 6 position of guanine. Colon mucosa is exposed to the direct effects of environmental carcinogens and therefore maintaining a proficient DNA repair system is very important to stay protected against DNA mutagenesis. Loss of MGMT expression is almost exclusively associated with methylation of CpG islands in the MGMT gene promoter region which is found in approximately 40 % of colorectal cancers. The role of MGMT loss in colorectal tumorigenesis is complex but numerous studies have documented methylation of this gene even in the normal appearing mucosa as well as in aberrant crypt foci, suggesting that MGMT methylation can be regarded as an early event or field defect in <b>colon</b> cancer <b>neoplasia.</b> The focus of this perspective is the role of MGMT in different pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis as well as the implication of this molecule in treatment decisions in colorectal cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} survivin, {{telomerase}} catalytic subunit (TERT), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2), inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} (iNOS) and the regulatory factors c-MYB and Tcf- 4 are often found in human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC) and have been implicated {{in the development and}} progression of tumorigenesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the expression of these genes in mouse models of sporadic and colitis-associated CRC. To address these issues, we used qRT-PCR approach to determine changes in gene expression patterns of neoplastic cells (high-grade dysplasia/intramucosal carcinoma) and surrounding normal epithelial cells in A/J and ICR mouse strains using laser microdissection. Both strains were injected with azoxymethane and ICR mice were also given drinking water that contained 2 % dextran sodium sulphate. In both sporadic (A/J mice) and colitis-associated (ICR mice) models of CRC, the levels of TERT mRNA, COX- 2 mRNA and Tcf- 4 mRNA were higher in neoplastic cells than in surrounding normal epithelial cells. In contrast, survivin mRNA was upregulated only in neoplastic cells from A/J mice and ILK mRNA was upregulated only in neoplastic cells from ICR mice. However, the expression of iNOS mRNA was similar in normal and neoplastic cells in both models and c-MYB mRNA was actually downregulated in neoplastic cells compared with normal cells in both models. These findings suggest that the genetic background and/or the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis associated with genotoxic insults and colonic inflammation influence the gene expression of mTERT, COX- 2, Tcf- 4, c-MYB, ILK and survivin in <b>colon</b> epithelial <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|R

40|$|Marked {{increased}} {{expression of}} cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2), a prostaglandin-synthesizing enzyme that is pharmacologically inhibited by nonsteroid anti-inflammatory-type drugs, {{is a major}} early oncogenic event in the genesis of human <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> We report that, in addition to inducing expression of COX- 2, colon cancers further target the prostaglandin biogenesis pathway by ubiquitously abrogating expression of 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15 -PGDH), a prostaglandin-degrading enzyme that physiologically antagonizes COX- 2. We find that 15 -PGDH transcript and protein are both highly expressed by normal colonic epithelia but are nearly undetectable in colon cancers. Using gene transfection to restore 15 -PGDH expression in colon cancer cells strongly inhibits the ability of these cells to form tumors in immune-deficient mice and demonstrates 15 -PGDH to have functional colon cancer tumor suppressor activity. In interrogating the mechanism for 15 -PGDH expression loss in colon cancer, we determined that colonic 15 -PGDH expression is directly controlled and strongly induced by activation of the TGF-β tumor suppressor pathway. These findings thus delineate an enzymatic pathway that induces colon cancer suppression, a pathway that is activated by TGF-β and mediated by 15 -PGDH...|$|E

We determined prediagnostic levels of adiponectin and leptin in Caucasians (217 cases and 650 controls) and African Americans (175 cases and 378 controls) participating in the Case Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer Colon Adenoma Study. We evaluated mediating effects of adiponectin and leptin on the association of abdominal adiposity and colon adenoma separately according to race using mediational pathway analysis. Results. We observed differences in circulating adipokine concentrations by race; African Americans had higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin than Caucasians for both adenoma cases and controls (P values 0. 27).

By a crossed reading of patients' experience we obtained two type of informations: how CORD is working (CORD is the structure which has the role of coordination of oncological pathway, according to the regional guidelines) and which are the strength ness and the weakness of the services delivered by each healthcare unit participating at the study. The patient experience in benchmarking through out different institutions, has been useful for managers to start an internal process of reviewing critical points regarding above all humanization and care coordination along the heath care pathway. Particularly interesting is the case of the University Hospital of Pisa, where the patients indications allowed the institution to reengineering the process, to improve services and empower the communication skills of the physicians and nurses involved in the clinical pathway.

We tested the hypothesis that congenitally missing teeth may occur more commonly in individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer than in individuals without this diagnosis. METHODS: Via a survey conducted on 1636 individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 2788 individuals with no colorectal cancer from the Colon Cancer Family Registry, self-reported information on congenitally missing teeth was collected. The frequency of missing teeth between cases and controls was compared using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: 4. 8 % of cases and 5. 7 % of controls reported having at least one missing tooth (p[*]=[*] 0. 20). When we stratified by recruitment site, gender, and mutation status where available, frequency of missing teeth was not statistically significantly different between cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide support for there being a general predisposition to missing teeth among a large cohort of CRC patients.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} biological prevention with flavonoids the recurrence risk of neoplasia was {{studied in}} patients with resected colorectal cancer and after adenoma polypectomy. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients, 36 patients with resected colon cancer and 51 patients after polypectomy, were divided into 2 groups: one group was treated with a flavonoid mixture (daily standard dose 20 mg apigenin and 20 mg epigallocathechin-gallat, n = 31) and compared with a matched control group (n = 56). Both groups were observed for 3 - 4 years by surveillance colonoscopy and by questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 87 patients enrolled in this study, 36 had resected colon cancer and 29 of these patients had surveillance colonoscopy. Among the flavonoid-treated patients with resected colon cancer (n = 14), there was no cancer recurrence and one adenoma developed. In contrast the cancer recurrence rate of the 15 matched untreated controls was 20 % (3 of 15) and adenomas evolved in 4 of those patients (27 %). The combined recurrence rate for neoplasia was 7 % (1 of 14) in the treated patients and 47 % (7 of 15) in the controls (P = 0. 027).

Additional studies demonstrated that increased levels of mRNAs encoding several other ribosomal proteins, including S 6, S 8, S 12, L 5, and P 0, were present in colorectal tumors and polyps. These results suggest that there is increased synthesis of ribosomes in colorectal tumors and that this increase is an early event in <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Tumorigenesis of the colon is thought to be a complex multistep process involving multiple molecular events that are seen as changes in gene structure, expression, and activity (24, 25). Some of these changes are important to the development and progression of the disease in that they directly contribute to the neoplastic or invasive behavior of the tumor. On the other hand, many of these changes may b...|$|E

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) {{are involved}} in aspirin metabolism and clearance, and variant alleles in UGT 1 A 6 {{have been shown to}} alter salicylic acid metabolism and risk of <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> In a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of 44 healthy men and women, homozygous for UGT 1 A 6 * 1 or UGT 1 A 6 * 2, we explored differences between global epithelial and stromal expression, using Affymetrix U 133 + 2. 0 microarrays and tested effects of 60 -day aspirin supplementation (325  mg/d) on epithelial and stromal gene expression and colon prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels. We conducted a comprehensive study of differential gene expression between normal human colonic epithelium and stroma from healthy individuals. Although no statistically significant differences in gene expression were observed in response to aspirin or UGT 1 A 6 genotype, we have identified the genes uniquely and reproducibly expressed in each tissue type and have analyzed the biologic processes they represent. Here we describe in detail how the data, deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) – accession number GSE 71571 – was generated including the basic analysis as contained in the manuscript published in BMC Medical Genetics with the PMID 25927723 (Thomas et al., 2015 [9]) ...|$|E
40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play {{a central}} role in the {{recognition}} and response to microbial pathogens and in the maintenance and function of the epithelial barrier integrity in the gut. The protein MyD 88 adaptor-like (Mal/TIRAP) serves as a bridge between TLR 2 /TLR 4 - and MyD 88 -mediated signaling to orchestrate downstream inflammatory responses. Whereas MyD 88 has an essential function in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, a role for Mal in this context is less well described. Colitis was induced in wild-type (WT) and Mal-deficient (Mal(-/-)) mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Colitis-associated cancer was induced by DSS and azoxymethane (AOM) treatment. Chimeric mice were generated by total body gamma irradiation followed by transplantation of bone marrow cells. In the DSS model of colon epithelial injury, Mal(-/-) mice developed increased inflammation and severity of colitis relative to WT mice. Mal(-/-) mice demonstrated the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates, increased crypt proliferation, and presence of neoformations. Furthermore, in the AOM/DSS model, Mal(-/-) mice had greater incidence of tumors. Mal(-/-) and WT bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that nonhematopoietic cell expression of Mal had an important protective role in the control of intestinal inflammation and inflammation-associated cancer. Mal is essential for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and expression of Mal in nonhematopoietic cells prevents chronic intestinal inflammation that may predispose to <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the impact of a standardized laparoscopic intracorporeal right colectomy on the short-term outcome of patients with neoplasia. Methods Consecutive patients with histologically proven right <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> underwent a standardized laparoscopic intracorporeal right colectomy with medial to lateral approach encompassing ten sequential steps: 1) ligation of ileocolic vessels, 2) identification of right ureter, 3) dissection along superior mesenteric vein, 4) division of omentum, 5) division of right branch of middle colic vessels, 6) transection of transverse colon, 7) mobilization of right colon, 8) transection of terminal ileum, 9) ileocolic anastomosis, 10) delivery of specimen. Values were medians (ranges). Results From July 2002 to June 2005, 111 laparoscopic intracorporeal right colectomies were attempted with a 5. 4 percent conversion rate. There were 57 women and 54 men, aged 64. 9 (range, 40 – 85) years, with body mass index of 33 (range, 20 – 43), American Society of Anesthesiology score of 2 (range, 2 – 4), 36. 9 percent comorbidities, and 37. 8 percent previous abdominal surgery. The indication for surgery was cancer in 109 patients. Operative time was 120 (range, 80 – 185) minutes. Estimated blood loss was 69 (range, 50 – 600) ml. Overall length of skin incisions was 66 (range, 60 – 66) mm; 29 (range, 2 – 41) lymph nodes were harvested. Length of stay was four (range, 2 – 30) days. Complication rate was 4. 5 percent. Conclusions A standardized laparoscopic intracorporeal right colectomy resulted in a favorable short-term outcome in unselected patients with neoplasia of the right colon...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims: Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is {{expressed}} robustly in human <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> {{and is a}} major new "rational" target of therapy for cancers of the colon and other organs. Nonetheless, the mechanism(s) of action of VEGF-targeted therapies and the biologic roles of VEGF in tumorigenesis have not been well defined. We used a transgenic approach to directly test the hypothesis that augmented VEGF expression can drive progression of intestinal neoplasia. Methods: Transgenic mouse lines were generated with moderate (vilVEGF 1) and high (vilVEGF 2) VEGF expression from the intestinal epithelium. vilVEGF 1 mice were bred to Min mice (adenomatous polyposis coli [APC] +/-). Colon epithelial cells from an APC patient were cocultured with endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Results: viIVEGF mice were generally healthy but displayed red small intestines. Vessels were larger and more numerous in the submucosa but not the mucosa. The mucosa showed striking stromal and epithelial hypercellularity, with increased epithelial proliferation. Many crypts formed cysts composed of relatively undifferentiated epithelial cells surrounded by cells with endothelial and myofibroblast markers. Compared with Min controls, vilVEGF 1 -Min mice developed 6 -fold more intestinal adenomas of all sizes, with more advanced histologic features. Polycystic masses were also observed. Coculture of human colonocytes with endothelial cells and fibroblasts directly stimulated colonocyte proliferation. Conclusions: Augmented VEGF expression from intestinal epithelium potently stimulated cross talk with mesenchymal cells and proliferation of normal and neoplastic epithelium. These effects of VEGF, largely occurring prior to the canonical angiogenic switch in tumors, may be in part independent of angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The orphan cotransport protein {{expressed}} by the SLC 5 A 8 gene {{has been shown to}} play a role in controlling the growth of colon cancers, and the silencing of this gene is a common and early event in human <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> We expressed this protein in Xenopus laevis oocytes and have found that it transports small monocarboxylic acids. The electrogenic activity of the cotransporter, which we have named SMCT (sodium monocarboxylate transporter), was dependent on external Na+ and was compatible with a 3 : 1 stoichiometry between Na+ and monocarboxylates. A portion of the SMCT-mediated current was also Cl− dependent, but Cl− was not cotransported. SMCT transports a variety of monocarboxylates (similar to unrelated monocarboxylate transport proteins) and most transported monocarboxylates demonstrated Km values near 100 μm, apart from acetate and d-lactate, for which the protein showed less affinity. SMCT was strongly inhibited by 1 mm probenecid or ibuprofen. In the absence of external substrate, a Na+-independent leak current was also observed to pass through SMCT. SMCT activity was strongly inhibited after prolonged exposure to high external concentrations of monocarboxylates. The transport of monocarboxylates in anionic form was confirmed by the observation of a concomitant alkalinization of the cytosol. SMCT, being expressed in colon and kidney, represents a novel means by which Na+, short-chain fatty acids and other monocarboxylates are transported in these tissues. The significance of a Na+–monocarboxylate transporter to colon cancer presumably stems from the transport of butyrate, which is well known for having anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity in colon epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesNeoplasias can be {{associated}} with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) with the consequent blood incompatibility that hinders blood transfusion. The authors describe and discuss the conduct in three patients undergoing surgical intervention for neoplastic disease with positive Coombs Test (CT), and the impossibility to determine the blood type. Case report 1 st case: 87 -year old male patient, ASA III, scheduled for surgery for <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> The patient had positive CT, being treated with corticosteroids, immunoglobulin (Ig), and erythropoietin, after which it was possible to determine his blood type. One unit of packed-red blood cells (PRBC) was transfused intraoperatively without intercurrences. Twenty four hours after the transfusion, the patient died due to an ischemic stroke. 2 nd case: 77 -year old male patient, ASA III, scheduled for surgery for a gastric carcinoma. The patient had a positive CT, being treated with corticosteroids and Ig, but we were unable to determine his blood type. The surgery was performed without intercurrences. The patient died on the 18 th postoperative day after a cardiorespiratory arrest. 3 rd case: 80 -year old female patient, ASA IV, undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy. She also had a positive CT. The surgery (hemicolectomy) was performed without intercurrences. The patient died 48 hours after the surgery from an ischemic stroke. ConclusionsCirculating autoantibodies in AHA can make it impossible to determine the blood type to transfuse compatible blood. Proper treatment of AHA is aimed at remission of autoantibodies and anemia. When {{it is not possible to}} determine the blood type, the procedure should be a life-saving blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{germline}} allele-specific expression (ASE) of {{the gene}} encoding for transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGFBR 1) has been proposed {{to be a major}} risk factor for cancer predisposition in the colon. Germline ASE results in a lowered expression of one of the TGFBR 1 alleles (> 1. 5 -fold), and was shown to occur in approximately 20 % of informative familial and sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. In the present study, using the highly quantitative pyrosequencing technique, we estimated the frequency of ASE in TGFBR 1 in a cohort of affected individuals from familial clusters of advanced colon neoplasias (cancers and adenomas with high-grade dysplasia), and also from a cohort of individuals with sporadic CRCs. Cases were considered positive for the presence of ASE if demonstrating an allelic expression ratio 1. 5. Using RNA derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines, we find that of 46 informative Caucasian advanced <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> cases with a family history, only 2 individuals display a modest ASE, with allelic ratios of 1. 65 and 1. 73, respectively. Given that ASE of TGFBR 1, if present, would likely be more pronounced in the colon compared with other tissues, we additionally determined the allele ratios of TGFBR 1 in the RNA derived from normal-appearing colonic mucosa of sporadic CRC cases. We, however, found no evidence of ASE in any of 44 informative sporadic cases analyzed. Taken together, we find that germline ASE of TGFBR 1, as assayed in lymphoblastoid and colon epithelial cells of colon cancer patients, is a relatively rare event...|$|E
40|$|Type C-related human {{endogenous}} retroviral sequences {{have been}} previously discovered and characterized [Martin, M. A., Bryan, T., Rasheed, S. & Khan, A. S. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4892 - 4896]. We investigated the transcriptional pattern of these sequences {{to determine whether}} {{and to what extent}} their expression is altered in colon tumors and colon cancer cell lines as compared to normal colon mucosa (NCM). Of two long terminal repeat (LTR) -specific transcripts [3. 6 and 2. 1 kilobases (kb) ], the 3. 6 -kb RNA was particularly abundant in NCM but strikingly decreased in most primary colon cancers tested. In NCM we identified three envelope gene (env) -related transcripts [...] namely, 3. 0, 1. 7, and 0. 6 kb. Colon tumors appeared to express higher levels of these transcripts, especially the 1. 7 -kb species. In one case of dysplasia and in one benign tumor, this 1. 7 -kb transcript was clearly increased. We also examined the pattern of transcription in colon cancer cell lines HCT and Caco 2. The LTR-homologous 3. 6 -kb transcript, very abundant in NCM, was decreased in primary tumors and in HCT cells and virtually absent in Caco 2 cells. The latter, however, appeared to produce the transcript when growing exponentially, indicating that Caco 2 cultures provide an inducible system susceptible to in vitro manipulation. Both cell lines also contained higher amounts of the 1. 7 -kb env-related transcript. The decrease of the 3. 6 -kb RNA in colon tumors versus NCM {{may be the result of}} an altered pattern of differentiation, whereas the increase of the 1. 7 -kb RNA in tumors may represent an early marker of <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The {{association}} between Helicobacter pylori infection and <b>colon</b> <b>neoplasia</b> {{has been the}} subject of recent investigations which have produced controversial results. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with colonic adenomas and also in patients whose colonoscopy exams were normal. METHODS: After colonoscopy, the individuals were distributed into two groups: patients with colon adenomas (cases) and patients whose colons were normal (controls). The groups were similar regarding age and gender. The individuals of both groups were subjected to a dosage of IgG antibody against H. pylori. The dosage was applied according to the solid phase, chemiluminescent immunometric assay. The chi-square test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: There were 30 men and 64 women in each group (94 cases and 94 controls). The mean age of the cases was 59. 79 ± 12. 25 years and that of the controls was 58. 98 ± 11. 55 years. The H. pylori serology was positive for 66 (70. 21 %) of the cases and for 51 (54. 25 %) of the controls. There was a significant difference (P = 0. 024). The odds ratio was 1. 98 (CI 95 %, 0. 82 - 3. 15). The prevalence of H. pylori in cases and controls according to gender, histological type and location of the colon lesions showed a significant difference only among women (P = 0. 03), among patients with tubular adenomas (P = 0. 03), and in those with distal adenomas (P = 0. 038). CONCLUSION: There is a positive {{association between}} H. pylori infection and colonic adenomas. This association is more evident in women, especially for tubular adenomas and distal colonic location...|$|E
