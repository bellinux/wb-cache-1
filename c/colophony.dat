40|$|BACKGROUND: Inhalation of fumes from heated <b>colophony</b> (pine resin) is a {{recognised}} {{cause of}} occupational asthma, although the {{mechanisms by which}} <b>colophony</b> produces symptoms are unclear and specific immune responses to <b>colophony</b> have not been reported in sensitised workers. A study was carried out to determine whether <b>colophony</b> is antigenic. METHODS: The immune responses to <b>colophony</b> were studied in C 57 BL/ 6 mice and Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs after intraperitoneal injection of <b>colophony</b> conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or human IgG by a mixed anhydride procedure. <b>Colophony</b> and dinitrofluorobenzene were also compared in an assay of dermal sensitisation. RESULTS: Mice immunised with the <b>colophony</b> conjugates produced antibodies which recognised conjugates of both BSA and human IgG irrespective {{of which had been}} used as the immunogen. Solutions of unconjugated <b>colophony</b> inhibited the binding of antibodies to the BSA-colophony and BSA-abietic acid conjugates, confirming that the antibodies recognised one or more components in the <b>colophony.</b> Portuguese <b>colophony</b> also abrogated the antigen binding of serum from guinea pigs immunised with the BSA-colophony conjugate. Spleen cells from immunised mice proliferated {{in the presence of the}} conjugates. Although there was some cross reactivity in these responses, it was not as marked as in the antibody assays. Unconjugated <b>colophony</b> failed to induce an immune response when injected intraperitoneally with adjuvant. Skin sensitisation could not be induced in mice by topical application, or by subcutaneous or intradermal injection of unconjugated <b>colophony.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Colophony</b> components have the potential to act as haptens and an immune component could be involved in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma in workers exposed to <b>colophony.</b> <b>Colophony</b> is not readily immunogenic unless conjugated ex vivo to proteins...|$|E
40|$|<b>Colophony</b> - {{also called}} rosin - is a {{material}} obtained from coniferous trees. It is used widely in many products, particularly {{because of its}} good tachifying properties. <b>Colophony</b> is also used in paper sizing to increase water resistance. <b>Colophony</b> may cause contact allergy, and around 5 % of Swedish dermatitis patients show allergic reactions to <b>colophony</b> at patch testing. There are many case reports of <b>colophony</b> in different products causing contact dermatitis. Often, however, the clinical relevance of a positive patch-test reaction to <b>colophony</b> is difficult to evaluate. The principal aims of the present thesis were to study the prevalence of contact allergy to <b>colophony</b> and of skin disease in individuals with an occupational exposure to colophony; to study the prognosis of dermatitis in colophony-sensitive subjects, and to investigate the outcome of repeated open applications of <b>colophony,</b> thereby trying to elucidate the clinical relevance of contact allergy to <b>colophony.</b> Employees of a tall-oil rosin (<b>colophony)</b> factory (n= 180), and of an opera company where <b>colophony</b> was used in dancers' rosin, mascara and wig glues (n= 132), were interviewed, examined and patch tested. 3. 9 % and 2 % of these two groups respectively had a positive patch test to <b>colophony.</b> More than every fourth participant showed some kind of skin disease, but only few cases were related to work. Eighty-three patients with previously diagnosed contact allergy to <b>colophony</b> were followed up. 72 % showed a positive patch-test reaction to <b>colophony</b> at re-testing. Around one third had hand eczema. There was no significant correlation between <b>colophony</b> exposure and current hand eczema. Adhesive bandages containing <b>colophony</b> and zinc oxide (ZnO), <b>colophony</b> and mixes of <b>colophony</b> and ZnO, were tested in 7 colophony-sensitive subjects to see whether addition of zinc oxide inhibited elicitation of allergic dermatitis to <b>colophony,</b> which has been proposed. No difference in reactivity between <b>colophony</b> and colophony/ZnO was seen at patch testing, and there were positive patch-test reactions to all colophony-eontaining bandages. Thus no inhibitory effect of ZnO was shown. Repeated open application tests were performed with cobalt chloride and <b>colophony</b> in sensitized guinea pigs. The animals were also patch-tested. A dose-response correlation was found with both cobalt chloride and <b>colophony.</b> There was a concordance between patch-test reactions and reactions at repeated open application tests, the higher the concentration of the allergen at the open test the stronger the concordance. In 13 colophony-sensitive subjects serial dilution patch tests with <b>colophony</b> were performed followed by repeated open application tests using <b>colophony</b> of different concentrations once daily for two weeks. Reactions were assessed visually, by laser Doppler flowmetry and by measurements of transepidermal water loss. Ten subjects reacted at open applications with <b>colophony</b> 20 %. The strength of the reaction varied greatly. A correlation between the threshold concentration at patch testing and {{the outcome of the}} repeated open application tests was found and also a dose-response relationship. Nine healthy controls did not reaet to repeated open applications with <b>colophony.</b> The measurements of transepidermal water loss and bloodflow was of no additional use to visual assessment when evaluating repeated open application test reactions with <b>colophony...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Colophony</b> is a well-recognized {{cause of}} {{allergic}} contact dermatitis (ACD) in athletes because of its use in many sports (bowling, baseball, gymnastics, etc.) to enhance grip and it represents a known cause of ACD to adhesive medical tapes. Inspite of this, ACD to <b>colophony</b> from protective adhesive finger taping used by volleyball players {{does not appear in}} literature. It may be argued that the actual occurrence of ACD to <b>colophony</b> contained in protective adhesive finger taping could be underestimated as many cases may be misdiagnosed and patch tests are not always performed. Furthermore newer forms of finger support made of more advanced materials have become available and may sometimes take the place of older types of adhesive tape, like the one we analysed. We describe the case of an 18 -year-old girl who developed an eczematous reaction on the back and palmar surface of the third and fourth fingers of the left hand that relapsed after each volleyball training or match. The girl resulted sensibilized to <b>colophony</b> contained in protective adhesive tape that she wore on her fingers every time she played volleyball...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-nine {{electronics}} {{workers were}} investigated by bronchial provocation testing to soldering fluxes containing <b>colophony</b> and were followed up {{one to four}} years later. At presentation and on follow-up each worker had nonspecific bronchial reactivity measured with inhaled histamine, and also had detailed measurements of lung function and estimation of total immunoglobulin levels. They completed a questionnaire designed to detect residual disability. The workers were divided into three groups. Twenty had left work after their initial diagnosis, eight had been moved to alternative work within their original factories, and 11 were thought to have asthma unrelated to <b>colophony</b> exposure as they failed to react to <b>colophony</b> at presentation. Histamine reactivity had returned to normal in half the workers who had left their original factories, but in only one worker who had moved within her original factory. This suggested that the nonspecific bronchial reactivity to histamine was the result rather than {{the cause of the}} occupational asthma, and that indirect exposure at work was sufficient to delay recovery of histamine reactivity. However, only two of the 20 affected workers who had left their original factories were symptom free on follow-up, and most had a considerable reduction in their quality of life by continuing asthma, which was particularly provoked by exercise, respiratory infections, and nonspecific irritants. Continuing symptoms may have been caused by domestic sources of <b>colophony,</b> or possibly the failure to eliminate <b>colophony</b> from the lungs...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of work-related wheeze and breathlessness {{was measured in}} factory employees manufacturing flux-cored solder. The flux contained <b>colophony</b> which was heated in the production process, exposing the workers to <b>colophony</b> fumes. Measurement of <b>colophony</b> in the breathing zone defined three grades of exposure with median levels of 1. 92 mg/m 3 (six subjects), 0. 02 mg/m 3 (14 subjects), and less than 0. 01 mg/m 3 (68 subjects). All but two workers {{in the first two}} groups, and 90 % of a random sample of the last group, were studied. Occupational asthma was present in 21 % of the higher two exposure groups and 4 % of the lowest exposure group. Mean values of FEV 1 and FVC fell with increasing exposure. The {{prevalence of}} upper and lower respiratory symptoms was only one-third to a half that found in a previous study of shop floor electronics workers, whose work raised the flux to a higher temperature and produced higher concentrations of <b>colophony</b> fume. Total IgM levels were higher in the solder manufacturers than in unexposed controls, and were higher still in the electronics workers. The solder manufacturers were exposed to <b>colophony</b> fumes at 140 degrees C, below the temperature at which the resin acids decompose, supporting the hypothesis that it is the whole resin acids rather than decomposition products which cause occupational asthma. The threshold limit value should be based on the resin acid content of the fume, and not the aldehyde content as at present.
