5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, <b>corner</b> <b>joint,</b> edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{the assessment of the}} performances of glued laminated wood <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> for outdoor window profiles applications, proposing a methodology to appreciate the strength of 90 ° tenon mortise <b>corner</b> <b>joints.</b> The rationale relies on the potential damage (i. e. breaking of the frame) that can be caused by poor glueing processes and/or typology of adhesives. There is a number of standards for assessment of wood-adhesive bonds for outdoor windows; however, {{there is a lack of}} specific standards related to glueing assessment for outdoor wood frames, which can take into account all the factors influencing the glueing quality. The proposed methodology was tested on red oak window profiles. A commercially available polyvinyl acetate-based adhesive was used for <b>corner</b> <b>joints.</b> Bending strength of 90 ° tenon mortise <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> was measured and compared with maximum admissible loads on the frame to limit its deformations within admissible ranges. The test results show that the 90 ° tenon mortise <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> strength exceeds the admissible load to preserve the functionality of the frame. In order to appreciate the influence of conditioning processes on adhesion, shear strength tests of the flatwise glued joint samples (bond lines of lamellae) were carried out after different conditioning processe...|$|R

40|$|The stress {{capacity}} of joints made of modified wood members under loading {{can be affected}} by design of joints and type of adhesive. Hence, these factors were addressed in this study by assessment of {{stress capacity}} variations in <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> under diagonal applied compressive load induced combined stresses. The joints with mitered and butted design were constructed by application of epoxy and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesives from furfurylated wood samples with two weight percentage gains (WPGs), i. e., 20 % as low level and 60 % as high level. Results indicated that stress capacity in both <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> was not significantly decreased with increasing polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) in wood. Despite the high compression strength in mitered joint, the induced compression stresses were low in comparison with butted joint. The stress capacity in mitered joint bonded with epoxy adhesive enhanced with increasing the level of furfurylation. This was true for shear stress parallel to grain as well. Generally, it could be concluded that mitered joint made of furfurylated members and bonded with epoxy adhesive would be stronger than other <b>corner</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using {{finite element}} method (FEM) has become wide spread {{in the field of}} wood {{mechanics}} for analyzing difficult problems instead of conventional methods. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the strength properties of wood <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> using FEM. For this purpose, diagonal compression and diagonal tension experiments were carried out using dowel, mortise and tenon elements. <b>Corner</b> <b>joints</b> (L-type) were prepared with Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) woods. Data obtained experimentally were used in FEM computer modeling to determine structural specifi cations of wood materials. The amount of deformation as a result of compression-tension in the <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> was determined and then simulated with a computer program using FEM (ANSYS Multiphysics/LS-DYNA). As a result, the amount of deformation obtained from experiments was consistent with the FEM computer modeling with 90 to 97 %. It is suggested that strength properties of joints can be forecast by using FEM computer modeling instead of physical experiments that may cause loss of time, increase of cost and destruction of materials...|$|R

40|$|Beam-to-column joints are {{commonly}} considered critic regions for RC frames subjected to earthquake actions. When designed for gravity loads only, beam-to-column <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> strongly affect the global structural behaviour of a frame, {{and they can}} be cause of its collapse, as shown by recent earthquakes in Europe. In the paper, a component-based f. e. model for external beam-to-column joints is presented to simulate the seismic behaviour of r. c. existing structures designed without any capacity design criteria (smooth bars with hooked-end anchorages and with no transverse reinforcements in the joint). The joint deformation is modelled by means of two separate contributions, the shear deformation of the panel zone, and the rotation at the interface sections between the joint and the structural members, due to the reinforcing bars' slip within the joint core. The work focuses on the evaluation of the joint strength and stiffness, and it points out the importance of modelling the bar bond slip within the panel zone to describe the actual frame response. The component-based f. e. model is validated by experimental results of tests on beam-to-column <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> realized according to the construction practice of the 1960 s- 1970 s in Italy, thus confirming the effectiveness of the presented model for the assessment of existing structures...|$|R

The Pinus Nigra, Fagus Orientalis L and Populus Nigra were used as solid wood materials. Wood-based biscuit joining elements were used in <b>corner</b> <b>joints</b> of the test construction and epoxy resin was used as glue for materials.

50|$|Generally {{the size}} of the mortise and tenon is related to the {{thickness}} of the timbers. It is considered good practice to proportion the tenon as one third the thickness of the rail, or as close to this as is practical. The haunch, the cut-away part of a sash <b>corner</b> <b>joint</b> that prevents the tenon coming loose, is one third the length of the tenon and one sixth of the width of the tenon in its depth. The remaining two-thirds of the rail, the tenon shoulders, help to counteract lateral forces that might tweak the tenon from the mortise, contributing to its strength. These also serve to hide imperfections in the opening of the mortise.|$|E
