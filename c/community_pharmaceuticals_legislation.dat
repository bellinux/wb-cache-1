40|$|Quality {{by design}} (QbD) {{is a concept}} first {{outlined}} by Juran, who believed that quality could be planned and that most quality crises and problems relate {{to the way in}} which quality was planned in the first place. Experimental design is a powerful technique and tool for QbD, used for exploring new processes, gaining increased knowledge of the existing processes and optimizing these processes for achieving internationally competitive performance. It is also used for the investigation of relationship between parameters of ill-defined process. In this paper, the experimental design principles in pharmaceutical development and impact of these principles on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> have been reviewed. Also, slow implementation of QbD in pharmaceutical industries has been discussed. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> is necessary for companies to continue benefiting from knowledge gained and to continually improve throughout the process lifecycle by making adaptations to assure that root causes of manufacturing problems are quickly corrected...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} abuses to engage the {{attention}} of the new body was the practice of pharmacy by unqualified persons, and in 1845 Bell drew up the draft of a bill to deal with the matter, one of the provisions of which was the recognition of the Pharmaceutical Society as the governing body in all questions connected with pharmacy. For some time after this the question of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> was widely discussed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act and its legacy in modern <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation.</b> The 1906 Act {{was one of}} the first attempts of the federal government to regulate an entire industry in the name of consumer protection. The debate surrounding the act helped to strengthen interest group politics at a critical era of government expansion. Finally, this paper shows how the FDA definition of effectiveness as effective beyond a placebo negatively impacts public health by denying consumers the benefit of a proven placebo treatment even when it is the only, or the safest, treatment available...|$|R
40|$|Edmond Dupuy, barrister, {{holding the}} « diplôme supérieur de pharmacien » (equivalent {{to the present}} degree of doctor of pharmacy), and a degree in law (licence), was {{appointed}} {{at his own request}} to give the first course of lectures on the history of pharmacy and legislation at the Ecole supérieure of Paris in 1884 - 85. Unfortunately, he devoted to theses subjects {{only a small part of}} the alloted time, the greater part of which he occupied with extraneous questions. Disappointed at having obtained only a « cours libre » when he had applied for a « cours complémentaire », he abandoned the idea of continuing his teaching beyond the 1885 - 86 session and, subsequently, took the chair of pharmacy at Toulouse (Faculté de médecine et de pharmacie). M. Coutant, a former barrister and clerk to the « Court of Cassation », was, in a like manner, in 1897, authorised to deliver a « cours libre » on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation,</b> which he continued for four consecutive years. The teaching of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> and deontology, established by the 1909 reform, was subsequently introduced as a « cours complémentaire » created by decree (26 sept. 1913) and put in the charge of a jurist, Marc Honnorat.

40|$|A {{descriptive}} {{cross-sectional study}} was done among <b>community</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> dispensers in Ilala district, Dar es Salaam from March to June 2010. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the knowledge and practice of pharmaceutical dispensers on oral health. 66 pharmacies were approached, out of which 62 responded and a study group of 26 pharmacists, 8 pharmaceutical technicians, 22 nursing assistants and 6 other dispensers which includes doctor, form six and form four leavers were interviewed using the questionnaires and the data was analysed. The following observations were made that the awareness on oral health was high (98. 4 %), the knowledge on oral health associated problems was found to be inadequate and provision of appropriate advice towards common oral problem halitosis poor (51. 6 %). Regarding their daily practice the first commonly dispensed over the counter oral health products were mouthwashes (50 %) while the most commonly encountered oral health condition was toothache (37. 1 %). All the participants in the study population supported the idea of continuing education on oral health (100 %). And more than a half of the study population suggested to have seminars on oral health after every six months (54. 8 %) as one of the ways of continuing education on oral health. It was recommended that education should be continued to <b>community</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> dispensers and emphasis on oral health in the curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate together with increased collaboration between dentists and pharmaceutical dispensers...|$|R
40|$|Innovation in the {{development}} of new drugs has to balance the needs of health actors and administrators, the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Differing perspectives on what constitutes an innovation, where research and development should be directed and how new drugs should be evaluated and priced cause ongoing tensions within the regulatory framework. In the current climate, where Europe’s health systems face rising demand for health services and increasingly restricted resources, the efficiency of pharmaceutical regulation and drug development is under even greater scrutiny. How can regulation foster innovation and industry growth while also serving the public health needs of society, and what is the EU’s role in pursuing this objective? Drawing on a provision which formerly existed in Norwegian <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation,</b> this article explores the potential of a medical need clause (MNC) in addressing these issues. In restricting market authorisations to those drugs that offer an added therapeutic value, might a MNC foster innovation and spending efficiency in Europe’s health systems...|$|R
40|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20 th century, {{homeopathy}} became the most widespread alternative to conventional medicine in Sweden, although it was practised almost exclusively by laymen. In July 1951, news spread that certain manufacturers of homeopathic remedies had skipped part of the potentization process and had sold pure sugar pills under the false claim that they were homeopathic remedies. Directors and other company employees were sentenced for fraud and tax evasion. According to Swedish medical authorities, homeopathy had finally been revealed as the quackery they had always declared it to be. Homeopathy’s social and cultural associations at this time – belief and religious faith as well as criminal activities – facilitated the pronouncement of the end of this kind of healing. Homeopathy vanished from both Swedish <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> and the discursive level in society. The homeopathic “pill scandal” can be seen as an important symbolic turning point in the process of modernisation of health care in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Both the US and EU have {{introduced}} pediatric <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> to facilitate clinical trials {{in children and}} development of better medicines for children. The first concerns were published in 2014 that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) ’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO) may be over-enthusiastic and has compelled questionable pediatric clinical trials from pharmaceutical companies. Numerous clinical trials are mandated in rare conditions for which not enough patients exist for even one trial. Furthermore, where these trials are mandated in adolescent patients, the legal age limit of the 18 th birthday is confused with a medical age limit and can result in separate clinical trials in adolescent patients that neither make medical nor scientific sense nor will ever recruit enough patients for a meaningful outcome. To confirm our concerns we searched the registry clinicaltrials. gov and found examples for PDCO-triggered unethical trials. We conclude that such trials should not be accepted by institutional review boards (IRBs) /ethics committees (ECs) and that clinical trials resulting from negotiations with EMA’s PDCO need extra careful scrutiny by IRBs/ECs {{in order to prevent}} unethical studies and damage to pediatric research and unnecessary risks to pediatric patients...|$|R

40|$|The European Pediatric <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Legislation</b> wants {{children}} to benefit more from pharmaceutical progress. In rare diseases, concerns {{have been raised}} that this legislation might damage research and stymie drug development. We discuss {{the role of the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Pediatric Committee (PDCO) in the development of ivacaftor, first-in-class for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the G 551 D mutation (and eight other mutations later) and of lumacaftor and ataluren, two more potential break-through CF medications. Ivacaftor was USA-approved early 2012 and six months later in the EU. Registration was based on the same data. We analyzed these drugs’ EU pediatric investigation plans (PIPs) and compared the PIP-studies with the pediatric CF studies listed in www. clinicaltrials. gov. The ivacaftor PIP studies appear to reflect what the developer planned anyway, apart from a study in 1 – 23 -month-olds, which has not yet started. The total negotiation time for the current PIP version was approximately 5. 5 years. For companies that develop drugs in pediatric diseases, e. g., CF, PIPs represent considerable additional procedural workload with minimal or no additional benefit for the patients. New drugs for pediatric diseases should not be hampered by additional, unnecessary and costly bureaucracy, but be registered as rapidly as possible without compromising safety...|$|R

40|$|The {{past two}} decades saw {{tremendous}} achievements in blood safety, which are due to the commitment of blood establishments and industry, progress in technology such as the improvement of serological and NAT screening tests, and stringent regulatory control. Milestones in the legislation were the inclusion of plasma derivatives in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislation</b> of the European Community (EC) in the year 1989 and special laws for the blood sector in EC and in member states, such as the Transfusionsgesetz (Transfusion Law) in Germany. The legal frame has to be supplemented by scientific and technical guidance, which is provided on the European level by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care and by the European Medicines Agency. In the member states, guidelines {{taking into account the}} national peculiarities can be elaborated, such as the German hemotherapy guidelines issued by the German Medical Association (Bundesärztekammer) in agreement with the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. The regulatory control of screening tests, and the introduction of NAT testing lead to a remarkably high degree of safety concerning the most relevant viruses HIV, HBV and HCV. Issues needing further attention are bacterial contamination and transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI). Measures aiming at minimizing risks have to be balanced against their impact on supply. In order to ensure the assured supply with safe blood products, sustained efforts and research are needed as well as a continuous dialogue among blood services, industry, physicians, patients and regulatory authorities...|$|R

40|$|As the Nigerian economy {{continues}} to grow, more multi-national pharmaceutical companies are being attracted to this market. However, new companies {{as well as those}} presently operating in Nigeria, are faced with a fundamental problem typical for companies doing business in developing countries. This problem is lack of information important in decision making. There is a general lack of information and understanding of Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>legislations.</b> Consequently, companies are forced to make many important decisions on the basis of lack of, or at best, incomplete information. In addition, little is presently known about industrial pharmaceutical practices in Nigeria. The methodology consisted of two parts. First, the study analyzed major sections of Nigeria 2 ̆ 7 s pharmaceutical laws and compared them to United States drug legislations. Major differences were identified and explained. The second part of the study consisted of gathering primary data from major United States and European pharmaceutical companies doing business in Nigeria. Responses obtained were compared to facts secure from the literature search. Although the research was exploratory in nature rather than conclusive, the following conditions appear to exist: 1. There is a general lack of understanding of the Nigerian Food and Drug laws. 2. The laws themselves appear to be confusing with numerous loopholes. 3. The Nigerian legal environment is less stringent than in the United States. 4. Specifically, drug introduction legislation was found to be much less stringent in Nigeria than in the United States. 5.
