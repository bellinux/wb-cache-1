Runoff is especially concerning in the region south of Cairns, as it may receive up to 4200mm of rain per year. About 90% of sea contamination originates from land farming activities.

As a result, 70–90% of the coastal wetlands has been lost over the past decades, and many remaining flora species are endangered.|$|E
25|$|Hudson {{believed}} that the passage to the Pacific Ocean was between the St. Lawrence River and Chesapeake Bay, so he sailed south to the Bay then turned northward, traveling close along the shore. He first discovered Delaware Bay and began to sail upriver looking for the passage. This effort was foiled by sandy shoals, and the Halve Maen continued north. After passing Sandy Hook, Hudson and his crew entered the narrows into the Upper New York Bay. (Unbeknownst to Hudson, the narrows had already been discovered in 1524 by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano; today, the bridge spanning them is named after Verrazzano.) Hudson {{believed that}} he had found the <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> route, so he sailed up the major river that later bore his name. He found the water too shallow to proceed several days later, at the site of present-day Troy, New York.|$|E
2500|$|Deuterium {{abundance}} can {{be useful}} in tracking migration of various animals. Animals with metabolically inert tissue (e.g. feathers or hair) will have synthesized that tissue using hydrogen from source water and food but ideally not incorporate subsequent water {{over the course of the}} migration. Because δD tends to vary geographically, the difference between animal tissue δD and post-migration water δD, after accounting for the biological fractionation of assimilation, can provide information regarding animal movement. In monarch butterflies, for example, wing chitin is metabolically inert after it has been built, so it can reflect the isotopic composition of the environmental water at the time and location of wing growth. This then creates a record of butterfly origin and can be used to determine migration distance. This approach can also be used in bats and birds, using hair and feathers, respectively. Since rainwater becomes depleted as elevation is increased, this method can also track altitudinal migration. However, this is technically difficult to do, and the resolution appears to be too poor to track small altitudinal changes. [...] Deuterium is most useful in tracking movement of species between areas with large <b>continental</b> <b>water</b> variation, because species movement can be complicated by the similarity of local water δD values between different geographic regions. For example, source water from Baja California may have the same δD as water from Maine. Further, a proportion of the hydrogen isotope composition within the tissue can exchange with water and complicate the interpretation of measurements. In order to determine this percentage of isotopic exchange, which varies according to local humidity levels, standards of metabolically inert tissue from the species of interest can be constructed and equilibrated to local conditions. This allows measured δD from different geographic regions to be compared against each other.|$|E

40|$|Emerging global role {{of small}} lakes and ponds: little things {{mean a lot}} Until recently, small <b>continental</b> <b>waters</b> have been {{completely}} ignored in virtually all global processes and cycles. This has resulted from the neglect of these systems and processes by ecologists and the assumption that ecosystems with a small areal extent cannot {{play a major role}} in global processes. Recent inventories based on modern geographical and mathematical approaches have shown that <b>continental</b> <b>waters</b> occupy nearly twice as much area as was previously believed. Further, these inventories have shown that small lakes and ponds dominate the areal extent of <b>continental</b> <b>waters,</b> correcting a century-long misconception that large lakes are most important. The global importance of any ecosystem type in a process or cycle is the product of the areal extent and the intensity of the process in those ecosystems. Several analyses have shown the disproportionately great intensity of many processes in small aquatic ecosystems, indicating that they play an unexpectedly major role in global cycles. Assessments of the global carbon cycle underscore the need for aquatic scientists to view their work on a global scale in order to respond to the Earth’s most pressing environmental problems...|$|R

50|$|Gour de Tazenat is a {{volcanic}} crater formed by a phreatomagmatic eruption. The {{banks of the}} lake have {{a volcanic}} crescent moon shape (north, east and south) formed by projections arranged in layers. In the stratum at the base, the basaltic volcanic projections, released as blocks, volcanic bombs and pozzolana are mixed with boulders (granite, granulite metamorphic rocks) from the base torn out by violent explosions. The bombs have a cauliflower shape, typical of phreatomagmatic eruptions due to fissures created by contact with water. The setting up of these initial projections corresponds {{to the beginning of}} the eruption when magma rises to the surface in contact with <b>continental</b> <b>water.</b> It causes heavy explosions capable of breaking fragments of crystalline basement, and the appearance of volcanic bombs in cauliflower shapes. Thereafter, water is removed and activity becomes more magmatic than phreatic. After cessation of eruptive activity, the Gour de Tazenat gradually filled with rainwater.|$|E

Species lineages often split in consequence to geological and climatic processes during the Tertiary, as exemplified on species complexes of Austropotamobius crayfish, species lineages of the amphipod Gammarus fossarum species complex, and the isopod Asellus aquaticus. The distribution of intraspecific lineages has been strongly affected by Quaternary cycles of glaciation, which not only destroyed many habitats by moving glaciers but also created new colonisation routes. Such routes were peri-glacial lakes, which had been used by Gammarus lacustris, or retreat of sea level, which enabled white-clawed crayfish to colonise England, and a freshwater crab to colonise Italy.

40|$|Abstract Spelaeogriphaceans and thermosbaena-ceans are two {{orders of}} eyeless, unpigmented perac-arid {{crustaceans}} represented by very few species from subterranean waters. Spelaeogriphaceans occur only in <b>continental</b> <b>waters,</b> either running or still, in limestone or sandstone caves, or in calcrete aquifers. The four species known are limnic except one occurring in slightly brackish water loosely associ-ated with an endorheic basin. The Thermosbaenacea are primarily marine, with only 18 species recorded in limnic conditions or in brackish inland waters whose salinity does not derive from dilution of seawater. They occur in limestone caves, the inter-stitial medium associated to alluvial deposits, or in thermo-mineral springs. Spelaeogriphaceans are {{found on the}} southern continents, in ancient cratons not affected by sea transgressions {{at least since the}} Early Cretaceous, when Gondwana started to break-up. The former integration of these terranes into Gondwana suggests that the penetration of spelaeo-griphaceans in <b>continental</b> <b>waters</b> took place previous to the fragmentation of this super continent (starting ca. 140 Ma), and that their current distribution pattern was driven by continental drift. The distribu-tion of the Thermosbaenacea matches precisely the area covered by the ancient Tethys Sea or its coastlines.
