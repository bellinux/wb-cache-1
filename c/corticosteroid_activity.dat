40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{important}} function of steroidogenic cyto-chromes P 450 is {{the transformation of}} cholesterol to produce androgens, estrogens, and the <b>corticosteroids.</b> The <b>activities</b> of cytochrome P 450 c 17 (CYP 17) are essential in sex hormone biosynthesis, with severe developmental defects being a consequence of deficiency or mutations. The first reaction catalyzed by this multifunctional P 450 is the 17 α-hydroxylation of pregnenolone (PREG) to 17 α-hydroxypregnenolone (17 -OH PREG) and progesterone (PROG) to 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OH PROG). The hydroxylated products then either are used for production of corticoids or undergo a second CYP 17 catalyzed transformation, representing the first committed step of androgen formation. While the hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by the well-known Compound I intermediate, the lyase reaction is believed to involve nucleophilic attack of the earlier peroxo- intermediate on the C 20 -carbonyl.

40|$|AbstractThere are {{significant}} differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of inhaled corticosteroids currently available for use in treatment of asthma and this can result in differences in pharmacodynamic activity. All currently used inhaled corticosteroids are rapidly cleared from the body, but show varying levels of oral bioavailability, with fluticasone propionate having the lowest. Following inhalation, there is also considerable variability in the rate of absorption from the lung, and pulmonary residence times are greatest for fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide, and shortest for budesonide and flunisolide. Cortisol suppression is frequently used as a surrogate market of systemic <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>activity.</b> Cortisol release displays a circadian rhythm, which can be mathematically modelled and the effects of exogenous corticosteroids on cortisol suppression established.

However, owing to a lack of clinical data, the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises against using intravenous hydrocortisone for treating adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability [1]. Moreover, a recent study by Contrael et al. [36] has indicated that significant variability was observed when corticosteroids were prescribed for septic shock; thus, the decision to prescribe low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock must have depended on the physicians’ clinical experience. In addition, low-dose corticosteroids are commonly administered globally in treating any type of septic shock without considering the underlying infection site or pathophysiology of the cause of sepsis [18].|$|E

Using the mouse model of Mycobacterium avium infection, we show in this study that the production of NO from IFN-gamma-activated macrophages plays a major role in mycobacterial infection-induced thymic atrophy. Our results show that disseminated infection with a highly virulent strain of M. avium, but not with a low-virulence strain, led to a progressive thymic atrophy. Thymic involution was prevented in genetically manipulated mice unable to produce IFN-gamma or the inducible NO synthase. In addition, mice with a selective impairment of IFN-gamma signaling in macrophages were similarly protected from infection-induced thymic atrophy. A slight increase in the concentration of corticosterone was found in mice infected with the highly virulent strain, and thymocytes presented an increased susceptibility to dexamethasone-induced death during disseminated infection. The administration of an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptors partially reverted the infection-induced thymic atrophy. We observed a reduction in all thymocyte populations analyzed, including the earliest thymic precursors, suggesting a defect during thymic colonization by T cell precursors and/or during the differentiation of these cells in the bone marrow in addition to local demise of thymic cells.

Data Sources: Clinical studies of the OCS-sparing effects of ICSs were located by searching MEDLINE databases from 1966 onward using the terms oral, steroid, and asthma in combination with the generic names for each marketed ICS. Study Selection: Studies reporting on the use of ICSs to reduce OCS requirements in patients with persistent and acute asthma are included. Results: Clinical study results consistently show that ICSs significantly improve asthma control and reduce OCS requirements among adults, children, and infants with persistent asthma. A dose reduction or complete discontinuation of use of OCSs is possible in most patients without loss of asthma control. ICSs also can control asthma during acute asthma exacerbations and reduce the need for short courses of OCSs. With many ICSs, the reductions in OCS use are accompanied by recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, indicating that the safety of asthma therapy is improved when OCS requirements are decreased with ICSs. Of the available ICSs that may reduce OCS needs, budesonide appears to be the most intensively studied. Conclusions: ICSs can reduce OCS requirements in adults and children with persistent asthma and during acute asthma exacerbations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of treatment duration, vehicle, {{and time of}} day of application on topical 0. 05 % betamethasone dipropionate uptake into human stratum corneum and the resulting skin- blanching response was investigated in human subjects. Drug uptake into stratum corneum and the resulting skin color changes measured with a chromameter demonstrate an equilibrium delay. Maximal drug uptake occurred at 2 h, whereas maximal skin color changes occurred 6 h after a single application. Extent of decreased skin color was dependent on vehicle, treatment duration, and time of day of application. Time of maximal decreased skin color occurred at midnight independent of vehicle, treatment duration, or time of day of application. This time of maximal drug activity coincides with the well-known time period of lowest circulating cortisol concentrations (2000 - 0400 h). Application of a single 2 - or 6 -h dose of the 0. 05 % cream at 1600 h produced more extensive and prolonged changes in skin color over 24 h than a 0900 -h application in the same subject. These data demonstrate that the extent and duration of topical <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>activity</b> in human skin is influenced by vehicle, treatment duration, and time of day of application. The prolonged changes in skin color measured with a single dose applied at 1600 h suggest that a once-a-day dosing regimen {{in the late afternoon}} may be sufficient for dermatologic therapy.

ObjectivesWe assessed the safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic activity of ascending doses of TPI 1020 compared to budesonide in asthma. MethodsSmokers with mild asthma (n= 27) were randomized to receive either 600 mcg of TPI 1020 (n= 13) or 400 mcg of budesonide (n= 14) bid for 2 weeks followed by 1200 and 800 mcg bid, respectively, for an additional week. ResultThere was no serious adverse event and all but one adverse event were mild or moderate (severe headache with budesonide). Patients receiving TPI 1020 reported three-fold fewer treatment-emergent AEs (n= 13) than those receiving budesonide (n= 39). TPI 1020 had similar effects as budesonide on FEV 1, PEF, rescue medication, asthma scoring system, methacholine response, sputum eosinophils and exhaled NO. Sputum neutrophils (%) tended to decrease more with TPI 1020 (32. 6 % decrease versus 3. 7 % increase for budesonide); the decrease occurring only in patients with high neutrophils at baseline. A significant difference favoring TPI 1020 was noted for CRP. Budesonide caused a statistically significant decrease in 24 h urinary free cortisol over 22 days (median of 4. 4 – 2. 8 mcg/ml, p= 0. 01) whereas TPI 1020 had no such effect (4. 4 – 5. 8 mcg/ml), suggesting lower systemic corticosteroid exposure following TPI 1020 treatment.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, much {{research}} has been done on lipid metabolism because of the possible involvement of lipids in atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. These diseases appear to be related to abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Since sex differences have been noted in lipid metabolism, the role of steroid hormones has been under investigation in a number of laboratories. Coronary heart disease occurs only rarely in women during the reproductive phase. In men, the administration of estrogens results in a decreased serum cholesterol level while androgens tend to increase circulating cholesterol. Experiments on rats and chickens have indicated that both corticosteroids and sex hormones are involved in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In chickens, estrogens decreased the circulating cholesterol and prevented the coronary atherosclerosis that can be induced by feeding cholesterol. The effect of estrogens and androgens on the metabolism of essential fatty acids in rats is under investigation by Ostwald et al. (1965). Female or estrogen-treated rats maintained more arachidonic acid in their plasma phospholipids and cholesteryl esters than did their male counterparts even during acute and prolonged deficiencies of dietary linoleic acid. Adrenal cortex contains a number of potent hormones all of which are steroid derivatives having characteristic cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene nucleus. The corticosteroids are produced by the adrenal gland in both male and female. One measure of <b>corticosteroids</b> <b>activity</b> is the determination of urinary 17, 21 -dihydroxy- 20 -ketosteroids. The androgens in female are produced by the adrenal cortex and in small amounts by the ovary; in the male by the testis {{and to a lesser extent}} in the adrenal cortex. Measurement of the urinary neutral 17 -ketosteroids is becoming more frequently used as an index of androgenic activity but it should be borne in mind that the androgenic ptency of a given urine extract will not necessarily parallel 17 -ketosteroid concentration. Until more is known about androgen and 17, 21 -dihydroxy- 20 -ketosteroids (DKS), male adrenals, as well as possible androgen secretion by the ovary, the significance of normal neutral 17 -ketosteroids and 17, 21 -dihydroxy- 20 -ketosteroids determinations in urine are of considerable importance when measured regularly for long periods of time. The measurement of the output of these steroids during several menstrual periods would provide a biochemical index of androgen and corticosteroids secretion in women. Few, detailed studies of changes in urinary excretion of androgen and corticosteroid end products during the menstrual cycle in normal young women have been reported in the literature. Yu (1964) found that neutral 17 -ketosteroids gradually increased from the 9 to 15 days. This increase was significant. However, she did not have values for the rest of menstrual period on her five subjects. Her results indicated that a more detailed study of changes occurring during the menstrual cycle was desirable. Then, if these changes were related to concentrations of the serum fatty acids during the menstrual cycle, basic information on relationships between steroid hormones and lipid metabolism might be obtained. The findings should be important because abnormal metabolism of lipids seems to be one factor involved in several of the degenerative diseases of old age such as atherosclerosis and cerebral hemorrhage. This study is a part of a larger problem to determine relationships that exist among serum cholesterol, serum fatty acids, and concentrations of estrogens and degradations products of the androgens and corticosteroids in urine in normal young women. The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in concentrations of neutral 17 -ketosteroid and 17, 21 -dihydoxy- 20 -ketosteroid hormones in women 2 ̆ 7 s urine during specified days of the menstrual period, which would help to define the effect of ovulation on the urinary excretion of these hormones...|$|R

A 6 -year-old boy developed acute regression of expressive language following epileptic seizures, leading to complete mutism, at which time EEG revealed CSWS. MEG showed bilateral superior parietal and opercular independent CSWS onsets and PET with fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated significant increase in relative glucose metabolism in bilateral superior parietal regions.

40|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} is a {{major cause}} of mortality worldwide, often with severe sepsis as the terminal event. Over the last two decades, several studies have reported that in septic patients the adrenal glands respond inappropriately to stimulation, and that the treatment with corticosteroids decreases mortality in such patients. Both cirrhosis and septic shock share many hemodynamic abnormalities such as hyperdynamic circulatory failure, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, hypo-responsiveness to vasopressors, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukine(IL) - 1, IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and it has, consequently, been reported that adrenal insufficiency (AI) is common in critically ill cirrhotic patients. AI may also be present in patients with stable cirrhosis without sepsis and in those undergoing liver transplantation. The term hepato-adrenal syndrome defines AI in patients with advanced liver disease with sepsis and/or other complications, and it suggests that it could be a feature of liver disease per se, with a different pathogenesis from that of septic shock. Relative AI is the term given to inadequate cortisol response to stress. More recently, another term is used, namely &#x 201 C;critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency&#x 201 D; to define &#x 201 C;an inadequate cellular <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>activity</b> for the severity of the patient&#x 2019;s illness&#x 201 D;.

The prevalence of AI in cirrhotic patients varies widely according to the stage of the liver disease (compensated or decompensated, with or without sepsis), the diagnostic criteria defining AI and the methodology used. The effects of corticosteroid therapy on cirrhotic patients with septic shock and AI are controversial. This review aims to summarize the existing published information regarding AI in patients with liver cirrhosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: Budesonide is a {{corticosteroid}} {{with minimal}} systemic <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>activity</b> due to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Budesonide MMX® is a once-daily oral formulation of budesonide that extends budesonide release throughout the colon using multi-matrix system (MMX) technology. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of budesonide MMX for induction of remission in 509 patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} groups that were given budesonide MMX (9 mg or 6 mg), mesalamine (2. 4 g, as reference), or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at week 8. RESULTS: The rates of remission at week 8 among subjects given 9 mg or 6 mg budesonide MMX or mesalamine were 17. 9 %, 13. 2 %, and 12. 1 %, respectively, compared with 7. 4 % for placebo (P =. 0143, P =. 1393, and P =. 2200). The rates of clinical improvement at week 8 among patients given 9 mg or 6 mg budesonide MMX or mesalamine were 33. 3 %, 30. 6 %, and 33. 9 %, respectively, compared with 24. 8 % for placebo (P =. 1420, P =. 3146, and P =. 1189). The rates of endoscopic improvement at week 8 among subjects given 9 mg or 6 mg budesonide MMX or mesalamine were 41. 5 %, 35. 5 %, and 33. 1 %, respectively, compared with 33. 1 % for placebo. The rates of symptom resolution at week 8 among subjects given 9 mg or 6 mg budesonide MMX or mesalamine were 28. 5 %, 28. 9 %, and 25. 0 %, respectively, compared with 16. 5 % for placebo (P =. 0258, P =. 0214, and P =. 1025). Adverse events occurred at similar frequencies among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide MMX (9 mg) was safe and more effective than placebo in inducing remission in patients with active, mild to moderate UC...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>activity</b> are {{as diverse as}} they are necessary. Steroid hormones and their receptors have co-evolved to influence a multitude of physiological and behavioral parameters via discrete modifications in steroid signaling pathways. Here, I investigated the presence and relative abundance of receptors and steroidogenic enzymes in the corticosteroid (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) and androgen signaling pathways during the breeding season in a teleost fish, the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus), that has two male reproductive morphs with divergent reproductive tactics. Territorial (type I) males acoustically court females, whereas sneaker (type II) males do not court females but rather steal fertilizations from type I males. I first cloned and sequenced the midshipman genes for glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors and the enzymes 11 -beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (beta-HSD) and beta-hydroxylase (beta-H) {{that are involved in}} corticosteroid and androgen synthesis. A prior study cloned and sequenced the midshipman androgen receptor (AR). Absolute quantitative PCR then determined the mRNA expression profiles for GR, MR, AR, beta-HSD and beta-H in each midshipman male morph. In general, type II males showed the highest mRNA expression levels for all genes throughout the central nervous system. Type I males, however, had higher mRNA levels for all genes in the vocal muscle, and for beta-HSD and beta-H in the testis. Together, the expression patterns showed that mRNA abundance for the enzymes and receptors mediating androgen and glucocorticoid signaling pathways are distinct in type I and II male midshipman fish, reflecting their equally distinct vocal, spawning and endocrine phenotypes. A separate study addressed the specificity of the ligand binding domain of corticosteroid receptors from teleost fish (including midshipman) and mammals. The results indicated that a duplicated GR in teleosts exhibited high sequence identity to the mammalian GR, but responded like the mouse MR to steroid ligands. A phylogenetic analysis then showed that the duplicated fish GR secondarily evolved after a more ancestral duplication event that led to the initial divergence of two corticosteroid receptors in vertebrates that were activated by either glucocorticoids alone (GR) or both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (MR) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids rely on promotion of a natural peptide phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, lipocortin, but in vivo effects on arachidonic acid metabolism have not been shown. Equilibrium dialysis of the rectum in patients with ulcerative colitis {{was used to determine}} whether cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products released from the inflamed rectal mucosa could be differentially inhibited by systemic treatment with prednisolone and indomethacin, respectively. In 10 patients with severe disease luminal concentrations of prostaglandin E 2, prostaglandin F 2 alpha, and leucotriene B 4 were markedly raised (p less than 0. 05) on comparison with 10 healthy controls, and they decreased significantly (p less than 0. 05) within 72 hours after administration of prednisolone 1. 5 mg/kg/day orally. In contrast prostaglandin, but not leucotriene B 4 concentrations decreased (p less than 0. 05) within 72 hours after administration of indomethacin 150 mg/day in another 10 patients with distal disease. These prompt reductions in concentrations of arachidonic acid metabolites more likely are caused by direct drug actions, rather than being secondary to decreased tissue damage. The data accord with the theory explaining anti-inflammatory effects of <b>corticosteroids</b> through lipocortin <b>activity</b> and support the belief that leucotrienes are more important than prostaglandins as mediators of inflammation in ulcerative colitis...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a freqüência e localização de manifestações cardiovasculares em LES através da ecocadiografia com Doppler, bem como associações com anticorpos anticardiolipina, uso crônico de corticosteróide, atividade e tempo de evolução da doença. Foi realizado um estudo prospectivo em 72 pacientes com LES, de ambos os sexos (45 com LES ativo e 27 com LES inativo), no período de abril de 2000 a dezembro de 2001, e comparados com 45 controles normais. Anormalidades do pericárdio foram encontradas somente no LES ativo, em 35 pacientes, destacando-se pericardite sem derrame em 28, 9 %; espessamento do pericárdio em, 8, 9 %; pericardite com derrame em 22, 2 %. Comprometimento endocárdio-valvular destacando-se no LES ativo, com insuficiência mitral em 22, 2 % e espessamento mitral em 37, 7 %. No LES inativo, espessamento mitral ocorreu em 14, 9 %. Quanto ao envolvimento do miocárdio, destacando-se hipertrofia do ventrículo esquerdo em 20 % com LES ativo e 14, 9 % com LES inativo. Disfunção diastólica de ventrículo esquerdo em 17, 7 % com LES ativo. Pressão na artéria pulmonar elevada foi encontrada somente em LES ativo em 2 (4, 4 %) pacientes. Hipertensão {{arterial}} sistêmica, associada às alterações miocárdicas, esteve presente em 12, 5 %, especialmente com hipertrofia do ventrículo esquerdo. Quando relacionada a freqüência de anticorpos anticardiolipina, não se observou com o envolvimento do pericárdio; acometimento do miocárdio associado com LES ativo foi encontrado em 7 (15, 5 %) e em 2 (7, 4 %) com a doença inativa; associação com envolvimento endocárdio-valvular ocorreu em 3 (6, 7 %) com LES ativo e em 1 (3, 7 %) com LES inativo. As dimensões da raiz da aorta, átrio esquerdo, ventrículo esquerdo na diástole, volume sistólico e espessura do septo interventricular e parede posterior, fração de encurtamento, ventrículo direito, e espessuras parietais foram avaliadas nos dois grupos de pacientes com LES, e quando relacionados, não houve diferenças estatísticas significantes. A ecocardiografia com Doppler pode ser utilizada de forma rotineira na investigação cardiovascular em LES e em acompanhamento, sendo mais importante durante a atividade da doençaThis study {{evaluates the}} frequency and localization of cardiovascular manifestations em SLE through echocardiographic study with Doppler, {{as well as the}} associated frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies, chronic use of <b>corticosteroids,</b> <b>activity</b> and duration of the evolution of illness. A prospective study conducted between April, 2000 and December, 2001, included 72 patients of both sexes, with SLE, (45 with active SLE and 27 with inactive SLE) which were compared with a control group of 45 subjects without SLE. Pericardial abnormalities were found only in 35 patients with active SLE, and 28. 9 % presented pericarditis without effusion; 8. 9 % with pericardial thickening and 22. 2 % presenting pericarditis with effusion. Endocardial ? valvular involvement was revealed in 22. 2 % of the patients with active SLE most of them presenting mitral insufficiency while 37. 7 % had mitral thickening. In patients with inactive SLE, 14. 9 % presented mitral thickening. Regarding the involvement of the myocardial, left ventricle hypertrophy was encountered in 20 % of the patients with active SLE and in 14. 9 % of the patients with inactive SLE. Diastolic disfunction of the left ventricle occurred in 17. 7 % of the patients with active SLE. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was found in only 2 (4. 4 %) patients with active SLE. Systemic arterial hypertension, associated with the myocardial alterations were present in 12. 5 %, especially in those with left ventricle hypertrophy. Regarding the frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies, no association with involvement of the pericardium was observed; involvement of the myocardia associated with active SLE was found in 7 (15. 5 %) and in 2 (7. 4 %) with the inactive illness; association with endocardial ? valvular involvement was found in 3 (6. 7 %) patients with active SLE and in 1 (3. 7 %) with inactive SLE. The dimensions of the aortic root, left atrium, left ventricle during diastole, systolic volume, and thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall, fractional shortening, right ventricle and parietal thicknesses were evaluated in the two groups of patients with SLE, and, when compared, presented no significant statistical differences.

40|$|Of 250 {{consecutively}} admitted {{patients with}} {{central nervous system}} (CNS) infections who were treated during a 1 -year period, all 133 patients with tickborne encephalitis (TBE) were included in a prospective follow-up study. TBE presented as mild (meningeal) in 43. 6 % of patients and as moderate or severe (encephalitic) in 43. 6 % and 12. 8 % of patients, respectively. Paralytic disease was observed in 3. 8 % of the subjects, and cranial nerve injury was observed in 5. 3 %. One patient died of TBE. Permanent CNS dysfunction after 1 year was found in 30. 8 % of patients; in 8. 5 % of all TBE cases, severe disabilities required adjustment of daily <b>activities.</b> <b>Corticosteroid</b> treatment {{did not seem to}} improve outcome. A progressive course of TBE was noted in 2 patients. The risk of incomplete recovery was significantly higher among patients with the encephalitic form of TBE (odds ratio, 4. 066; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 848 – 8. 947). In conclusion, TBE is an important pathogen in CNS infection in the Kaunas region of Lithuania, and it causes long-lasting morbidity in one-third of cases.
