40|$|Abstract — Wafer-level testing (wafer sort) {{is used in}} the {{semiconductor}} industry to reduce packaging and test cost. However, a large number of wafer probe contacts leads to higher yield loss. Therefore, it is desirable that the number of <b>chip</b> pins <b>contacted</b> by tester channels during wafer sort be kept small to reduce the yield loss resulting from improper contacts. Since test time and the number of <b>contacted</b> <b>chip</b> pins are major practical constraints for wafer sort, not all scan-based digital tests {{can be applied to the}} die-under-test. We propose an optimization framework that addresses test access mechanism (TAM) optimization and test-length selection for wafer-level testing of core-based digital SoCs. The objective here is to design a TAM architecture and determine test-lengths for the embedded cores such that the overall SoC defect screening probability at wafer sort is maximized. Defect probabilities for the embedded cores, obtained using statistical yield modeling, are incorporated in the optimization framework.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal features of both a Visa credit card and the Oyster product, Barclaycard OnePulse included the ability to pay for low value items under £20 using the Visa contactless system by waving the card over a reader in participating outlets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} experimental investigations on {{influence of}} different media such as Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL), compressed air and emulsion on tool-chip contact length. The results are compared with dry cutting {{in terms of}} tool-chip <b>contact</b> and <b>chip</b> morphology. The tool-chip contact area was examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and white light interferometer. The orthogonal turning test series were planned {{in such a way}} that, the engagement time was altered from long to very short (intermittent turning). The results showed that MQL and compressed air lowers the contact length compared to dry cutting at short and longer engagement times. The contact length is almost the same for MQL and compressed air assisted cutting, but the difference is in sliding region with the shorter engagement times. Emulsion assisted cutting gave the shortest <b>contact</b> length. The <b>chips</b> were also examined with optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Wider chips were observed with dry cutting which is a result of side flow. Different oil amount was also investigated with TiN coated inserts. The effect of oil and air component of MQL on the contact length is understood that helps to clarify their role in the whole process. It is concluded that MQL is a very suitable method for short engagement time machining...|$|R

Conference theme - Innovative Systems Thinking: Unravelling Complexity for Successful Solutions. Titanium is used in aircrafts structures and engines. The materials’ low thermal conductivity and chip segmentation during machining cause a fluctuating heat load on the cutting edge. The extreme reactivity of titanium at elevated temperatures and its adhesive phenomena gives it the characteristic of being difficult-to- machine. The reduction of the <b>chip</b> <b>contact</b> length on the cutting tool edge will help to reduce the friction and thereby slow down tool wear. Various lubrication and cooling strategies were explored and evaluated {{in order to develop}} a new cooling technique that will be able to reduce the <b>chip</b> <b>contact</b> length. This will help to improve tool life and the surface integrity of the machined components. The tool wear was measured with an optical microscope in order to realize the performance of the different strategies. It was found that the high pressure cooling strategy showed to perform superior to the other strategies. Improved chip removal and reduced <b>chip</b> <b>contact</b> length with the cutting edge were found. Thereby, a new focused high pressure cooling cutting tool could be designed. The steps to design a cutting tool are shown and commented on. It is concluded that the high pressure cooling techniques show promising results and that future work is necessary to explore these benefits.
