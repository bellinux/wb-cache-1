Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} {{would be}} too strong a competition for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release him from the <b>co-development</b> agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering.

40|$|EU pig welfare {{legislation}} required European pig {{farmers to}} shift from individual to group housing of pregnant sows by 1 January 2013. This requirement was principally {{designed to meet the}} sows’ needs for locomotion and interaction with conspecifics. This paper explored how the legislation affected everyday sow-farmer interaction, which influences farm animal welfare to an important degree. We started by analysing conceptualisations of sow welfare and sow-farmer relations as implicated in the EU Directive and the scientific advice that informed it. Contending that these conceptualisations largely overlooked <b>co-developments</b> in sow housing systems and sow-farmer relations, we subsequently introduced an alternative analytical framework that builds on sociological, practice-oriented theories. We then applied this framework to analyse 19 qualitative interviews with pig farmers from Belgium on the on-farm introduction of group sow housing, and observations in these farmers’ group housing systems. We found that farmers’ practical, experience-based understandings of good animal-stockperson relations informed farmers’ choices for particular group housing systems to an important degree. Furthermore, we discerned that the effect of these choices on everyday sow-farmer relations differed, in the longer run, in at least three analytically distinct (negative, neutral to moderately positive, and positive) ways – according to if and to what degree the novel infrastructure allowed and motivated sows to portray, and farmers to perceive and act upon subjective and individual sow behaviour and needs. When failing to anticipate on this dynamic integration of legislation in on-farm contexts, opportunities are being missed to work towards preventing negative and promoting positive animal-farmer relations and concomitant animal welfare impacts when designing animal welfare policy. Most fundamentally, then, our study underlines a need to rethink the current focus in animal welfare science and policy on infrastructural criteria without attending to emergent <b>co-developments</b> in barn infrastructures, animal-farmer relations, and the well-being of animals and farmers...|$|R
40|$|Open innovation" and {{collaborative}} innovation are central topics {{in the recent}} discourse in business strategy and innovation [1, 2, 3, 4]. This paper examines the openness and "interconnectedness" of the innovation value chain of {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SME), and investigates how openness and innovation management practices interplay to explain the value creation at three levels of the innovation value chain: the idea funnel, launch and overall firm growth. To do so, we examine the direct effects of 4 aspects of openness addressing the scope of external idea sourcing, the interconnectedness of the overall value chain via <b>co-developments,</b> the size of the innovation network and the utilization of business partners for innovation. Beyond, we model explicit innovation management routines and implicit capabilities as mediating factors and investigate how they interplay with openness. The empirical research is based on a sample of 1440 firms from both manufacturing and service industries. We identified significant effects of openness and interconnectedness on the innovation value chain output. Results support the mediating role of "explicit" innovation management routines for "utilizing" external sources; especially during launch...|$|R

25|$|As with Rogue Squadron and Battle for Naboo, Rogue Leader {{was again}} co-developed by Factor5 and LucasArts, however {{the bulk of}} the game's {{development}} was done by Factor5. Unlike past <b>co-development</b> efforts, {{the bulk of the}} level design, which was traditionally handled by LucasArts, was created by Factor5 in addition to the game's engineering and programming. Factor5's in-house development team consisted of 25members plus two freelance employees. One level designer as well as the game's lead artist were employed by LucasArts. Development of the game's art started that same year. In anticipation of the project, modelers immediately began building high-polygon models of the playable craft using Maya and in-house tools, and usable art was pulled from the archives. In late December, 2000, mission designers met with director Julian Eggebrecht and producer Brett Tosti to start planning the game engine. The team eventually completed Battle for Naboo, and full-time development of Rogue Leader began in February 2001.|$|E

This paper presents an industrial practice which consists in codesigning a broad scope of technology-based applications in an exploratory partnership [Segrestin, 2005]. First, we propose a brief overview of inter-firm R&D cooperations and focus on an emerging flexible organization in the field of innovation : exploratory partnerships. From a more detailed description and a presentation of MINATEC IDEAs Laboratory®, we emphasize on the strategic role of technology in partnerships which gather a large number of partners. Finally, we propose a useroriented technological design method called “D 4 method” [Piat, 2005] through its recently implementation on a microfluidic technology. This method has been already tested in confidential EDF projects but its experimentation in a multipartners context has revealed some interesting aspects. We present D 4 method's features with respect to other creativy tools and we finally argue that this method fits very well in technology-centred exploratory partnerships. Indeed, "D 4 method" permits to identify and to manage carefully the shift from community based co-operation to complementary based co-operation. user-oriented technological design; D 4 method, exploratory partnerships; innovation; CK theory...|$|R

Leading enterprises in GVCs were forced to focus on their core competences while outsourcing other activities to enterprises that specialise in physical distribution and materials management, in transport and in logistics. Complex system of GVC and networks are dependent on efficient logistics. The benefits arising from GVCs' spreading could not be realised without <b>co-developments</b> in modern logistics services, underpinned by innovations in containerisation, intermodal transport {{and the application of}} Information Technology (IT) in physical distribution and materials management. As a result new innovative logistics providers and concepts have emerged, but the development and provision of advanced logistics services vary from country to country. Countries seeking to benefit from globalisation and from GVCs need to address key underlying factors of their logistics capabilities and how they impact on their industrial performances, productivity and competitiveness. This paper focuses on logistics capabilities and on how they can be monitored. The paper presents major changes in logistics industry since 1990 s and discusses recent work to monitor logistics performances of countries with a composite index. The paper proposes constructing a new index to monitor logistics capabilities and concludes with policy recommendations for developing countries. logistics industry; GVCs; networks; logistics performance index; LPI; logistics capability index; LOCAI; capability drivers; logistics capabilities; industrial policy; global value chains; core competences; outsourcing; advanced logistics services; developing countries; performance monitoring. ...|$|R
40|$|Council Directive 2001 / 88 /EC on the {{protection}} of pigs required European pig farmers to shift from individual to group housing of gestating sows by 1 January 2013. This legislation was principally designed to enhance the welfare of sows by meeting their needs for locomotion and social contacts with conspecifics. Yet, a shift to group sow housing also affects animal-stockperson relations, which influence animal welfare to an important degree. This raises the questions of how, and with which implications for sow welfare, sow-stockperson relations were transformed in on-farm implementations of group housing systems? And how is and can animal welfare policy be informed by understandings of these on-farm animal-stockperson dynamics? To answer these questions, in this paper I first analyse conceptualisations of interconnections between sow welfare, barn infrastructures and animal-stockperson relations, as implicated in the EU Directive and the scientific advice that informed it. Contending that these conceptualisations overlook <b>co-developments</b> in barn infrastructures and animal-stockperson relations, I subsequently address this conceptual lacuna by introducing an analytical framework that builds on sociological, practice-oriented theories. I then apply this framework to analyse qualitative interviews with 19 pig farmers from Flanders, Belgium on the on-farm introduction of group housing systems. In this analysis, I discern {{different ways in which}} farmers’ understandings and experiences of appropriate sow farming practices informed their choices for particular group housing infrastructures, and how these infrastructures in turn co-determined the nature and quality of animal-stockperson interactions. Finally, I conclude with a reflection on implications of these findings for animal welfare policy...|$|R
