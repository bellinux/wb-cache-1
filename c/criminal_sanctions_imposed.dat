The governmental structures of the modern Chinese state have replaced the hereditary rulers, kings and monastic leaders, who formerly exercised leadership over the nomads ’ tribes. However, ideologies of revenge and practices of feuding still characterise relations between tribal groups. Moreover, the nomads continue to turn to senior Buddhist lamas as mediators, despite the <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>imposed</b> by the police.

Both activities have raised the specter of prosecution under antitrust laws that have been with us {{for more than a}} century but are poorly understood by practicing physicians. Recent monopolistic activities in the health care arena have prompted the Federal Trade Commission to file actions under specific acts of Congress, eg, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Celler-Kefauver Act. Inasmuch as it is likely that specialties such as vascular surgery as a business will undergo substantial transformation, physicians need to be aware of the severe civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>imposed</b> if they are found guilty; fines that are several times actual damages; activities that raise antitrust issues including utilization review, medical staff privileges for competing specialties, participating provider agreements, and predatory pricing; and affirmative defenses and relief available in terms of specific exemptions. As health care providers react, innovate, and adjust to stay solvent, their business strategies will surely continue to be scrutinized for antitrust behavior by federal and state officials. The physician must have a basic understanding of the groundrules that govern any contemplated business strategy so that common pitfalls may be averted...|$|E

Even though it is possible to impose this punishment for several years, it is not so commonly used.

40|$|Many {{developed}} {{markets have}} taken {{what appears to}} be a tough stance on illegal insider trading through the use of <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Although <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions</b> represent a much greater penalty than civil sanctions, the higher burden of proof required makes their enforceability weaker.

Significant changes in sanction regimes are rare, especially when <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions</b> are introduced without other changes. In February 2008, New Zealand introduced <b>criminal</b> <b>sanctions</b> for insider trading. This change of law offers a unique setting in which to examine the deterrence effect of criminalization.

40|$|Sentencing of {{offenders}} {{is often}} described as a difficult task, requiring as it does the balancing of many different factors; often disparate and sometimes inherently contradictory. Sentencing is defined as “the process by which people who have been found guilty of offending against the <b>criminal</b> law have <b>sanctions</b> <b>imposed</b> upon them in accordance with the law” It is this task which is examined in this book. The major change in sentencing in Australia over the past 20 years has been the enactment of provisions to govern the sentencing process, and in most Australian jurisdictions, the enactment of dedicated sentencing legislation. This legislation has set out, to various extents, sentencing guidelines and principles. As will be seen however, a wide judicial discretion is available for almost every factor {{to be taken into account}} in the sentencing process, and in the choice of sanctions. In Australia, decisions of which penalty to impose, and the quantum of that penalty, are virtually always a matter for the individual sentencer in their exercise of judicial discretion. This differs from the situation in other countries, in particular many jurisdictions in the United States. This book takes a principled approach to sentencing, by exploring key themes and issues which will resonate across and between jurisdictions, and by analysing examples from the various jurisdictions where appropriate. Each Australian jurisdiction now has sentencing principles enshrined in legislation, mainly discrete, but some incorporated within general criminal legislation.
