40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a simulation‐based {{evaluation}} method for the comparison of different organizational forms and software support levels in the field of supply chain management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach – Apart from widely known logistic performance indicators, the discrete event simulation model considers explicitly <b>coordination</b> <b>cost</b> as stemming from iterative administration procedures. Findings - The method is applied to an exemplary supply chain configuration considering various parameter settings. Curiously, additional <b>coordination</b> <b>cost</b> does not always result in improved logistic performance. Influence factor variations lead to different organizational recommendations. The results confirm the high importance of (up to now) disregarded dimensions when evaluating SCM concepts and IT tools. Research limitations/implications – The model is based on simplified product and network structures. Future research shall include more complex, real world configurations. Practical implications – The developed method is designed for the identification of improvement potential when SCM software is employed. Coordination schemes based only on ERP systems are valid alternatives in industrial practice because significant investment IT can be avoided. Therefore, the evaluation of these coordination procedures, in particular the cost due to iterations, is of high managerial interest and the method provides a comprehensive tool for strategic IT decision making. Originality/value – Reviewed literature is mostly focused on the benefits of SCM software implementations. However, ERP system based supply chain coordination is still widespread industrial practice but associated <b>coordination</b> <b>cost</b> has not been addressed by researchers...|$|R

Both of them are inefficient due to the incidental high <b>coordination</b> <b>cost.</b> In this paper, we bring CSMA into UHF RFID systems to enhance tag read rate by reducing <b>coordination</b> <b>cost.</b> However, it is not straightforward due to the simple hardware design of passive RFID tags, which is unable to sense the transmissions or collisions of other tags. To tackle this challenge, we propose receiver-based CSMA (RCSMA) in this paper. In RCSMA, the reader notifies the tags channel condition. According to different sensing results of reader's notifications, the tags take corresponding actions, e. g., random back off. RCSMA does not require special RFID tag hardware design. An absorbing Markov chain model is presented to analyze the performance of RCSMA and shown {{to be consistent with}} the simulation results.

5000|$|There {{are the two}} {{different}} views of how programs differ from projects. On one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or [...] "chunks" [...] of change; programs create outcomes. On this view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other deliverables and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology. The other view is that a program {{is nothing more than}} either a large project or a set (or portfolio) of projects. On this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, is concerned with the aggregate outcome(s) or end-state result(s) of the collection of projects in a particular program.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} {{research and development}} (R&D) and formation of research joint ventures (RJV). The first chapter analyzes R&D competition and cooperation regimes with <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> under full information sharing and no spillovers in a Stackelberg model. The findings show that profits and R&D incentives of RJV members decrease with <b>coordination</b> <b>costs.</b> R&D cooperation of leaders results in higher profits for insiders and also higher welfare compared with R&D competition. Checking the robustness of the results shows that with R&D spillovers and no information sharing no RJV forms. With convex costs, an RJV containing all leaders forms. The second chapter considers a duopoly Cournot model where production may result in environmental damage. Firms can either invest in process or environmental R&D. In the first case, we assume an exogenous emission tax. With high enough emission tax, welfare is always higher under public R&D than cooperation. Under endogenous emission tax, when the regulator acts before firms’ decision on R&D, with high R&D spillovers, public R&D yields higher welfare than R&D cooperation. When the regulator sets the emission tax after firms’ decision on R&D, welfare under R&D cooperation is higher than public R&D. Comparison of commitment and no commitment also shows that commitment increases private R&D. Chapter three investigates the endogenous formation of coalitions under the size announcement game in a Cournot framework and analyzes the effect of <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> on equilibrium and optimal coalitions. When there are industry-wide R&D spillovers numerical simulations show that with high enough <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> no RJV forms in equilibrium, which also maximizes welfare.

We compare two R&D regimes, that is, R&D competition and R&D cooperation where firms can enter in a Research Joint Venture (RJV). We introduce <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> for the RJV and examine how these affect the equilibrium outcomes. Further, we examine {{the question of the}} equilibrium versus the optimal size of the RJV. For a given size of the RJV, its members decrease their own R&D as the anticipated <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> increase. This results in lower output and profits. On the contrary, the non-RJV firms increase their R&D investment in response to the fall in the RJV firms' R&D. We show that the performance of the RJV in terms of R&D investment, profit and welfare in relation to R&D competition is sensitive to the level of <b>coordination</b> <b>costs.</b> Furthermore, we show that, although the RJV as a whole may no longer conduct a unit of R&D at a lower cost compared to the independent firm under the non-cooperative R&D regime, its members can still make savings on their own R&D expense through information sharing. Finally, we find that not only the equilibrium size becomes smaller as <b>coordination</b> <b>costs</b> increase, but the discrepancy between the equilibrium and optimal sizes is widening.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new systematic method for exploring and evaluating alternatives {{of a product}} design process for differentiated products - those that share some elements but also have differentiating features. Based on coordination theory, the method clarifies the opportunities and risks of process alternatives. The method consists of three steps: 1) finding applicable differentiation approaches, 2) finding applicable patterns of process coordination, and 3) evaluating total costs of the process alternatives. We categorized the differentiation approaches as a taxonomy of design processes; the taxonomy includes approaches of adding or removing differentiating elements or sorting results. We also categorize how these are limited by type of interim resource in a design process. We outline three patterns of process coordination and how this interacts with the choice of product differentiation approaches. We show how the process alternatives vary in the success rate of the coordination and how this probability affects total cost of executing a design process.
