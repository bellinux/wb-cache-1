50|$|Sliders are {{available}} in three types: one with tick marks and a triangular scrubber, one with a round scrubber and no tick marks and a <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> which can be rotated. All {{are available}} horizontally or vertically. The <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> is simply a gray dot on a white circle which can be rotated to set values.|$|E
50|$|Hoppers are sliders {{that must}} pass through an {{obstacle}} {{in their path}} in order to move. The best known {{example of this is}} the cannon of Chinese chess, which moves as a rook but can only capture after jumping one occupied square. This is indicated by the modifier p. The modifier g also indicates the move must hop, but such that it immediately lands behind the obstacle. Rarely used modifiers are q, for <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> motion (the direction of subsequent steps rotates in the same direction), z for zig-zag sliders (where the direction of steps alternates), and o for cylinder moves (which wrap around the left and right board edges).|$|E
50|$|Betza 2.0 treats range specifiers as exponentiation in {{the same}} way as Bex, e.g. (cQ-mQ)4 for the Ultima long leaper that can make upto 4 captures along a {{straight}} line if it can find empty squares between the pieces it jumps over (and then captures). A quirky feature is that it allows modifiers on the range itself, to overrule the defaults of the chaining operator that is spread around by this exponentiation. E.g. Nrf7 would mean N-rfN-rfN-..., a repeated knight step that deflects right-forward, i.e. a move of the <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> qN. A geometric e modifier can force a continuation slider leg to be of equal length as a previous slider leg, which makes it possible to specify rifle captures by sliders as forth-and-back moving (e.g. cR-ebR). Betza 2.0 also has an explosion modifier x that would make shrapnell ejected in all directions continue the specified move to cause side effects on a specified surroundings (leaving the moving piece behind).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} a mobile sketching interface for exploring multi-dimensional datasets on wall displays. We demonstrate {{the idea of}} SketchSliders, range sliders that users can freely sketch on a mobile surface to customize their exploration. A small combination of sketches and gestures allows the creation of complex interactive <b>sliders,</b> such as <b>circular</b> <b>sliders</b> for periodic data, slider branches for detailed interaction, and fisheye transformation sliders. We augment sliders with a suite of tools, such as markers, slider cursors, and approximate views of data distributions. Our designs are inspired by a design study with three visualization experts and validated through a user study with six experts using our system. Our findings indicate that our sketching interface accommodates {{a wide range of}} exploration strategies, helping users customize as well as focus their visual explorations...|$|R
40|$|DE 19938058 A UPAB: 20010418 NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} includes {{at least}} two serially arranged moving devices with guides on which sliders can move. The holder is arranged {{on one of the}} serial moving devices. At least one of the serially arranged moving devices is formed as a circular moving device with a planar circular guide (2, 6) and a <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> (1, 5). The <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> is rotatably mounted on the guide. The holding device may carry a tool or tool receptacle. USE - For machine tool. ADVANTAGE - Allows high acceleration at high precision...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} has been performed {{to study the}} classical problem of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is forced through the porous of a <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> which is moving laterally on a horizontal plan. The governing equations for this problem are reduced to an ordinary form and are solved by Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) and Numerical solution as Boundary Value Problem (BVP). The analytical solution for the coupled Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations resulting from the momentum equation is obtained and Velocity fields have been computed and discussed for different values of the Reynolds number of the velocity field. The analytic solution {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the direct numerical solution...|$|E
40|$|An {{incompressible}} Newtonian fluid {{is forced}} through the porous of a <b>circular</b> <b>slider</b> which is moving laterally on a horizontal plan. In this paper, we introduce {{and apply the}} one step Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (one step OHAM) {{to the problem of}} the circular porous slider where a fluid is injected through the porous bottom. The effects of mass injection and lateral velocity on the heat generated by viscous dissipation are investigated by solving the governing boundary layer equations using one step optimal homotopy technique. The approximate solution for the coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations resulting from the momentum equation is obtained and discussed for different values of the Reynolds number of the velocity field. The solution obtained is also displayed graphically for various values of the Reynolds number and it is shown that the one step OHAM is capable of finding the approximate solution of circular porous slider...|$|E
