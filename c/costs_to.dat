The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice.

40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> major water area and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> minor water area, which presented physical factors; <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> district center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city expansion center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> major roads, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city roads, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> district center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city expansion center and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads. Slope, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> minor water area, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> town center, <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> county roads and <b>cost</b> distance <b>to</b> rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land.

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany.

The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

As a result, {{we found that the}} lower <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> sales ratio projects had the higher relative effort ratio in external design phase, which indicates that spending less effort in external design can cause decrease of profit. We also found that high outsourcing ratio projects had higher <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> sales ratio, and that projects having moderate code reuse ratio had lower and disperse <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> sales ratio, which suggests troubles in code reuse can damage the profit of a project.
