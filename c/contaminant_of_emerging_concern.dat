The difficulty to detect and quantify <b>contaminants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> in the environment stimulates the development of appropriate analytical methods. In this work a chemometric approach to positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) optimization for the simultaneous determination <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> in water samples by liquid chromatography-ion trap-time of flight-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-IT-TOF-HRMS) was applied. Three types of phase modifiers were used: formic acid, ammonium hydroxide and formic acid/ammonium formate. The effects of operational parameters such as mobile phase modifier concentrations, mobile phase flow rate, heating block temperature and drying gas flow rate were evaluated by the 24 − 1 fractional factorial experimental design, resolution IV, in the screening phase and byDoehlert experimental design. Initial factorial experimental design studies indicated that the phasemodifier ammonium hydroxide was more efficient {{compared to the other}} evaluated modifiers. It provided higher ion intensities to the majority of analytes. Doehlert experimental design allowed finding a region indicative of the optimum experimental conditions for most analytes.

The United States environmental regulatory process is a constant work in progress. Inherited from decades-old public health traditions, environmental regulatory programs arose to address the issues of public health as water and air quality issues surfaced. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U. S. C. 2601), enacted in 1976, provided the EPA regulatory authority to protect the environment and consumers’ health against risks posed by chemicals in commerce. TSCA only retroactively addressed chemical hazards, after they had been deemed unsafe and previously unrestricted in the public. A bill to overhaul TSCA, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21 st Century Act (House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H. R. 2576, TSCA Modernization Act of 2015), was passed by the Senate on June 7, 2016 and sent on for President Obama’s signature. The amended law will give the EPA new authority to evaluate the safety of a new chemical before it enters the marketplace. It will also allow EPA to evaluate the safety of chemicals already known to be risks, including chemicals found to persist in the human body and in the environment. The Columbia River is presented as a case study as an example of a significant waterbody with research and regulatory gaps concerning CECs.

40|$|Rational {{design is}} {{important}} to achieve high-performance sorbents used to remove the <b>contaminants</b> <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>concern</b> (CECs) from water. However, {{it is hard to}} propose effective design guidelines {{due to the lack of}} a clear understanding of the interaction mechanisms. By means of systematic quantum chemical computations, as a case study, we investigated the interactions between zeolite X/Mn+âzeolite X (Si/AlÂ =Â  1, Mn+Â =Â Cu 2 + and Ni 2 +) and three commonly used CECs (namely salicylic acid, carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin) in water to clarify the adsorption mechanisms. Our computations found that anionic salicylic acid cannot be adsorbed by neither zeolite X nor Mn+âzeolite X in neutral water due to the high electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin have favorable binding energies with both zeolite X and Mn+âzeolite X, and their interactions with Mn+âzeolite X are stronger due to the joint effects of H-bond, metal complexation and electrostatic interaction. The adsorption loading of ciprofloxacin, which has a large molecular size, on Mn+âzeolite X is limited due to the steric hindrance. In general, steric hindrance, electrostatic interaction, H-bond and metal complexation are dominant factors for the examined systems in this study. Thus, for the design of high-performance absorbing materials, we should fully consider the molecular properties of pollutants (molecular size, surface electrostatic potential and atomic type, etc.), and properly enhance the favorable effects and avoid the unfavorable factors as much as possible under the guidance of the interaction mechanisms.
