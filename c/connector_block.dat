In cases of abnormally high lead impedance with {{no evidence of a}} macroscopic fracture, optimal treatment options have not yet been established. Here, we present the case of a 49 -year-old woman with a 12 -year history of Parkinson’s disease who received bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS in March 2006. The patient showed good control of parkinsonism until December 24, 2010, when she awoke with abrupt worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. At telemetric testing, lead impedances were found at > 2, 000 Ω in all four leads on the left side. Fracture of a lead or an extension wire was suspected. However, radiological screening and palpation revealed no macroscopic fracture. In June 2011, the implantable pulse generator (IPG) was changed under local anesthesia without any complications. Postoperatively, her parkinsonism immediately improved to the previous level, and the lead impedance readings by telemetry were also normalized. The disconnection of the neurostimulator <b>connector</b> <b>block</b> and the hybrid circuit board of the IPG was confirmed by destructive analysis. The present report illustrates that a staged approach that starts with simple IPG replacement can be an option for some cases of acute DBS effect loss with high impedance, when radiological findings are normal, thereby sparing the intact electrodes and extension wires.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the <b>connector</b> <b>block.</b> Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements.

40|$|The use of resolvers and resolver-to-digital (R/D) {{converters}} {{in industrial}} applications is increasing {{in the past}} few years. Meanwhile, as the need for high speed and high precision in Adjustable Speed Drives (ASD) is increasing imperiously, traditional analog R/D converters are replaced by digital R/D converters. Compare to traditional analog R/D converters, the advantage of using digital R/D converters is that it has high accuracy, good noise resistance, and low cost. Here, an improved R/D converter developed using FPGA codes is performed in this research. This proposed R/D converter utilizes synchronous detectors for signal demodulation, and A/D converters for analog to digital signal conversion, as well as built-in look-up table for angular data conversion. The result of this research shows the effectiveness of this proposed R/D converter system and is feasible to implement into the modern ASD and its applications.

40|$|AbstractThe DNA {{packaging}} motor of the bacteriophage ϕ 29, comprising head-tail connector, ATPase, and pRNA, transports the viral DNA {{inside the}} procapsid against pressure differences {{of up to}} ∼ 60 atm during replication. Several models for the DNA packaging mechanism have been proposed, which attribute different roles to the connector, and require specific mechanical properties of the connector. To characterize these properties at the atomic level, and {{to understand how the}} connector withstands this large pressure, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the whole connector both in equilibrium and under mechanical stress. The simulations revealed a quite heterogeneous distribution of stiff and soft regions, resembling that of typical composite materials that are also optimized to resist mechanical stress. In particular, the conserved middle α-helical region is found to be remarkably stiff, similar only to structural proteins forming viral shell, silk, or collagen. In contrast, large parts of the peripheral interface to the ϕ 29 procapsid turned out to be rather soft. Force probe and umbrella sampling simulations showed that large connector deformations are remarkably reversible, and served to calculate the free energies required for these deformations. In particular, for an untwisting deformation by 12 °, as postulated by the untwist-twist model, more than four times’ larger energy is required than is available from hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. Combined with previous experiments, this result is incompatible with the untwist-twist model. In contrast, our simulations support the recently proposed one-way revolution model and suggest in structural terms how the <b>connector</b> <b>blocks</b> DNA leakage. In particular, conserved loops at the rim of the central channel, which are in direct contact with the DNA, are found to be rather flexible and tightly anchored to the rigid central region. These findings suggest a check-valve mechanism, with the flexible loops obstructing the channel by interacting with the viral DNA...|$|R

40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of car navigation systems, indoor navigation systems are increasingly attracting attention in the indoor research area. However, the available models for indoor navigation suffer from the problems that architectural constraints are not considered, route planning is only based on 2 D planes, users are represented as points without considering their volumes, and different requirements asked for by different users are ignored. Consequently, the routes provided by existing models may not be suitable for different kinds of users like pedestrians, persons in wheelchairs, and persons driving indoor autos. This paper proposes a cubebased model to compute feasible routes for different users according to their widths, heights, and special requirements (e. g., users in wheelchairs prefer the routes without stairs). In this model, an indoor space is first represented by multiple cubes with different types. Then, according to the heights and types of the cubes, possible passages with the maximum widths and heights are generated by merging cubes into large blocks.

Key electrical and mechanical concerns that effect further array subsystem development are also discussed. Three integrated array design concepts were selected by the advisory panel for further optimization and development. From these concepts a single one will be selected for detailed analysis and prototype fabrication. The three concepts selected are: (1) An array of frameless panels/modules sealed in a T shaped zipper locking neoprene gasket grid pressure fitted into an extruded aluminum channel grid fastened across the rafters. (2) An array of frameless modules pressure fitted {{in a series of}} zipper locking EPDM rubber extrusions adhesively bonded to the roof. Series string voltage is developed using a set of integral tongue <b>connectors</b> and positioning <b>blocks.</b> (3) An array of frameless modules sealed by a silicone adhesive in a prefabricated grid of rigid tape and sheet metal attached to the roof...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a complete}} thermocouple assembly. Elements of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and constantan, and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type <b>connectors</b> and terminal <b>blocks</b> ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The constantan wires are attached to a common constantan wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and constantan wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves pushing the assembly into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short cables, a test pit. Longer assemblies are usually lowered into bore holes with a 10 - 20 lb weight tied to the bottom. Finally the bore hole is backfilled so that no air pockets exist.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomena}} of fracture in polymers {{at the molecular}} and continuum level. At a molecular level, we study the failure of polymer/polymer interfaces. Our main focus is on a specific mode of failure known as chain pull-out fracture, which is common to weak adhesive junctions, and polymer blends and mixtures. In {{the case of the}} interface between incompatible polymers, reinforcement is achieved by adding a block copolymer to the interface. We introduce a microscopic model based on Brownian dynamics to investigate the effect of the polymerization index N, of the <b>block</b> <b>connector</b> chain, on fracture toughness of such reinforced polymeric junctions. We consider the mushroom regime, where connector chains are grafted with low surface density, for the case of large pulling velocity. We find that for short chains the interface fracture toughness depends linearly on the polymerization index N of the connector chains, while for longer chains the dependence becomes N 3 / 2. We propose a scaling argument, based on the geometry of the initial configuration, that accounts for both short and long chains and the crossover between them. At the continuum level, we study the pattern selection mechanism of finger-like crack growth phenomena in gradient driven growth problems in general, and the structure of stress-induced morphological instabilities in crazing of polymer glasses in particular. We simulate solidification in a narrow channel {{through the use of a}} phase-field model with an adaptive grid. By tuning a dimensionless parameter, the Peclet number, we show a continuous crossover from a free dendrite at high Peclet numbers to anisotropic viscous fingering at low Peclet numbers. At low Peclet numbers we find good agreement between our results, theoretical predictions, and experiment, providing the first quantitative test of solvability theory for anisotropic viscous fingers. For high undercoolings, we find new phenomena, a solid forger which satisfies stability and thermodynamic criterion. We further provide an analytical form for the shape of these fingers, based on local models of solidification, which fits our numerical results from simulation. Later we study the growth of crazes in polymer glasses by deriving the equations of motion of plastic flow at the craze tip, and the steady-state velocity profile of this flow. By developing a phenomenological model, we solve the full time-dependent equations of motion of this highly non-linear phenomena. Our simulation produces the steady-state cellular pattern observed in experiments. We further show that polymer glasses with lower yield stress produce cellular patterns with sharper tips and more cells, indicating instabilities with smaller wavelengths...|$|R
