Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E

Type- 2 fuzzy <b>sets</b> and <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are both three {{dimensional}} extensions of type- 1 fuzzy <b>sets.</b> <b>Complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> come in two forms, the standard form, postulated in 2002 by Ramot et al., and the 2011 innovation of pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets,</b> proposed by Tamir et al [...] In this paper we compare and contrast both forms of <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> with type- 2 fuzzy sets, as regards their rationales, applications, definitions, and structures. In addition, pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are compared with type- 2 fuzzy sets {{in relation to their}} inferencing operations. <b>Complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> and type- 2 fuzzy sets differ in their roles and applications; <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are pertinent to inferencing where there is seasonality, and type- 2 fuzzy sets are applicable to reasoning under uncertainty. Their definitions differ also, though there is equivalence between those of a pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> and a type- 2 fuzzy set. Structural similarity is evident between these three- dimensional <b>sets.</b> <b>Complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are represented by a 3 –D line, and type- 2 fuzzy sets by a 3 –D surface, but a surface is simply a generalisation of a line. This similarity is particularly apparent between pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> and type- 2 fuzzy sets, which are both mappings from the domain onto the unit square. However type- 2 fuzzy sets were found not to be isomorphic to pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets.</b> The mechanisms by which <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> model and quantify periodicity, and type- 2 fuzzy sets model and quantify uncertainty are discussed. A type- 2 fuzzy set can be represented as the union of its type- 2 embedded set. An embedded type- 2 fuzzy set is a type- 2 fuzzy set in itself, whose geomet- rical representation is a 3 -D line. Thus, geometrically an embedded type- 2 fuzzy set can be seen as equivalent to a pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> and therefore a type- 2 fuzzy set can be represented as the union of a collection pure <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets,</b> which in turn can be regarded as embedded <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> of a type- 2 fuzzy set. This relationship is exploited to provide a complex definition of a type- 2 fuzzy set...|$|R

The oldest rocks in the area that now includes Death Valley National Park are extensively metamorphosed by intense heat and pressure and are at least 1700 million years old.

5|$|These {{features}} {{have made}} Gibraltar a naturally strong defensive position. The isthmus lacks any natural cover, exposing any approaching enemy to opposing fire. The heights of the Rock form a natural barrier to movement and rocky ledges provide natural platforms for gun batteries. The sheer cliffs {{on the north}} and east sides of the Rock block access from those directions and the sea cliffs around {{the southern end of the}} peninsula make landings there difficult, especially if opposed. A single road connects Gibraltar with Spain, and within the territory most roads are narrow and often steep due to the restricted land area. Over the centuries, Gibraltar's successive occupants have built an increasingly <b>complex</b> <b>set</b> of fortifications around, on top of and incorporating the territory's natural features.|$|E

40|$|DMU Interdisciplinary Group in Intelligent Transport Systems (DIGITS) Data is {{frequently}} characterised by both uncertainty and seasonality. Type- 2 fuzzy sets are {{an extension of}} type- 1 fuzzy sets offering a conceptual scheme within which the effects of uncertainties in fuzzy inferencing may be modelled and minimised. <b>Complex</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> are type- 1 fuzzy sets extended by an additional phase term which permits them to intuitively represent the seasonal aspect of fuzziness in time-series applications.

40|$|In this paper, complex {{membership}} {{grades are}} introduced for {{the extension of}} fuzzy set theory to the complex domain. This model {{is based on the}} idea of viewing the complex domain in a linguistic manner, where two linguistic terms are required to define an object. Thus, as opposed to Buckley's model, after fuzzification the two- dimensionality of the universe of discourse is still apparent. One form for representing a <b>complex</b> fuzzy <b>set</b> is using the Cartesian <b>Complex</b> Fuzzy <b>Set</b> representation, which produces <b>complex</b> <b>sets</b> of the form [Z]̃c = [X]̃ + j[Y]̃. The motivation for this aberrant representation is oriented from the limitations in using a direct extension to Zadeh, that Buckley introduced. These limitations pose the guidelines for Complex Membership Grades and, therefore, are initially discussed in this paper. <b>Complex</b> Fuzzy <b>Sets</b> are defined and a technique for converting between <b>Complex</b> Fuzzy <b>Sets</b> and Fuzzy Relations is developed based on Cylindrical Extensions and Projections defined by Zadeh. Next, linguistic coordinate transformations are discussed and exemplified by a rule-base coordinate transformation between Polar and Cartesian <b>Complex</b> Fuzzy <b>Sets.</b> Arithmetic operations and defuzzification are demonstrated. The simplicity of these latter operations is crucial when considering implementation prospects. Finally, Complex Membership Grades are applied to the design of adaptive filters. It is shown that a logically derived rule-base can be described, using the linguistic complex domain, for the adaptation process. Emphasis, in this part, is put on the unique characteristics of the complex membership grades model...|$|R
5|$|Spotted hyenas have a <b>complex</b> <b>set</b> of postures in communication. When afraid, {{the ears}} are folded flat, {{and are often}} {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as {{it has also been}} observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
