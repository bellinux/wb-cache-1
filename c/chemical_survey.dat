The study of the New Zealand marine bryozoan Pterocella vesiculosa has resulted in the isolation of three new compounds; pterocellin H, pterocellin I and 1 -methyl- 5 -bromo- 8 -methoxy-β-carboline. These compounds were characterised using high resolution mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of these compounds was investigated and a discussion of the results including a comparison with the activity of closely related compounds is also presented. The crude extracts of eighty-five marine organisms were surveyed to establish their biological activity and chemical constituents. The results of this study indicated which species had interesting biological activity. The <b>chemical</b> <b>survey</b> allowed geographical and intra-species comparisons of chemical constituents between samples, as well as potentially indicating the presence of known secondary metabolites.

40|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>survey</b> of 58 marine samples {{obtained}} from three sites around Tauranga New Zealand was undertaken {{in an effort}} to identify new metabolites. MTT assays using HeLa and P 388 cell lines were carried out to determine if any of the samples contained bioactive compounds. For each sample, a crude extract was obtained and analysed by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS). The chromatogram traces were examined and fives samples containing potential metabolites of interest were chosen for further investigation. Of the five samples two were identified from preliminary taxonomic analysis as Lyngbya sp. (cyanobacterium) and Cliona celata (a sponge). The compound targeted in Lyngbya sp. was thought to potentially be a new peptide and the Cliona celata compounds contained bromine atoms. These two samples were extracted in bulk and fractionated by reversed phase and size exclusion chromatography. From the mass spectral data and the taxonomy there were no identified samples on the MarinLit database. The separation yielded several fractions and these were analysed by LCMS to identify which ones contained the targeted compounds. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry was then used on the most concentrated (targeted compound) fractions to get more structural information. NMR spectroscopy of Cliona celata was found contain many impurities and the target compounds concentrations were not sufficient enough to give any structural information. The compound from Lyngbya sp. appeared to be a fatty acid. The sterol composition of Cliona celata was also analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). The three other samples analysed in more detail were Aplidium sp. (RI 2 - 13), Alcyonaria sp. (RI 2 - 14) and Ircinia sp. (RI 2 - 17).

Water samples are of the calcium bicarbonate type, with small fluctuations in outlet temperature (20. 05 ± 0. 23 °C), pH (6. 23 ± 0. 16), and TDS (2415 ± 35 mg/l). The concentrations of major ions stayed nearly constant, except for SO 42 −. All analyzed waters are saturated or oversaturated relative to calcite and dolomite. The higher saturation indices of the water samples relative to calcite and dolomite observed {{during the summer of}} 1998 is interpreted in terms of the lower rainfall during the dry season, inducing a lower supply of CO 2 to the feeding aquifer at depth. The sharp decrease of SO 42 − in the December 1998 to January 1999 water samples during the wet season may be ascribed to a drop in the supply of H 2 S from a deep-seated source due to a temporary change of stress regime.

Samples between 0. 5 and 7 m depth were analyzed for their physical, mineralogical and chemical properties, and their micro-morphology was described by optical and transmission electron microscopy. Two steps of a sequential extraction procedure helped to assess the mobility of elements and to better discriminate between metals originating from pedogenesis and issued from MSW. These combined approaches showed that exposed soil profiles have been impacted at various depths, down to 7 m, through increased metal content, especially enhanced mobility of Zn, Co, Mn, Cu and Fe, and through increased salinity and organic matter. The mobility of potentially harmful metals should decrease with pH, which significantly increased in some impacted horizons, but other factors can reverse this trend...|$|E
40|$|The Porgera Joint Venture (PJV) gold mine, {{located in}} Enga Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG), {{discharges}} approximately 15, 000 tonnes of treated tailings per day to an erodible dump and flows to the receiving river system. As {{a condition of}} the permit to discharge tailings, PJV undertakes routine chemical and biological monitoring of the downstream system. Indigenous prawns of the genus Macrobrachium demonstrate significant differences in bioaccumulated metal concentrations (predominantly cadmium) between populations exposed to mine-derived materials compared to those in reference tributaries. Chemical analyses of the downstream system was unable to explain why these differences in bioaccumulated metals exist. This PhD study investigated the sources and mechanisms of metal bioaccumulation by prawns in the Strickland River. The project was divided into two main components, a <b>chemical</b> <b>survey</b> of the river system aimed at identifying potential sources of bioavailable metals in the dissolved and solid phases, and laboratory-based bioaccumulation assays using stable and radiolabelled metals. The second component was intended to provide {{a greater understanding of}} the significance of specific metal sources to the prawns. The <b>chemical</b> <b>survey</b> of the river system identified the particulate matter as the main source of metal loading to the downstream system. Dilute-acid extractions of particulate materials, aimed at targeting the potentially bioavailable pool of carbonate and hydroxide-bound metals, also indicated no significant difference in extractable metal concentrations between sites. The surveys demonstrated the difficulties in using chemistry alone to describing metal bioaccumulation patterns when metal concentrations had been diluted to near background levels. The prawn bioaccumulation assays were conducted using a surrogate species of Macrobrachium (M. australiense) due to issues involved with obtaining and holding the PNG species in Australia. Cadmium bioaccumulation by M. australiense was mostly attributed to uptake from solution when exposed to mine tailings, whereas lead and arsenic appeared to be bioaccumulated mostly from fine sediment ingestion. Results from radioisotope studies were used to develop a steady-state biokinetic model of cadmium bioaccumulation by M. australiense, which was in turn used to determine the relevant contributions of dietary and dissolved phases to the total body cadmium loading. The model predicted that the contribution of dietary cadmium would account for approximately 80 % of total body cadmium when exposed to typical cadmium concentrations found in the Strickland River, with the remaining 20 % coming from dissolved cadmium. A final study investigated the applicability of the biokinetic model developed for M. australiense to Macrobrachium species found in the studied system. The experiments included a dissolved cadmium exposure and mine tailings exposure using M. australiense, M. rosenbergii and M. latidactylus (the latter two species were tested in laboratories at the PJV mine site). The species comparison study suggested that the biokinetic model would most likely over-predict cadmium concentrations in the two PNG Macrobrachium species (but only by a factor of 2 to 4). The study also demonstrated the issues with using surrogate species of the same genus to describe metal bioaccumulation, even in controlled environments.

Therefore, it is inferred that the sodium and potassium (K+ + Na+) are in the forms of sulfate and that the sources of the sulfate are deserts and some dried lakes in Central Asia. It is also found that there is obviously spatial variation of ions such as K+ + Na+, Ca 2 +, SO 42 - and HCO 3 -. The concentrations of K+ + Na+ and SO 42 - and that of Ca 2 + and HCO 3 - have similar spatial pattern.

From these observations, the eddy contained 1. 25 × 109 moles Si, 4. 5 × 108 moles NO 3 ?, 5. 5 × 107 moles PO 3 ?, 1. 2 × 108 moles POC, and 1. 9 × 109 moles DOC, all available for transport to the interior of the Canada Basin. This suggests that such eddies likely play a significant role in maintaining the nutrient maxima observed in the upper halocline. Assuming that shelf-to-basin eddy transport is the dominant renewal mechanism for waters of the upper halocline, remineralization of the excess organic carbon transported into the interior would consume 6. 70 × 1010 moles of O 2, or one half the total oxygen consumption anticipated arising from all export processes impacting the upper halocline...|$|E
40|$|Aims. Our {{goal is to}} {{determine}} the molecular composition of the circumstellar disk around AB Aurigae (hereafter, AB Aur). AB Aur is a prototypical Herbig Ae star and the understanding of its disk chemistry is of paramount importance to understand the chemical evolution of the gas in warm disks. Methods. We used the IRAM 30 -m telescope to perform a sensitive search for molecular lines in AB Aur as part of the IRAM Large program ASAI (A <b>Chemical</b> <b>Survey</b> of Sun-like Star-forming Regions). These data were complemented with interferometric observations of the HCO+ 1 - 0 and C 17 O 1 - 0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Single-dish and interferometric data were used to constrain chemical models. Results. Throughout the survey, several lines of CO and its isotopologues, HCO+, H 2 CO, HCN, CN and CS, were detected. In addition, we detected the SO 54 - 33 and 56 - 45 lines, confirming the previous tentative detection. Comparing to other T Tauri's and Herbig Ae disks, AB Aur presents low HCN 3 - 2 /HCO+ 3 - 2 and CN 2 - 1 /HCN 3 - 2 line intensity ratios, similar to other transition disks. AB Aur is the only protoplanetary disk detected in SO thus far. Conclusions. We modeled the line profiles using a chemical model and a radiative transfer 3 D code. Our model assumes a flared disk in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best agreement with observations was obtained for a disk with a mass of 0. 01 Msun, Rin= 110 AU, Rout= 550 AU, a surface density radial index of 1. 5 and an inclination of 27 deg. The intensities and line profiles were reproduced within a factor of 2 for most lines. This agreement is reasonable taking into account the simplicity of our model that neglects any structure within the disk. However, the HCN 3 - 2 and CN 2 - 1 line intensities were predicted more intense by a factor of > 10. We discuss several scenarios to explain this discrepancy...|$|E
40|$|High-spin (S = 2) iron(IV) {{species are}} rare but {{increasingly}} recognized as reactive intermediates {{in the catalytic}} cycles of several nonheme iron enzymes. A question of some interest, therefore, concerns how much higher in energy the low-spin (S = 1) state is for these species. With the use of density functional theory (DFT) and high-level ab initio calculations [CASPT 2 and CCSD(T) ], we have attempted {{to answer this question}} for the so-called Collins complex, a square-pyramidal Fe-IV complex with a tetraamido-N equatorial ligand set, a chloride axial ligand, and an S = 2 ground state. The calculations suggest that relative to the ground state, the low-spin state is higher in energy by at least 0. 3 eV and possibly as much as 0. 7 eV. Using DFT calculations, a broad quantum <b>chemical</b> <b>survey</b> of high-spin (FeO) -O-IV intermediates was also undertaken. A key finding is that the Fe-O distance and O spin population are quite similar across all mononuclear (FeO) -O-IV species studied, regardless of the heme versus non-heme environment and of the S = 1 versus 2 spin state, reflecting the essential similarity of the Fe(d(pi)) -O(p(pi)) orbital interactions in all the species studied. However, the spin density profiles of high-spin (FeO) -O-IV species, currently believed to be known only as a nonheme iron enzyme (TauD) intermediate, are predicted to be very different from that of Collins' high-spin Fe-IV complex. Our calculations further suggest that with the help of sterically hindered ligands such as 6 -me(3) -tpa, {{it might be possible to}} generate synthetic high-spin (FeO) -O-IV models of the unique TauD intermediate. Finally, our calculations confirm the aptness of describing the [(6 -me(3) -tpa) Fe-III(mu-O) (2) Fe-IV(6 -me(3) -tpa) ](3 +) cation as a flexible diamond core and indicate the presence of a fairly discrete high-spin (FeO) -O-IV unit within the dinuclear core.

40|$|Polymerases are protein {{enzymes that}} move along nucleic acid chains and {{catalyze}} template-based polymerization reactions during gene transcription and replication. The polymerases also substantially improve transcription or replication fidelity through the non-equilibrium enzymatic cycles. We briefly review computational efforts {{that have been}} made toward understanding mechano-chemical coupling and fidelity control mechanisms of the polymerase elongation. The polymerases are regarded as molecular information motors during the elongation process. It requires a full spectrum of computational approaches from multiple time and length scales to understand the full polymerase functional cycle. We keep away from quantum mechanics based approaches to the polymerase catalysis due to abundant former surveys, while address only statistical physics modeling approach and all-atom molecular dynamics simulation approach. We organize this review around our own modeling and simulation practices on a single-subunit T 7 RNA polymerase, and summarize commensurate studies on structurally similar DNA polymerases. For multi-subunit RNA polymerases that have been intensively studied in recent years, we leave detailed discussions on the simulation achievements to other computational <b>chemical</b> <b>surveys,</b> while only introduce very recently published representative studies, including our own preliminary work on structure-based modeling on yeast RNA polymerase II. In the end, we quickly go through kinetic modeling on elongation pauses and backtracking activities. We emphasize the fluctuation and control mechanisms of the polymerase actions, highlight the non-equilibrium physical nature of the system, and try to bring some perspectives toward understanding replication and transcription regulation from single molecular details to a genome-wide scale...|$|R
40|$|Two mass spectrometers (MS) {{are tested}} for the {{measurement}} of volatile substances, such as hydrocarbons and metabolic gases, in natural waters. KOALA is a backpackable MS operated from above the water surface, in which samples are pumped through a flow cell using a syringe. NEREUS is an underwater instrument hosted by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that is linked to a communications network to provide chemical data in real time. The mass analyzers of the two MS are nearly identical cycloids, and both use flat-plate membrane inlets. Testing took place in an eutrophic, thermally stratified lake exhibiting steep chemical gradients and significant levels of methane. KOALA provided rapid multispecies analysis of dissolved gases, with a detection limit for methane of 0. 1 ppm (readily extendable to 0. 01 ppm) and savings of time {{of at least a}} factor of 10 compared to that of conventional analysis. The AUV-mounted NEREUS additionally provided rapid spatial coverage and the capability of performing <b>chemical</b> <b>surveys</b> autonomously. Tests demonstrated the need for temperature control of a membrane inlet when steep thermal gradients are present in a water body, as well as the benefits of co-locating all sensors on the AUV to avoid interference from chemically different waters entering and draining from the free-flooding outer hull. The ability to measure dissolved volatiles provided by MS offers potential for complementarity with ionic sensors in the study of natural waters, such {{as in the case of}} the carbonate system...|$|R
