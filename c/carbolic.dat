5|$|Prof Carstairs Cumming Douglas FRSE {{physician}} and hygienist {{was born in}} Kirkcaldy. He was largely {{the man responsible for}} introducing the obligatory use of <b>Carbolic</b> soap throughout Scottish schools in 1907.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing <b>carbolic</b> acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, republican {{sentiment}} in Britain, {{fed by the}} Queen's seclusion, was boosted after {{the establishment of the}} Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic <b>carbolic</b> acid spray. In late November 1871, {{at the height of the}} republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.|$|E
25|$|Phenol was {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of the <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball, an ineffective device marketed in London in the 19th century as protection against influenza and other ailments, {{and the subject of}} the famous law case Carlill v <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Company.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century William Stewart Halstead (1852–1922) laid out basic {{surgical}} principles for asepsis known as Halsteads principles. Halsted also introduced the latex medical glove. After {{one of his}} nurses suffered skin damage due to having to sterilize her hands with <b>carbolic</b> acid, Halsted had a rubber glove that could be dipped in <b>carbolic</b> acid designed.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with <b>Carbolic</b> acid, an antiquated name for phenol.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterward, in 1834, Friedrich Ferdinand Runge {{discovered}} <b>carbolic</b> acid in coal-tar, and Auguste Laurent obtained it from phenylhydrate, {{which was}} soon {{determined to be}} the same compound. There was no clear view on the relationship between <b>carbolic</b> acid and creosote; Runge described it as having similar caustic and antiseptic properties, but noted that it was different, in that it was an acid and formed salts. Nonetheless, Reichenbach argued that creosote was also the active element, as it was in pyroligneous acid. Despite evidence to the contrary, his view held sway with most chemists, and it became commonly accepted wisdom that creosote, <b>carbolic</b> acid, and phenylhydrate were identical substances, with different degrees of purity.|$|E
25|$|Commercially used {{creosote}} {{is often}} treated {{to extract the}} <b>carbolic</b> acid, naphthalene, or anthracene content. The <b>carbolic</b> acid or naphthalene is generally extracted {{to be used in}} other commercial products. American produced creosote oils typically will have low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of naphthalene, because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will be ruined and only the hard pitch will remain; this ruins it for use in roofing purposes, and only leaves a product which isn't commercially useful.|$|E
25|$|Carlill v <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Company - an {{advertisement}} containing certain terms {{to get a}} reward constituted a binding unilateral offer that could be accepted by anyone who performed its terms.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, {{physician}} Agostino Gemelli {{wrote that}} Pio was a hysteric and his stigmata was self-induced not of supernatural origin. Gemelli also speculated that his wounds were kept open with <b>carbolic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|A {{pharmacist}} sold four {{grams of}} <b>carbolic</b> acid to Padre Pio {{in the year}} 1919. The archbishop of Manfredonia, Pasquale Gagliardi, reported this as evidence that Padre Pio could have effected the stigmata with acid. This suggestion was examined and dismissed by the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|Phenol, {{also known}} as <b>carbolic</b> acid, is an {{aromatic}} organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a phenyl group (−C6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (−OH). It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns.|$|E
25|$|A {{recipe for}} {{preparing}} the ink is as follows: Take one lb. of bruised galls, one gallon of boiling water, 5½ oz of ferrous sulfate in solution, 3 oz of gum arabic previously dissolved, {{and a few}} drops of an anti-septic, such as <b>carbolic</b> acid. Macerate the galls for 24 hours, strain the infusion and add the other ingredients.|$|E
25|$|Asquith {{appeared}} in two important {{cases in the}} early 1890s. He played an effective low-key role in the sensational Tranby Croft libel trial (1891), helping {{to show that the}} plaintiff had not been libelled. He was on the losing side in Carlill v <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Co (1892), a landmark English contract law case that established that a company was obliged to meet its advertised pledges.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or <b>carbolic</b> acid as he called it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Angus Smith {{developed}} and patented a product called McDougall's Powder as a sewer deodorant; it was mainly composed from <b>carbolic</b> acid derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a sewage farm. This later led to {{widespread use of}} creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted dip, and drenching tubes {{would be used to}} administer doses to the animals' stomachs to kill internal parasites.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{benefits}} of gas lighting and heating, the process for producing coal gas yielded {{a number of other}} substances which were subsequently successfully exploited. Among these were coke; ammonia; phenol (<b>carbolic</b> acid), a disinfectant and one of the components of bakelite, the first synthetic plastic invented in 1910; and coal tar, which contained a number of organic chemicals. Coal tar was subsequently used to produce the first synthetic dye, mauve, by William Henry Perkin in 1856 and in 1853 was found, by Charles Gerhardt to contain the chemical acetylsalicylic acid, now known as aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% <b>carbolic</b> solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, Pasteur's rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, used <b>carbolic</b> acid to kill anthrax bacilli {{and tested}} the vaccine on sheep. Pasteur {{thought that this}} type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. In early 1881, Pasteur discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method {{in a speech to the}} French Academy of Sciences on February 28. Later in 1881, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at Pouilly-le-Fort on sheep, goats and cows, was successful. Pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort. His laboratory notebooks, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, show that he actually used heat and potassium dichromate, similar to Toussaint's method.|$|E
500|$|According to an eye witness, an {{assistant}} janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer to Our Lady. Each time the guards checked on him, {{he was standing}} or kneeling {{in the middle of}} the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. [...] After two weeks of dehydration and starvation, only Kolbe remained alive. “The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of <b>carbolic</b> acid. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientist}} Michael Faraday {{described the}} situation {{in a letter to}} The Times in July 1855: shocked at the state of the Thames, he dropped pieces of white paper into the river to [...] "test the degree of opacity". His conclusion was that [...] "Near the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind.... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." [...] The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, chloride of lime and <b>carbolic</b> acid into the waterway to ease the stench.|$|E
500|$|In late 1891, the Prince was implicated {{as having}} been {{involved}} with a former Gaiety Theatre chorus girl, Lydia Miller (stage name Lydia Manton), who committed suicide by drinking <b>carbolic</b> acid. Although she was the nominal mistress of Lord Charles Montagu, who gave evidence at the inquest, it was alleged that he was merely a cover for the Prince who had requested she give up her theatrical career on his behalf, and that the authorities sought to suppress the case by making the inquest private and refusing access to the depositions. Similarly to the Cleveland Street scandal only overseas newspapers printed Albert Victor's name, but regional British newspapers did quote the radical London newspaper The Star which published: [...] "It is a fact so well known that the blind denials of it given in some quarters are childishly futile. Lydia Manton was the petite amie of a certain young prince, and that, too, quite recently." [...] It was labelled [...] "a scandal of the first magnitude... on the lips of every clubman", and compared to the Tranby Croft affair, in which his father was called to give evidence at a trial for slander.|$|E
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell <b>carbolic</b> soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E
500|$|A {{few years}} later, when World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse {{with her mother}} and Olga. They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe <b>carbolic</b> acid and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot her mother had been born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip she heard about her own German connections.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in Carlisle, England, {{officials}} were {{experimenting with a}} sewage treatment, using <b>carbolic</b> acid to reduce the smell of sewage cess pools. [...] Having heard of these developments and having himself previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success, Lister decided to try <b>carbolic</b> acid as an wound antiseptic. [...] He had his first chance on August 12, 1865, when he received a patient: an eleven year old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced {{the skin of his}} lower leg. [...] Ordinarily, amputation would be the only solution. [...] However, Lister decided to try <b>carbolic</b> acid. [...] After setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints, Lister soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted <b>carbolic</b> acid and applied them to the wound, covered with a layer of tin foil, leaving them for four days. [...] When he checked the wound, Lister pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection, just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the <b>carbolic</b> acid. [...] Reapplying fresh bandages with diluted <b>carbolic</b> acid, the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exception}} arises if {{the advertisement}} makes a unilateral promise, {{such as the}} offer of a reward, as in the famous case of Carlill v. <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Company, decided in nineteenth-century England. <b>Carbolic,</b> a medical firm, advertised a smoke ball marketed as a wonder drug that would, according to the instructions, protect users from catching the flu. If it did not work, buyers would receive £100 and the company {{said that they had}} deposited £1,000 in the bank to show their good faith. When sued, <b>Carbolic</b> argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer; instead it was [...] "a mere puff", or [...] gimmick. But the court of appeal held that it would appear to a reasonable man that <b>Carbolic</b> had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were both}} {{religious}} and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used <b>carbolic</b> acid {{to make the}} wounds. [...] The historian Sergio Luzzatto recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Pio had requested <b>carbolic</b> acid from a pharmacist. She said it was for sterilization.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carbolic</b> acid {{was soon}} {{commonly}} sold {{under the name}} [...] "creosote", and the scarcity of wood-tar creosote in some places led chemists {{to believe that it}} was the same substance as that described by Reichenbach. In the 1840s, Eugen Freiherr von Gorup-Besanez, after realizing that two samples of substances labelled as creosote were different, started a series of investigations to determine the chemical nature of <b>carbolic</b> acid, leading to a conclusion that it more resembled chlorinated quinones and must have been a different, entirely unrelated substance.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were both}} {{religious}} and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used <b>carbolic</b> acid {{to make the}} wounds. In 2007, The Telegraph reported on the book, The Other Christ: Padre Pio and 19th Century Italy, by the historian Sergio Luzzatto. He recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Padre Pio requested <b>carbolic</b> acid from a pharmacist. She said it was for sterilization. The Catholic Anti-Defamation League said Luzzatto was spreading [...] "anti-Catholic libels" [...] and needed {{to learn more about}} religion. [...] Luzzatto was awarded the [...] in History for the book.|$|E
2500|$|Carlill v <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Company [...] , [...] 1 QB 256, [...] 2 QB 484 (QBD) - an {{advertisement}} containing certain terms {{to get a}} reward constituted a binding unilateral offer that could be accepted by anyone who performed its terms.|$|E
2500|$|Contract law {{concerns}} enforceable promises, and can {{be summed}} up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept). In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v <b>Carbolic</b> Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, <b>Carbolic</b> argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man <b>Carbolic</b> had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, [...] "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the [...] "distinct inconvenience" [...] of using a faulty product. [...] "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, [...] "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".|$|E
2500|$|The Church {{dismissed}} {{charges that}} he had faked the stigmata. [...] "The boys had needed injections to fight the Spanish Flu which was raging at that time. Due to a shortage of doctors, Padres Paolino and Pio administered the shots, using <b>carbolic</b> acid as a sterilizing agent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Using [...] Belgian chemist Dr. Leo Baekland's {{patented}} <b>carbolic</b> {{acid and}} formaldehyde phenolic resin compound marketed as [...] "Bakelite", Dr. Robert Nebesar patented a process where bakelite-bonded fine grain plywood was formed under pressure and heat {{to produce a}} strong light weight curved panel. The process was marketed under the trade name [...] "Duraloid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phenol was {{discovered}} in 1834 by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who extracted it (in impure form) from coal tar. Runge called phenol [...] "Karbolsäure" [...] (coal-oil-acid, <b>carbolic</b> acid). [...] Coal tar remained the primary source until {{the development of the}} petrochemical industry. [...] In 1841, the French chemist Auguste Laurent obtained phenol in pure form.|$|E
2500|$|Soaps: [...] "Burford's Prize No 1" [...] soap, [...] "Signal" [...] soap, mottled soap, yellow soap, {{transparent}} soap, White Naptha soap, Apollo {{laundry soap}} in various sized bars, Borax soap, [...] "Sayso" [...] <b>carbolic</b> family soap, [...] "Snowflakes" [...] extract of soap powder, Dr Bayley's medicated soap, sulphur soap, White Dove soap, and kerosene soap (foliage spray for controlling insects) ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the early}} 1900s to the 1970s {{it was used}} as a soap, known as <b>carbolic</b> soap. Concentrated phenol liquids are {{commonly}} used for permanent treatment of ingrown toe and finger nails, a procedure known as a chemical matrixectomy. The procedure was first described by Otto Boll in 1945. Since that time it has become the chemical of choice for chemical matrixectomies performed by podiatrists. [...] Phenol is also used as a preservative in some vaccines.|$|E
