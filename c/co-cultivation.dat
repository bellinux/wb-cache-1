40|$|Grape marc and lees are main waste biomass in wine industry, {{which contain}} {{substantial}} amount of carbohydrates and nutrients, but currently deliver considerable carbon emission through landfill in Australia. This study was aimed to develop a biotechnological systematic approach to select suitable fungi for bioconversion of the winery biomass wastes into animal feed. The biotech-systematic approach was developed through assessment of nutrient/carbon source accessibility of the fungi, understanding of their metabolic reactions in solid state fermentation, and nutritive value of the fungi-fermented grape marc. From 13 Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Trichoderma fungal species, A. oryzae DAR 3699, A. oryzae RIB 40 and T. reesei RUT C 30 were determined as the best fungi due to their promising biochemical capabilities to enhance protein contents and in vitro digestibility of grape marc in mono- and <b>co-cultivations.</b> The mono-fungous-cultured SSF process used these selected fungi is able to convert grape marc to nutrient-rich feed by increasing the protein contents from 5 % to 26 % and the digestibility from 25 % to over 50 %. R. oligosporus 2710 with R. oryzae 6201 or T. viride 15719 showed promising protein enrichment to 18 - 23 % and digestibility improvement by 50 % in their <b>co-cultivations.</b> This preliminary bioengineering strategy will be useful for selecting microorganisms for the bioconversion of organic wastes to high valuable products. This "green cycle" bioprocess will be useful to promote the old-fashioned waste treatment technologies for the cleaner production in food processing industries.

To that end, <b>co-cultivations</b> of the bEnd. 3 brain endothelial cell line and lymph node cells (LNC) were performed, and gene expression and production of IL- 17 and IFN-γ were determined. It was found that bEnd. 3 cells inhibited expression and production of IFN-γ, but not of IL- 17. Additionally, bEnd. 3 cells also reduced production of the major IFN-γ-promoting cytokine – IL- 12 – in LNC.

40|$|Microorganisms form diverse multispecies {{communities}} in various ecosystems. The high abundance of {{fungal and bacterial}} species in these consortia results in specific communication between the microorganisms. A key role in this communication is played by secondary metabolites (SMs), which are also called natural products. Recently, it was shown that interspecies ‘talk’ between microorganisms represents a physiological trigger to activate silent gene clusters leading {{to the formation of}} novel SMs by the involved species. This review focuses on mixed microbial cultivation, mainly between bacteria and fungi, with a special emphasis on the induced formation of fungal SMs in co-cultures. In addition, the role of chromatin remodeling in the induction is examined, and methodical perspectives for the analysis of natural products are presented. As an example for an intermicrobial interaction elucidated at the molecular level, we discuss the specific interaction between the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus with the soil bacterium Streptomyces rapamycinicus, which provides an excellent model system to enlighten molecular concepts behind regulatory mechanisms and will pave the way to a novel avenue of drug discovery through targeted activation of silent SM gene clusters through <b>co-cultivations</b> of microorganisms...|$|R

Conditions assessed were bacterial inoculum concentration, infection period, wounding and pre-culture of explants, acetosyringone (AS) concentration and <b>co-cultivation</b> temperature. Optimized conditions resulted in high transformation efficiency at transient level were as follows; Agrobacterium tumefaciens growth phase of A 600 nm 0. 8, infection period of 30 min, pre-culture of wounded explants prior to infection, addition of acetosyringone (AS) in bacterial growth culture (100 μM) and in <b>co-cultivation</b> medium (200 μM) and <b>co-cultivation</b> temperature of 22 °C.

40|$|The {{effect of}} glucose and oxygen {{limitation}} {{on the growth}} and fermentation performances of Dekkera bruxellensis was investigated {{in order to understand}} which factors favour its propagation in ethanol or wine plants. Although D. bruxellensis {{has been described as a}} facultative anaerobe, no growth was observed in mineral medium under complete anaerobiosis while growth was retarded under severe oxygen limitation. In a continuous culture with no gas inflow, glucose was not completely consumed, most probably due to oxygen limitation. When an air/nitrogen mixture (O- 2 -content ca. 5 %) was sparged to the culture, growth became glucose-limited. In <b>co-cultivations</b> with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ethanol yields/g consumed sugar were not affected by the co-cultures as compared to the pure cultures. However, different population responses were observed in both systems. In oxygen-limited cultivation, glucose was depleted within 24 h after challenging with S. cerevisiae and both yeast populations were maintained at a stable level. In contrast, the S. cerevisiae population constantly decreased to about 1 % of its initial cell number in the sparged glucose-limited fermentation, whereas the D. bruxellensis population remained constant. To identify the requirements of D. bruxellensis for anaerobic growth, the yeast was cultivated in several nitrogen sources and with the addition of amino acids. Yeast extract and most of the supplied amino acids supported anaerobic growth, which points towards a higher nutrient demand for D. bruxellensis compared to S. cerevisiae in anaerobic conditions.

IMPF: 07. 39 RONO: 00 Similar to other metazoan pathogens, Schistosoma mansoni undergoes transcriptional and developmental regulation during its complex lifecycle and host interactions. DNA methylation as a mechanism to control these processes has, to date, been discounted in this parasite. Here we show the first evidence for cytosine methylation in the S. mansoni genome. Transcriptional coregulation of novel DNA methyltransferase (SmDnmt 2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins mirrors the detection of cytosine methylation abundance and implicates {{the presence of a}} functional DNA methylation machinery. Genome losses in cytosine methylation upon SmDnmt 2 silencing and the identification of a hypermethylated, repetitive intron within a predicted forkhead gene confirm this assertion. Importantly, disruption of egg production and egg maturation by 5 -azacytidine establishes an essential role for 5 -methylcytosine in this parasite. These findings provide the first functional confirmation for this epigenetic modification in any worm species and link the cytosine methylation machinery to platyhelminth oviposition processes.

After 1 hr of <b>co-cultivation</b> adherent cells had a high MLR response, whereas the nonadherent cells were unresponsive and could not be restimulated by the addition of allogeneic leucocytes or syngeneic adherent cells. In contrast, the MLR was positive when syngeneic adherent cells were added to nonadherent cells which had not been co-cultured prior to the initiation of culture. The MLR of adherent cells declined progressively as a function of time of <b>co-cultivation</b> prior to separation. Conversely, there was a progressive increase in the MLR of nonadherent cells obtained after 12, 18 and 24 hr of <b>co-cultivation.</b> Morphological studies revealed a higher number of lymphocytes in the early adherent cell population than at later times. We conclude that during the first few hours of <b>co-cultivation</b> lymphocytes with the potential of responding to allogeneic stimulation are retained in the adherent cell population.

The four factors that we found most influenced transformation were: the sensitivity of immature sorghum embryos to Agrobacterium infection, the growth conditions of the donor plant, type of explant and <b>co-cultivation</b> medium. A major problem during the development of our protocol was a necrotic response which developed in explants after <b>co-cultivation.</b> Immature sorghum embryos proved to be very sensitive to Agrobacterium infection and we found that the level of embryo death after <b>co-cultivation</b> was the limiting step in improving transformation efficiency. The addition of coconut water to the <b>co-cultivation</b> medium, the use of vigorous and actively growing immature embryos and the removal of excess bacteria significantly improved the survival rate of sorghum embryos and was critical for successful transformation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to standardize a protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.). Embryogenic calli, produced from one-year-old mature seeds of buffel grass, were used as target cells for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A. tumefaciens strain LBA 4404, harbouring pCAMBIA- 1301 or pCAMBIA- 2301, was used for <b>co-cultivation</b> with embryogenic calli from three genotypes (IG- 3108, IG- 9757 and IG- 97101). Co-culturing of calli with Agrobacterium for 30 minutes, followed by <b>co-cultivation</b> with 0. 1 mM acetosyringone for 3 days was found to be optimum for maximum transformation efficiency. Presence of acetosyringone during <b>co-cultivation</b> was found to be necessary for transformation. Transient GUS (�-glucuronidase) gene expression was used to monitor T-DNA delivery into the target cells. Significant genotypic variations in response to transformation were observed among the tested genotypes. A very high frequency (63. 3 %) of GUS gene expression was obtained following Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into embryogenic calli. The standardized protocol would be useful for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of buffel grass with genes of agronomic importance...|$|E
40|$|Microalgae {{have gained}} {{increased}} attention as a viable, eco-friendly and alternative source of green bioenergy. To compete in the fuel market, saline microalgae cultivation for biofuel production {{would need to be}} economically sustainable and <b>co-cultivation</b> of saline microalgae using only saline water and recycled nutrient can potentially be the best solution to reduce the excessive use and prompt downsizing of natural resources like fresh water and fertilizers. This review provides a critical analysis on the selection of potential biofuel producing marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. Here we proposed a microalgae <b>co-cultivation</b> strategy from seawater salinity (35 ppt) to salt saturation (300 ppt) with biofuel as the main output. We focused that adaptation of a <b>co-cultivation</b> strategy could reduce 95 %, 74 % and 51 % of the overall nutrient waste compared to the monoculture of marine, halotolerant and halophilic microalgae. This paper also highlights a cultivation strategy using both mono and mixed culture over the period of increased saline condition and compares mass industrial-scale biofuel production from microalgae in three sites in Western Australia...|$|E

Transformed plants {{were obtained by}} <b>co-cultivation</b> of leaf disks with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 harbouring a binary vector pCAMBIA-CpGS that carried E. coli glutathione synthetase (GS), b-glucuronidase as reporter gene and nptII as selective marker gene for kanamycin resistance. Using a constitutive double CaMV 35 S promoter and an rbcS transit peptide, we successfully addressed CpGS to the chloroplasts through pJIT 117 vector.

30|$|A. aculeatus conidia {{was spread}} onto filter paper (hardened, low-ash grade 50; Whatman, Maidstone, UK) on IM {{containing}} 200 μM acetosyringone (AS). After <b>co-cultivation</b> for 24 - 72 h at 24 °C, the filter paper {{was transferred to}} the selection medium (SM; MM containing 100 μg/ml of hygromycin B and 100 μg/ml of cefotaxime). When <b>co-cultivation</b> was performed in liquid IM, A. tumefaciens was cultured to OD 660 = 0.4, harvested by centrifugation, and co-cultivated with 107 of A. aculeatus conidia in liquid IM containing 200 μM AS.

40|$|Due {{to their}} unique properties, {{self-supporting}} nano porous aluminum oxide (alumina) membranes are useful substrates for the indirect <b>co-cultivation</b> of cells. The membrane {{can act as}} a physical barrier between different cell types, whereas the cell-to-cell communication is guaranteed by the diffusion of soluble molecules or factors through the pores. With the help of such membranes the mRNA expression of hepatic genes can be induced in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) during an indirect <b>co-cultivation</b> with primary mouse hepatocytes under different culture conditions. This proof of concept shows that such a cultivation approach is beneficial for different issues in the field tissue engineering or cell therapy...|$|E
30|$|Hairy root {{induction}} in leaf explant was studied on {{the basis}} of percentage transformation frequency and results are given in Table  1 (Additional file 1 : Table S 3). It was found that changes in infection and <b>co-cultivation</b> periods affected the transformation frequency. Findings of this experiment reflect that when infected leaves were co-cultivated for 24  h, the transformation frequency increased with the increase of infection period up to 4  h for strain 532 and up to 3  h for strain 2364, further increment in infection period caused inhibition of transformation in both the strains. <b>Co-cultivation</b> period of 48  h along with 3  h infection period showed maximum transformation frequency (42.59  ±  0.92  %) after 27.66  ±  0.33  days of inoculation on semisolid MS medium containing cefotaxime (200  mg/l) in case of the strain 532. The strain 2364 showed maximum transformation frequency, (16.67  ±  0.01  %) after 35  ±  0.57  days, when 3  h infection period was used (Table  1). The strain 532 showed better and quick response in comparison to strain 2364. Infection period of 3  h and <b>co-cultivation</b> period of 48  h for leaf explant was found to be the best treatment which was able to show significant frequency of transformation. So 48  h <b>co-cultivation</b> period along with the strain 532 was used in other experiment. Uninfected leaves were not able to show any induction of hairy roots even after 60  days of transfer to semisolid MS medium containing cefotaxime (200  mg/l). Figure  1 b shows hairy root formation in leaf explant.|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} of indica rice is undoubtedly a challenging task {{due to the}} rice recalcitrant nature to transformation process. Therefore, optimization of the transformation protocol is important for specific indica rice cultivar to ensure effectiveness of the transformation. In this study, crucial parameters affecting Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were optimized to obtain transgenic rice of local rice cultivar (indica MR 219). Embryogenic calli were chosen for inoculation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 harbouring a binary vector pH 2 GW 7 -ABP 57 containing gene of interest, Auxin binding protein 57 (Abp 57). The parameters that have been optimized were the immersion time, <b>co-cultivation</b> period, acetosyringone concentration and <b>co-cultivation</b> temperature. A total of four days <b>co-cultivation</b> period and 30 min immersion of embryogenic callus are optimum for the {{transformation of}} MR 219 with transformation efficiency of 26. 4 % and 16. 0 %, respectively. Acetosyringone at 200 μM and <b>co-cultivation</b> at 28 °C also gave the highest transformation efficiency (14. 4 and 18. 4 %, respectively). Meanwhile, inclusion of 20 g/L maltose+ 20 g/L sorbitol into the regeneration media has significantly improve the transformed somatic embryos growth and increase the regeneration efficiency up to 40. 0 %. The results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that the transgene was successfully integrated and overexpressed in transgenic rice of MR 219. In conclusion, significant improvement in transformation efficiency for rice cv. MR 219 has been obtained by using the optimised protocol for transformation and regeneration developed in this study...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae were co-cultivated {{with each}} other and with Magnaporthe grisea or Phanerochaete chrysosporium, respectively. Enzyme assays for plant {{polysaccharide}} and lignin-degrading enzymes showed that <b>co-cultivation</b> can improve extracellular enzyme production. Highest β-glucosidase, α-cellobiohydrolase, β-galactosidase, and laccase activities were found for A. oryzae in combination with other fungi, in particular with P. chrysosporium. Highest β-xylosidase activity was obtained when A. niger was co-cultivated with P. chrysosporium. SDS-PAGE protein profiles demonstrated that A. niger and A. oryzae contributed most to the overall enzyme activities found in the culture medium of the mixed cultivations. These data demonstrate that <b>co-cultivation</b> of two major industrial fungi, A.  niger and A. oryzae, results in improved production of biotechnologically relevant enzymes...|$|E
