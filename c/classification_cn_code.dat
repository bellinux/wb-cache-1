For each transaction, we know the firm’s identification code, the product according to the 8 -digit Combined Nomenclature (<b>CN)</b> <b>classification</b> 2, the destination of the export transaction, the free-on-board (FOB) value in euros of the transaction, and the exported quantity (in weight metric and/or units). 3 Every year, new <b>CN</b> 8 <b>codes</b> {{are added to the}} <b>classification</b> and some <b>CN</b> <b>codes</b> are dropped. Since some sections of the paper compare data for different years, we use the Van Beveren et al.

Second, we study whether concentration also occurs in export flows, where a flow is defined as a particular 8 -digit product shipped to a particular destination. Finally, we analyze how sensitive concentration is to different product classifications.|$|R

40|$|Evidence broadly {{confirms}} that EU harmonization of food regulations {{can be considered}} as a trade-promoting and market-integrating instrument in the Single market. However, little is known on how these particular trade liberalization measured may impact total factor productivity (TFP). One of the general presumptions is that trade liberalization has a positive impact on productivity through the effect of competitive pressures to which domestic firms are exposed. For instance, as a result of lowering or removing regulatory barriers to trade, entry costs of foreign and domestic competitors decrease. This leads to more competitive pressures which have a downward effect on prices (and markups) and whereby a better reallocation of inputs are developed. Our contribution on this research is to test these predictions in one empirical framework. First, we lay out the empirical underpinnings on TFP measurement under markups and variable returns to scale. The estimation enables us to verify the cyclical behavior of the market structure and scale economies over time. Second, our empirical model (panel) disentangles the impact of harmonization of regulations on markups and markups on TFP. The analysis is carried out at the level of Dutch food processing firms for the period 1979 - 2005. We extend and built upon a new database on EU harmonization of regulations in the food industry.

Mutations of the ELANE gene (the symbol recently replacing ELA 2) are considered {{largely responsible for}} most cases of CN and SCN, but specific mutations are typically associated with one or the other. Procedure We performed ELANE genotyping on all individuals and paternal sperm in an SCN kindred with eight SCN progeny of a sperm donor and six different mothers. Results One patient with CN had the same S 97 L ELANE mutation as seven patients with the SCN phenotype. The mutant allele was detected in the donor's spermatozoa, representing 18 % of the ELANE gene pool, but not in DNA from his lymphocytes, neutrophils, or buccal mucosa, indicating gonadal mosaicism.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Validation of the {{prognostic}} indices for the recurrence-free {{interval of}} patients with parotid carcinoma, the development of which was described in a previous report, is needed to be confident of their generalizability and justified prospective use. METHODS: The Dutch Cooperative Group on Head and Neck Cancer database contains 231 patients with parotid carcinoma from six tertiary referral centers who were seen between 1985 - 1994. This database was used to validate the predictive value of the prognostic indices, PS 1 (pretreatment index predicting recurrence) and PS 2 (posttreatment index predicting recurrence), in patients with parotid carcinoma. Validation methods included calculation of both indices for each patient, comparison of coefficients, construction of survival curves using the published cutoff points, and calculation of concordance measure C. Wald tests for optimization of scale and weights of the contributing variables, and for possible score improvement by including other variables, were also performed. RESULTS: The 5 -year disease-free rate was 62 % (standard error = 4 %). PS 1 was calculated for 183 patients. The previously set cutoff points resulted in 5 -year disease-free rates that ranged from 92 % (PS 1 = 1) to 42 % for the least favorable group (PS 1 = 4). Concordance measure C was 0. 74. The postoperative score, PS 2, was calculated for 171 patients. Previous cutoff points resulted in 5 -year disease-free rates that ranged from 90 % (PS 2 = 1) to 40 % (PS 2 = 4). Concordance measure C was 0. 71. Both PS 1 and PS 2 did not improve using the findings in this independent material. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic indices performed adequately in this validation sample. This finding demonstrates that the prognosis of a parotid carcinoma patient can be quantified by using a weighted combination of the parameters of age, pain, clinical T (cT) <b>classification,</b> clinical N (<b>cN)</b> <b>classification,</b> skin invasion, facial nerve dysfunction, perineural growth, and involved surgical margins. A quantified prognosis, {{in terms of the}} recurrence-free interval, can be used to provide information to the patient, to perform clinical trials, and eventually to make clinical decisions.

40|$|Background: New {{research}} {{criteria for}} diagnosing Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) in the {{mild cognitive impairment}} stage (MCI-AD) incorporate biomarkers to assign a level of certainty to the diagnosis. Structural MRI is widely available but greatly under-utilized for assessing atrophy of structures affected in early AD, such as the hippocampus (HP), because the quantification of HP volumes (HP-v) requires special expertise, and normative values have not been established. Methods: Elderly subjects (n = 273) from the Florida ADRC were classified as having no cognitive impairment (cognitively normal, CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD. Volumes for the hippocampus (HP-v) were measured on structural MRI scans. A validated visual rating system for measuring medial temporal atrophy (VRS-MTA), including hippocampal, entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex atrophy was employed. The participants were subdivided into younger (less {{than or equal to}} 75 years of age) and older (greater than 75 years of age) subgroups. Results: Volumetric and VRS-MTA measures were equivalent in predicting <b>classification</b> of <b>CN</b> vs. aMCI for older (area under the receiver operator curves [aROC]: 0. 652 vs. 0. 723) and younger subjects (aROC: 0. 764 vs. 0. 736). However, for younger AD subjects, aROC values were significantly higher for VRS-MTA measures (0. 920) than for volumetric measures (0. 847). Relative to HP-v, VRS-MTA score was significantly more correlated to impairment on a range of memory tests and was more associated with progression of aMCI to AD than HP-v. Conclusion: Structural MRI with VRS-MTA assessment can serve as a biomarker for supporting the diagnosis of MCI-AD. Age-adjusted VRS-MTA scores are at least as effective as HP-v for distinguishing aMCI and AD from CN and for predicting progression from aMCI to AD. VRS-MTA is convenient for use in the clinic as well as for clinical trials and can readily be incorporated into a standardized radiological report...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{solution}} of nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) is frequently encountered in computational science and engineering. The applicability of most existing methods {{is limited by}} matrix structures, property of eigen-solutions, size of the problem, etc. This paper aims to break those limitations and to develop robust and universal NEP solvers for large-scale engineering applications. The novelty lies in two aspects. First, a rational interpolation approach (RIA) is proposed based on the Keldysh theorem for holomorphic matrix functions. Comparing with the existing contour integral approach (CIA), the RIA provides the possibility to select sampling points in more general regions and has advantages in improving accuracy and reducing computational cost. Second, a resolvent sampling scheme using the RIA is proposed for constructing reliable search spaces for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, based on which a robust eigen-solver, denoted by RSRR, is developed for solving general NEPs.

The thought behind these rules is to use formulae in the design of the sandwich panels instead of the more time consuming ﬁnite element method. The work in this thesis has involved ﬁnding the proper analytical formulae for buckling and bending of simply supported sandwich plates from relevant theory and comparing the results from these formulae with the ﬁnite element method. The formulae have been implemented in a Visual Basic-automated Excel spread-sheet which has been made available as a supporting tool for the classiﬁcation note. Another part of the thesis has been to develop a semi-analytical method, using a Rayleigh-Ritz approach, for more accurate buckling strength assessments. This model can be used for both simply supported and clamped plates and calculates eigenvalues for all combinations of in-plane normal and shear forces. It also can accurately account for pre-stresses in the buckling analyses. The results from the analyses are presented along with the underlying theory in this thesis. For the analytical models the results show a good agreement between the formulae and the ﬁnite element method for most cases, with the closed form formulae often being a bit conservative on the safe side. The results for the Rayleigh-Ritz model also show very good agreement with the ﬁnite element method. Some problems were encountered in the modelling procedures of sandwich plates in ABAQUS, especially with the solid element models. This can be the cause of some of the diﬀerence between the analytical and ﬁnite element models in the results...|$|R
40|$|A {{sleeping}} beauty in diffusion {{indicates that the}} information, can be ideas or innovations, will experience a hibernation before a sudden spike of popularity and it is widely found in citation history of scientific publications. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the {{sleeping beauty}} is an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion and even more inspiring, there exist two consecutive sleeping beauties in the entire lifetime of propagation, suggesting that the information, including scientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes, will go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attracts some attention, and then it falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity peak. Further explorations on this phenomenon show that intervals between two wake ups follow an exponential distribution and the second wake up generally reaches its peak at a higher velocity. In addition, higher volume of the first wake up will lead to even much higher popularity of the second wake up with great odds. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is presented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media. Our results can help understand the common mechanism behind propagation of different memes and are instructive to locate the tipping point in marketing or find innovative publications in science.

40|$|The excel tool was {{developed}} as an {{implementation of a}} commodity-based hazard identification protocol for biological hazards in plants and animals {{in the form of}} a decision support tree. The content of the decision tree is based on the results of a systematic review of pest and pathogen characteristics, a review of risk assessment schemes and on expert judgement. Application of the protocol results in an indication of the level of likelihood of entry of animal and plant pathogens/pests in the area of destination associated with the commodity/pathway, and it guides the decision regarding potential actions to be undertaken in the search for existing and emerging pathogens/pests. The excel tools contains three worksheets representing three levels. Level 0 concerns whether the commodity itself can turn into a pest, whether it can contain pests and pathogens, and whether it contains additional material that can be contaminated. The likelihood that a commodity contains pests and pathogens depends on the likelihood of pest association and survival before the commodity is transported to the country of destination, and the likelihood that the pest/pathogen will come into contact with local hosts in that country. In level 1, the likelihood of pest association and survival is elaborated and assessed for each pest/pathogen category, whereas in level 2 the likelihood that a biological hazard comes into contact with local host is assessed in greater detail. The tool includes an extension with a [commodity list derived from Combined Nomenclature (<b>CN)</b> <b>classification</b> with relevant characteristics, and a pathway model which enables the risk assessor to provide and structure the relevant information. The decision tree has been tested with six commodity case studies: three of plant origin and three of animal origin...|$|R
