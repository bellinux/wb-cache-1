At higher temperatures between 200 and 250 °C, on the other hand, two methanediol molecules form glycolic acid which has a new C-C bond.

Although recognized as an animal carcinogen, TCE’s carcinogenic potential in humans is still uncertain. We have carried out a cross-sectional study of 80 workers exposed to TCE and 96 unexposed controls matched on age and sex in Guangdong, China to study TCE’s early biologic effects. We previously reported that the total lymphocyte count {{and each of the}} major lymphocyte subsets (i. e., CD 4 + T cells, CD 8 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells) were decreased in TCE-exposed workers compared to controls, suggesting a selective effect on lymphoid progenitors and/or lymphocyte survival. To explore which T lymphocyte subsets are affected, we investigated the effect of TCE exposure on the numbers of CD 4 + na&# 239;ve and memory T cells, CD 8 + na&# 239;ve and memory T cells, and regulatory T cells by FACS analysis. Linear regression of each subset was used to test for differences between exposed workers and controls adjusting for potential confounders. We observed that CD 4 + and CD 8 + na&# 239;ve T cell counts were about 8 % (p = 0. 056) and 17 % (p = 0. 0002) lower, respectively, among exposed workers. CD 4 + effector memory T cell counts were decreased by about 20 % among TCE exposed workers compared to controls (p = 0. 001).

In this oxidation process, once an electric current is applied between the anode (an iron sheet) and the cathode (a graphite bar), a predetermined amount of Oxone® {{is added to the}} reactor and UV light is simultaneously irradiated. It was found that an acidic condition is favorable to the process and over 92 % removal of 0. 2. mM 2, 4, 5 -TCP in the pH range of 2. 5 - 4. 35 was rapidly obtained by the proposed EFOU process. Nevertheless, around 80 % of 2, 4, 5 -TCP was decayed at pH of 7. 70 in 20. min suggesting that the proposed EFOU process is efficient even at neutral pH. Experimental results show that applied current of 1. mA results in the best performance, while the process is slightly inhibited at higher currents due to excessive generation of ferrous ions. The investigation on the mode of current-application shows that the EFOU process can be further optimized by controlling a proper electrolytic duration to reach a balance of Fe(II) generation and energy consumption. Additionally, it is found that tandem addition of Oxone® could minimize the scavenging effect between the radicals (from the first dose) and fresh Oxone® (from the second dose) and improve the overall performance of EFOU. Furthermore, aromatic intermediates such as 2, 5 -dichlorohydroquinone, 4, 6 -dichlororesorcinol, 2, 4 -chlorophenol, and many others are identified by using LC-ESI/MS analysis, based on which a possible decay pathway of 2, 4, 5 -TCP by EFOU process is therefore proposed.

40|$|Bacteria and archaea {{have evolved}} {{the ability to}} respire using diverse {{compounds}} to produce energy. The use of alternative electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration is critical in environments where oxygen is limited or absent – such as soils of the Arctic Coastal Plain. Continuous permafrost below the active layer of soil restricts drainage, creating anoxic conditions. Thus, anaerobic respiration dominates all but the top few centimeters of soil. Climate change effects acutely impact the Arctic, {{and the potential for}} positive feedback from soil respiration is substantial. Biogeochemical cycling in this environment warrants further study, particularly concerning anaerobic electron acceptors which contribute to CO 2 fluxes and can compete with methanogenesis, further impacting greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this dissertation is to explore metabolism of unusual electron acceptors in Arctic tundra soils, focusing on the importance of humic substances, their interactions with iron, and the role of organohalide respiration in the Arctic carbon cycle. The research contained within unites microbiological techniques, soil chemistry methods, and innovative interdisciplinary tools to study these compounds from a variety of vantage points. Soil extract measurements, potentiometric redox titrations, and cyclic voltammetry revealed that metabolism involving humic acids in this environment may contribute nearly 400 moles of electrons per square meter of soil (e-/m 2), accounting for over 10 % of ecosystem respiration. Performing a field-based soil amendment experiment and laboratory incubations validated that reduction of large, insoluble humic acids can be facilitated by way of soluble iron intermediates, iron is an electron-accepting moiety in humic acids, and iron-reducing bacteria liberate complexed iron from the structure of humic acids. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> cycling in tundra soils was studied with field measurements, biological exploration using laboratory incubations and metagenomics, and chemical investigation using elegant tools including Oxidative Combustion Microcoulometry and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES).

40|$|International audienceIn Martinique, chlordecone, a {{synthetic}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> has mainly {{been used as}} an insecticide for banana farming up to 1993. The intrinsic characteristic of this contaminant makes it still quite abundant in soil, surface and groundwater. Since 2004 and {{the implementation of the}} Water Framework Directive the concentration of chlordecone in groundwater has been monitored regularly (two to four times / year) at different points of the island by the ODE (Office de l'Eau). Previous study (Gourcy et al. 2009, Arnaud et al. 2012) showed that variations of pesticides concentrations in groundwater are temporally strong and not always easy to correlate to climate, geological or hydrogeological context. The objective {{of the present study was}} to explore new investigation ways to identify, in a specific site and for high sampling frequency possible pathways of chlordecone into surface and ground-waters. A major sampling campaign was carried out in December 2011 including 12 surface and groundwater points located in Chalvet and Chez Lélène wells watersheds. Besides, monthly or weekly samples were taken at these two groundwater monitoring wells and the Falaise river up to August 2012. Major dissolved ions, δ 18 O, δ 2 H, chlordecone concentrations were determined for all samples. CFC- 11, CFC- 12, CFC- 113 and SF 6 analyses were performed for groundwater for apparent age estimation. Punctual or cumulative rainfalls were sampled at Chalvet (30 m NGM) and Aileron (800 m NGM) for stable isotopes determination. The isotope data are indicating a deuterium excess higher for surface water, groundwater and rainfall collected at high altitude vs. samples corresponding to lowest altitudes. This data can therefore be used to estimate the average altitude of recharge area of groundwater. This altitude of recharge, between 30 and 350 m corresponds to the altitude of banana growing; it is therefore in accordance with the presence of chlordecone in soils. This information is also giving necessary data for apparent age estimation using dissolved gases tracers (CFCs). Apparent age (or CFC and SF 6 concentrations) and δ 18 O and δ 2 H (and calculated d-excess) of groundwater are very stable with time even during intensive rainfall episodes and high water stage. Limited variability of chemistry and isotopes in surface water allow demonstrating that the Falaise River is highly sustained by groundwater. As a consequence, regarding chlordecone, the quality of surface water is governed by groundwater quality. Besides, during the dry season when the contribution of groundwater to the flow is the highest, chlordecone concentrations fluctuations are similar for both surface and ground-waters. During the period December 2011 - August 2012, chlordecone concentration varies from 0. 25 to 0. 45 µg/L at Chez Lélène borehole and 0. 02 to 0. 1 µg/L at Falaise River. In this area, groundwater contributes to the degradation of surface water qualit...|$|E
40|$|Triclosan is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> which, {{due to its}} {{antibacterial}} properties in vitro, has found widespread use {{in a variety of}} products such as textiles, plastics and healthcare products. Humans are directly and chronically exposed to triclosan via dermal and mucosal contact from soap and toothpaste, upon which triclosan is rapidly absorbed into the body. Owing to the hydroxyl group on triclosan and the quick phase II metabolism, the turnover of triclosan in the human body is relatively fast and the plasma half life is less than a day. Nevertheless, triclosan has been found in human blood plasma and milk. A cause for concern in this regard, is that in vitro and in vivo animal studies show that triclosan is able to exert adverse effects on hormone homeostasis and metabolic mechanisms, connected to a diverse array of possible toxicological endpoints. Before this work began, the information about the exposure to triclosan in humans was scarce. Furthermore, the methods for analyzing triclosan in human body fluids lacked sensitivity. There was a need to identify the main sources of triclosan in humans and to investigate the exposure to triclosan in different subgroups of human populations. Also, the fact that triclosan had been found in human plasma warranted further study to examine the transfer rate of triclosan from plasma to milk, and to elucidate if breast milk is a significant source of triclosan to infants. In addition, there was a clear need to study if the in vivo triclosan exposure in humans had an impact on cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 enzyme activity and/or thyroid hormone homeostasis. The scope of this thesis was to contribute to filling these knowledge gaps. Study I describes a sensitive and precise method for the analysis of triclosan in human body fluids, enabling the study of background levels of triclosan. Study II showed that triclosan was omnipresent in plasma and milk from Swedish nursing mothers, and that the level of exposure was highly correlated to the use of triclosan containing personal care products. The transfer rate of triclosan from plasma to milk was low, and the risk of adverse effects from triclosan exposure of the breastfed infant via the milk was judged to be negligible. The results from Study III showed that, apart from some small gender and age variations, the exposure was quite homogenous among serum pools of different genders, ages, regional cohorts and sampling years from the Australian population. Study IV showed that the in vivo exposure to triclosan via toothpaste in humans is not likely to change cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 enzyme activity and/or thyroid hormone homeostasis. While this work shows that there is widespread human exposure to triclosan {{as a result of the}} use of triclosan containing personal care products, more research is needed to assess potential negative effects thereof...|$|E

40|$|Triclosan (TCS) is a <b>chlorinated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> which, {{due to its}} {{antibacterial}} properties in vitro, has found widespread usages in many medical and consumer products such as textiles, plastics and personal care products. Humans are directly and chronically exposed to TCS via dermal and mucosal contact {{from the use of}} TCS-formulated products such as soap and toothpaste. TCS is classified as an environmental contaminant by the European Union Water Framework Directive, whose mandatory goal is to develop new and simple-to-use analytical methodologies capable of measuring low concentrations of TCS and that are suitable for high-throughput detection. Synthetically-derived single-stranded oligonucleotides, also known as aptamers, are superior candidates for the development of sensitive and high-throughput biosensing strategies. Biosensors utilising aptamers as molecular recognition elements have showed great promise in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications, especially for the detection of small molecular weight organic compounds such as TCS. The aim of this thesis was to develop aptamers as new capture reagents for TCS, as the first step towards the development of an alternative, user-friendly, diagnostic technique for monitoring TCS in both environmental and biological samples. The objectives of the thesis were to: [i] produce by in vitro selection procedures, TCS binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers; [ii] characterise the selected aptamers and determine their equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values and; [iii] evaluate the applicability of the selected aptamers in a biosensing platform. To achieve these objectives, ssDNA aptamers capable of binding TCS were generated in vitro using a sequential approach known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). An affinity column-based SELEX strategy together with a variety of SELEX modifications such as negative and counter selections, real-time amplification and fluorescence quantification were explored for finding TCS specific aptamers. A total of 20 TCS aptamers, ten from 8 rounds of a basic-SELEX procedure, and the other ten from 10 rounds of a revised-SELEX procedure were generated. In general, these aptamers showed acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity to TCS, and the best binding aptamer demonstrated a Kd value of 378 nM. The Kd value is comparable to published Kd values for compounds that share similar chemical structures to TCS. In addition, a novel fluorescent-based imaging method was developed in this dissertation. The method developed provides an alternative approach for monitoring SELEX progression and has the potential to simplify the way to characterise the binding properties of an aptamer to its cognate target. The utility of this method was compared with commonly used methods such as dot blot and fluorescent binding assays. The performance of the new imaging method was superior to the existing methods in terms of accuracy, simplicity and reproducibility. Furthermore, the best binding TCS aptamer was evaluated for its utility in an aptamer-based biosensor. The developed aptasensor, utilising a TCS aptamer as the recognition element and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the signal reporter, was capable of detecting TCS in spiked-water samples at concentrations ranging from 20 – 750 nM with a visual detection limit of 150 nM. In conclusion, methods were developed to select, refine, and characterise ssDNA aptamers capable of binding to TCS, and these aptamers have the potential to offer a sensitive, simple-to-use, and user-friendly analytical method for TCS detection...|$|E
