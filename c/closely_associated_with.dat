40|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} (HRV) causes {{upper respiratory}} infections and asthma exacerbations. We screened multiple orthologous RNAi reagents and identified host proteins that modulate HRV replication. Here, {{we show that}} RNASEK, a transmembrane protein, was needed for the replication of HRV, influenza A virus, and dengue virus. RNASEK localizes to the cell surface and endosomal pathway and <b>closely</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump. RNASEK is required for endocytosis, and its depletion produces enlarged clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at the cell surface. These enlarged CCPs contain endocytic cargo and are bound by the scissioning GTPase, DNM 2. Loss of RNASEK alters the localization of multiple V-ATPase subunits and lowers the levels of the ATP 6 AP 1 subunit. Together, our results show that RNASEK <b>closely</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> the V-ATPase and is required for its function; its loss prevents the early events of endocytosis and the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses...|$|R
