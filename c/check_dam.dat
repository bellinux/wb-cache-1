Additionally, we evaluated the effect of timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in reducing CO 2 emissions and their economic efficiency compared with non-timber <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> We found that switching from concrete to all-wood timber and hybrid timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> reduced CO 2 emissions by 54 and 43  %, respectively. Switching from steel to all-wood timber and hybrid timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> reduced CO 2 emissions by 28 and 11  %, respectively. In terms of direct installation costs, all-wood timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> were 241  % that of concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> and 179  % that of steel <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> but hybrid timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> were only 132 and 98  %, confirming {{that they could be}} competitive in terms of price. From the perspective of reducing CO 2 emissions costs, we found that a policy for switching from concrete to all-wood or hybrid timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> did not constitute a low-cost means of reducing CO 2 emissions, compared with other policies for reducing CO 2 emissions.|$|R

30|$|For {{comparison}} with other measures of reducing CO 2 emissions [24], the marginal abatement costs of switching from concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> to all-wood timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> would come to a similar amount to improvements to the urban automotive driving environment (the use of intelligent transport systems), for example. If (c) all-wood timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> without a front apron and only steel bars were used instead of steel <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> this would cost around the same amount as using gas turbine combined-cycle power generation. These costs are around 4 – 38 {{times greater than the}} marginal abatement cost of 15 thousand yen/t-CO 2 (54 thousand yen/t-C) for using thinnings or logging residues as an energy source to reduce CO 2 emissions (average emission factors for all power sources) [24], suggesting that switching from concrete or steel <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> to timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> would not constitute a cheap means of reducing CO 2 emissions compared to other methods for reducing CO 2 emissions. Further cost reduction measures, as well as political support such as subsidy systems, are required for the use of timber in <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
40|$|Slovenia {{has a lot}} of torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> {{but until}} now there was no uniform method one could apply in order to perform a review of the torrential check dams' {{condition}} and to assess their physical vulnerability. In 2013, we assessed the risk of torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> on Suhelj, Belca and Pišnica torrents by applying the risk assessment methodology for large dams. Since, for various reasons, the results were deemed useless, we decided to adjust the risk assessment model for torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> and establish a new methodology. Hence, the diploma thesis presents a new tailor-made method for the risk assessment of the torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> For the purpose of the uniformity of system, the risk assessment methodology for large dams served as a basis for the risk assessment of torrential check dams; this methodology was proven to be insufficient because torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> have their own specific characteristics. In the light of this, the methodology was adapted for the risk assessment of torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> Additionally, this diploma thesis gives the comparison between the two risk assessment models: the risk assessment methodology for large dams and the newly adapted risk assessment methodology for torrential check dams; both were applied on selected torrential tributaries of the Upper Sava River. The risk assessment methodology for torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> can serve as basis for one of the first preventive actions to be taken in order to perform a comprehensive review of the condition of torrential <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in Slovenia...|$|R

50|$|Many <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> tend to form stream pools. Under {{low-flow}} circumstances, water either infiltrates {{into the}} ground, evaporates, or seeps through {{or under the}} dam.

50|$|As a {{strategy}} to stabilize mountain streams, the construction of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> {{has a long tradition}} in many mountainous regions dating back to the 19th century in Europe. Because of the steep slopes in the mountain region, it may be difficult for large construction machinery to reach mountain streams; therefore, <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> have been implemented in place of large-scale dams. Because the typical high slope causes the flow velocity to move faster, a terraced system of multiple closely spaced <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> is typically necessary to reduce velocity and thereby counteract erosion. Such consolidation <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> built in terraces, attempt to prevent both headward and downward cutting into channel beds while also stabilizing adjacent hill slopes. They are further used to mitigate flood and debris flow hazards.|$|R

Disaster mitigation includes non-structural (hazard mapping, insurance policies), active structural (drainage systems) and passive structural (<b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> stilling basins) countermeasures. Since over twenty years, many efforts are devoted by the scientific and engineering communities {{to the design of}} proper devices able to capture the debris-flow volume and/or break down the energy. If considerable theoretical and numerical work has been performed on the size, the shape and structure of <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> allowing the definition of general design criteria, {{it is worth noting that}} less research has focused on the optimal location of these dams along the debris-flow pathway. In this paper, a methodological framework is proposed to evaluate the influence of the number and the location of the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> on the reduction of the debris-flow intensity (in term of flow thickness, flow velocity and volume). A debris-flow model is used to simulate the run-out of the debris flow. The model uses the Janbu force diagram to resolve the force equilibrium equations; a bingham fluid rheology is introduced and represents the resistance term. The model has been calibrated on two muddy debris-flow events that occurred in 1996 and 2003 at the Faucon watershed (South French Alps). Influence of the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> on the debris-flow intensity is quantified taking into account several <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> configurations (number and location) as input geometrical parameters. Results indicate that debris-flow intensity is decreasing with the distance between the source area and the first <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> The study demonstrates that a small number of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> located near the source area may decrease substantially the debris-flow intensity on the alluvial fans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Study was {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of watershed management programme on natural resource conservation in North – Western India. The watershed planning was based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and the technologies are being executed for development of watershed in participatory mode through watershed committee. Out of 682. 5 ha watershed area, about 460 ha has been treated with silt retention masonry <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> water storage <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> masonry spillways, masonry gully plugs, graded bunds with loose boulder waste weirs, leveling and small farm pond. A total of 538 ha cm surface runoff was harvested by constructing two small farm ponds on community land, and three small earthen and two masonry <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> on private waste lands to recharge ground water/drinking water otherwise going waste. It was observed that silt retention behind stone masonry <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in upper, middle and lower reaches of the watershed was 59. 6, 16. 7 and 9. 9 t/(ha yr) respectively and 618. 27, 23. 49 and 1, 775. 81 kg of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were arrested. It was found that soil moisture at 0 cm— 15 cm, 15 cm— 30 cm and 30 cm— 60 cm depth was 27. 66, 32. 23 and 38. 11 % higher respectively as compared to gullies without <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> Nearly 2. 65 ha gullied land was reclaimed for cultivation due to nine small <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> The average yield of mustard and chickpea in reclaimed gullies was 48. 82 and 58. 82 % higher respectively than normal yield of these crops in the region...|$|R
30|$|Direct {{construction}} costs {{in these three}} cases (values of (a), (b) and (c) in Fig.  8) were 88  % of current costs (values of actual condition) in case (a), 72  % in case (b), and 60  % in case (c). Compared with concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> however, the respective figures were 213  % in case (a), 173  % in case (b), and 144  % in case (c), showing that although they might be competitive with concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in terms of costs if these could be reduced {{to the level of}} case (c), further cost reductions or subsidies would be required to make them competitive in cases (a) and (b). To reduce the cost differential between their current structural forms and concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> may require cost-cutting by means such as either a major reduction in the amount of timber used, which accounts for the greater part of material cost, or by promoting the commercialization of an on-site production system that integrates all the stages from timber procurement through to material preparation, processing, and construction at the construction site [23]. Focusing on the price of timber, to keep the direct {{construction costs}} of all-wood timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in their present form down to around 1.5 times those for concrete <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> would require the price of timber (dressed on four sides) to fall to 42  % of its current level, and to 60  % of this level in case (a) and 78  % in case (b) above. The direct construction costs in the three cases described above were 158, 128, and 107  % of those for steel <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively. In case (c), the cost was very nearly equivalent to that for steel <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> and even cases (a) and (b) might possibly be cost-competitive. The CO 2 emissions for all-wood timber <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in these three cases were (a) 19.9 t-CO 2, (b) 16.0 t-CO 2, and (c) 14.7 t-CO 2, respectively. These results indicate cutting costs would also contribute to reducing CO 2 emissions at the same time.|$|R
40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>dams</b> are {{commonly}} used for soil conservation. In the Loess Plateau of China, <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> have been widely constructed as the principal means to retain floodwater and intercept soil sediments since the 1970 s. For instance, {{there are more than}} 6572 <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in the Yanhe watershed with an area of 7725 km 2 in the Loess Plateau. However, little research has been done to quantify the hydrological effects of the <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> In this research, the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was applied to simulate the runoff and sediment in the Yanhe watershed. We treated the 1950 s to 1960 s as the reference period since there were very few <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> during the period. The model was firstly calibrated and validated in the reference period. The calibrated model was then used in the later periods to simulate the hydrological effects of the <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> The results showed that the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> had a regulation effect on runoff and a retention effect on sediment. From 1984 to 1987, the runoff in rainy season (from May to October) decreased by 1. 54 m 3 s − 1 (14. 7 %) to 3. 13 m 3 s − 1 (25. 9 %) due to the check dams; while in dry season (from November to the following April), runoff increased by 1. 46 m 3 s − 1 (60. 5 %) to 1. 95 m 3 s − 1 (101. 2 %); the sediment in rainy season decreased by 2. 49 × 10 6 ton (34. 6 %) to 4. 35 × 10 6 ton (48. 0 %). From 2006 to 2008, the runoff in rainy season decreased by 0. 79 m 3 s − 1 (15. 5 %) to 1. 75 m 3 s − 1 (28. 9 %), and the runoff in dry season increased by 0. 51 m 3 s − 1 (20. 1 %) to 0. 97 m 3 s − 1 (46. 4 %); the sediment in rainy season decreased by 2. 03 × 10 6 ton (79. 4 %) to 3. 12 × 10 6 ton (85. 5 %). Construction of the large number of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in the Loess Plateau has enhanced the region's capacity to control the runoff and sediment. In the Yanhe watershed, the annual runoff was reduced by less than 14. 3 % due to the check dams; and the sediment in rainy season was blocked by up to 85. 5 %. Thus, <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> are effective measures for soil erosion control in the Loess Plateau...|$|R
