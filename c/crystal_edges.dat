The {{thermal stress}} {{field in the}} {{polysilicon}} was simulated and comparatively analyzed at different shapes of crucibes which have different types of a flat, a inverted-conical and concave bottom by COMSOL Multiphysics version 4. 3 a. The results indicated that: within the flat-bottomed crucible,the isotherm in the crystal was slightly convex and {{the area of the}} maximum thermal stress was distributed {{in the bottom of the}} <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> and near the top of crystal edge; within the inverted-cone crucible, the isotherm in the crystal was straight and the area of the maximum thermal stress was only distributed in the bottom of the crystal edge; within the bottom of the concave crucible, the isotherm in the crystal was slightly concave and the area of the maximum thermal stress distributed in the bottom of the <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> was larger than that of the crystal within the first two kinds of crucibles. To sum up, the inverted-cone crucibe was beneficial to reduce the thermal stress distribution in the polysilicon which could provide theoretical guidance for improving the production process of the polysilicon...|$|R

5000|$|Abnormal cooling rates {{occur in}} {{supercooled}} magmas, particularly komatiite lavas. Here, low nucleation rates due to superfluidity prevent nucleation until the liquid is {{well below the}} mineral growth curve. Growth then occurs at extreme rates, favoring slender, long crystals. Additionally, at crystal vertices and terminations, spikes and skeletal shapes may form because nucleation favors <b>crystal</b> <b>edges.</b> [...] or [...] texture {{is an example of}} this result.

50|$|A {{heterogeneous}} catalyst has active sites, {{which are}} the atoms or crystal faces where the reaction actually occurs. Depending on the mechanism, the active site may be either a planar exposed metal surface, a <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> with imperfect metal valence or a complicated combination of the two. Thus, not only most of the volume, but also most of {{the surface of a}} heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> dislocation on the metallic surface of a Topological Insulator. The edge dislocation gives rise to torsion which the electrons experience as a spin connection. As a result the electrons propagate along confined two dimensional regions and circular contours. Due to the edge dislocations the parity symmetry is violated resulting in a current measured by the in-plane component of the spin on the surface. The tunneling density of states for Burger vectors in the $y$ direction is maximal along the $x$ direction.

40|$|Large zeolite {{crystals}} of ferrierite {{have been}} used to study the deactivation, at the single particle level, of the alkyl isomerisation catalysis of oleic acid and elaidic acid by a combination of visible micro-spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy (both polarised wide-field and confocal modes). The large crystals did show the desired activity, albeit only traces of the isomerisation product were obtained and low conversions were achieved compared to commercial ferrierite powders. This limited activity is in line with their lower external non-basal surface area, supporting the hypothesis of pore mouth catalysis. Further evidence for the latter comes from visible micro-spectroscopy, which shows that the accumulation of aromatic species is limited to the <b>crystal</b> <b>edges,</b> while fluorescence microscopy strongly suggests the presence of polyenylic carbocations. Light polarisation associated with the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy reveals that these carbonaceous deposits are aligned only in the larger 10 -MR channels of ferrierite at all <b>crystal</b> <b>edges.</b> The reaction is hence further limited to these specific pore mouths...|$|E

The graphitization mechanism of needle coke is suggested {{as well as}} the Li + extraction―insertion behaviors. With the heat―treatment temperature increasing, the graphite―like crystal grows continuously attended with a complicated process, including the arrangement of crystal along radial/axial direction, dislocation dispersion among graphite layers, hexagonal carbon formation, <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> dispersion and folded graphite layer turning to plane. Meanwhile, the driving―forces are far different for different process. When needle coke is graphitized at 2800 ¡æ, it exhibits a lower charge/discharge potential and stable charge/discharge platform, and the insertion capacitance of Li + can maintain at 305 mAh/g even after charge/discharged for 40 cycles...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on the {{incorporation}} of trace elements into calcite were performed, and rare earth elements (REE) were used to mark the growth zones of individual crystals. Experiments were conducted at different pH (7. 7 to 8. 8) and temperatures (2 °C to 24. 6 °C) in NH 4 Cl + CaCl 2 solutions, where REE were rapidly consumed by growing calcite. LA-ICP-MS line-scans yielded the distribution of (REE/Ca) calcite within individual crystals {{in a manner consistent}} with the addition of REE into fluid. A sharp decrease of (REE/Ca) calcite toward the <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> suggests the fast depletion of (REE/Ca) fluid due to strong REE consumption by growing calcite.

40|$|Temperature {{changes during}} {{the growth of}} {{lamellar}} polymer crystals give rise to steps {{on the surface of}} the crystals. It has recently been suggested that these steps could provide important insights into the mechanism of polymer crystallization. In particular, a characterization of the profiles of these steps might reveal the fixed-point attractor that underlies a recently proposed crystallization mechanism. Here we examine this hypothesis by performing simulations of such temperature jumps using the Sadler-Gilmer model. We find that for this model the step profiles do reveal the fixed- point attractor. However, for temperature decreases they also reflect the rounding of the <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> that occurs in this model and for temperature increases they also reflect the fluctuations in the thickness present in the crystal.

40|$|Simulation of the CERN crystal-extraction {{experiments}} at the SPS [1], {{including the}} real crystal geometry and SPS parameters, {{as well as}} multiple turns and passes, has been performed. Two crystals with different geometry have been tried. We argue that {{in both cases the}} extraction experiment suffered from the <b>crystal</b> <b>edge</b> imperfection. For the experimental conditions reproduced, the efficiency of the first (”twisted”) crystal was found to be 12 – 18 % (peak) in the angular range of 140 – 260 µrad (FWHM), depending on the vertical beam position at the crystal location. For the second (”U–shaped”) crystal the peak efficiency was much the same, ∼ 19 %, while the angular scan FWHM reduced to 70 µrad. These results, as well as the beam profiles, are in agreement with measurements. Finally we suggest some ways to advance this experiment. ...|$|R

We assumed a pattern of site potential and staggered plaquette magnetic flux on the lattice so as to imitate the observed stripe charge ordering pattern. When the magnetic modulation is sufficiently large, the system becomes a Chern insulator, where Berry curvatures around two gapped Dirac cones have the same sign on each band, and one chiral edge state connects the conduction and valence bands at each <b>crystal</b> <b>edge.</b> The present model is an organic version of Haldane's model, which discussed the Chern insulator on the honeycomb lattice with second nearest neighbor couplings.

50|$|In FCC crystal, scaled {{velocity}} shows a main peak in distribution {{with relatively}} smooth curve, {{which is expected}} from theory except for some disagreement at low velocity. However, in BCC crystal, distribution of scaled velocity is broader and much more dispersed. The result also shows that scaled velocity in BCC is a lot slower than FCC, which is not predicted by mean field theory. A possible explanation this discrepancy is based on different moving speed of edge and screw dislocations in two type of crystals. In FCC crystals, two parts of dislocation move at same velocity, resulting in smooth averaged avalanches profile; whereas in BCC <b>crystals,</b> <b>edge</b> components move fast and escape rapidly, while screw parts propagate slowly, which drag the overall velocity. Based on this explanation, we will also expect a direction dependence of avalanche events in HCP crystals, which currently lack in experimental data.|$|R

Under certain conditions, the standard Young tableaux occur, and do so with weight 0. Standard Young tableaux also parametrize the vertices of dual equivalence graphs.

In particular, we put a dual equivalence graph structure on the 0 -weight space of certain crystal graphs, producing edges combinatorially from the <b>crystal</b> <b>edges.</b> The construction can be {{expressed in terms of}} the local characterizations given by Stembridge for crystal graphs and the author for dual equivalence graphs. 1...|$|E

Without further spatial symmetries, five of the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes allow for the existence of such second-order topological insulators in two and three dimensions. We show that reflection symmetry can be employed to systematically generate examples of second-order topological insulators and superconductors, although the topologically protected states at corners (in two dimensions) or at <b>crystal</b> <b>edges</b> (in three dimensions) continue to exist if reflection symmetry is broken.

40|$|Lithium {{intercalation}} into graphite is {{a critical}} process in energy storage technology. Studies of Li intercalation kinetics have proved challenging due to structural and phase complexity, and sample heterogeneity. Here we report direct time- and space-resolved, all-optical measurement of Li intercalation. We use a single crystal graphite electrode with lithographically defined disc geometry. All-optical, Raman and reflectance measurements distinguish the intrinsic intercalation process from side reactions, and provide new insight into the microscopic intercalation process. The recently proposed Cahn–Hilliard reaction (CHR) theory quantitatively captures the observed phase front spatial patterns and dynamics, using a two-layer free-energy model with novel, generalized Butler–Volmer kinetics.

The R 3292 has an active area 10. 0 cm in diameter (quoted). Utilization of the full active area of the photocathode is a goal that has been previously unrealized due to edge effects. Initial measurements with a 0. 75 cm thick CsI(Na) crystal indicate that the performance (position resolution linearity) starts to degrade as one reaches a radius of only 3. 5 cm, reducing the active area by 60 %.
