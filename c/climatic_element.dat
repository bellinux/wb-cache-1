The atmospheric circulation during the year is represented by modes of low-frequency circulation variability in sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 -hPa heights (Z 500) obtained by using statistical method "Principal component analysis". The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to describe the relationship between modes and <b>climatic</b> <b>elements.</b> Four circulation patterns in Z 500 over Euro-Atlantic sector influence climate in Europe all over the year: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern, the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, and two Eurasian patterns (EU 1, EU 2). There were found patterns in SLP that strongly correlate with modes of the Z 500 and influence surface climate similar way. Statistically important correlations of modes in Z 500 and SLP with maximum, minimum and mean temperature, precipitation amounts and occurrence of [...] ...|$|R

However, as pointed out in Section 1, there is no evidence for long-term increasing or decreasing rainfall, either for the Indian region as a whole or for meteorological subdivisions of the country. Thus, in the Indian context, it is more pertinent to analyze impacts of climatic variability rather than of climatic change...|$|E

Based on the error (RMSE) and correlation (R) of GCM outputs, the error-based GCM ranks were assigned on average over the indicators. Overall, the GCMs showed much better accuracy in representing mean climatology of temperature comparing to other elements whereas few GCM showed acceptable skills for precipitation.

This study attempts to model the weekly rainfall climatology of dry zone using Markov processes as the driving mechanism based on the 51 years of past data. The weekly occurrence of rainfall was modelled by two-state first and second order Markov chains while the amount of rainfall on a rainy week was approximated by taking random variates from the best fitted right skewed probability distribution out of Gamma, Weibull, Log-Normal and Exponential distributions. The parameters of the both models namely, elements of transition matrices, and scale and shape parameters of the desired distribution, were determined using weekly data. Both first and second Markov chains performed similarly in terms of modelling weekly rainfall occurrence and amount of rainfall if rain occurred.

The method itself decomposes the original series into so called intrincic mode functions (IMF), each being characterized by its own, intrinsic time scale. Sums of the low-frequency IMFs for the single element revealed pres-ent climatic fluctuations on the decade-to-century scale. It is confirmed that climatic fluctuations of every single element, particularly temperature and cloudiness, are the results of variations in the global atmospheric circulation above the whole Europe. Trend and long-term variations of Zagreb tempera-ture fits to globally observed increase of temperature but also to variations of zonal circulation index. Exchange of Hadley’s zonal and Rossby’s wave re-gime of the general atmospheric circulation {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th cen-tury is observed in the long-term variations of almost every element.
