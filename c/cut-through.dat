25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual <b>cut-through</b> of wire insulation, {{especially}} when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist <b>cut-through</b> due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow <b>cut-through</b> failures caused by creep.|$|E
25|$|A bicycle {{boulevard}} is a {{low speed}} street which has been optimized for bicycle traffic. Bicycle boulevards discourage <b>cut-through</b> motor vehicle traffic but allow local motor vehicle traffic. They are designed to give priority to cyclists as through-going traffic.|$|E
25|$|A key {{characteristic}} of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. <b>Cut-through</b> driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents. Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.|$|E
30|$|The {{test site}} was a 50 m length of gate road, {{close to the}} high wall of the mine. The testing took place between two side-roads {{branching}} off from the main roadway tunnel, known as <b>cut-throughs.</b> This was an ideal test location as <b>cut-throughs</b> are a common feature of all roadways in an underground coal mine. <b>Cut-throughs</b> are a very obvious feature for detection, and their locations are accurately surveyed, hence {{they can be used}} as correction points for any cumulative localisation errors. Roadway development for the test location was complete {{at the time of the}} trial, including all the typical mine site infrastructure such as air-lines, hydraulics, signage, and electrical distribution systems.|$|R
25|$|The road has rock <b>cut-throughs</b> {{as well as}} steep fills and has steep roadway grades, 6% to 7% in some areas.|$|R
30|$|Both {{of these}} {{features}} (the <b>cut-throughs</b> and the higher amplitude returns from the bolt-plates) are valuable aids for measuring the along-track distance.|$|R
25|$|A {{recent study}} in California {{examined}} {{the amount of}} child play that occurred {{on the streets of}} neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict <b>cut-through</b> driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{analysis}} of The Australian Election Study, a postal survey of 1,873 voters during the 2007 poll, found that although respondents respected Howard {{and thought he}} had won the 6-week election campaign, Howard was considered [...] "at odds with public opinion on <b>cut-through</b> issues", his opponent had achieved the highest [...] "likeability" [...] rating in the survey's 20-year history, and a majority had decided their voting intention before the election campaign.|$|E

[...] From its {{roundabout}} on the A25, less major roads provide a <b>cut-through</b> towards Walton-on-the-Hill, via the notoriously steep Pebble Hill, a route towards Sutton, London, the M25's Reigate Hill junction or Leatherhead and minor routes to the south connect southern villages, including Leigh, Surrey. [...] A-road intersections of the A25 are in Dorking (A24) and at the foot of Reigate Hill in Reigate (A217).|$|E
30|$|We have {{described}} a novel radar-based system for underground mine machine localisation. The approach avoids {{the need to}} install additional reference infrastructure by exploiting mining structures already present in the underground mining environment, such as bolt plates and <b>cut-throughs,</b> to generate feature-rich radar signal returns. Different probabilistic data processing techniques were explored {{in order to provide}} estimates of the equipment’s along-track and across-track position. These estimates were subsequently validated through the use of laser range scanners and found to be in close agreement. The success of these trials has spurred development of a modified system that is now ready for integration into an operational mine machine automation system. Work is ongoing to improve the classifier algorithm performance with the view to incorporating these results into an operational automation system.|$|R
50|$|Warning tactile {{indicators}} in New Zealand are mandatory at pedestrian cross-walks (also called pram ramps or kerb crossings in New Zealand), at {{the approaches}} to stairways, ramps, escalators and moving walkways, {{the approach to}} railway level crossings, bus hoarding areas, median <b>cut-throughs,</b> along {{the entire length of}} railway platform edges and before any abrupt changes in grade to the walking surface (1:8 change with a kerb height of more than 70mm). Warning tactile indicators in New Zealand need to be installed to the full width of the approach to the obstacle/hazard so as to minimise the risk of a vision-impaired person stepping over or through the pad and encountering the obstacle. In any event, the warning tactile indicator pad should be no less than 900mm wide, except where it is physically impossible.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} {{reviewed}} {{the variety of}} mine inertisation systems available in Australia and their technical specifications. Exercises which involved “evaluation or auditing ” of selected mines as {{to the ability to}} deliver inert gases generated from inertisation units to high priority underground fire locations have been undertaken in a number of mines. These exercises have been built around the use of the fire simulation computer program VENTGRAPH and modelling of fire scenarios in selected different mine layouts. A coding system has been developed from these audit exercises. Designs have been developed to allow delivery of high volumes of inert gases down mine bore holes. A section of the paper has examined considerations presented by the layouts of underground mines developed from surface extraction pits. Inertisation and dilution issues in mine openings create complex situations. Mains headings present a complex ventilation network with often numerous parallel headings, hundreds of <b>cut-throughs</b> and a variety of ventilation control devices. In these complex systems the additional interference from a fire means maintaining control of the movement of inert gas is more difficult than elsewhere in the mine. Some illustrations of these issues are given. Mine fires and heatings are recognised across the world as a major hazard issue. New approaches allowing improvement in understanding their use of inertisation techniques have been examined. The outcome of the project is that the mining industry is in an improved position in their understanding of mine fires, use of inertisation and the use of modern advances to preplan for the handling of possible emergency incidents...|$|R

50|$|An {{adaptive}} switch is {{a network}} switch designed {{to operate in}} <b>cut-through</b> mode (<b>cut-through</b> switching) normally but if a port's error rate jumps too high, the switch automatically reconfigures the port to run in store-and-forward mode. This optimizes the switch's performance by providing higher speed <b>cut-through</b> switching if error rates are low but higher throughput store and forward switching if error rates are high.|$|E

5000|$|This {{behaviour}} {{is quite}} similar to <b>cut-through</b> switching, commonly called [...] "virtual cut-through," [...] the major difference being that <b>cut-through</b> flow control allocates buffers and channel bandwidth on a packet level, while wormhole flow control does this on the flit level.|$|E

50|$|Pikeville, Kentucky was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} biggest Model Cities projects. The Pikeville <b>Cut-Through</b> is 1,300 feet (0.40 km) wide, 3,700 feet (1.1 km) long, and is 523 feet (0.159 km) deep. The project was completed in 1987 following 14 years of work at a cost of $77.6 million. The <b>cut-through</b> provides a path for a four-lane highway, a CSX railroad line, and the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, which snaked through the downtown area, to eliminate almost yearly flooding. The river bed then was reclaimed by depositing fill from the <b>cut-through</b> into the old riverbed, significantly increasing the available space for development within the city.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>cut-through</b> switching is {{a method}} for packet switching systems, wherein the switch starts forwarding a frame (or packet) before the whole frame has been received, normally {{as soon as the}} destination address is processed. Compared to store and forward, this technique reduces latency through the switch and relies on the destination devices for error handling. Pure <b>cut-through</b> switching is only possible when the speed of the outgoing interface is equal to or greater than the incoming interface speed.|$|E
