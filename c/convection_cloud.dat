For 20- 30 decades Fu has been doing research in the Amazon and across South America that demonstrates the importance of maintenance of the rainforest to sustain the rainfall rates of the Amazon. This research work is vital to the continuation of the Amazonian environment and many more environments.

50|$|The {{first step}} of {{forecasting}} and preparing for heat bursts is recognizing the events that come before heat bursts occur. Rain from a high <b>convection</b> <b>cloud</b> falls below cloud level and evaporates, cooling the air. Air parcels that are cooler than the surrounding environment fall. And lastly, temperature conversion mixed with a downdraft momentum continue downward until the air reaches the ground. The air parcels then become warmer than their environment. McPherson, Lane, Crawford, and McPherson Jr. researched the heat burst system at the Oklahoma Mesonet, {{which is owned by}} both the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. The purpose of their research was to discover any technological benefits and challenges in detecting heat bursts, document the time of day and year that heat bursts mostly occur, and to research the topography of where heat bursts mostly occur in Oklahoma.Scientists and meteorologists use archived data to manually study data that detected 390 potential heat burst days during a fifteen-year period. In studying the archived data, they observed that 58% of the potential days had dry-line passages, frontal passages or a temperature change. The temperature change was due to increase in solar radiation in the hours of the morning or a daytime precipitation weather system. By studying the archived data, the scientists' have the ability to determine the beginning, peak and end of heat burst conditions. The peak of heat burst conditions is the maximum observed temperature. The beginning of the heat burst occurrence is the time when the air temperature began to increase without decreasing until after the heat burst. The end of the heat burst is when the system ceased to affect the temperature and dew point of the area. In addition to researching the life cycle and characteristics of heat bursts, a group of scientists concluded that the topography of Oklahoma coincided with the change in atmospheric moisture between northwest and southeast Oklahoma. An increase in convection normally occurs over the United States High Plains during the late spring and summer. They also concluded that a higher increase in convection develops if a mid-tropospheric lifting mechanism interacts with an elevated moist layer.|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} section, we reviewed {{the spread of}} the low cloud feedback among different climate models. However, the limited size of the CMIP model ensemble does not necessarily cover the whole possible uncertainty range (Tebaldi and Knutti 2007; Collins et al. 2011). Parameterizations of model physics (e.g., <b>convection,</b> <b>cloud</b> microphysics, and turbulence) for reproducing realistic current climatology (Mauritsen et al. 2012) could lead to a biased estimate of the cloud feedback and ECS. Recently, uncertainty due to the behavior of physics schemes implemented in climate models has been addressed by single or multi-model frameworks. PPE is an effective approach to evaluate a sensitivity of cloud feedback and ECS to parameter settings in physics schemes (Murphy et al. 2004; Stainforth et al. 2005; Sanderson et al. 2010; Collins et al. 2011; Klocke et al. 2011).

We assessed {{the extent to}} which aspect and its relatedness to temperature affect plant species diversity, and the colonization and disappearance of species on alpine summits on a pan-European scale. Location: Mountain summits in Europe's alpine life zone. Methods: Vascular plant species and their percentage cover were recorded in permanent plots in each cardinal direction on 123 summits in 32 regions across Europe. For a subset from 17 regions, resurvey data and 6 -year soil temperature series were available. Differences in temperature sum and Shannon index as well as species richness, colonization and disappearance of species among cardinal directions were analysed using linear mixed-effects and generalised mixed-effects models, respectively. Results: Temperature sums were higher in east- and south-facing aspects than in the north-facing ones, while the west-facing ones were intermediate; differences were smallest in northern Europe. The patterns of temperature sums among aspects were consistent among years. In temperate regions, thermal differences were reflected by plant diversity, whereas this relationship was weaker or absent on Mediterranean and boreal mountains. Colonization of species was positively related to temperature on Mediterranean and temperate mountains, whereas disappearance of species was not related to temperature. Main conclusions: Thermal differences caused by solar radiation determine plant species diversity on temperate mountains. Advantages for plants on eastern slopes may result from the combined effects of a longer diurnal period of radiation due to <b>convection</b> <b>cloud</b> effects in the afternoon and the sheltered position against the prevailing westerly winds. In northern Europe, long summer days and low sun angles can even out differences among aspects. On Mediterranean summits, summer drought may limit species numbers on the warmer slopes.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{frequency and}} rainfall production of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) relative to smaller groups of convective clouds over the tropical oceans {{is not well}} known. Eighty days of shipboard radar data collected during the recent Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) were used to provide a detailed view of convection in the western Pacific warm pool, a region of global climatological significance. The {{aim of this study}} was to document the frequency of occurrence, rainfall production, and depth of convection observed during TOGA COARE within a simple and meaningful framework of convective horizontal organization. Organization was characterized in terms of the horizontal scale and morphology of convective systems. Precipitation events were defined based on whether they attained the length scale of an MCS, and on whether convection was organized into lines. About four-fifths of rainfall during COARE was associated with MCS-scale squall lines. These occurred in a variety of wind regimes but tended to be most common prior to low-level westerly wind maxima. Systems of isolated cells produced 12 % of all COARE rainfall and were observed during periods of both very weak and very strong low-level winds. These two modes occurred about equally as often, and together they accounted for about 90 % of observed <b>convection.</b> <b>Cloud</b> height populations associated with MCS organization were distinct from sub-MCS-scale cloud systems, with more rainfall from shallower clouds for sub-MCS convection. The distribution of total rainfall by cloud height for COARE was interpreted as a superposition of rainfall-cloud height distributions from each mode of organization.

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center, though its main area of <b>convection</b> and <b>clouds</b> extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|R
40|$|The Colorado State University (CSU) Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) is a {{new type}} of general {{circulation}} model (GCM) that replaces the conventional parameterizations of <b>convection,</b> <b>clouds,</b> and boundary layer with a cloud-resolving model (CRM) embedded into each grid column. The MMF has been used to perform a 19 -yr-long Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project–style simulation using the 1985 – 2004 sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice distributions as prescribed boundary conditions. Particular focus has been given to the simulation of the interannual and subseasonal variability. The annual mean climatology is generally well simulated. Prominent biases include excessive precipita-tion associated with the Indian and Asian monsoon seasons, precipitation deficits west of the Maritime Continent and over Amazonia, shortwave cloud effect biases west of the subtropical continents due to insufficient stratocumulus clouds, and longwave cloud effect biases due to overestimation of high cloud amounts, especially in the tropics. The geographical pattern of the seasonal cycle of precipitation is well reproduced, although the seasonal variance is considerably overestimated mostly because of the excessive monsoon precipitation mentioned above. The MMF does a good job of reproducing the interannual vari-ability in terms of the spatial structure and magnitude of major anomalies associated with El Niño–Souther...|$|R
3000|$|Yang et al. (2014) {{studied the}} {{dependence}} of a planet’s habitability on its rotation rate using two 3 D models, the CAM 3 and the CCSM 3. CAM 3 is a 3 D GCM standalone atmospheric circulation model, which calculates the atmospheric circulation and radiative transfer, {{as well as the}} small-scale vertical <b>convection,</b> <b>clouds</b> and precipitation. CCSM 3 is a 3 D GCM coupled ocean–atmosphere model. Its ocean component calculates the oceanic circulation using an ocean with uniform depth and albedo and no circulation. The CCSM 3 ’s atmospheric components are the CAM 3 or the CAM 4. They are able to simulate the marine stratus, layered, shallow convective and deep convective clouds as well as liquid and ice condensates. CAM 4 has a cloud scheme {{similar to that of the}} CAM 3 and an improved deep convection scheme. Both models are precursors of the model used in our paper. The study of Yang et al. (2014) focused on the troposphere of the simulated planets. They demonstrated that a slow rotating Earth-like planet (rotation speed = 1 rotation/ 243 days), located at a distance of 0.7 AU away from a Sun-like star, would be habitable. They also determined that an Earth-like planet rotating at a rate of 1 rotation/day required half the stellar flux compared to an Earth-like planet rotating at a rate of 1 rotation/ 243 days to maintain an Earth-like climate.|$|R
