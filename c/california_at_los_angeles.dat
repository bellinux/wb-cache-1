500|$|On September15,2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warren Campbell filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carey at the [...] 9th Circuit for {{copyright}} infringement, [...] "reverse passing off" [...] and false designation, claiming that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] borrowed heavily from a song they composed called [...] "One of Those Love Songs". It was recorded by the R group Xscape in 1998 for their album Traces of My Lipstick. The lawsuit claimed that Carey wrongfully gave the songwriting credits to Jam and Lewis. Swirsky and Campbell had sold the rights of the song to So So Def Recordings in 1998. [...] "I'm a fan of Mariah Carey; this is nothing personal against her. But I really do believe there's accountability, and it's very clear what happened here. I've never sued anybody before", Swirsky said. According to the district court, an expert witness (chair of the Musicology Department at the University of <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles)</b> determined that the songs shared a [...] "substantially similar chorus". The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B. The expert further remarked that [...] "the emphasis on musical notes" [...] on the two songs was the same, which [...] "contribute to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs." [...] He presented a series of visual transcriptions of his observations. The transcriptions contained details about the pitch sequence of both the songs' chorus, melody, and bassline.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Wenders]]' Paris, Texas?

The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films.

Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E
