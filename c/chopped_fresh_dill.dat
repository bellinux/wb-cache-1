40|$|AbstractThe dill variety ‘Superdukat’ {{stems and}} leaves {{grown in the}} test fields of the Latvia University of Agriculture were {{harvested}} in July 2010 and dried by eight microwave vacuum drying programmes at various vacuum, drum rotation speed and specific energy. Volatiles from <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> leaves and <b>fresh</b> and dried <b>dill</b> stems were isolated using solid phase micro extraction with DVB/Car/PDMS fibre and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main aroma compounds of dill leaves are α-phellandrene, dill ether and these results are comparable with those found in literature. In stems a lower concentration of α-phellandrene but {{a higher percentage of}} dill ether was detected. Used microwave vacuum drying programme showed the significant influence to the GC total and individual peak areas of aroma compounds. Deviation square sum was calculated to compare the percentage composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> and stems versus dried dill stems. The volatile compounds content in dried dill stems obtained using programme 4 is the most similar to the composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>dill</b> leaves and stems, whereas the least similar –dried using programme 3.
