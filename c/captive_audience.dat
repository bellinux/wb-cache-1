25|$|During {{the tenure}} of chair Paul Herzog, the NLRB {{nevertheless}} continued to issue a series of rulings which held that unions should be granted equal time whenever an employer held a <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meeting.

500|$|The writers {{originally}} conceived several premature joke game endings if {{the player}} performed certain actions, but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped. One of these joke endings {{was triggered by}} shooting a portal onto the moon's surface, after which the player's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song, {{but the idea of}} creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game's final ending. The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending, but this was not considered funny enough. In an early version of the script, Chell finds a lost [...] "tribe" [...] of turrets looking for their leader, a huge [...] "Animal King" [...] turret which can be seen in in-game videos of the retail product. As a reward, the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret, which would have followed Chell around the game without visible movement. The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline, in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts, such as a comic based on a pastiche of Garfield. The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human-like for testing purposes, but recognized that unlike the <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> of the single-player campaign, the two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over the story, and thus the story was condensed into very basic elements.|$|E

His {{maternal}} grandmother, Myrtle Glied (1886-1969), was a Vaudeville performer on the Orpheum Circuit.

Even though the young Buono enjoyed the polite applause of those <b>captive</b> <b>audiences,</b> he aspired to be a doctor. When he was sixteen, Father John Aherne, OSA, of St. Augustine High School in San Diego cast him as Papa Barrett in the play The Barretts of Wimpole Street.

25|$|However, {{joining the}} ANFC also {{stripped}} the VFA of the throw-pass, and therefore of the on-field distinctions which {{allowed it to}} compete with the VFL for fans; this, coupled with the increased mobility of suburban Melburnians – who, due to the increased affordability of cars and the lifting in 1950 of wartime travel restrictions, were no longer <b>captive</b> <b>audiences</b> for their local VFA teams – resulted in a significant downturn in most VFA clubs during the 1950s. On-field, the competition became dominated by the few clubs with strong community links such as Port Melbourne, Williamstown, Sandringham, Oakleigh and Moorabbin (who had joined the VFA alongside Box Hill in 1951); the gap between those clubs and the weaker clubs, many of whom were periodically forced to play as amateurs {{due to a lack of}} money, grew large and the popularity of the competition declined.|$|R
2500|$|Farmer {{publicly}} stated {{his opposition}} to the Bonwit Teller rulings during the confirmation process.

Farmer did not, however, find the employer's right to hold <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings absolute. [...] In Peerless Plywood Co. Farmer, Rodgers, and Peterson agreed that employers may not hold <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings within 24 hours of a union representation election.

2500|$|President Eisenhower's staff quickly {{selected}} Farmer as Herzog's replacement. Publicly, Farmer {{was portrayed}} as a political independent. He had few personal associations with management and his professional contacts were perceived as legal and contractual rather than ideological. But privately, Farmer was well known as a strong conservative, an avid proponent of states' rights, and an early and avid political backer of Eisenhower. By June 21, Farmer {{was reported to be}} Eisenhower's only choice as Herzog's replacement. However, Eisenhower also informed his cabinet that all agency appointments should be cleared with the Republican National Committee (RNC), which was known to be much more conservative on labor issues than the administration. The RNC {{went so far as to}} advocate that all Roosevelt and Truman administration appointees to the NLRB be fired, no matter how competent. Farmer's views of federal labor law were strongly conservative. Farmer thought the federal role in labor relations should be delegated to the states. [...] "...I favor as much decentralization as possible; and as much as possible should be done with the board's discretionary authority, which has some limits on it now, to cede to the states by agreement." [...] Farmer advocated wholesale re-examination of the major decision of the Herzog board, especially in those areas restricting employer freedom of speech, permitting bargaining during the contract, and giving unions preferential treatment in <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings. [...] Farmer was also a vigorous anti-communist, which further heightened his appeal as chairman. He believed that communists had infiltrated not only American labor unions but the staff of the NLRB itself (some at the highest levels of the Board), and that it was his duty to purge the NLRB of these individuals.|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of {{the primary}} aims for {{physical}} education is to provide young people with the necessary skills, knowledge and competence to chose and participate in health-related physical activity in their leisure-time. Physical education stands in an advantageous position for promoting the benefits of extra-mural physical activity as it addresses young, diverse, and <b>captive</b> <b>audiences</b> (Fox & Biddle, 1989). Importantly, it is through physical education that young people experience a variety of physical activities and it is these experiences that may determine involvement in leisure-time. Nevertheless, there is a relatively little research outlining how physical education teachers or physical education programmes can effectively orient young people towards regular leisure-time physical activity outside of school. In the present study we propose and evaluate a theory of social cognition, known as the trans-contextual model, to explain the psychological processes by which young peopl...|$|R

5000|$|Although moderators {{are trained}} to {{minimize}} imbalances in deliberations, in many deliberative forums there is little empirical data on how well they actually facilitate discussions. However, in the Deliberative Polls, evaluation questions about the moderators are always included and they invariably are evaluated by the participants as being balanced in their facilitation and as not imposing or suggesting their own views.Critics might say that careful moderation of discussions might create <b>captive</b> <b>audiences</b> [...] in which participants behave differently from {{what is likely to}} occur in real-world settings. However, the point is to create an environment in which people are effectively motivated to consider competing arguments and become informed. Democratic institutions always raise questions of institutional design. This democratic design is intended to produce a representation of informed and thoughtful opinion and that is likely to be different from the inattentive and sound bite driven public opinion found in ordinary life.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1953, Farmer {{wrote to}} Eisenhower to {{influence}} the choice of Styles' replacement. [...] The nominee {{was bound to be}} contentious because the individual would give the Republican Party its first opportunity to appoint a majority {{of the members of the}} Board. On November 23, he wrote to the President: [...] "It is readily apparent that the person appointed by you to fill the remaining Board vacancy will be in a position to determine in large measure the extent to which the policies of your administration will be effectuated by this agency." [...] Farmer understood that the next appointment to the Board would either give him room to roll back the Herzog Board's decisions or limit his movement and allow the passage of time to give additional weight and authority to those rulings. [...] By early November, the Associated Press reported, Farmer had undertaken an extensive review of the Herzog Board's decisions. Thus far, Farmer had managed to reverse only two decisions (after Murdock abstained several times): A decision which concluded it was an automatic ULP for an employer to question workers about their support for the union, and a ruling that unions could elect leaders who were under indictment for violating the Taft-Hartley Act's requirement that they sign an anticommunist oath. By December, with Murdock continuing to abstain, the Farmer-led Board reversed Bonwit Teller in Livingston Shirt Corp., 107 NLRB 400, (1953), and established a new rule in Peerless Plywood Co., 107 NLRB 427 (1953) (in which both employers and unions were barred from making <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> presentations 24 hours before an election, but the employer could make such speeches before this period without giving the union equal time). In Chicopee Manufacturing Corp., 107 NLRB 106 (1953), Farmer wrote an opinion in which the board established its [...] "prophecy doctrine": [...] Employers could [...] "predict" [...] that voting for the union might result in a plants moving or plant closures, so long as the employer did not actually threaten to do so (e.g., engage in coercive behavior). The Farmer Board also held that Section 8(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act should be applied to representation elections (overturning General Shoe), and that an employer assertion that it would appeal any union victory in the courts was not a per se ULP but a statement of legal rights.|$|E
60|$|The tale of {{our summer}} amusements would be sadly {{incomplete}} without some {{record of the}} bull-fights given by the Spanish prisoners of war on the neighboring island, where they were confined {{the year of the}} war. Admission to these could be had only by favor of the officers in charge, and even among the Elite of the colony those who went were a more elect few. Still, the day I went, there were some fifty or seventy-five spectators, who arrived by trolley near the island, and walked to the stockade which confined the captives. A real bull-fight, I believe, is always given on Sunday, and Puritan prejudice yielded to usage even {{in the case of a}} burlesque bull-fight; at any rate, it was on a Sunday that we crouched in an irregular semicircle on a rising ground within the prison pale, and faced the <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> in another semicircle, across a little alley for the entrances and exits of the performers. The president of the bull-fight was first brought to the place of honor in a hand-cart, and then came the banderilleros, the picadores, and the espada, wonderfully effective and correct in white muslin and colored tissue-paper. Much may be done in personal decoration with advertising placards; and the lofty mural crown of the president urged the public on both sides to Use Plug Cut. The picador's pasteboard horse was attached to his middle, fore and aft, and looked quite the sort of hapless jade which is ordinarily sacrificed to the bulls. The toro himself was composed of two prisoners, whose horizontal backs were covered with a brown blanket; and his feet, sometimes bare and sometimes shod with india-rubber boots, were of the human pattern. Practicable horns, of a somewhat too yielding substance, branched from a front of pasteboard, and a cloth tail, apt to come off in the charge, swung from his rear. I have never seen a genuine corrida, but a lady present, who had, told me that this was conducted with all the right circumstance; and it is certain that the performers entered into their parts with the artistic gust of their race. The picador sustained some terrific falls, and in his quality of horse had to be taken out repeatedly and sewed up; the banderilleros tormented and eluded the toro with table-covers, one red and two drab, till the espada took him from them, and with due ceremony, after a speech to the president, drove his blade home to the bull's heart. I stayed to see three bulls killed; the last was uncommonly fierce, and when his hindquarters came off or out, his forequarters charged joyously among the aficionados on the prisoners' side, and made havoc in their thickly packed ranks. The espada who killed this bull was showered with cigars and cigarettes from our side.|$|E

50|$|Marketing {{experts are}} often {{interested}} in narrowcast media {{as a commercial}} advertising tool, since access to such content implies exposure to a specific and clearly defined prospective consumer audience. The theory being that, by identifying particular demographics viewing such programmes, advertisers can better target their markets. Pre-recorded television programmes are often broadcast to <b>captive</b> <b>audiences</b> in taxi cabs, buses, elevators and queues (such as at branches of the Post Office in the United Kingdom). For instance, the Cabvision network in London's black cabs shows limited pre-recorded television programmes interspersed with targeted advertising to taxicab passengers. Television has made a transition from broadcasting to narrowcasting which has given advertisers a greater advantage {{when it comes to}} directing their messages to a specific demographic audience. For example, if an energy drink company wanted to target 18- to 25-year-old action sport athletes, they may purchase commercial time on a niche network that only narrowcasts mixed martial arts, thus making their message more valuable by marketing to a concentrated audience.|$|R

While some scenes were implicitly critical, of course, the Theatre Group at no time produced openly political cabaret or directly attacked the Nazi regime. To do so would have violated the most fundamental condition for the troupe's and its members' survival, as life in Westerbork was dominated by the persistent threat of deportation on the next transport to an unknown but deeply feared fate in the East. So, standing helplessly and unaided before the fascists' executioners and their lackeys, the Theatre Group, of necessity, limited itself to entertaining its audiences and to momentarily distracting them from the surrounding horrors.
