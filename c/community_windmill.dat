50|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century the area started {{undergoing}} gentrification which has increased house prices in the area. Windmill Hill remains a creative and <b>community</b> driven neighbourhood. <b>Windmill</b> Hill's <b>Community</b> Centre was opened in the 1970s in the former church hall of St Michael and All Angels church.|$|R
50|$|On November 11, 1838, Birge, von Schoultz {{and roughly}} four hundred other Hunters left {{the shores of}} New York and {{proceeded}} down the St. Lawrence River to put their attack plan into motion. Von Schoultz was placed {{in charge of a}} schooner called the Charlotte of Toronto, the only original vessel that would reach the Upper Canadian shore. On November 12, von Schoultz and his crew of about one hundred and fifty men landed three kilometers east of Prescott and worked to construct fortifications in the hamlet of Newport. When the men reached one of the main structures in <b>community,</b> the <b>windmill,</b> they elected von Schoultz as their leader. He helped arrange a solid defence which held up against the British forces for nearly five days, but on November 16, von Schoultz and his men surrendered to the British.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{plans were}} drawn {{up for a}} new school {{building}} due to the school buildings no longer being fit for purpose {{and the need to}} consolidate council properties. Plans were also made for a replacement school to be built in its place which would cater to the rising population in south east Kirkcaldy. Forming part of <b>Windmill</b> <b>Community</b> Campus the school, which remains Viewforth High School, began construction in 2015 and brought together Viewforth High School, Rosslyn School, a local library and local office creating Fife's first community campus. It opened in 2016 and proudly builds on Viewforth's historic past and values.|$|R
50|$|Hille is a {{significant}} contributor to the Westfalian Mill Road in the so-called Mill(Muehlen) Kreis Minden-Lübbecke. Five examples of the Dutch type windmill are standing in the <b>community.</b> The <b>windmill</b> in Hartum has been gutted and converted to a vacation home. The windmills in Hille and Nordhemmern are functional, {{they are used to}} accommodate meetings of associations and groups. The windmill in Eickhorst is known as the Stork Mill and is operated by a group that conducts an open house every 3rd or 4th Saturday during the season. Eickhorst also has a water mill with a functioning water wheel. The related building was converted to a home. The windmill in Südhemmern has been built as a complete mill complex with the millers house and a community center. The mill cannot be operated presently since a miller is lacking. The Mindener Boat Excursion Line (Schifffahrtgesellschaft) offers a combination ticket to the Südhemmern windmill by boat on the Mittlelandkanal from Minden, with a return by the Museum Train (Museumseisenbahn)operating on the Mindener Kreisbahnen track.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the food webs of two, shallow-water benthic <b>communities</b> from the <b>Windmill</b> Island and Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were analysed to establish baseline descriptions of community structure and function. Both food webs shared similar features, {{and there were}} clear energy pathways to first order-consumers, yet higher-order consumers displayed considerable trophic diversity, resulting in complex food webs characterised by many trophic links. A review of the global literature for isotope marine food webs was conducted and revealed that: food chain length was similar across all habitats, food webs were negatively correlated with oceanographic primary productivity and positively correlated with δ 15 N values of the top consumer. I consequently hypothesise that shallow-water benthic communities share similar food web features throughout Antarctica...|$|R
2500|$|Broadhalfpenny Down {{continued}} in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781. At {{the end of}} that season, the Hambledon Club moved to Windmill Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was [...] "one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw". A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, for fairs and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the <b>community</b> and <b>Windmill</b> to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the [...] "raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)". The move was done {{at the behest of the}} Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.|$|R
50|$|A {{settlement}} called Shepetivka, {{belonging to}} the prince Ivan Zaslavsky, was first mentioned in a written document in 1594. In the 16th century Shepetivka didn’t differ from other settlements of Polesie. The settlement had a <b>community</b> and a <b>windmill.</b> It was given Magdeburg Rights {{at the end of}} the 16th century. This contributed the settlement’s expansion and growing population. At the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries the peasantry was intensively enslaved. Population of Shepetivka also suffered from frequent attacks of the Crimean Tatars. Peasants and craftsmen responded to the feudal oppression with the revolt in 1591-1593, led by Krzysztof Kosiński, and the revolt in 1594-1596, led by Severyn Nalyvaiko. When during the Ukrainian war of liberation from Poland in July 1648 peasant-Cossack regiments of Maxym Kryvonis had conquered Polonne, the inhabitants of Shepetivka joined the troops.At the end of the 17th century Shepetivka became property of Lubomirski family, and in 1703, of the Sanguszko family. And {{at the end of the}} 18th century it became part of Iziaslav county, Volhynian Governorate. In 1866 Shepetivka became the capital of the county.|$|R
50|$|The Bourne Windmill {{was built}} in 1911 by Commodore Frederick G Bourne, {{designed}} by noted architect Alfred Hopkins. It {{was part of the}} Bourne Dairy Farm, the Windmill Works were built by the Andrew J Corcoran Company, which supplied water for the dairy, farm, farmhouse, fountains and fire hydrants. The Windmill tower stood approximately one hundred feet high, topped by the windmill twenty five feet in diameter. The tower was an octagonal design, constructed of reinforced concrete pillars with terracotta block between, and stucco on the exterior. The upper portion of the tower housed a large metal water tank, and the lower portion was used as a silo. The Windmill was noteworthy in its height and construction, and artistic design, incorporating terracotta Rams Heads {{at the top of the}} tower. The farm buildings fell into disrepair and were damaged by vandalism, and were demolished around 1975. The property was developed as a residential <b>community</b> and the <b>windmill</b> was retrofitted with faux Dutch style windmill blades, replacing the original American Farm design which was in disrepair. The Windmill was demolished in 2004-2005 after engineering reports estimated the cost to maintain the structure would be too expensive..|$|R
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{of carbon}} and nitrogen {{were used to}} determine the different carbon pathways and trophic assemblages amongst coastal benthic fauna of the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica. Macroalgae, pelagic POM, sediment POM and sea ice POM had well-separated δ 13 C signatures, which ranged from − 36. 75 ‰ for the red alga Phyllophora antarctica, to − 10. 35 ‰ for sea ice POM. Consumers were also well separated by δ 13 C, ranging from − 21. 42 ‰ for the holothurian Staurocucumis sp. up to − 7. 47 ‰ for the urchin Sterechinus neumayeri. Analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N revealed distinct groups for suspension feeders, grazer/herbivores and deposit feeders, whilst predators and predator/scavengers showed less grouping. Consumers spanned a δ 15 N range of 8. 71 ‰, equivalent to four trophic levels, although δ 15 N ratios amongst consumers were continuous, rather than grouped into discrete trophic levels. The study has built a trophic model for the Windmill Islands and summarises three main carbon pathways utilised by the benthos: (1) pelagic POM; (2) macroalgae/epiphytic/benthic diatoms and (3) sediment POM/benthic diatoms. The movement of carbon within the coastal benthic <b>community</b> of the <b>Windmill</b> Islands is considered complex, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were valuable tools in determining specific feeding guilds and in tracing carbon flow, particularly amongst lower-order consumers...|$|R
