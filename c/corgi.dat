5|$|There {{have been}} no anthologies drawn solely {{from the pages of}} Science Fantasy, but Weird Shadows From Beyond, edited by John Carnell, and {{published}} by <b>Corgi</b> Books in 1965, drew eight of its ten stories from the magazine.|$|E
5|$|Tidd {{imported}} Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding {{lines in}} 1935, registering {{him with the}} AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, {{he became the first}} <b>Corgi</b> to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories. The Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> club was formed in 1937, and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge's Gilralda Farms in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> had become the 37th most popular breed of dog in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The <b>Corgi</b> breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, {{continued}} {{the connection between}} royalty and the King Charles Spaniel, attending Princess Anne's tenth birthday party with her dog Rolly in 1960. Elizabeth II has also owned King Charles Spaniels {{in addition to the}} dogs most frequently associated with her, the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} date for Corgis {{appearing in the}} show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh <b>Corgi</b> Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis {{began to appear in}} conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them. The Welsh <b>Corgi</b> appeared at Crufts {{for the first time in}} 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} the film led {{to a number of}} promotional {{licensed}} tie-in items, including a toy Aston Martin DB5 car from <b>Corgi</b> Toys which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. The promotion also included an image of gold-painted Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson on the cover of Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the <b>Corgi</b> breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the <b>Corgi</b> breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} version, {{designed}} by EA UK, was released 25 June 2007. Lego produced just one set, {{a model of}} Hogwarts, the lowest amount of sets for a film so far. NECA produced a series of action figures, while a larger array of smaller figures was also produced by PopCo Entertainment, a <b>Corgi</b> International company.|$|E
5|$|Fewer colours of coat {{appear in}} the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each {{of which can be}} with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would be {{considered}} to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.|$|E
5|$|Queen Elizabeth II {{has long}} been {{associated}} with corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), purchased the Pembroke <b>Corgi</b> Rozavel Golden Eagle, from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie.|$|E
5|$|She is {{patron of}} over 600 organisations and charities. Her main leisure {{interests}} include equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis. Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first <b>corgi</b> owned by her family. Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; {{she and her}} family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do the washing up afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh <b>Corgi</b> {{was listed}} in the Kennel Club's first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list is for those breeds which {{register}} less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, {{with a total of}} 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> was also added, as there had been only 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this on the importation of foreign dog breeds, The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline on the ban on tail docking introduced six years before. However, 2015 saw an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Action Button Entertainment is a {{video game}} {{development}} studio consisting of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski that has produced five games: Ziggurat (2012), TNNS (2013), Ten by Eight (2013), Tuffy the <b>Corgi</b> (2014), and Videoball (2016). The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds {{that he could not}} complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection he had with Rogers from producing a mockup of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corgi</b> International Limited made 5-inch {{action figures}} and gadgets (such as a {{voice-activated}} briefcase), {{as well as}} its traditional die-cast toy vehicles. It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.|$|E
5|$|Corgis {{have also}} {{appeared}} on screen, stage and in novels. Corgis as characters {{were incorporated into}} the storybook fantasies Corgiville Fair, The Great Corgiville Kidnapping, and Corgiville Christmas of American author and illustrator Tasha Tudor. In 1961, a <b>Corgi</b> was featured in the Walt Disney film Little Dog Lost, which led {{to an increase in}} popularity for the breed within the United States. A theatrical adaptation took place of Welsh author Roald Dahl's The BFG which toured the UK in 1991 required several different Corgis to perform on stage as those of Queen Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh <b>Corgi</b> to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Princess Elizabeth {{was then}} given a Pembroke <b>Corgi</b> of her own, named Susan, for her 18th {{birthday}} in 1944. She {{had a strong}} connection to the dog, which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs which were either pure-bred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis.|$|E
5|$|The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was {{published}} in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition {{was published}} by <b>Corgi,</b> an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's popularity increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and later Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd, which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's agent. Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a greater}} number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed {{standard}} allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of <b>Corgi,</b> and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.|$|E
5|$|Because Lazenby had {{informed}} the producers that On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was to be}} his only outing as Bond {{and because of the}} lack of gadgets used by Bond in the film, few items of merchandise were produced for the film, apart from the soundtrack album and a film edition of the book. Those that were produced included a number of <b>Corgi</b> Toys, including Tracey's Cougar, Campbell's Volkswagen and two versions of the bobsleigh—one with the 007 logo and one with the Piz Gloria logo. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was nominated for only one award: George Lazenby was nominated in the New Star of the Year – Actor category at the 1970 Golden Globe Award ceremony, losing out to Jon Voight.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 {{the first}} Welsh Corgis {{were brought to}} the United States by American breeder Mrs Lewis Roesler, for her Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had {{previously}} been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke bitch, Little Madam, at London's Paddington Station for £12. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several <b>Corgi</b> kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh <b>Corgi</b> {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh <b>Corgi</b> {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh <b>corgi.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh <b>Corgi</b> is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E

The Batmobile with Batboat were also produced under the Matchbox and <b>Corgi</b> names in the UK, during this period.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the writing}} {{was on the}} wall, Dinky's offerings in the 1970s covered the entire {{spectrum}} of vehicles, both real and fictitious. Besides the normal gamut of passenger, sports and racing cars, buses, farm, emergency and military vehicles – cars, aeroplanes and spacecraft were also offered from popular (mostly British) TV shows of the time like Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, UFO, Thunderbirds, the Pink Panther, The Secret Service, and Joe 90 (Dinky Toys 1974). It could be argued, though, {{that it was too}} little too late, as <b>Corgi</b> Toys had already been offering for several years vehicles from far more well-known shows and movies in the United States like Batman, The Saint, Daktari, James Bond, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Dinky's seemingly weaker standing made it all the more susceptible to Mattel's unstoppable Hot Wheels onslaught. At least the <b>Corgi</b> name still survives as a well-known collectible brand.|$|E
25|$|Dinky Toys was {{the brand}} name for {{die-cast}} Mazak zinc alloy miniature vehicles produced by Meccano Ltd.
