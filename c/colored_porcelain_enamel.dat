50|$|Industrial <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> (also {{known as}} glass lining, glass-lined steel, or glass fused to steel) {{is the use}} of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> (also known as {{vitreous}} enamel) for industrial, rather than artistic, applications. <b>Porcelain</b> <b>enamel,</b> a thin layer of ceramic or glass applied to a substrate of metal, is used to protect surfaces from chemical attack and physical damage, modify the structural characteristics of the substrate, and improve the appearance of the product.|$|R
50|$|<b>Porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> is {{also used}} architecturally as a coating for wall panels. It may be used {{externally}} to provide weather resistance and desirable appearance, or internally to provide wear resistance; for example, on escalator side panels and tunnel walls. In recent years, agricultural silos have also been constructed with <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelled</b> steel plates to protect the interior from corrosion and the exterior from weathering; this may indicate a future trend of coating all outdoor mild steel products in a weather-resistant <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel.</b>|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristic of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel,</b> from an industrial perspective, is its resistance to corrosion. Mild steel {{is used in}} almost every industry and a huge array of products; <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> is a very economic way of protecting this, and other chemically vulnerable materials, from corrosion. It can also produce very smooth, glossy finishes in {{a wide array of}} colours; these colours will not fade on exposure to UV light, as paint will. Being a fired ceramic, <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> is also highly heat-resistant; this allows it to be used in high-temperature applications where an organic anti-corrosion coating or galvanization may be impractical or even dangerous (see Metal fume fever).|$|R
50|$|A bathtub, bath, or tub (informal) is a {{large or}} small {{container}} for holding water {{in which a person}} or animal may bathe.

A bathtub is usually placed in a bathroom either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower.|$|R

50|$|<b>Porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> {{has been}} applied to jewelry metals such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity for the {{purposes}} of decoration. It was not until the Industrial Revolution that ferrous metals first became the subject of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelling</b> processes; these first attempts were met with limited success. A reliably successful technique was not developed until the middle of the 19th century, with the development of a method for enamelling cast-iron cooking pots in Germany. It was not long before this method of enamelling became outdated with the development of new ferrous substrates, and most modern research into <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelling</b> is concerned with creating an acceptable bond between enamels and new metal substrates.|$|R

50|$|The {{ability to}} apply <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to sheet steels was not {{developed}} until 1900, {{with the discovery}} that making {{minor changes to the}} composition of the enamel, such as including cobalt oxides as minor components, could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels. Concurrent with this development was the first use of wet-slurry enamel application; this allowed <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to be applied to much more complex shapes by dipping the shape into the liquid enamel slurry.|$|R

40|$|<b>Porcelain</b> <b>enamelled</b> steel {{with various}} pretreatments was {{produced}} by a standard practice for evaluation of adherence using both conductivity measurement and periodic cracking method. From the test results, {{it was found that}} the adherence of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to steel treated with cobalt is higher than that treated with nickel and without transition metal. The difference in the adherence can be explained from an examination of the microstructure of enamel/steel interfaces by scanning electron microscopy. Good adherence is associated with those that have high density of anchor points at the enamel/steel interface. This suggests that the adherence of the <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> to steel is controlled by a mechanism of mechanical interlocking. In addition, a plot of the adherence index versus average shear stress shows a sigmoidal curve, within which the failure mode of the enamel changes from cohesive to adhesive at a critical load.
