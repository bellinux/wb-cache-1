50|$|The {{behavior}} of badgers differs by family, but all shelter underground, living in burrows called setts, {{which may be}} very extensive. Some are solitary, moving from home to home, while others are known to form clans called <b>cetes.</b> Cete size is variable from two to 15.|$|E

Peri locates the TARDIS manual and presents it to the Doctor who dismisses it, as he knows perfectly well that transitional elements within the TARDIS have stopped producing orbital energy only Zeiton-7 ore can realign the power systems. But as the Doctor explains, Zeiton-7 is exceptionally rare and only comes from one planet in the <b>Cetes</b> constellation: Varos.|$|E

50|$|During 1915-1917 the deportations in the Pontus had {{involved}} slaughter, rape, brutality, and robbery {{that reached}} far beyond any justification, military or otherwise. Only {{a small number}} of the victims might have been involved in any anti-Turkish resistance activity. Moreover, notorious bands of <b>cetes</b> (organized brigands), especially those led by Topal Osman had been engaged in continuous shooting, plunder and rape of defenseless Greek villagers in the Pontus region. As a result of this campaign of genocide the Christian population of Samsun, the most important port on the south coast of the Black Sea, was dramatically affected: the Armenian community that originally numbered 5,000 members was reduced to only 1,000 inhabitants, while the 15,000 ethnic Greeks were reduced to 10,000 at the end of World War I.|$|E

5000|$|Niyazi Bey, {{a senior}} captain (Kolağası), raided the {{military}} depot in Resne and with two hundred men, including the town's mayor Hoca Cemal Efendi, escaped {{into the surrounding}} mountains from where he issued a proclamation calling {{for the restoration of}} the 1876 Constitution. At roughly the same time, Major Ismail Enver Bey, a member of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), retreated into the mountains near Resne. Other officers followed both men's examples and took to the hills to form their own <b>Çetes.</b> Because their actions carried the appearance of having sparked the Revolution, Niyazi and Enver, one Albanian and the other a Turk (Enver Bey's mother was Albanian), later gained popular acclaim as the [...] "heroes of freedom" [...] (hürriyet kahramanları). Of the two officers, Niyazi focused on mobilizing the Albanian community for the revolutionary cause.|$|E
30|$|SIZE {{presents}} {{some negative}} and significant coefficients, that is, larger banks attract fewer long-term deposits. LOAN presents positive and statistical significant coefficients, that is, loan growth positively influence {{the shift from}} short- to long-term deposits. EXPOSURE has negative and significant coefficients, note that usually the interbank deposits are short term, and they affect negatively on retail long-term deposits. <b>CETES</b> presents positive and significant coefficients, that is, higher <b>CETES</b> rates favor long-term deposits.|$|E
30|$|The control {{variables}} show some interesting results. SIZE presents negative and significant coefficients; consequently larger banks pay {{lower interest rates}} on deposits (in favor of the implicit “too-big-to-fail” policy). LOAN presents some positive and significant coefficients, that is, there is a demand effect determining interest rates on deposits, as proposed by Ben-David et al. (2013). EXPOSURE enters with positive signs and significance; therefore, a higher exposure to the interbank deposit market corresponds to a higher interest rate on deposits. <b>CETES</b> presents positive signs and significance, predictably, because of the natural relationship between IIRDE and <b>CETES</b> (see Fig.  1). The time dummies show some positive and significant coefficients, surprisingly, because IIRDE shows a negative trend {{during the period of}} analysis (see Fig.  2 in the appendix). Probably, <b>CETES</b> is catching up with this trend.|$|E

In this research the statistic developed by Ait-Sahalia (1996 a) has been applied to the Mexican <b>CETES</b> (28 days) interest rate in the period 1998 - 2006. With this technique, the discrete approximation to the continuous model is unnecessary even when the data are discrete.

30|$|The bank size enters in the {{regressions}} {{with some}} significant and negative coefficients, that is, larger banks attract fewer deposits (they show lower deposit growth rates). LOAN enters with positive and significant coefficients, that is, higher loan growth rates positively influence deposit growth rates. EXPOSURE presents negative and significant coefficients, because the interbank deposits are substitutes of retail deposits. <b>CETES</b> has some positive and significant coefficients, that is, higher {{prices of the}} Mexican obligations favor the growth of deposits, the <b>CETES</b> rate and the interest rate on deposits present a direct relationship.

Buscando seguir uma perspectiva etnográfica, ocorre uma imersão do pesquisador no grupo que faz parte do projeto “Piá Basqueteiro”. Iniciando pelos espaços periféricos à quadra, procura identificar quem os ocupa, como os ocupa e qual a sua relação com o basquete. Em seguida, procura entender como o basquete se insere na vida desses sujeitos através da observação de eventos fora do <b>CETE</b> onde esses sujeitos estiveram reunidos: um churrasco; um torneio amistoso e jogos pelo campeonato gaúcho. Para finalizar há um retorno ao <b>CETE,</b> porém, agora, com o olhar dirigido à quadra e ao jogo que pode ser melhor compreendido quando já se tem um pouco de conhecimento sobre as questões que o cercam: imagem social, autonomia, saúde, rendimento e participação.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} Mexican Treasury {{securities}} primary auctions applying the structural econometric model proposed by Février, Préget, and Visser (2002). The model {{is based on}} the share auction proposed by Wilson (1979) and estimates the parameters that characterize the distribution function of the securities ’ marginal value and the conditional distribution of the signals given the securities ’ value, respectively. These estimated parameters are used to derive optimal bids and equilibrium prices of alternative auction mechanisms and compare revenues yielded through each one. Our analysis of the primary auctions of the Certificados de la Tesorería de la Federación (<b>CETES)</b> carried out during the period between January 2001 and April 2002 shows the revenue superiority of the uniform format. Comparisons with previous reduced form analysis about the <b>CETES</b> and the French treasury securities, as well as simulation exercises with noisier value signals suggest that this result {{can be explained by the}} winner’s curse usually associated with market uncertainty.

40|$|Using a vector error {{correction}} model I test whether shocks in the funding liquidity {{conditions in the}} U.

(2) A stable long-run equilibrium relation emerges when I include the effects of funding liquidity shocks stemming from the U. S. and Europe. (3) The exchange rate forward premium adjusts towards a long-run equilibrium relation given by the CIP. (4) Surprisingly, the yield on 1 -month Mexican <b>CETEs</b> has its own stochastic trend despite the strong relation between the U. S. and Mexico's economies.
