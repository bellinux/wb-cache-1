50|$|The {{cost of the}} war to the United States was <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> the US Congress to be $61.1 billion. About $52 {{billion of}} that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion <b>by</b> <b>Germany</b> and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions). About 25% of Saudi Arabia's {{contribution}} was paid {{in the form of}} in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation. US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the abdominal visceral fat area (VFA), we developed novel ultrasonographic (US) methods for estimating. Methods. 100 male volunteers were recruited, and their VFA was <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> two novel US methods, the triangle method and the ellipse method. The VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> these methods was {{compared with the}} VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> CT. Results. Both the VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> the triangle method (r= 0. 766, p< 0. 001) and the ellipse method (r= 0. 781, p< 0. 001) showed a high correlation coefficient with the VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> CT. Also, the VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> our novel methods were significantly increased in subjects {{with one or more}} metabolic risk factors than in those without any risk factors. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients obtained using the two methods were enhanced by the addition of multiple regression analysis (with the triangle method, r= 0. 8586, p< 0. 001; with the ellipse method, r= 0. 8642, p< 0. 001). Conclusions. The VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> the triangle or ellipse method showed a high correlation coefficient with the VFA <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> CT. These US methods are easy to use, they involve no radiation exposure, and the measurements can be conducted frequently. We hope that our simple methods would be widely adopted for the evaluation of VFA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn May 2003, the United States, Canada and Argentina {{launched}} a World Trade Organization (WTO) {{case against the}} European Union concerning its authorization regime for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The complainants challenged three types of measures: (i) an alleged general moratorium on the approval of GMOs; (ii) delays in the processing of product-specific applications; (iii) national safeguard measures adopted by certain Member States banning the marketing of certain genetically modified products. In November 2006, the WTO condemned the European regime. Using the most recent advances in gravity equation, we estimate the reduction in exports of potentially affected products from the complainants to the European Union. Export losses are <b>calculated</b> <b>by</b> product, complainant country and measure at stake.
