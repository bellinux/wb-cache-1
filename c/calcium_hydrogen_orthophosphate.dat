The potential of kafirin as a tablet matrix for pharmaceutical applications was studied. Tablets composed of kafirin, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> caffeine and magnesium stearate were prepared by direct compression. The tablets showed appropriate levels of hardness and friability. Drug release studies showed that caffeine dissolution was greater in 0. 1 M HCl than in either phosphate buffer (pH = 6. 8) or distilled water. Deamidation of the protein in acid conditions might explain this observation. FTIR analysis showed that the secondary structure of kafirin {{was found to be}} mainly governed by a helices with some ß sheets. Upon tabletting, there was a change in protein conformation, which was recovered upon dissolution irrespective of the dissolution media. This might be explained by the loss of protein coil to coil interaction during tabletting (possibly due to the diluting effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate).</b> This was later recovered when tablets were dissolved due to the hydrophobic interactions between the kafirin proteins. In summary, this work has shown that kafirin has a potential for use as a tablet for drug delivery...|$|E

The sodium nitrate {{is a highly}} water soluble white solid, used in high blood pressure, dentinal hypersensitivity, and production of fertilizers. The present study was aimed to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on spectral properties of disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> and sodium nitrate. The study was performed in two groups i. e., control and treatment of each compound. The treatment groups were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. The spectral properties of control and treated groups of both compounds were studied using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. FT-IR spectrum of biofield treated disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> showed the shifting in wavenumber of vibrational peaks (with respect to control) corresponding to O-H stretching from 2975 to 3357 cm- 1, PO-H symmetrical stretching from 2359 to 2350 cm- 1, O=P-OH deformation from 1717 - 1796 cm- 1 to 1701 - 1735 cm- 1, P=O asymmetric stretching from 1356 to 1260 cm- 1 and P=O symmetric stretching from 1159 to 1132 cm- 1, etc. Likewise, the FT-IR spectrum of sodium nitrate exhibited the shifting of vibrational frequency of N=O stretching from 1788 to 1648 cm- 1 and NO 3 asymmetric and symmetric stretchings from 1369 to 1381 cm- 1 and 1340 to 1267 cm- 1. UV spectrum of treated disodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> revealed a negative absorbance; it {{may be due to}} decrease in UV absorbance as compared to control. UV spectrum of control sodium nitrate exhibited two absorbance maxima (λmax) at 239. 4 nm and 341. 4 nm, which were altered to one absorbance maxima (λmax) at 209. 2 nm after biofield treatment.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has examined the}} use of zein proteins from maize as the major component in oral controlled-release tablets, such formulations often being required to improve patient compliance. Tablets containing ground zein proteins, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> polyvinyl pyrrolidone, theophylline and magnesium stearate were produced by wet granulation and compression on a single station tablet press and were compared to directly compressed tablets based on zein proteins, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> and theophylline. Non invasive techniques such as Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy were employed to investigate any changes in the secondary structure of zein proteins during tablet production. Random coils, a helices and ß sheets predominated and their relative content remained unaffected during grinding, wet granulation and compression, indicating that formulations based on zeins will be robust, i. e. insensitive to minor changes in the production conditions. Drug release from the tablets was studied using a standard pharmacopoeial dissolution test. Dissolution profiles in water, 0. 1 M HCl (pH = 1) and phosphate buffer (pH = 6. 8) show that only {{a limited amount of}} theophylline was released after 4. 5 h, suggesting that zein proteins could act as a potential vehicle for oral controlled drug release. Analysis of the theophylline release profiles using the Peppas and Sahlin model reveals that diffusion and polymer relaxation occurred in acidic (pH = 1) and buffered (pH = 6. 8) conditions for wet granulated tablets, whereas diffusion was predominant in directly compressed tablets. In conclusion, the present study has shown that zeins can be successfully used as a pharmaceutical excipient, and in particular as a matrix in monolithic controlled release tablets...|$|E

Results: All specimens except those in pH 3 medium gained weight for the first 2 - 5 weeks after which weight was lost until all specimens weighed less than at the commencement of the study.

40|$|SUMMARY Despite {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} control the spread of malaria, this infectious disease is still a major global health problem as chemotherapy of malaria parasites is limited by established drug resistance and lack of novel affordable treatment options. To combat malaria, identification and characterization of essential genes are needed. Although the calcium metabolism {{is very important in}} the life of P. falciparum, {{little is known about the}} genes which regulate the transport of calcium. With the release of the P. falciparum genome, a putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter has been identified. To understand the role of this gene in the calcium metabolism of P. falciparum and to evaluate it as a drug target, we describe here the functional characterization by the heterologuous expression of this putative <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter in Xenopus oocytes and in a S. cerevisiae strain which is deficient for the yeast vacuolar <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter VCX 1. The putative 441 -residue protein, which we designate PfCHA, is predicted to contain 11 membrane-spanning segments and is related to the calcium exchanger family. Expression of pfcha in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a higher and pHdependent uptake of pfcha expressing oocytes, in comparison with control oocytes. External pH estimation showed that the calcium uptake was coupled to extrusion of protons out of the oocytes. In other experiments, we found that PfCHA has an antiport activity which is linear with time, unidirectional and electrogenic. Moreover PfCHA was inhibitable by La 3 +, a calcium transporter competitor, and was moderately inhibited by a sodium calcium exchanger inhibitor KB-R 7943. This inhibitor showed also a moderate inhibition on parasite growth in culture. In contrast to the Xenopus oocytes, expression of pfcha in yeasts mutants defective in the Ca 2 + transport resulted in a weakly complementat ion of the calcium tolerance. Our subcellular experiments suggested that PfCHA was localized to the yeast vacuole. These results confirm that PfCHA is a <b>calcium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> antiporter and we speculate that PfCHA could be a potential drug target. Further studies are needed to localize it in the parasite and to evaluate it as a drug target...|$|R

The current study is based on HAp was synthesized using sol-gel method. The drug was loaded in presence of gelatin with pure HAp. Precursors like calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and diammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> were used and ammonia solution was added to maintain the pH value at 10. 5 throughout the reaction. The synthesized HAp and drug loaded HAp with gelatin were characterized using PXRD, FTIR, SEM, Drug loading, drug release studies. Results show that the average crystallite size for prepared HAp and drug loaded HAp with polymer are ~ 30 to 300 nm respectively was calculated using PXRD and morphology of pure HAp and drug loaded HAp with polymer was found using SEM. Drug loading and release percentage was calculated. Keeping the above points {{in the present study}} was aimed to produce the biocompatibility and bioactivity of HAp...|$|R
