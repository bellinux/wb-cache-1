For this purpose, test samples have been generated from <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> and weld material according to the ASTM standard. The creep behavior and properties have been examined for these materials by conducting uniaxial creep tests. Constant temperatures and constant load uni-axial creep tests {{have been carried out}} at two high temperatures, 680 and 720 o C, subjected to constant loads, which produce initial stresses ranging from 240 to 360 MPa. The experimental data have been used to obtain the creep constitutive parameters using numerical optimization techniques...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{previously}} published papers by the authors, the specific heat energy loss per cycle (the Q parameter) {{was used to}} rationalize about 120 experimental results generated from constant amplitude, push-pull, stress- or strain-controlled fatigue tests on plain and notched hot rolled AISI 304 L stainless steel specimens {{as well as from}} <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> un-notched <b>bars</b> of the same steel, tested under fully-reversed axial or torsional fatigue loadings. It has been shown that Q can be estimated starting from the cooling gradient measured at the critical point immediately after the fatigue test has been stopped. Concerning notched specimens, it was noted that a 3 mm notch tip radius was close to the limitation of applicability of the adopted temperature sensor, consisting in 0. 127 -mm-diameter thermocouples, because of the 1. 5 -to- 2 mm diameter spot of the glue which prevented to measure the maximum temperature level. In this paper, the fatigue-damage-index effectiveness of Q parameter was investigated, carrying out fully reversed axial fatigue tests on 4 -mm-thick AISI 304 L specimens, having 3, 1 and 0. 5 mm notch tip radii. The cooling gradients were measured by using an infrared camera, characterized by a 20 μm/pixels spatial resolution. As a result, all new fatigue data could be rationalized using the same scatter band published previously by the authors...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} melt {{spinning}} and <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> parameters on {{the formation of}} β-phase crystallinity in Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) (PVDF) fibres, and ways of increasing such crystallinity, were studied. Fibres were melt-spun using four different melt draw ratios, and subsequently cold-drawn at different draw ratios. The maximum <b>draw</b> ratio in <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> was dependent on the draw ratio used in the melt spinning. The crystalline structure of the fibres was studied mainly by DSC and XRD.

By <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> α-phase crystallites could be transformed into the β-phase. It was established that, at certain conditions of melt spinning and <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> PVDF fibres containing up to 80 % of mainly β form crystallinity can be prepared. It is further proposed that fibres spun at a sufficiently high melt draw ratio consist to a large extent of extended-chain crystals, and this greatly affects the melting point of the PVDF. Thus DSC melting point data were shown to be insufficient to determine the crystalline phase of PVDF...|$|R

Forming of magnesium alloys into high-precision thin-wall tubes has however presented a technological barrier in the fabrication of vascular stents, because of the poor workability of magnesium at room temperature. In the present study, the forming processes, i. e., hot indirect extrusion and multi-pass <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> were used to fabricate seamless microtubes of a magnesium alloy.

The structure of the three-phase morphology of the {{linear low density polyethylene}} monofilaments was investigated by combining these measurements. It was found that the most important structure variation was found in the intermediate or rigid amorphous phase, whereby the amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases were nearly constant and almost independent of the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio. The intermediate third phase contains gauche and trans molecules and the amount of trans molecules was increased with the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio and was directly related to this 2 <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Progressive <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> in {{eutectoid}} steels {{produces a}} preferential {{orientation of the}} pearlitic micorstructure in the wire axis or drawing direction. This affects the posterior behaviour of the steels under environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) conditions. The experimental results show that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> induces strength anisotropy in the steel, and thus the resistance to EAC is a directional property {{that depends on the}} angle in relation to the drawing direction. Therefore, an initial transverse crack changes its propagation direction to approach that of the wire axis, thus producing mixed mode propagation, the deflection angle being an increasing function of the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> degree. This experimental result may be explained by micro-mechanical considerations {{on the basis of the}} lamellar microstructure of the steels. A relationship is established between the microstructural angles and the deflection angles of the macroscopic crack in EAC, thus providing a materials science type relationship between the microstructure and the macroscopic crack paths...|$|R
