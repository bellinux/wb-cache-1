40|$|AbstractThe shock {{response}} and spall strength of Kovar®, an alloy of Fe- 29 Ni- 17 Co, are obtained using a single stage powder gun to achieve pressures between 6 and 55 GPa by performing symmetric, planar impact tests. Above ~ 6. 5 GPa, the behavior shifts from a dispersive, continuous pressure {{rise to a}} shock, and it is shown that the material displays anomalous behavior at low pressures. Above 6. 5 GPa, the Hugoniot is described by a linear relationship between shock and particle velocity of US= 2. 06 UP+ 3. 54 km/s. The spall strength, an engineering description of the spall phenomenon, was calculated and shown to increase from 3. 6 - 7. 4 GPa as stress increases from 6 - 55 GPa, and it is shown that the method of spall strength computation has a large effect. From previous studies on the iron-nickel system, the authors expected to observe evidence of an α → E phase transition in the material but did not. Upon examining the shock and metallurgical literature, high concentrations of Ni and Co will have competing effects on the phase transition, but the effect of Ni will likely dominate and decrease the phase transition pressure. Further experiments on the high alloy Fe-Ni-Co system are needed to understand Kovar's <b>complex</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> mechanical behavior...|$|E

On October 15, the eastern chunk of moisture began exiting the Northeastern United States, while the main system continued to move northwestward in the Gulf of Alaska, weakening into a 988 mbar storm. On October 17, the main low stalled just south of Alaska, while steadily weakening, even as the eastern chunk of moisture began a well-defined extratropical cyclone off the coast of Nova Scotia. On October 18, the storm system moved to the south of Alaska, and absorbed a weak low to the south of the system, while the former eastern chunk of the system began to accelerate northeastward into the Labrador Sea, and received the name Yannick from the Free University of Berlin. On October 19, the central low of the storm system stalled just south of Alaska once again, and rapidly weakened to a disorganized 1010 mbar system.

Early the next day PAGASA {{reported that}} the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area had intensified into a tropical depression and named it as Domeng. During that day Domeng interacted with another <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area which was located {{to the north of}} the system, before merging with it early on August 4. After Domeng, had merged with the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> area PAGASA reported that Domeng had intensified into a tropical storm and reached its 10-minute peak sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Later that day PAGASA reported that Domeng had weakened into a tropical depression, before reporting early the next day that after it had passed through the Babuyan Islands, Domeng had weakened into an area of <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
