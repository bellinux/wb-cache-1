There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|E

60|$|It {{is strange}} that any one, {{after such a}} warning, should rely implicitly on the {{evidence}} a priori of such propositions as these, that matter can not think; that space, or extension, is infinite; that nothing can be made out of nothing (ex nihilo nihil fit). Whether these propositions are true {{or not this is}} not the place to determine, nor even whether the questions are soluble by the human faculties. But such doctrines are no more self-evident truths, than the ancient maxim that a thing can not act where it is not, which probably is not now believed by any educated person in Europe.(236) Matter can not think; why? because we can not conceive thought to be annexed to any arrangement of material particles. Space is infinite, because having never known any part of it which had not other parts beyond it, we can not conceive an absolute termination. Ex nihilo nihil fit, because having never known any physical product without a pre-existing physical material, we can not, or think we <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> <b>imagine</b> a creation out of nothing. But these things may in themselves be as conceivable as gravitation without an intervening medium, which Newton thought too great an absurdity for any person of a competent faculty of philosophical thinking to admit: and even supposing them not conceivable, this, for aught we know, may be merely one of the limitations of our very limited minds, and not in nature at all.|$|E

60|$|But {{according}} to Mr. Spencer {{there are other}} beliefs, relating to other things than our own subjective feelings, for which {{we have the same}} guarantee—which are, in a similar manner, invariable and necessary. With regard to these other beliefs, they can not be necessary, since they do not always exist. There have been, and are, many persons who do not believe the reality of an external world, still less the reality of extension and figure as the forms of that external world; who do not believe that space and time have an existence independent of the mind—nor any other of Mr. Spencer’s objective intuitions. The negations of these alleged invariable beliefs are not unbelievable, for they are believed. It may be maintained, without obvious error, that we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> tangible objects as mere states of our own and other people’s consciousness; that the perception of them irresistibly suggests to us the idea of something external to ourselves: and I am not in a condition {{to say that this is}} not the fact (though I do not think any one is entitled to affirm it of any person besides himself). But many thinkers have believed, whether they could conceive it or not, that what we represent to ourselves as material objects, are mere modifications of consciousness; complex feelings of touch and of muscular action. Mr. Spencer may think the inference correct from the unimaginable to the unbelievable, because he holds that belief itself is but the persistence of an idea, and that what we can succeed in imagining we can not at the moment help apprehending as believable. But of what consequence is it what we apprehend at the moment, if the moment is in contradiction to the permanent state of our mind? A person who has been frightened when an infant by stories of ghosts, though he disbelieves them in after years (and perhaps never believed them), may be unable all his life to be in a dark place, in circumstances stimulating to the imagination, without mental discomposure. The idea of ghosts, with all its attendant terrors, is irresistibly called up in his mind by the outward circumstances. Mr. Spencer may say, that while he is under the influence of this terror he does not disbelieve in ghosts, but has a temporary and uncontrollable belief in them. Be it so; but allowing it to be so, which would it be truest to say of this man on the whole—that he believes in ghosts, or that he does not believe in them? Assuredly that he does not believe in them. The case is similar with those who disbelieve a material world. Though they can not get rid of the idea; though while looking at a solid object they can not help having the conception, and therefore, {{according to}} Mr. Spencer’s metaphysics, the momentary belief, of its externality; even at that moment they would sincerely deny holding that belief: and it would be incorrect to call them other than disbelievers of the doctrine. The belief therefore is not invariable; and the test of inconceivableness fails in the only cases to which there could ever be any occasion to apply it.|$|E

Phase-matched high harmonics by a loosely focusing geometry produce high focused intensity sufficient to induce nonlinear optical phenomena in the xuv region [1]. Such nonlinear phenomena not only have been attracting much attention {{in the field of}} quantum electronics, but also are of great importance for direct measurement of temporal shapes of the xuv pulses. Paul et al. first reported the measurement of an attosecond pulse train and determined that the pulse width in the train is 250 as by analyzing the electron energy spectra produced with the two-color above threshold ionization (ATI) [2].

The state-of-the-art of BT derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history.

With our parallel algorithm and the resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the entire Yahoo’s user base within one day, the scale that one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even <b>imagine</b> with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20 % CTR lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset. Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance {{in spite of the}} typically skewed distribution of domain data.
