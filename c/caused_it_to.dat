Rather than representing a distinct genus, Tatankaceratops could as easily represent a dwarf Triceratops or a Triceratops individual with a developmental disorder that <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> stop growing prematurely.|$|E
5|$|The memorial's {{location}} {{on a busy}} street corner has <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent clean-up and restoration projects.

5|$|Caged Bird was {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy.

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic. Algae blooms <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In October 1911 Robertson {{took the}} {{entrance}} examination for the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and was {{accepted into the}} second intake of cadets in 1912. His class was due to be commissioned on 1 January 1916, but {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914 <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be graduated early. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in both the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) and the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 3 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Keith's {{slow and}} erratic {{movement}} <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore {{the brunt of}} the storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding. Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The 1985 European Cup Final was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before {{the match}} at the Heysel Stadium began, Liverpool fans {{breached}} a fence separating opposing fans. As Juventus fans fled to safety, {{the accumulation of}} people against a perimeter wall <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed two hours before starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. Michel Platini's penalty won the final 1–0 for the Italians.|$|E
5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{was painted}} using an {{experimental}} technique, which <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> begin to deteriorate {{as soon as}} it was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in the gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery, over 150 years after being consigned to storage.|$|E

5|$|The immensely {{complex and}} ambitious F-111 design and {{construction}} process forced the Australian government to quickly adopt sophisticated American procurement and project management methods. Although Australia originally planned to buy the American F-111A design, RAAF liaison officers requested country-specific changes such as a long-distance radio, Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided metal fatigue expertise, and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions. The differences from the F-111A <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be designated the F-111C in 1966.|$|E

There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73.

5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above John and nearly <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved through}} the West Indies between November3 and November4. The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> re-curve west-southwestward on November 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC on November 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204km/h (127mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and {{the passage of a}} trough weakened the typhoon and <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E
