40|$|An Australian sample (N = 467) of {{high school}} {{students}} was administered scales tapping optimism, self-esteem, career expectations, career goals, <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration. The study tested a career mediational model based on social cognitive <b>career</b> theory (SCCT) <b>and</b> cognitive-motivational-relational theory (CMR). It was hypothesised that the stable person inputs of optimism and self-esteem would predict <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration through the variables of <b>career</b> expectations <b>and</b> <b>career</b> goals differentially for young males and females. For males, optimism <b>and</b> self-esteem influenced <b>career</b> expectations, sequentially predicting career goals, <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration. A different pathway was identified for females, with optimism directly influencing career goals, which subsequently predicted <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration. Self-esteem predicted career expectations, which then directly influenced <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> exploration by bypassing career goals. Results are discussed in the context of SCCT and CMR. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{diversification}} in <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> occupational trajectories of knowledge workers. In many discourses on the emerging knowledge-based economy, knowledge workers {{are supposed to}} “concentrate” {{a lot of changes}} in work and to be a paradigmatic example of new work patterns. The paper mainly relies on the empirical findings of case studies of knowledge-intensive occupations carried out in the European WORKS project (2006 - 2010). The first section clarifies the concepts of <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> occupational trajectories. It also addresses the theoretical debate concerning organisational versus boundaryless <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> specifies to what extent this theoretical debate concerns “knowledge workers”. The second section summarises some relevant empirical findings concerning the diversification of <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> occupational trajectories, within four occupational groups: researchers in IT, dress designers, software professionals, managers in logistics. The final and concluding section highlights the key issues of the diversification of <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> trajectories of knowledge workers, in terms of <b>career</b> development <b>and</b> labour market organisation...|$|R

A sample of 505 employees of a Nigerian Bank revealed the significant link between the variables of <b>career</b> planning <b>and</b> <b>career</b> management, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development, <b>and</b> in turn, with job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>career</b> commitment.

The paper offers new guidelines for bringing about a rapprochement between <b>career</b> theory <b>and</b> <b>career</b> success research.

40|$|We {{tested a}} cross-sectional, moderated-mediation model of career {{identity}} in young adults (N = 667, 72. 9 % female, mean age = 20 years). In this model, career preparatory activities (<b>career</b> exploration <b>and</b> planning) {{were associated with}} perceptions of future employability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> distress. These relationships were mediated by <b>career</b> identity, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> identity was conditional upon level of career calling.

40|$|Career {{adaptability}} {{constitutes a}} resource {{that can help}} employees to effectively manage <b>career</b> changes <b>and</b> challenges. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between the two higher-order constructs of <b>career</b> adaptability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> entrenchment (i. e., the perceived inability and/or unwillingness to pursue new career opportunities), as well as relationships among the dimensions of <b>career</b> adaptability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> entrenchment. We hypothesized a negative relationship between overall <b>career</b> adaptability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> entrenchment, <b>and</b> more differentiated associations among their dimensions. Data for this study came from 404 employees in Brazil. Results of structural equation modeling showed that overall career adaptability weakly negatively predicted overall career entrenchment (standardized effect = −. 13), after controlling for age, gender, education, and job tenure. More differentiated findings emerged at the dimension level. Future research should examine the mechanisms and boundary conditions of the relationship between <b>career</b> adaptability <b>and</b> <b>career</b> entrenchment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
