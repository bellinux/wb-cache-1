40|$|A new {{immunoassay}} amplification {{method has}} been applied to the measurement of toxins A, B, and E from Clostridium botulinum. The technique is a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which relies on the detection of sandwich complexes on microtiter plates by a solid-phase <b>coagulation</b> <b>assay</b> known as ELCA, or enzyme-linked <b>coagulation</b> <b>assay.</b> In the method, a coagulation activating enzyme (RVV-XA) isolated from the venom of Russell's viper is conjugated to affinity-purified horse antibodies specific for toxin type A, B, or E. Plates are coated with affinity-purified antibodies, and standard captag (capture-tag) protocols using labeled antibody are employed to bind the toxin from solution. Complexes are detected by adding a modified plasma substrate which contains all the coagulation factors mixed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled fibrinogen and solid-phase fibrinogen; deposition of solid-phase, enzyme-labeled fibrin on the solid phase is then a reflection of formation of toxin-RVV-XA-antibody complexes on the solid phase. Because of the ability to detect RVV-XA by this <b>coagulation</b> <b>assay</b> at concentrations < 0. 1 pg/ml, it was possible to measure C. botulinum toxins A, B, and E at mouse bioassay levels (< 10 pg/ml, or < 0. 07 pM) for both purified neurotoxin and crude culture filtrates obtained from strains known to produce appropriate single toxins. ELISA-ELCA should be applicable to measurement of toxins in most of the materials (contaminated food, blood, and excreta) for which the comparably sensitive mouse bioassay is currently employed. This method has the potential of broad application to the measurement of low concentrations of any antigen for which appropriate immunochemical reagents are available, in a color test format...|$|E

This study used in vitro methods to determine i) optimum <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> for dabigatran in children and ii) anticoagulant effect of dabigatran across pediatric age groups. Materials and MethodsPooled plasma samples from healthy children aged 0 to < 1, 1 to < 5, 5 to < 10, 10 to < 17 years and adults were spiked with increasing concentrations of dabigatran and the effect was assessed in five <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays.</b> The samples were also assessed for overall hemostasis potential using a fibrin clot formation and lysis assay. ResultsIn all five <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays,</b> {{there were no differences}} in responses to dabigatran over all pediatric age groups. The international normalized ratio was the least sensitive measure. Activated partial thromboplastin time showed moderate sensitivity and a nonlinear response curve. Thrombin time (TT), dilute TT (dTT) and ecarin clotting time were linearly correlated with dabigatran concentrations; however, the ecarin time and TT were overly sensitive. In the overall hemostasis potential assay, increasing dabigatran concentrations delayed the initiation of clot formation and reduced the time to 50 % clot lysis. The responses to initiation of clot formation and clot lysis were consistent across all pediatric groups and comparable to responses in adults. ConclusionThe dTT is the most suitable assay for measuring dabigatran concentrations in children. Fibrin clot generation and lysis assay responses to dabigatran in children over all ages were consistent and comparable to those of adults...|$|R
40|$|Human protein Z (PZ) is a 62, 000 -Mr, vitamin K-dependent {{plasma protein}} whose {{structure}} {{is similar to}} coagulation factors VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S, but whose function is not known. The procoagulant activity of factor Xa in a one-stage plasma <b>coagulation</b> <b>assay</b> is reduced when factor Xa is first incubated with PZ. This apparent inhibitory effect is time dependent, requires the presence of calcium ions and procoagulant phospholipids (rabbit brain cephalin), and appears predominantly related to the incubation period of PZ with cephalin. In serum the initial rate of inhibition of factor Xa with calcium ions and cephalin also is enhanced in the presence PZ. A PZ-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) has been isolated from plasma. ZPI is a 72, 000 -Mr single-chain protein with an N-terminal amino acid sequence of LAPSPQSPEXXA (X = indeterminate) and an estimated concentration in citrate-treated plasma of 1. 0 – 1. 6 μg/ml.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of toxins A, B, and E from Clostridium botulinum {{was accomplished by}} use of a modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employing labeled horse antibody and either chicken antibody or biotinylated horse antibody. The complexes formed in solution phase were captured onto solid phases coated with rabbit anti-chicken immunoglobulin G (chicken antibody) or avidin (biotinylated antibody). The assay {{was brought to the}} sensitivity of the mouse bioassay (5 to 10 pg/ml, or 0. 03 to 0. 07 pM) by employing as labeling enzyme the factor X activator of Russell's viper venom (RVV-XA) and a sensitive coagulation-based assay amplification system known as enzyme-linked <b>coagulation</b> <b>assay.</b> Complex formation was found to be a slower reaction than binding to the capture plate, and so the assay used a preincubation step to produce the solution-phase complexes before they were bound to the solid phase. Keeping the concentrations of Russell's viper venom factor X activator antibody and capture antibody constant for diluted samples and diluting complexes into buffer without keeping labeled antibody concentrations constant were equivalent in allowing the detection of low neurotoxin concentrations.

40|$|Sulfation of curdlan, a natural, linear beta- 1, 3 -glucan {{results in}} potent {{anticoagulant}} and antithrombotic agents. The different activity characteristics {{in the classical}} <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> were shown to depend on various structural parameters. To obtain more detailed information about their structure-dependent mechanisms of action, one representative of these beta- 1, 3 -glucan sulfates (CurS), was further investigated using several <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> and amidolytic tests with chromogenic substrates. The mode of action of CurS {{differs from that of}} heparin. CurS reduces the thrombin formation by principally inhibiting the intrinsic FXa generation. As shown by amidolytic assays, it eliminates already generated thrombin mainly by accelerating the HCII-mediated thrombin inactivation, whereas its AT-mediated anti-thrombin activity is considerably lower than that of heparin. Further, it prevents the thrombin-mediated fibrin polymerization by directly interfering with the thrombin action on fibrinogen as well as by binding to fibrinogen. Finally, CurS is capable to activate the contact system with the consequence of a potential fibrinolytic effect. In conclusion, beta- 1, 3 -glucan sulfates do not inhibit the blood coagulation nonspecifically due to their anionic character, but in dependence on their individual structure, they interfere specifically with the coagulation process at several sites...|$|R
40|$|Dabigatran is an oral, {{reversible}} thrombin inhibitor {{that has}} shown promising results in large clinical trials. Laboratory monitoring {{is not needed}} but the effects on common <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> are incompletely known. Dabigatran was added to plasma from healthy subjects in the concentration range 0 - 1, 000 mu g/l and analysed using several reagents for activated thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, antithrombin, and activated protein C resistance. Typical trough concentrations are about 50 mu g/l, peak concentrations 100 - 300 mu g/l. At 100 mu g/l all APTT-results were prolonged. The concentration required to double APTT ranged between 227 and 286 mu g/l, the responses for all five reagents were similar. PT-reagents were much less affected with almost no samples above INR 1. 2 at 100 mu g/l. The effect was sample dilution dependent with PT Quick type more sensitive than PT Owren type methods. If a patient on dabigatran has prolonged APTT, andgt; 90 seconds, and Quick PT INR andgt; 2 or Owren PT INR andgt; 1. 5 over-dosing or accumulation of dabigatran should be considered. Two of four fibrinogen reagents underestimated the fibrinogen concentration considerably at expected peak concentration. Methods based on inhibition of thrombin over-estimated the antithrombin concentration, but not Xa-based. The APC-resistance methods over-estimated the APC-ratio, which may lead to miss-classification of factory Leiden patients as being normal.

A cut-off DOAC level of 50 ng/mL based on results from patient samples within the laboratory can be used as the lower limit which will result in prolongation of APTT for dabigatran (sensitivity 96 %, n = 25) and PT for rivaroxaban (sensitivity 97 %, n = 29), respectively.

Seventeen of 35 patients had elevated PIVKA-II levels before surgery, which continued to be above normal range postoperatively.

Virtually all Belgian laboratories performing routine coagulation testing (189 / 192) participated in the survey. Both, dabigatran and rivaroxaban significantly prolonged the PT and aPTT in a concentration- and reagent-dependent manner. PT reagents were more influenced by rivaroxaban than by dabigatran and aPTT reagents more influenced by dabigatran than by rivaroxaban. Among PT reagents, Neoplastin R® was the most sensitive to rivaroxaban and Innovin® and Thromborel S® the least sensitive. Converting PT results to INR only increased the variability between reagents. Among aPTT reagents, Actin FSL® was the least sensitive to dabigatran while the other aPTT reagents showed slightly higher sensitivities. The presence of dabigatran led to falsely reduced fibrinogen concentrations when measured with a low thrombin concentration reagent. The presence of dabigatran caused an overestimation of the antithrombin level when measured with a thrombin-based activity assay and the presence of rivaroxaban an overestimation of the antithrombin level when measured with a FXa-based assay.

40|$|The {{processes}} of inflammation and coagulation {{are known to}} be interconnected through several mechanisms; however, the influence of inflammation on the interpretation of <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> remains unknown. Blood was collected from 87 dogs admitted to a tertiary referral intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 control dogs. The association between 2 markers of inflammation [mature neutrophil count and C-reactive protein (CRP) ] and 5 coagulation parameters [activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin (AT), and platelet count (plt) ] were evaluated through correlation analysis. The study population was then divided into 4 groups based on severity of ACT prolongation with comparisons to all other variables assessed through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. A strong correlation for a biological system was demonstrated between ACT and CRP (r = 0. 66; P < 0. 0001). Statistically significant results were also found between aPTT and AT with the markers of inflammation, but the correlations were weaker. Within ACT groups of increasing severity, higher CRP concentrations (P < 0. 0001) and lower AT activities (P < 0. 0001) were identified. This study provides evidence for an association between assays of inflammation and coagulation and suggests that modification of our traditional interpretations of <b>coagulation</b> <b>assays</b> may be required. As a point-of-care test, ACT is a simple and inexpensive tool {{that can be used to}} assess an underlying inflammatory or hemostatic process...|$|R
