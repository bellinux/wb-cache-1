50|$|There can be {{multiple}} punishments due {{to certain}} <b>criminal</b> <b>charges.</b> Minor <b>criminal</b> <b>charges</b> such as misdemeanors, tickets, and infractions have less harsh punishments. The judge usually sentences the person accused of committing the charges {{right after the}} hearing. The punishments generally include things like fines, suspension, probation, {{a small amount of}} jail time, or alcohol and drug classes. If the <b>criminal</b> <b>charges</b> are considered more serious like a felony then there is a more lengthy process for determining the punishment. Felonies include the most serious crimes such as murder and treason. There is a separate trial to determine the punishments for the <b>criminal</b> <b>charges</b> committed.|$|R

25|$|Two {{investigations}} were conducted. The {{first by}} Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were {{unrelated to the}} attacks but later concluded {{it was the most}} likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved into her life leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and alcohol and drug abuse by Philip, as well as a pending <b>criminal</b> <b>charge</b> against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude it was just as likely that she had met a different fate.|$|E

If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a <b>criminal</b> <b>charge</b> merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.|$|E
25|$|Burroughs {{moved into}} a rundown hotel in the Latin Quarter of Paris in 1959 when Naked Lunch was {{still looking for a}} publisher. Tangier, with its {{political}} unrest, and criminals with whom he had become involved, became dangerous to Burroughs. He went to Paris to meet Ginsberg and talk with Olympia Press. He left behind a <b>criminal</b> <b>charge</b> which eventually caught up to him to Paris. Paul Lund, a British former career criminal and cigarette smuggler whom Burroughs met in Tangier, was arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics into France. Lund gave up Burroughs, and evidence implicated Burroughs in the importation of narcotics into France. When the Moroccan authorities forwarded their investigation to French officials,Burroughs faced criminal charges in Paris for conspiracy to import opiates. It was during this impending case that Maurice Girodias published Naked Lunch; its appearance helped to get Burroughs a suspended sentence, since a literary career, according to Ted Morgan, is a respected profession in France.|$|E
