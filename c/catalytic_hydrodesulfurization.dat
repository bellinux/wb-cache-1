30|$|The {{removal of}} sulfur {{compounds}} from liquid fuels {{is carried out}} industrially via <b>catalytic</b> <b>hydrodesulfurization</b> (HDS). Although the conventional HDS has been highly effective in reduction of sulfur levels, aromatic sulfur compounds such as thiophene, benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, and their derivatives, which are the major objectionable sulfur components present in petroleum fractions, are less reactive to this process (Song 2003). Further improvement of the HDS process for deep desulfurization is limited to increasingly severe operating conditions at high cost. Moreover, deep HDS process will require a considerable increase in the consumption of energy and hydrogen, which can substantially improve the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst, resulting in undesirable side reactions. Such side reactions {{can lead to a}} decrease in the octane number of gasoline (Nie et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007).

These results are explained as follows: HDS rate is increased by both elimination of excess P on the active sites at higher reduction temperatures and enhancement of the crystallinity of Rh 2 P. Furthermore, because the particle size of the P(T) /Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (ca. 1. 2 nm) was substantially smaller than that of the Rh-P(A) /Al 2 O 3 catalyst, the P(T) /Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited greater HDS rate compared with the Rh-P(A) /Al 2 O 3 catalyst...|$|R
