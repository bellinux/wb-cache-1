5|$|July 1992: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Darby caused cloudiness in California. These <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> also enough {{to delay the}} landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a day, and cause it to land in Florida instead of California.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> first {{detected}} {{from space}} by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of 1932 Quizapu has been quiet. In 1949 and 1967 small ash <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> reported, while in the 1980s {{there were no signs}} of activity other than fumaroles.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also likely}} that the Hills <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> the largest {{concentration}} of comets across the Solar System.

40|$|The {{current status}} of models of diffuse {{interstellar}} <b>clouds</b> <b>is</b> reviewed. A detailed comparison of recent gas-phase steady-state models shows that both the physical conditions and the molecular abundances in diffuse <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> still not fully understood. Alternative mechanisms are discussed and observational tests which may discriminate between the various models are suggested. Recent developments regarding the velocity structure of diffuse <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> mentioned. Similarities and differences between the chemistries in diffuse clouds and those in translucent and high latitude <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> pointed out...|$|R
5|$|Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry), {{representing}} the Queen, arrived with the President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge. The London Symphony Orchestra and the Urban Voice Choir performed {{the national anthem}} of the United Kingdom whilst the Union flag was raised by {{the armed forces and}} the performers waved mini Union flags in the stadium. Once the flag was raised Hirst's artwork was revealed as the grey <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> removed.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch {{telescope}} he had initiated {{finally came}} online. Gascoigne, {{looking for a new}} research project and keen to use the new telescope, took up the study of globular clusters, compact groups {{of tens of thousands of}} ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of photometer, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic <b>Clouds</b> <b>were</b> both young and old, and had quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E
50|$|An {{interstellar}} <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> {{the generic}} name given to {{an accumulation of}} gas, plasma, and dust in our and other galaxies. Put differently, an interstellar <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> a denser-than-average region of the interstellar medium. Depending on the density, size, and temperature of a given cloud, the hydrogen in it can be neutral (H I regions), ionized (H II regions) (i.e. a plasma), or molecular (molecular clouds). Neutral and ionized <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> sometimes also called diffuse clouds, while molecular <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> sometimes {{also referred to as}} dense clouds.|$|R

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{refers to}} both the applications delivered as a service over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the data centers that provide those services [15]. The <b>cloud</b> could either <b>be</b> a public <b>cloud</b> (that <b>is,</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> provided in a prepaid manner to the general public), private <b>cloud</b> (that <b>is,</b> internal IT infrastructure of an organization is inaccessible to the general public), or a hybrid <b>cloud</b> (that <b>is,</b> the computing ability of the private <b>cloud</b> <b>is</b> boosted by the public cloud).|$|R
5|$|In Virginia, a large band of {{thunderstorms}} {{associated with}} the hurricane brought strong winds and spawned three tornadoes. A funnel cloud formed in Albemarle County evolved into an F3 tornado after crossing into Greene County. It destroyed two houses and uprooted several trees, inflicting $250,000 in damage (1985USD, $470,000 2006USD). F0 tornadoes were also generated in Goochland County and Hanover County; the two tornadoes damaged a total of ten houses. Funnel <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> sighted throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E
5|$|To make it {{difficult}} for the enemy to track him he changed course frequently. Ranger operations depended on surprise, but it had clearly been lost. The <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> thinning out and visibility was improving. Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home. While flying over Funen island he spotted a building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole. A car was parked outside the entrance. Believing it might contain someone of importance, he dived to attack, strafing the building and destroyed the car.|$|E

5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, and later was extended to Zihuatanejo. Though the National Hurricane Center never forecast it to make landfall, one computer model predicted Carlotta to move ashore; due to the threat, the Mexican government also issued a hurricane watch from Puerto Angel to Zihuatanejo. Outer rainbands and rough surf affected the southwestern coast of Mexico for an extended duration; officials evacuated about 100families in potentially flooded areas of Acapulco as a precaution. Precipitation and <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> reported in every Mexican state along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in flooding in some areas. No stations in Mexico reported sustained tropical storm force winds; however, Bahías de Huatulco International Airport in Oaxaca reported a wind gust of 44mph (71km/h). Heavy rainfall and rough seas were also reported on Socorro Island.|$|E
5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was nationally televised on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz was told that the game may have to be stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts impinged on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{accomplishments in}} the {{infrared}} study of dense molecular <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> reviewed, and the outstanding problems {{in the area are}} discussed. Such questions as whether <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> collapsing, how they can be classified, and whether star formation is occurring on the edges of <b>clouds</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. Problems of determining size, energy distribution and luminosity, spectral features, evolutionary state, and energetics of infrared sources are discussed...|$|R

25|$|For {{several years}} {{following}} the eruption, {{it was reported that}} the moon appeared to be blue and sometimes green. This was because some of the ash <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> filled with particles about 1µm wide—the right size to strongly scatter red light, while allowing other colors to pass. White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> determined to be at 3bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the wavelength range 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|E
25|$|At the time, all {{reflector}} telescopes with an aperture of 2 metres or {{more were}} located in the northern hemisphere. The decision to build the observatory in the southern hemisphere resulted from the necessity of observing the southern sky; some research subjects (such as the central parts of the Milky Way and the Magellanic <b>Clouds)</b> <b>were</b> accessible only from the southern hemisphere.|$|E

50|$|In cloud nomenclature, any funnel- or inverted-funnel-shaped cloud {{depending}} from cumulus or cumulonimbus <b>clouds</b> <b>is</b> technically {{described as}} an accessory feature called tuba.

25|$|In January 1986, the Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} flew by Uranus at {{a minimal}} distance of 107,100km providing the first close-up images and spectra of its atmosphere. They generally {{confirmed that the}} atmosphere was made of mainly hydrogen and helium with around 2% methane. The atmosphere appeared highly transparent and lacking thick stratospheric and tropospheric hazes. Only {{a limited number of}} discrete <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> observed.|$|E
25|$|Clouds {{surrounding}} mountains {{display a}} seasonal variability. Clouds at Olympus Mons and Ascreaus Mons appear in northern hemisphere spring and summer, reaching a total maximum area of approximately 900,000km2 and 1,000,000km2 respectively in late spring. Clouds around Alba Patera and Pavonis Mons show an additional, smaller peak in late summer. Very few <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> observed in winter. Predictions from the Mars General Circulation Model {{are consistent with}} these observations.|$|E
25|$|The {{troposphere}} hosts four cloud layers: methane clouds {{at about}} 1.2bar, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia clouds at 3–10bar, ammonium hydrosulfide clouds at 20–40bar, and finally water clouds below 50bar. Only the upper two cloud layers {{have been observed}} directly—the deeper clouds remain speculative. Above the clouds lie several tenuous layers of photochemical haze. Discrete bright tropospheric clouds are rare on Uranus, probably due to sluggish convection in the planet's interior. Nevertheless, observations of such <b>clouds</b> <b>were</b> {{used to measure the}} planet's zonal winds, which are remarkably fast with speeds up to 240m/s.|$|E
