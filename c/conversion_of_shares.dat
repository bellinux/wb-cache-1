40|$|In {{the absence}} of taxes and {{transactions}} costs, {{there can be no}} benefit to corporate reorganization from a financial standpoint, but ‘real world ’ limitations and frictions do provide additional value that is gained through divestitures in terms of focus and financial flexibility. Herein, the corporate divestiture decision is analyzed to determine the motivation for a parent company either to cleave its offspring directly to the external capital market in an equity carve-out or to distribute the shares to the existing shareholders in a tax-free spin-off. Cash flow performance, asymmetric information, relative size of the divestiture, and relatedness of the parent’s and subsidiary’s operations are all found to contribute significantly to the divestiture decision. In Canada, an alternate form of security, known as the income trust unit, has become popular for corporate reorganizations, either through an initial public offering or as a <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> The flow-through structure of income trusts currently allows avoidance of corporate taxation to offer higher pre-tax returns to retail investors, in a market setting where yield is increasingly equated with value. To determine placement of these securities in the market, the risk of the income trust organizational form is analyzed and compared to the standard corporate form. Further, a number of publicly known characteristics of the income trusts can predict the relative risk of this type of investment. In recent ‘hot markets ’ for these securities, proof is uncovered that unsuitable firms have been migrating to this sector, but valuation of the investments in this sector has remained fair and full. Although pending legislation will discontinue the tax-exempt status of income trusts in 2011, during their tenure these securities have improved the Canadian market.

40|$|AbstractOne {{issue which}} is {{essential}} for the security of calculations and communication as well as the ability to guarantee data confidentiality is intelligent threshold division of strategic information that may later be passed on to a group of authorized users for reconstruction and shared use. Enabling such division of information acquires particular significance with regard to the management of important and confidential data by various national institutions, corporations or strategic (military) units. It seems that these techniques will become increasingly more important along with the growing number of their applications. The division of confidential information is inevitably related to the cryptographic algorithms of the division of secrets. Relying on these techniques, this paper will focus on two issues. The first is the expansion of the traditional techniques for the division of secrets and the development of the so-called linguistic threshold schemes, a new concept based on the traditional algorithms of the division of information which additionally introduces the stage <b>of</b> linguistic <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> data using specially defined formal grammar. The other is the demonstration of how linguistic threshold schemes thus developed may be used to manage secret data in a variety of selected organizational structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of split-share {{structure}} reform on earnings management in China. A unique institutional feature of China was the co-existence of two types <b>of</b> <b>share</b> that endowed all shareholders with equal voting and cash flow rights but different tradability. This split-share structure significantly constrained the tradability <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> that led the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission to make it mandatory for the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> non-tradable <b>shares</b> into tradable shares from 2006 onwards. We investigate whether such a conversion has any effect on information quality through reduced earnings manipulation. We specifically examine the incentives for earnings management during the reform-transition period. A unique feature of the split-share reform has been the requirement for non-tradable share holders to compensate the tradable share holders. We argue that the rational response from the non-tradable share holders would be to pay a lower consideration to tradable share holders by portraying a favorable picture through income-increasing earnings management. We also test for the effect {{of an increase in}} tradable shares on earnings management during the reform-transition and post-reform period...|$|R

These grassland areas are home to many bird species, so that Eiderstedt can be considered {{to be one of the}} most important bird habitats in Schleswig-Holstein. Ongoing changes in the structure of the regional agriculture towards an intensified dairy production and the growth of biofuels call for a <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> large <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> grassland to arable farm land.

40|$|Abstract: Beginning in late 2001, Argentina {{experienced}} a tumultuous {{economic and social}} crisis including {{the end of the}} decade-long peso peg to the dollar, drastic foreign exchange and capital controls, violent anti-government demonstrations, social unrest, and the largest debt default in history. Yet the Argentine stock market {{experienced a}} boom during the early period of the crisis. This is in contrast to the experience of other countries undergoing financial crises, where the domestic stock market experiences sharp declines in value. This paper explains the surprising Argentine experience as a result of investors using the stock market to shift funds out of Argentina and into the United States. This was accomplished via purchases in Argentina <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> firms listed in the United States and traded as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). These Argentine shares were converted into ADRs and sold in the U. S. to shift out of pesos in Argentina into dollars in the United States. While ADRs and underlying share prices typically trade in a very narrow range, during the time when ADR conversions were permitted in Argentina, a large premium on share prices in Argentina relative to ADR prices existed. This premium reflected the capital loss expected on peso investments in Argentina and the value of capital control avoidance. On March 25, 2002, the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> Argentine <b>shares</b> into ADRs was prohibited and the premium <b>of</b> Argentine <b>share</b> prices over ADR prices once again returned to fluctuate about zero...|$|R
