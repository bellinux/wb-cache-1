Having been coated, {{the surface}} {{unevenness}} and pores on paper {{were covered by}} a coating layer composed of fine particles and binders, which can absorb ink well, thereby a good uniformity and smoothness of paper could be obtained, consequently, the reproducing capability for printing dot and good whiteness, gloss and opacity can be improved. In theory, the ink rub resistance for <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> <b>print</b> is mainly affected by the ink absorbance property of <b>paper,</b> <b>printing</b> conditions, ink components, rub medium and so on. In this study, seven different kinds of coated papers, the viscosities of the inks were adjusted with a viscosity adjusting agent, and then the prints were prepared by proofing with the ink with different viscosities. After drying, the prints were used for rub testing. The impact of the basic properties of coated paper {{and the content of}} reducer in inks on rub resistance were discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis of the experimental data. Printing color density loss rate and print color difference were exploited in this paper to characterize the ink rub resistance for <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> <b>prints.</b> In this study, it was found that ink rub resistance was mainly influenced by ink absorbency and smoothness of the paper. Under the similar conditions, the color density of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> <b>print</b> decreases with the rub strength increasing, color difference increased gradually, but not linearly. With the increase of ink viscosity reducer content, printing density loss rates as well as color difference changed, but not be linearly...|$|R

This article presents the research results of voltage changes of the intermediate cylinder in indirect electrophotography with liquid toner on dirt count and area on handsheet made from fibers after prints pulping and flotation, brightness and effective residual ink concentration. Since on the indirect transfer of ElectroInk except the voltage of the intermediate cylinder also impacts temperature, its influence on the dirt count and area is showed. Uncoated and both side coated substrates were used for printing. The results show that changes in voltage of the intermediate cylinder in the printing affects the characteristics of pulped and floated fibers and dirt count and area on handsheets. Dominant factor of studied process is surface treatment of the printing substrate. Maximum efficiency of deinking flotation (87. 7 %) was observed on non <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> <b>print,</b> at the voltage of the intermediate cylinder of 700 V. The efficiency of deinking flotation on both sides <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> <b>prints</b> in dependence on the voltage of the intermediate cylinder in most cases is below 10 %. The results show that an increase in temperature of the intermediate cylinder increases dirt count and area on handsheetst after pulping prints under experimental conditions. Increased efficiency of flotation was found for print obtained at a lower temperature of the intermediate cylinder...|$|R

To enhance {{printing}} qualities, {{this study}} used refluxed silica (SiO 2) from rice husk by hydrochloric acid (HCl) at different molarities and reaction times as <b>coating</b> agent for <b>printed</b> <b>paper.</b> Characterization of the refluxed silica from 2 M HCl 120 min elucidated the purity of 98. 7 % and amorphous structure. Particle size of the silica exhibited uniform size of 3 μm and the color measurement (CIE L*a*b*) indicated 94. 79 + 0. 48 + 1. 24, whiteness and color difference (∆E) were 84. 85, 3. 28, respectively. The coating agent was prepared by water-based varnish of acrylic resin mixed with the synthesized silica at different proportions: 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 (%wt), and later was applied on 170 g/m 2 -white kraft papers. The {{results showed that the}} water-based coating varnish with silica exhibited an increase of viscosity as increasing the amount of the silica. Printing qualities indicated that the vanished <b>printed</b> <b>paper</b> with 1. 0 % silica elucidated the highest details in shadow tone and text (font) sharpness. The color gamut yielded a wider scope than the <b>printed</b> <b>papers</b> which were varnished with the silica at 0. 0 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 5 %.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} Low Coherence Interferometry (LCI) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in paper measurements. The developed measurement system {{is a combination of}} a profilometer and a tomographic imaging device, which makes the construction versatile and applicable in several paper measurement applications. The developed system was first used to measure the surface structure of paper. Different grades of paper were selected to provide maximum variation in surface structure. The results show that the developed system is capable of measuring grades of paper from rough base paper to highly <b>coated</b> photo <b>printing</b> <b>paper.</b> To evaluate the developed system in surface characterization, the roughness parameters of five laboratory-made paper samples measured with the developed system and with a commercial optical profilometer were compared. A linear correlation was found with roughness parameters Ra and Rq. Next, the surface quality of paper was evaluated using LCI, a Diffractive Optical Element Based Glossmeter (DOG), and a commercial glossmeter. The results show linear correlation between Ra and gloss measured with the commercial glossmeter. The roughness Ra and averaged gloss measured with the DOG didn't give such a correlation, but a combination of these techniques provided local properties of gloss and surface structure, which can be used to evaluate the local surface properties of paper. In the next study, determination of the filler content of paper using OCT is discussed. The measurement results show clear correspondence of the slope of the averaged logarithmic fringe signal envelope and the filler content. The last studies focus on 2 D and 3 D imaging of paper using OCT and begin with imaging of a self-made wood fiber network. The visibility of the fibers was clear. Next, several refractive index matcing agents are studied by means of light transmittance and OCT measurements to find the best possible agent for enhancing the imaging depth of OCT in paper. Benzyl alcohol was found to have the best possible combination of optical, evaporation, and sorption characteristics, and it is applied in 2 D and 3 D visualizations of copy paper...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Mar. 5, 2014 - Mar. 5, 2015 Due to the wide applications of inkjet printers in industry and our daily life, characterization of liquid droplets from inkjet printers, particularly the behaviors of the impact and diffusion of the droplets {{on the surface of}} and inside porous medium is of great interest. One conventional characterization method uses high-speed optical cameras to record the images of the motion of the liquid droplets. However, this method does not have sufficient time resolution to capture the transient motion of the liquid droplet and does not provide any information of the diffusion process inside the medium because the porous media such as paper are not transparent. In this study, we use an optical scattering method to investigate the behavior of liquid droplets in porous media both theoretically and experimentally. The working principle is based on measuring the liquid-induced optical scattering from a laser beam to probe the impact and diffusion processes of the droplets. The diffusion characterization was conducted on conventional <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>printing</b> <b>paper</b> samples from Hewlett Packard. The influence of thermal effects from the laser and the distance between the printer and the sample was also analyzed. The correlation between the optical transmission and the penetration depth was studied. In addition, we measured the transient optical signals with nano-second resolution to reveal the liquid droplet oscillation on a glass surface. Our experimental results match the numerical simulation, which proves that the optical scattering method is feasible tool for further characterizations of the liquid droplets from inkjet printers...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{printing}} troubles on print quality is non-uniformity of printing density called print mottle. The causes of print mottle are various. As far as paper, {{it has been}} thought that surface roughness of paper, absorption of ink and fountain solution cause non-uniformity of ink transfer. As the results of evaluation on commercial <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>print</b> mottle did not occur in solid area and non-uniformity of ink transfer also did not arise. But print mottle occurred in halftone dots, and it was thought another factor except ink transfer affect print mottle in halftone dots. This was confirmed because print mottle was also observed in halftone dots which shape and density were quite even on the paper (chemical proof). The purpose {{of this research is}} to clarify the cause affecting print mottle in halftone dots. It is known that apparent dot gain (optical dot gain) arises in halftone dots due to lateral light scattering of printing medium, and optical dot gain affects printing density. We set up a hypothesis that non-uniformity of optical dot gain causes print mottle in halftone dots. Therefore, we investigated the non-uniformity of lateral light scattering of paper that was thought to bring about the non-uniformity of optical dot gain. In the past researches to measure the lateral light scattering, ruled-lines were formed on the paper, the modulation arisen in amplitude of microdensity profile of ruled-lines due to light scattering, and light intensity distribution against distance was calculated from the modulation. We measured the modulation using <b>printed</b> ruled-lines on <b>paper.</b> Non-uniformity of light scattering was found, and it was though that this was caused by coating amount variation and so on from microscopic observation. From these results, non-uniformity of optical dot gain was thought {{to be one of the}} important factors affecting print mottle in halftone dots...|$|R
