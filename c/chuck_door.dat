5000|$|At Chuck's house, Howard sneaks {{over several}} walls {{to be let}} in through the back <b>door.</b> <b>Chuck</b> reveals to Howard that he {{intentionally}} allowed Ernesto to hear the tape, knowing he would reveal this to Jimmy. Chuck plans to have Jimmy arrested for criminal theft, predicting the latter would break into his house to destroy the tape. To everyone's shock, an enraged Jimmy shows up at Chuck's house at that very moment. Jimmy kicks down <b>Chuck's</b> <b>door</b> and screams at him for pulling that [...] "heartstrings con job" [...] on him. He pries open the desk drawer and destroys the tape.

However, Jimmy falls for Chuck's trap: Howard and David make their presence known, and declare themselves witnesses to Jimmy's crimes.|$|R

50|$|Mike {{once again}} {{finds himself in}} Jimmy's {{services}} when Jimmy and Kim hire him to infiltrate Chuck's house {{pretending to be a}} repairman that Chuck had hired to fix a door that Jimmy had broken down earlier. After using an electric drill to scare Chuck into hiding upstairs, Mike takes photos of the interior with a disposable camera, which Jimmy later shows to Chuck's ex-wife and as a tactic during his disbarment hearing. Mike also actually fixes <b>Chuck's</b> <b>door,</b> causing him to comment on how nice it is to fix something for once. Meanwhile, Gus, impressed with Mike's work against Hector, sends Victor to deliver a payment, which Mike rejects. Rather than see this as a sign of offense, Gus sees it as a sign of Mike's integrity and personally meets him again to suggest that he might consider a job as part of Gus's drug crew.|$|R

50|$|When Achmed {{knocks on}} Tyler's {{dressing}} room <b>door,</b> <b>Chuck</b> radios for help. Achmed breaks {{open the door}} and, knife in hand, moves toward the closet where Tyler is hiding. Chuck stops him by showing him a cell phone picture of Tyler's tattoo. As Tyler listens, stunned, Chuck recounts how Achmed and his private army are selling enriched uranium to unstable countries, and that they've been using Tyler's manager to get information to their buyers via Tyler's tattoos. He threatens to e-mail that and the photo to everyone. Achmed puts down his knife. Tyler bursts from the closet, armed with a cymbal. He swings at Achmed, misses, propelling himself and <b>Chuck</b> through the <b>door.</b> They run, passing Tyler's manager whom he punches and fires, ending up onstage.|$|R
60|$|Very softly Johnny Chuck crept {{along the}} back passageway. Very, very {{cautiously}} he stuck his little black nose out the doorway and sniffed. Yes, he could smell foxes, {{but he knew that}} they were not at his back door. Little by little he crept out until he could peep through the grass. There lay Reddy Fox behind a big clump of grass, his eyes fixed on Johnny <b>Chuck's</b> front <b>door,</b> and there behind the apple-tree lay Granny Fox taking her ease, but all ready to jump when Reddy should give the word. Johnny Chuck almost giggled out loud as he saw how eagerly Reddy Fox was watching for him. Then Johnny Chuck had an idea that made him giggle harder. His black eyes snapped and he chuckled to himself.|$|R
5000|$|While Jimmy and Kim {{celebrate}} the verdict at Wexler-McGill, Rebecca drops by the office, {{hoping to get}} Jimmy to have <b>Chuck</b> open his <b>door.</b> He refuses to get involved, and when Rebecca says that Jimmy lied to her about wanting to help Chuck, he coldly says that he told the truth about Chuck having problems and needing her help and that's {{all he wanted to}} say. Rebecca says Chuck is Jimmy's brother and Jimmy says [...] "Not anymore, he's not." [...] Rebecca angrily says Chuck was right about Jimmy and leaves after bitterly telling him and Kim to [...] "enjoy your champagne". Jimmy isn't moved by this but Kim looks upset.|$|R
50|$|The {{group had}} not had a single in five months and it was {{beginning}} to appear that Atlantic was either losing interest or waiting for Warren to return full-time from the army. This is at least one possible explanation for the release of only two singles in two years. They were You Are My Only Love, released the fourth week of May 1953, and Under a Blanket of Blue (a song recorded nearly 2-1/2 years earlier) released the third week of April 1954. Warren rejoined the group full-time in March 1954, but the septet wasn’t brought in to record until January 18, 1955, more than two years after their last session. The primary yield of this four-song date was the <b>Chuck</b> Willis-penned The <b>Door</b> Is Still Open to My Heart, which was issued as a single in the fourth week of February 1955.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main and}} {{fundamental}} {{influence of the}} Skelters are the legendary Beatles. John Lennon was Angel's strongest [...] "model" [...] and {{was the reason for}} the creation of the Skelters. The Beatles was the cornerstone for the band's creation and development. Apart from the Beatles, large influence on the Skelters are Queen, U2, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Bruce Springsteen, Little Richard, Oasis and Bon Jovi.However, the Skelters have some secondary, but equally important influences. Each one plays its role in the musical interests of the members. So big names such as Aerosmith, Deep Purple, Bob Dylan, Guns n 'Roses, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, <b>Doors,</b> <b>Chuck</b> Berry, Roy Orbison, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, David Bowie and T-Rex are added to the musical sounds and musical preferences of the Skelters. Finally, 60s, 70s, 80s and some other kinds of music, for example, blues, folk, glam, disco, funk, progressive, alternative etc., complete their musical influences.|$|R
5000|$|Chuck, Casey, and Sarah {{to confront}} Bentley and Josie, the only {{remaining}} suspects, only to find them accusing each and holding each other at gunpoint. Chuck reviews the day's events in his mind and recalls finding a positive pregnancy test in Josie's bag, explaining her emotions. He then accuses Bentley of being the murderer, as she was absent during every murder. When he moves closer to Bentley, however, he whispers that the actual murderer is Damien. As they draw their guns, Damien rises from his cot and threatens to detonate a boombox full of explosives {{if they do not}} get him to a doctor. Had Brody not seen him planting the explosives, Damien would have escaped. When he was forced to murder Brody and [...] "cover his tracks", Damien strategically detonated the explosive and shielded himself with the door. He also planted the bomb under the chair during his interrogation and used the distraction to hide Lewis's body. Just as Damien reveals that he came for Chuck, Bentley shoots him and retrieves the boombox. She runs to the Intersect room and uses a manual release to lock the boombox in with her and save everyone else. As the one-minute timer counts down, <b>Chuck</b> hacks the <b>door's</b> control panels to save Bentley and they evacuate. The explosion sends the Large Mart piglet flying into Chuck's arms.|$|R
50|$|While Sarah {{is on the}} road, {{her search}} of Stephen Bartowski concludes, and she decides to return {{immediately}} to Burbank to tell Chuck what she has found. She arrives after Chuck has been abducted {{and is about to}} leave him a note when she sees his phone lying on his bed. Sarah immediately returns to Castle but her access has been revoked. She signals Casey and warns him that Chuck is missing. Forrest attempts to overrule her because his watch's GPS transponder places him in his apartment's courtyard. Sarah activates their surveillance cameras: his watch is {{at the bottom of the}} fountain. The three track them to a bank vault, which Zamir is using to shield the bug while forcing Chuck (whom he believes is Devon) to operate and remove it. Chuck tries to stall, but his identity is revealed and Zamir tries to kill him, knocking over a tank of nitrous which Casey sees as they arrive at the vault shortly before Zamir seals the door. Forrest wants to blow the vault open, but the blast could ignite the nitrous, killing Chuck. Sarah works on cracking the lock while the others try to get Chuck to open the <b>door.</b> <b>Chuck</b> and Zamir get high on the gas, and in their inebriated state Chuck gets Zamir to confess where the terrorists are located. Sarah succeeds in opening the vault and rescues Chuck.|$|R
6000|$|In this autumn {{he went up}} to London {{long before}} his family, and then found them at Merle Park on the Saturday after their arrival there. They had gone down on the {{previous}} Wednesday. On the Saturday, when he entered the house, the first thing he saw was Mr. Traffick's hat in the hall. This was Saturday, 23rd November, and there would be three months before Parliament would meet! A curse was not muttered, but just formed between his teeth, as he saw the hat. Sir Thomas, in his angriest mood, never went so far as quite to mutter his curses. Will one have to expiate the anathemas which are well kept within the barrier of the teeth, or only those which have achieved some amount of utterance? Sir Thomas went on, with a servant at his heels, <b>chucking</b> about the <b>doors</b> rather violently, till he found Mr. Traffick alone in the drawing-room. Mr. Traffick had had a glass of sherry and bitters brought in for his refreshment, and Sir Thomas saw the glass on the mantelpiece. He never took sherry and bitters himself. One glass of wine, with his two o'clock mutton chop, sufficed him till dinner. It was all very well to be a Member of Parliament, but, after all, Members of Parliament never do anything. Men who work don't take sherry and bitters! Men who work don't put their hats in other people's halls without leave from the master of the house! [...] "Where's your mistress?" [...] said Sir Thomas, to the man, without taking any notice of his son-in-law. The ladies had only just come in from driving, were very cold, and had gone up to dress. Sir Thomas went out of the room, again banging the door, and again taking no notice of Mr. Traffick. Mr. Traffick put his hand up to the mantelpiece, and finished his sherry and bitters.|$|R
