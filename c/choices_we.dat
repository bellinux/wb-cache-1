25|$|A modern {{audience}} might admire Batty’s will to {{flee the}} confinements of slavery and perhaps sympathize with his existential struggle to live. Initially, however, his desire to live is subsumed by his desire for power to extend his life. Why? In Heidegger’s view, because death inevitably limits the number of <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> have, freedom is earned by properly concentrating on death. Thoughts of mortality give us a motive for taking life seriously. Batty’s status as a slave identifies him as an object, but his will to power casts him as an agent and subject in the Nietzschean sense. His physical and psychological courage to rebel is developed as an ethical principle in which he revolts against a social order that has conspired against him at the genetic, cultural, and political levels. In Heidegger’s view, Batty’s willingness to defy social conformity allows for him to authentically pursue the meaning of his existence beyond his programming as a soldier. Confronting his makers becomes part of his quest, but killing them marks his failure to transcend his own nature.|$|E

On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested me is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated me is the way we arrive at the <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> make. The idea of this film is to say that the <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
500|$|The {{title was}} derived from a line from [...] "The Nurse's Song" [...] by English poet William Blake: [...] "And all the hills echoed". In January 2013, Publishers Weekly {{announced}} the publication date as May 21 of that year, and Riverhead Books released a statement that the novel was about [...] "how we love, how {{we take care of}} one another, and how the <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> make resonate through generations". First printed in hardback, And the Mountains Echoed was priced at $28.95 in the United States and £14.99 in the United Kingdom. Hosseini went on a five-week tour to 41 cities across America to promote the book. In October 2013, plans were confirmed to translate And the Mountains Echoed into 40 languages, among them Icelandic and Malay.|$|E
40|$|Emotions like regret {{and envy}} {{share a common}} origin: they are {{motivated}} by the counterfactual thinking of {{what would have happened}} had we made a different <b>choice.</b> When <b>we</b> contemplate the outcome of a <b>choice</b> <b>we</b> made, we may use the information on the outcome of a <b>choice</b> <b>we</b> did not make. Regret is the purely private comparison between two <b>choices</b> that <b>we</b> could have taken, envy adds to this the information on outcome of choices of others. However, envy has a distinct social component, in that it adds the change in the social ranking that follows a difference in the outcomes. We study the theoretical foundation and the experimental test of this view...|$|R

He was asked for [...] "20 things, like an ocean liner horn," [...] and Hutchins knew he had the music Hillenburg was looking for. Hutchins said [...] "I offered him options and, in some cases, multiple <b>choices.</b> <b>We</b> agreed to meet at the Warner Bros. gate near the water tower in 20 minutes."

[...] Ambrose made the remarks after Dryden commented on a poll that analyzed child care choices by Canadian families. Dryden won generally favourable reviews for his performance in Cabinet.|$|E

2500|$|After {{leaving the}} {{presidency}} in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft Johnson's first book, The <b>Choices</b> <b>We</b> Face, and work with him on his memoirs entitled The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969, published in 1971. That year, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened {{on the campus of}} The University of Texas at Austin. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, with the provision that the ranch [...] "remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past".|$|E

"Lomborg specialises in {{presenting}} {{the reader with}} false choices - such as the assertion that money not spent on preventing climate change could be spent on bringing clean water to the developing world, thereby saving more lives per dollar of expenditure. Of course, in the real world, {{these are not the}} kind of <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> are faced with. Why not take the $60 billion from George Bush's stupid Son of Star Wars program and use that cash to save lives in Ethiopia? Because in a world where political choices are not made democratically at a global level, but by a small number of rich countries and corporations, the poor and the environment are never going to be a priority." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Garden of Forking Paths" [...] (1941) {{presents}} {{the idea of}} forking paths through networks of time, none {{of which is the}} same, all of which are equal. Borges uses the recurring image of [...] "a labyrinth that folds back upon itself in infinite regression" [...] so we [...] "become aware of all the possible <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> might make." [...] The forking paths have branches to represent these choices that ultimately lead to different endings. Borges saw man's search for meaning in a seemingly infinite universe as fruitless and instead uses the maze as a riddle for time, not space. Borges also examined the themes of universal randomness ("The Lottery in Babylon") and madness ("The Zahir"). Due {{to the success of the}} [...] "Forking Paths" [...] story, the term [...] "Borgesian" [...] came to reflect a quality of narrative non-linearity.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{says the}} idea of free will [...] "cannot be mapped on to any {{conceivable}} reality" [...] and is incoherent. According to Harris, science [...] "reveals {{you to be a}} biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, [...] "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These <b>choices</b> <b>we</b> make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change {{the way we think about}} some of the most important questions in life.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the inauguration}} {{ceremony}} of Richard Nixon on January 20, 1969, Middleton {{returned to the}} LBJ Ranch in Stonewall, Texas, with Lyndon Johnson {{in the role of}} Special Assistant to the former President. From 1969 until May 18, 1970, he worked with Johnson on two books: The <b>Choices</b> <b>We</b> Face, (March 1969) and The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969 (1971). [...] In 1970, Johnson named him the director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum (LBJ Library) {{on the campus of the}} University of Texas at Austin. The building and grounds for the LBJ Library, the first to be located on a university campus, were donated by the University of Texas and are operated by the National Archives of the General Services Administration. The Library opened on May 22, 1971 and Middleton was responsible for its direction for the next 31 years until his retirement in 2002. Middleton also served as Executive Director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation from 1993 until 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The avenues {{from which}} teams {{acquired}} marquée talent started to close and DeWitt, recognizing {{that he needed}} to change his club's approach to stay competitive, went about [...] "abandoning a philosophy of chasing big names" [...] that had netted such stars as McGwire, Edmonds, Kile, Édgar Rentería and Rolen. [...] Said DeWitt, [...] "We had great teams in that era, but I knew that that wasn’t sustainable because as that group aged, we would need younger players. [...] With the new labor agreement that was coming in, teams were holding on to their players." [...] He added, [...] "we were opportunistic prior to that by getting players from other clubs, but we made a conscious decision back in the ’03 and ’04 time frame {{that we were going to}} throw a lot of resources and make every effort to build from within ... Rather than giving up draft <b>choices,</b> <b>we</b> tried to accumulate draft choices." [...] To avert continual reliance on signing free agents and trading for stars already in their prime, DeWitt sought to place the expertise of people like Jeff Luhnow to create an efficient player development system utilizing the entire organization. [...] DeWitt hired him in 2003 to become the vice president of baseball development. [...] As Luhnow lacked a baseball background, his hire was seen as unconventional, but DeWitt saw potential in the Northwestern graduate with an MBA because of his business background and analytical ability.|$|E
