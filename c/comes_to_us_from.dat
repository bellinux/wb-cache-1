25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving mathematical {{treatment of}} regular polygons and polyhedra <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> ancient Greek mathematicians. The five Platonic solids {{were known to}} them. Pythagoras knew {{of at least three}} of them and Theaetetus (c. 417 BC – 369 BC) described all five. Later, Euclid wrote a systematic study of mathematics, publishing it under the title Elements, which built up a logical theory of geometry and number theory. His work concluded with mathematical descriptions of the five Platonic solids.|$|E
25|$|The first written {{account of}} present-day Alberta <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the fur trader Anthony Henday, who {{explored}} {{the vicinity of}} present-day Red Deer and Edmonton in 1754–55. He spent the winter {{with a group of}} Blackfoot, with whom he traded and went buffalo hunting. Other important early explorers of Alberta include Peter Fidler, David Thompson, Peter Pond, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Simpson. The first European settlement was founded at Fort Chipewyan by MacKenzie in 1788, although Fort Vermilion disputes this claim, having also been founded in 1788.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reference}} to their simple life <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the Tasbih of Fatimah, a divine formula that was first given to Fatimah {{when she asked}} her father for a kaneez (servant girl) {{in order to help}} her with household chores. Her father asked her if she would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.|$|E

60|$|Oh--Balzac--what a loss! One of the {{greatest}} and (most) original writers of the age gone from us! To hear this news made Robert and me very melancholy.

Soulié, Bernard, gone too; George Sand translating Mazzini; Sue in a socialistical state of decadence--what he means by writing such trash as the 'Péchés' I really can't make out; only Alexandre Dumas keeping his head up gallantly, and he seems to me to write better than ever. Here is a new book, just published, by Jules Sandeau, called 'Sacs et Parchemins'! Have you seen it? It miraculously <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the little Siena library.|$|E

He was a soldier, and an Indian soldier too; and if there's anything more certain to me than the principle that all fighting is very wrong and indefensible, it's the principle that our rule in India is utterly unjust and wicked. So instead of being proud of my father's profession, much as I respected him, I'm profoundly ashamed of it; {{and it has been}} a great question to me always how far I was justified at all in living upon the pension given me for his Indian services.' ...|$|E

6000|$|And {{so there}} they were at last, in [...] "their resting graves." [...] So long as men do their duty, even if it be greatly in a misapprehension, they will be leading pattern lives; {{and whether or not}} they come to lie beside a martyrs' monument, we may be sure they will find a safe haven somewhere in the {{providence}} of God. It is not well to think of death, unless we temper the thought with that of heroes who despised it. Upon what ground, is of small account; if it be only the bishop who was burned for his faith in the antipodes, his memory lightens the heart and makes us walk undisturbed among graves. And so the martyrs' monument is a wholesome heartsome spot in the field of the dead; and as we look upon it, a brave influence <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the land of those who have won their discharge and, in another phrase of Patrick Walker's, got [...] "cleanly off the stage." ...|$|E
60|$|Though we, happily, {{no longer}} {{believe in the}} terror by night, which of old was thought to come from witches, ghosts, demons, {{yet there is a}} terror by night in which we must believe, for it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> God, and should be listened to as the voice of God, even that terror about our own sinfulness, folly, weakness, which comes to us in dreams and sleepless nights. We may learn from these night fancies and night thoughts; for they are often God's message to us, calling us to repentance and {{amendment}} of life. They are often God's Book of Judgment, wherein our sins are written, which God is setting before us, and showing us the things we have done. God sends dreams to men which enable them to look back, and recollect things past, which they had forgot only too easily; and these humble and penitential dreams are God's warning that (as the Article says) the infection of nature doth remain even in those who are regenerate, and that nothing but the continual help of God's Spirit will keep us from falling back or falling away.|$|E
60|$|John Quincy Adams, {{making a}} speech at New Bedford, many years ago, {{reckoned}} the number of whale-ships (if I remember rightly) that sailed out of that port, and, comparing it with some former period, {{took it as a}} type of American success. But, alas! it is with quite other oil that those far-shining lamps of a nation's true glory which burn forever must be filled. It is not by any amount of material splendor or prosperity, but only by moral greatness, by ideas, by works of imagination, that a race can conquer the future. No voice <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the once mighty Assyria but the hoot of the owl that nests amid her crumbling palaces. Of Carthage, whose merchant-fleets once furled their sails in every port of the known world, nothing is left but the deeds of Hannibal. She lies dead on the shore of her once subject sea, and the wind of the desert only flings its handfuls of burial-sand upon her corpse. A fog can blot Holland or Switzerland out of existence. But how large is the space occupied in the maps of the soul by little Athens and powerless Italy! They were great by the soul, and their vital force is as indestructible as the soul.|$|E

60|$|But, {{though we}} happily no longer {{believe in the}} terror by night which comes from witches, demons, or ghosts, there is another kind of terror by night in which we must believe, for it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> God, and should be listened to {{as the voice of}} God: even that terror about our own sinfulness, folly, {{weakness}} which comes to us in dreams or in sleepless nights. Some will say, 'These painful dreams, these painful waking thoughts, are merely bodily, and can be explained by bodily causes, known to physicians.' Whether they can or not, matters very little to you and me. Things may be bodily, and yet teach us spiritual lessons. A book--the very Bible itself--is a bodily thing: bodily leaves of paper, printed with bodily ink; and yet out of it we may learn lessons for our souls of the most awful and eternal importance. And so with these night fancies and night thoughts. We may learn from them. We are forced often to learn from them, whether we will or not. They are often God's message to us, calling us to repentance and amendment of life. They are often God's book of judgment, wherein our sins are written, which God is setting before us, and showing us the things which we have done.|$|E
60|$|Colville slept late, and awoke with a vague {{sense of}} self-reproach, which faded {{afterward}} to such poor satisfaction as <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> {{the consciousness of}} having made {{the best of a}} bad business; some pangs of softer regret mixed with this. At first he felt a stupid obligation to keep indoors, and he really did not go out till after lunch. The sunshine had looked cold from his window, and with the bright fire which he found necessary in his room, he fancied a bitterness in the gusts that caught up the dust in the piazza, and blew it against the line of cabs on the other side; but when he got out into the weather he found the breeze mild and the sun warm. The streets were thronged with people, and at all the corners there were groups of cloaked and overcoated talkers, soaking themselves full of the sunshine. The air throbbed, as always, with the sound of bells, but it was a mellower and opener sound than before, and looking at the purple bulk of one of those hills which seem to rest like clouds {{at the end of each}} avenue in Florence, Colville saw that it was clear of snow. He was going up through Via Cavour to find Mr. Waters and propose a walk, but he met him before he had got half-way to San Marco.|$|E
60|$|He who, {{a hundred}} years ago, more or less, {{pronounced}} the above words in the uneasiness of his heart, thirsting for professional distinction, was a young naval officer. Of his life, career, achievements, and end nothing is preserved for the edification of his young successors in the fleet of to-day--nothing but this phrase, which, sailor-like in the simplicity of personal sentiment and strength of graphic expression, embodies {{the spirit of the}} epoch. This obscure but vigorous testimony has its price, its significance, and its lesson. It <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> a worthy ancestor. We do not know whether he lived long enough for a chance of that promotion whose way was so arduous. He belongs to the great array of the unknown--who are great, indeed, by the sum total of the devoted effort put out, and the colossal scale of success attained by their insatiable and steadfast ambition. We do not know his name; we only know of him what is material for us to know- -that he was never backward on occasions of desperate service. We have this on the authority of a distinguished seaman of Nelson's time. Departing this life as Admiral of the Fleet {{on the eve of the}} Crimean War, Sir Thomas Byam Martin has recorded for us amongst his all too short autobiographical notes these few characteristic words uttered by one young man of the many who must have felt that particular inconvenience of a heroic age.|$|E
