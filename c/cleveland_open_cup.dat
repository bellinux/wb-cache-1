50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of flash point measurement: open cup and closed cup. In open cup devices, the sample is {{contained}} in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with {{the height of the}} flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the fire point.

30|$|Important {{properties}} for biodiesel are kinematic viscosity, pour point, flash point, initial boiling point, final boiling point, {{gross calorific value}} and cetane number. Kinematic viscosity (ASTM D 445) was measured using Cannon–Fenske viscometer at 40  °C. Pour point and flash point were measured as per ASTM D 97 and ASTM D 93 method using manual pour point and <b>Cleveland</b> <b>open</b> <b>cup</b> apparatus, respectively. Initial and final boiling points for SOME biodiesel were obtained by distillation method (ASTM D 86) using electrically heated distillation apparatus assembly. Gross calorific values and cetane numbers were obtained from bomb calorimeter (Model: LECO, AC 350, UK) and portable MID/NIR-FTIR spectrometer (Model: ERASPEC: eralytics GmbH, Austria), respectively. Composition of FAME in SOME biodiesel was analysed by gas chromatograph (Chemito GC 8, 610) with a SGE forte GC capillary column (BPX 70, 25  m ×  0.53  mm ×  0.5  µm). Temperatures of column, injector and detector ports were maintained at 230  °C, 24  °C and 280  °C, respectively, during analysis.|$|E
