40|$|Inductive {{hot-pressing}} is a field-assisted {{sintering process}} (FAST) {{in which an}} electrical current is used to enhance the densification of the powder. Inductive hot-pressing could be employed to enable titanium powder to reach a higher density {{in less time than}} the pressing and sintering process. In this study, titanium and titanium alloy powders with different features were processed by means of inductive hot-pressing. The influence of processing temperature on density, microstructure, quantity of interstitial elements and hardness was investigated. Generally, practically fully dense materials were obtained without any <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up,</b> even if the materials were in contact with the graphite matrix during processing. Nevertheless, there was an increment of the nitrogen content and some oxygen pick-up, especially for the powders with smaller particle size. Hardness is not significantly affected by the pressing temperature, but it strongly depends on the amount of interstitials.

40|$|The {{premature}} {{failure of a}} horizontal heat-exchanger, which occurred after service exposure at 580 degrees C for 50, 000 h, revealed the occurrence of extensive through-thickness cracking in approximately 40 % of the tube/stationary tube-sheet welds. Additionally, the internal surface of the welded joint featured intensive secondary intergranular cracking (up to 250 mu m deep), preferential formation of a 150 mu m thick layer of (Fe, Cr) (3) O- 4 and internal intergranular oxidation (40 mu m deep). The welded region also showed intense <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up</b> and, as consequence, severe precipitation of intergranular M 7 C 3 and M 23 C 6 carbides. The fracture surface was composed of two distinct regions: a ""planar"" region of 250 mu m, formed due to the stable crack growth along by the intergranular oxidation; and a slant region with radial marks, formed by the fast crack growth along the network of intergranular carbides. The association of intergranular oxidation pre-cracks with microstructural embrittlement promoted the {{premature failure}}, which took place by an overload mechanism, {{probably due to the}} jamming of the floating tube-sheet during the maintenance halt (cooling operation).

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> foil time <b>pick-up</b> {{detectors}} {{used in the}} time-of-flight {{measurements of}} MeV energy ions have been studied in connection to time-of-flight-energy spectrometer used for heavy ion elastic recoil detection analysis. In experimental coincident TOF-E data characteristic halos are observed around light element isobars, and the origin of these halos were studied. The experimental data indicated that these halos originate from single electron events occurring before the electron multiplication in the microchannel plate. By means of electron trajectory simulations, this halo effect is explained to originate from single electron, emitted from the carbon foil, hitting the non-active area of the microchannel plate. This electron creates a secondary electron from the surface and which ends up to the microchannel plate pore, is multiplied and create now a detectable signal. Other general timing gate parameters such as wire-to-wire spacing of the grids, acceleration potential of the 1 st grid and the mirror grid potential gradient were also studied {{in order to improve}} the detector performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carbon</b> foil time <b>pick-up</b> {{detectors}} {{are widely}} used in pairs in ion beam applications as time-of-flight detectors. These detectors are suitable for a wide energy range and for all ions but at the lowest energies the tandem effect limits the achievable time of flight and therefore the energy resolution. Tandem effect occurs when an ion passes the first carbon foil of the timing detector and its charge state is changed. As the carbon foil of the first timing detector has often a non-zero voltage the ion can accelerate or decelerate {{before and after the}} timing detector. The combination of different charge state properties before and after the carbon foil now induces spread to the measured times of flight. We have simulated different time pick-up detector orientations, voltages, ions and ion energies to examine the tandem effect in detail and found out that the individual timing detector orientation and the average ion charge state have a very small influence to the magnitude of the tandem effect. On the other hand, the width of the charge state distribution for particular ion and energy in the first carbon foil, and the carbon foil voltage contributes linearly to the magnitude of the tandem effect. In the simulations low energy light ion trajectories were observed to bend in the electric fields of the first timing gate, and the magnitude of this bending was studied. It was found out that 50 – 150 keV proton trajectories can even bend outside the second timing gate...|$|R
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{improvements in}} metal casting processes by reducing scrap {{and reducing the}} cost of production, due to scrap reduction from investment casting and yield improvement offered by lost foam casting as compared to no-bake or green sand molding. The objectives for the investment casting portion of the subtask are to improve knowledge of fracture toughness of mold shells and the sources of strength limiting flaws and to understand the effects of wax reclamation procedures on wax properties. Applying 'clean steel' approaches to pouring technology and cleanliness in investment casting of steel are anticipated to improve incoming materials inspection procedures as they affect the microstructure and toughness of the shell. This project focused on two areas of study {{in the production of}} steel castings to reduce scrap and save energy: (1) Reducing the amount of shell cracking in investment cast steel production; (2) Investigate the potential of lost foam steel casting The basic findings regarding investment casting shell cracking were: (1) In the case of post pouring cracking, this could be related to phase changes in silica upon cooling and could be delayed by pouring arrangement strategies that maintained the shell surface at temperature for longer time. Employing this delay resulted in less adherent oxidation of castings since the casting was cooler at the time o fair exposure. (2) A model for heat transfer through water saturated shell materials under steam pressure was developed. (3) Initial modeling result of autoclave de-waxing indicated the higher pressure and temperature in the autoclave would impose a steeper temperature gradient on the wax pattern, causing some melt flow prior to bulk expansion and decreasing the stress on the green shell. Basic findings regarding lost foam casting of steel at atmospheric pressure: (1) EPS foam generally decomposes by the collapse mode in steel casting. (2) There is an accumulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up</b> {{at the end of the}} casting opposite the gate. (3) It is recommended that lost foam castings in steel be gated for a quiescent fill in an empty cavity mold to prevent foam occlusion defects from the collapse mode. The energy benefit is primarily in yield savings and lower casting weight per function due to elimination of draft and parting lines for the larger lost foam castings. For the smaller investment casting, scrap losses due to shell cracking will be reduced. Both of these effects will reduce the metal melted per good ton of castings. There will also be less machine stock required per casting which is a yield savings and a small additional energy savings in machining. Downstream savings will come from heavy truck and railroad applications. Application of these processes to heavy truck castings will lighten the heavy truck fleet by about ten pounds per truck. Using ten years to achieve full penetration of the truck fleet at linear rate this will result in a fuel savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|E
40|$|This work investigates high {{temperature}} (1550 ºC) interactions of alumina-carbon refractories with liquid iron with specific {{focus on the}} chemical interactions occurring both in the interfacial region {{as well as in}} the bulk of the refractory. The sessile drop technique was used to determine the interfacial wetting behaviour and the phase transformations during the chemical reactions were determined using SEM, EDS and X-ray diffraction. Alumina-carbon refractories were prepared using two types of carbonaceous materials - synthetic graphite and natural graphite. From the experimental results, it was clearly observed that molten iron had penetrated to varying extents into all refractory substrates. The highest penetration was observed for alumina-carbon refractory substrates containing 10 % synthetic graphite, while all alumina-natural graphite substrates showed much lower levels of metal penetration. The drop in the contact angles was in direct correspondence with increasing carbon pickup values for these samples. Natural graphite samples also showed lower carbon pickup compared to synthetic graphite samples of similar carbon content. The differences in metal penetration and interfacial wetting behaviour were found to depend on the carbon pickup and the ash content of the refractory substrates, with the ash helping in the formation of an interfacial layer which limited reactions with the metal, and in filling the pores within the refractory. To determine the chemical interaction of Al 2 O 3 - 10 %C refractory molten iron at 1550 °C, investigations were also carried out in argon atmosphere for time periods ranging between 15 minutes to 3 hours. Video images of the iron droplet started to show minor deviations after 30 minutes of contact followed by intense activity in the form of fine aluminium oxide whiskers emanating from the droplet and on the refractory substrate. The interfacial region also changed significantly over time and the formation of small quantities of iron aluminide intermetallics was recorded after 30 minutes as a reaction product in the interfacial region. This shows that alumina cannot be treated as chemically inert at steelmaking temperatures when both carbon and molten iron are simultaneously present. High temperature interactions of recycled refractory (mixture of used and virgin refractory) substrates with liquid iron were also investigated to determine the role of used refractory constituents which contains degraded alumina, carbon and iron contamination from used refractory. The presence of iron and reactive alumina in the refractory substrates was seen to affect both physical and chemical interactions, contact angles and <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up.</b> The structural integrity and bonding of the recycled refractory was also compromised, and interfacial cracks were observed along with increases in the interfacial area of contact of metal droplet with refractory. Video images also showed whisker formation on metal droplets during 30 minutes of reaction time. The results from this study have shown that metal contaminated used refractories tend to enhance refractory degradation during recycling and are therefore unsuitable for steelmaking applications...|$|E
40|$|The repassivation of a {{commercial}} grade 18 % Cr 8 % Ni austenitic stainless steel in neutral deoxygenated water at 313, 353, 393, 433 and 473 °K was studied by XPS, obtaining composition profiles by argon ion etching. Evaluation of the technique revealed the negligible effect of the sample transfer through air from the spectrometer to the corrosion cell, but photoelectron attenuation and reduction in peak definition resulted from organic <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up</b> from water and spectrometer vacuum. Where necessary multiplet analysis by curve synthesis was carried out to determine the spectral peak heights of overlapping peaks. Quantitative analysis was based upon spectral peak normalization using experimentally determined sensitivity factors. For the experiments in the temperature range 393 to 473 °K, a PTFE corrosion cell with a built-in heater was constructed which was used in a nitrogen filled pressure vessel. XPS analysis revealed three types of passive layer: (1) An outer water-rich contaminent layer (2) A passive film consisting of Cr 3 + Fe 2 + Fe 3 + O= and OH- (3) An interfacial zone consisting of internally oxidised regions of the steel. The outer contaminent layer was most prominent in the 313 to 353 °K temperature range. It consisted of water possibly hydrogen-bonded to acreated organic molecules. At 313 and 353 °K, the unreacted nickel of the alloy showed an attenuation of the 2 p 3 / 2 signal with exposure, which presented {{a unique opportunity to}} calculate film thickness. This was only possible at these lower temperatures where no interfacial zones were observed. The film thickness was estimated at approximately 2. 0 nm. At the higher temperatures it was possible to consider the etch-time to be proportional to the film thickness. The films formed at 393 and 433 °K were found to be of a comparable thickness to those formed at 313 and 353 °K. The passive films formed at 313 and 353 °K revealed chromium-rich and iron-rich areas. Slight chromium enrichment was found at 353 °K. The more comprehensive analysis at 393 and 433 °K found evidence of a distinct iron-rich, possibly spinel region in the outer layer, and an inner chromium-rich region, possibly of a corrundum structure. There was no strong evidence of selective oxidation or dissolution in these outer layers. The films in this range of temperature were concluded to conform to the Mott-Cabrera, field-induced growth theory for the low temperature oxidation of metals. The outer layer was thought to correspond to the initial barrier film. The inner layer was thought {{to be the result of}} a solid-state reduction/oxidation reaction between chromium metal and magnetite, and the original metal/film interface, resulting in Cr 2 O 3 and iron. Such a reaction could be responsible for the chromium enrichment of films formed at 313 and 353 °K. This reaction would precede the internal oxidation of the steel at these higher temperatures where anion diffusion would be sufficient to penetrate these passive films. On passing through breaks in the chromium-rich inner-layer the oxygen and hydroxyl anions were then able to react with the underlying steel, along grain boundaries and surface imperfections, resulting in an interfacial zone. The thermodynamically more favourable direct oxidation of the chromium metal would tend to arrest the former reaction. At 473 °K, the higher cation diffusion resulted in considerable film growth, corresponding to approximately 7 and 18 nm after 1 and 3 h respectively. The iron-rich and chromium-rich zones were again in evidence at this temperature. No selective dissolution or oxidation of the outer layers was observed. However, a considerable concentration of nickel ions as well as traces of copper ions were found to be enriched in the outer layers of the passive films. The nickel was thought to be incorporated in the film as NiFe 2 O 4, an extremely stable spinel. The concentration profile of nickel ions was assumed to be a function of the rate of film, growth. The overall film growth appeared to correspond to a logarithmic growth rate. Whereas the thickness of the interfacial zones formed at 393 and 433 °K were comparable to the passive film thickness, at 473 °K the greater rate of cation diffusion compared to anion diffusion resulted in interfacial zones to a depth of a fraction of the passive film thickness. Throughout this work the suitability of XPS to a study of this kind was evaluated, and various aspects of the analysis have been closely examined including the procedure for multiplet analysis and the experimental determinations of peak sensitivity factors for quantitative analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} more {{efficient}} blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron {{is one of the}} most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality. As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted. The carburiser cover method was used to measure <b>carbon</b> <b>pick-up</b> as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450 - 1550 ºC. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ºC for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s- 1) = 0. 47 to K (x 103 s- 1) = 14. 7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates. The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role. Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ºC was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123 - 129 º in the initial stages and between 109 - 114 º after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke. Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates. The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles. There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron...|$|E
