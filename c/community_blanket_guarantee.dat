40|$|Indonesia {{established}} a deposit insurance system to maintain stability in its banking sector after the abolishment of <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> in 2005. Since the insurance premiums are fixed and flat, deposit insurance may create {{an incentive for}} banks to take more risks and transfer the risks to the deposit insurer. Using an option pricing based model of deposit insurance, we compute the fair deposit insurance premiums for all banks listed on the Indonesian stock exchange. We find evidence that banks shifted their risks to the deposit insurer. The magnitude of risk-shifting incentives under the deposit insurance regime is higher than under the <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> regime, as Indonesian depositors seem to lack awareness in monitoring bank performance. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{and restructuring}} decisions {{in respect of}} a multinational bank (MNB) using Nash bargaining, when {{the threat of a}} panic motivates countries to take decisions quickly. The failure of the bank would cause unevenly distributed externalities between the countries concerned, which influences restructuring incentives. In equilibrium, the bank is either liquidated or one – or both of the countries – recapitalizes it. The partition of the recapitalisation costs is sensitive to the country-specific benefits and costs from recapitalisation, panics and liquidation. The home regulator benefits from the privilege of being the only entity that can legally liquidate the MNB. Rational expectations regarding the bargaining result affect the incentives to declare a <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee.</b> banking crises; bank restructuring; blanket guarantee; bargaining; deposit insurance...|$|R
40|$|Following the 1997 / 1998 {{financial}} crisis, Indonesian banks experienced major regulatory changes, {{including the}} adoption of the <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme (BGS) in 1998, a limited guarantee (LG) in 2005, and changes in capital regulation in 1998 and 2001. We examine the impact of these regulatory changes on market discipline during the period 1995 - 2009. The price of deposits is used to measure market discipline in a dynamic panel data methodology on a sample of 104 commercial banks. We find a weakening of market discipline following the introduction of the BGS. The result is consistent with the deposit insurance scheme being credible in the lower capital requirement environment. The adoption of LG in a recovering economy also mitigates the role of market discipline. However, market discipline is more pronounced in listed banks than unlisted banks and in foreign banks than domestic banks. These results have important implications for banking regulation and supervision, particularly during a crisis period.

40|$|In {{episodes of}} {{significant}} banking distress or perceived systemic {{risk to the}} financial system, policymakers have often opted for issuing <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> on bank liabilities to stop or avoid widespread bank runs. In theory, <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> can prevent bank runs if they are credible. However, guarantee could add substantial fiscal costs to bank restructuring programs and may increase moral hazard going forward. Using a sample of 42 episodes of banking crises, this paper finds that <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> are successful in reducing liquidity pressures on banks arising from deposit withdrawals. However, banks'' foreign liabilities appear virtually irresponsive to <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees.</b> Furthermore, guarantees tend to be fiscally costly, though this positive association arises {{in large part because}} guarantees tend to be employed in conjunction with extensive liquidity support and when crises are severe.

40|$|The <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{introduced}} in 1998 {{in response to}} the emerging banking and economic crisis resulted in $ 50 [*]billion of losses to the general public. The government has now introduced a law that allows the phasing out of this <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee,</b> but also allows its reinstatement {{in the event of a}} threatened collapse of the banking system. Rather than eliminating the possibility of any repetition of the previous banking disaster, the new law effectively mandates an almost identical approach to handling system-wide banking collapses in the future, suggesting that the authorities and their advisers learned very little from the recent bitter experience. It is argued here that the crucial starting point for formulating policy in this field is to specify correctly the exact purpose that government intervention is intended to serve: namely, the avoidance of major macroeconomic disruption as a result of bank failures. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{a measure}} {{to cope with the}} {{scarcity}} of liquidity in the nation's banking system, in late 1997 and early 1998 the central bank (Bank Indonesia), as a lender of the last resort, provided liquidity assistance loans to banks.

This process left the Indonesian banking system holding a large number of bad loans at the end of 1997.|$|R

Its total taxpayer cost was roughly 8% of the Finnish GNP, making it the most severe of the contemporary Nordic banking crises. The crisis has been attributed to a combination of macro-economic turbulence, weak regulation, and bank-specific problems.

40|$|Finding {{the causal}} effects of {{liquidity}} shocks on credit supply {{is complicated by}} the endogenous relation between loan demand and liquidity position of banks. This paper attempts to overcome this problem by exploiting, as a natural experiment, the exogenous deposit outflow prompted by the removal of a <b>blanket</b> deposit <b>guarantee</b> on time deposits in Japan. We find that during the period of transition from a <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> to a partial guarantee, weak banks suffered from a large outflow of partially insured time deposits. More importantly, we find that those weak banks were not able to raise a sufficient amount of other types of deposits {{to make up for the}} loss of time deposits, which, consequently, forced them to cut back on loan supply. These results are consistent with the theory that the imperfect substitutability of insured deposits and uninsured deposits affects the tightness of banks' financing constraints and ultimately the supply of bank loans.

The benchmark model suggests that a bank run is a business-cycle-state-related phenomenon and it leads to the failure of the risk-sharing mechanism provided by the banking sector. Extensions of the model show that a num-ber of policy instruments, including the suspension of convertibility of deposits, the taxation on short-term deposits, reserve requirement and <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee,</b> turn out to be inefficient. Instead, I propose that a limited-coverage deposit insurance scheme or capital requirements can be welfare-improving...|$|R

This effect is robust to a battery of falsification and placebo tests, and the competitive response also cannot be explained by alternative forces.

A higher frequency of interventions coincides with greater zombie bank presence, and increases in competition are larger when zombie banks occupy bigger market shares...|$|R

Using a sample of 42 episodes of banking crises, this paper finds that <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> do help to reduce liquidity pressures on banks, but only partially since they do not stem withdrawals from non-residents. Withdrawals following the announcement of guarantees are much more pronounced for non-resident liabilities than for foreign-currency denominated deposits—which may also be held by residents—suggesting that the results on non-residents are not driven by foreign-currency risk but by concerns about the government’s ability and commitment to honor the guarantee to non-resident liability holders...|$|R
50|$|Systemic banking crises are {{associated}} with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses. Frequently, emergency liquidity support and <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> {{have been used to}} contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy.|$|R

We estimate a simultaneous equations model of supply and demand for funds using quarterly data for Indonesian banks from 2002 to 2008. We find that, regardless of their type (state-owned or private entities), politically connected banks are able to attract deposits more easily than their non-connected counterparts. We also show that this effect is more pronounced after the implementation of formal deposit insurance with limited coverage. Our findings have various policy implications. Formal deposit insurance might have improved market discipline, as highlighted by earlier studies, but it has also exacerbated the issue of political connections in the banking sector...|$|R

Bail-outs of important creditors, sometimes including shareholders, and <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantees</b> for creditors become the norm. We argue that efficient incentives of banks’ creditors, {{as well as of}} shareholders and managers, require predetermined rules for dealing with banks in distress, and a group of creditors that are credibly non-insured. Cross-border banking increases the need for pre-determined bank insolvency procedures that could enable banks to expand cross-border in branches. In the empirical part we show that credibility of non-insurance is maximized with a partial deposit insurance scheme, and that the coverage can be decreased if effective rule-based distress resolution procedures are implemented...|$|R

This paper uses this deposit insurance reform as a natural experiment to investigate the relationship between deposit insurance coverage and market discipline. I find that the reform raised the sensitivity of interest rates on deposits, and that of deposit quantity to default risk. In addition, the interest rate differentials between partially insured large time deposits and fully insured ordinary deposits increased for risky banks. These {{results suggest that the}} deposit insurance reform enhanced market discipline in Japan. I also find that too-big-to-fail (TBTF) policy became a more important determinant of interest rates and deposit allocation after the reform, thereby partially offsetting the positive effects of the deposit insurance reform on overall market discipline.

This made it vulnerable to the key element of the crisis: massive reversal of foreign capital flows. Despite huge expenditures on restructuring, many of these weaknesses remain and the current strategy does not seem likely to overcome them. The alternative strategy explored here advocates the creation of 'savings banks', holding government bonds as their principal asset. With these safe assets, deposits in such institutions would be secure, even {{in the event of a}} major economic crisis. With this safe 'core', the rest of the financial system could develop on conventional lines (allowing removal of the current <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee,</b> and making it more feasible to close banks without this causing a run on the system as a whole).

Beyond these, among the lessons identified are how quickly things can get out of hand in an apparently strongly performing economy; that at the outset of a crisis information will be very limited; and that management of a crisis will be an evolving process. A <b>blanket</b> <b>guarantee</b> covering all bank liabilities may be indispensable; however, the authorities are 'buying time', and the more time that has to be bought the more expensive the process will be. Transparency too is indispensable, to generate public trust and support, and to ensure that actions taken by the authorities are irreversible. Overall, while not everything was done right, the strategy put in place had positive elements that have served to protect a core banking system and establish conditions for recovery. ...|$|R
