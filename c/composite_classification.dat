50|$|Russian degrees do {{not have}} <b>composite</b> <b>classifications</b> {{such as in the}} British system of First Class, Upper/Lower Second Class, Third Class, Pass, etc. This is because each course is {{examined}} independently, students must pass all of them, and they do not add up or contribute to an average grade or class.

Accordingly, all students would be expected to perform at or above the minimum level required to qualify and graduate. Calculation of an aggregate mark or GPA is not considered fair or even possible, as it would be felt to disregard much of a candidates academic work.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  5 that the {{classification}} feature algorithm proposed in this study can better eliminate the complex background and the halo interference, correctly detect the human target, and have a certain effect on the adhesion between human bodies. The application of <b>composite</b> <b>classification</b> features in infrared human target detection can not only improve the correct detection rate, but also reduce the missed detection rate and false detection rate to varying degrees. In the experiment, the combination of the direction gradient histogram feature and the other two features produces different results. For example, when we keep the characteristics of the direction gradient histogram unchanged and increase the physical features, the number of false detections and missed inspections is reduced, but the number of false positives is significantly reduced. However, when the inertia feature is increased, the number of missed inspections is significantly reduced, but the number of false positives is increased. When the three features are used simultaneously, the number of missed inspections and the number of false positives are significantly reduced. Therefore, the use of <b>composite</b> <b>classification</b> features can complement each other and comprehensively describe the characteristics of the human body in the infrared image, thereby improving the detection rate of the human body.|$|E

In addition to the previously known spiral arms of HE 2211 - 3903, the emission-line maps reveal a large scale ring with a radius of about 6 kpc which is connected to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) through a bar-like structure.

In a series of basic laboratory and pilot-scale tests, 20 tons of consumer goods scrap, classified by beneficiation criteria and polymer content, were reprocessed. ABS from vacuum cleaners and PP from coffee machines were recovered at purities of > 99 % and PVC from keyboard at a purity of abt. 91 %. Metal and polymer yields were 85 and 62 and 76 mass % respectively. In a next step, 340 tons of consumer goods scrap were continuously processed in bulk in a demonstration plant, applying a feed rate of 350 to 500 kg/h in the dry processing units and of 230 - 250 kg/h in the wet processing units. The following recycling rates were achieved: 62 % for small household appliances (ABS, PP, PC, metals), 82 % for pre-comminuted Deutsche Bundespost telephones (ABS, metals), 57 % for key telephones of various designs (ABS, metals) 82 % for automotive rear and flashing lamps (ABS/PMMA) and 87 % for pre-comminuted car bumpers (TPE/EPDM).

However, during the fitness process, {{the human body}} will dissipate more heat, which {{is different from the}} general state. Therefore, this study uses infrared sensing to collect images. In this study, an image fuzzy clustering segmentation method based on two-dimensional histogram is used. In this method, the gray information of the infrared image and the spatial information between the neighborhoods are combined to construct a two-dimensional histogram, which makes the object and the background easier to distinguish. In this study, the histogram is first divided into multiple regions for multi-cluster analysis, and then the distribution of clustering centers of different categories after clustering is analyzed. Finally, the maxima points are found and are used as the image segmentation threshold to separate the target from the image. In the case of linear inseparability, we map the sample to a high-dimensional feature space and use the original space function to implement the inner product operation in the high-dimensional feature space. In this way, we transform the nonlinear problem into a linear problem of another space to obtain the attribution of a sample.

40|$|Abstract Background Detection of {{sentences}} that describe protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in biomedical publications is a challenging and unresolved pattern recognition problem. Many state-of-the-art approaches for this task employ kernel classification methods, in particular support vector machines (SVMs). In this work we propose a novel data integration approach that utilises semantic kernels and a kernel classification method {{that is a}} probabilistic analogue to SVMs. Semantic kernels are created from statistical information gathered from large amounts of unlabelled text using lexical semantic models. Several semantic kernels are then fused into an overall <b>composite</b> <b>classification</b> space. In this initial study, we use simple features {{in order to examine}} whether the use of combinations of kernels constructed using word-based semantic models can improve PPI sentence detection. Results We show that combinations of semantic kernels lead to statistically significant improvements in recognition rates and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores over the plain Gaussian kernel, when applied to a well-known labelled collection of abstracts. The proposed kernel composition method also allows us to automatically infer the most discriminative kernels. Conclusions The results from this paper indicate that using semantic information from unlabelled text, and combinations of such information, can be valuable for classification of short texts such as PPI sentences. This study, however, is only a first step in evaluation of semantic kernels and probabilistic multiple kernel learning in the context of PPI detection. The method described herein is modular, and can be applied with a variety of feature types, kernels, and semantic models, in order to facilitate full extraction of interacting proteins. </p...|$|E

The current and potential biomedical uses, including biological imaging, cell tracking, magnetic bioseparation, nanomedicine and bio- and chemo-sensoring, of magnetic-fluorescent nanocomposites are also discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{implementation}} of a fast parallel architecture based on an improved principal component analysis (PCA) method called Composite PCA suitable for real-time face recognition is presented in this paper. The proposed architecture performs the tasks of both feature extraction and <b>classification.</b> <b>Composite</b> PCA takes in to consideration the local features of face images, which do not vary widely between face images of the same person taken under varying expression, illumination and pose. Hence it leads to a better recognition rate than PCA. Composite PCA has more parallelism than conventional PCA and this parallelism is utilized to design an efficient architecture capable of performing real-time face recognition. The face recognition system is implemented in an FPGA environment and tested using standard databases. The system is able to recognize a person from a database of 110 images of 10 individuals in approximately 4 ms...|$|R

After accelerated aging {{test of the}} composite was done, practical and effective methods for characterization and extraction of texture feature of microscopic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of composites were investigated in this paper, and involved data compression and classification recognition were studied as well. Through Angle Measure Technique (AMT) method, the complexity spectra, MA spectra, of the preprocessed SEM images of the composites were derived and then the first four principal components of MA spectra using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were extracted accordingly. Two kinds of classifiers based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were introduced to classify the SEM images into five different aging periods in this paper. The research results indicate that AMT method is a very novel and effective approach in texture feature characterization and analysis of SEM images of <b>composites</b> and high <b>classification</b> accuracy of SEM images in different aging periods by using intelligent recognition can be reached...|$|R
