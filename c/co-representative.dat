40|$|How {{and when}} do journalists define the {{boundaries}} of acceptable controversy? And {{how do they do}} so while appearing to remain objective? To answer these questions, this research analyzes mainstream newspaper coverage of the American abortion debate from 1972 through 1994. Using qualitative content analyses and quantitative regression analyses, I explore how journalists rhetorically position themselves and other actors in news stories. More specifically, I analyze the use of analytic and outraged rhetoric in stories about the abortion controversy. I identify the actors who are ascribed analytic rhetoric or outrage rhetoric, as well as when journalists themselves use such rhetoric. I compare these uses across article characteristics and political contexts, as well as over time. Findings show that to perform their objectivity, journalists adopt one of two roles: either that of neutral observer or that of guardian of consensus. Scholars have studied the first role but not the second. Both of these journalistic performances violate commitments to objectivity by implying certain conflicts and contenders are legitimate and others are beyond the pale of political acceptability. By serving as neutral observers and by serving as guardians of consensus journalists enact their commitment to objectivity not by being impartial but by being partial (to their understanding of shared public values). Ironically, however, when adhering to the norms of the guardianship of consensus, journalists undermine the paradigms of “objective journalism” (i. e., facticity, independence, balance) and a democratic public sphere (i. e., civil, representative or inclusive, and dialogic). In addition to this consequence, these performances also treat different groups of actors as either <b>co-representatives</b> of the public interest or as illegitimate challengers to those interests...|$|R

40|$|Juridical {{concepts}} and revolutionary conjunctures. In response to Michel analysis François Furets article raises both factual and methodological points. The former are {{relation to the}} Constitution of 1791 and more specifically {{to the right of}} suspensive veto granted to the king by the Constituants in September 1789. The debates that preceded the vote show that the idea was not to give the king share in the exercice of sovereignty but simply to allow for the possibility of re-examination of the work of the legislators by the people. It was not until the summer of 1791, with the feuillants revision, that the king, declared <b>co-representative</b> of the nation, would be officially associated with the exercice of sovereignty at exactly the moment when, following the Varennes episode, he no longer possessed any authority either political or moral. This disagreement with Michel Troper's interpretation of the extent of the power in 1789 - 1791 coincides with disagreement with his method. François Furet thinks {{that it is impossible to}} analyze Constitution as such by its text alone as if it were apure system of juridical norms informed by the correct theory of law. Even the jurist cannot forego historical enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the elaboration of Constitution the interpretation held of that Constitution by its authors and how that document was put into practice. Such an enquiry may not exhaust the study of constitutional document but it is certainly necessary condition for any such undertaking. Furet François.

30|$|Labor {{policies}} were also prepared {{on the same}} ideological platform. The AfD announced official acceptance of a minimum wage, but its true intention has been clouded by comments from its key members, {{and there has been}} no practical evidence of its support in the form of policy change (Nocun 2016 : 10 – 15). Bernd Lucke, who represented the party in its early stage, opposed the introduction of minimum wage promoted by the coalition between the CDU and the SPD, for the reason that it could harm national competitiveness. Frauke Petry, who was the <b>co-representative</b> of the party at that time, crudely criticized the minimum wage system at a press conference in April 2015, calling it “a way to kill jobs,” “socialistic romanticism,” and “neo-socialist ideology of the SPD” (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 2014). The AfD stipulated the maintenance of a minimum wage system in its basic doctrine {{for the first time in}} 2016, and reiterated it in its Federal Parliament election manifesto one year later. However, they only provided theoretical and abstract reasoning for why the system is needed, with no substantial content such as the amount of minimum wage that they would set (AfD 2016 a: 35; 2017 : 52). Policies related to temporary employment, such as dispatched work and subcontracts, were left in ambiguity for a long time. The party expressed clear opposition to related regulations before the 2014 European Parliament election, but did not reflect it in its basic doctrine due to conflicting views within the party (Nocun 2016 : 16 – 18). The official position of the party was finally confirmed before the 2017 Federal Parliament election, and it calls for the ratio of dispatched and subcontract workers to be limited to 15 %, for dispatched workers to be converted to full-time employees after six months of employment, and for part-time labor contracts to be extended only once (AfD 2017 : 52). These seem somewhat out of character, considering the basic position that the party has maintained so far.|$|E
30|$|In {{its early}} stage, the AfD {{was led by}} the {{economic}} liberal faction centered on Lucke. Lucke was a <b>co-representative</b> of the party, along with Adam and Petry, but in practice led the party on his own using his large vote share in the party representative election and publicity to legitimize his authority. Of the seven members of the AfD elected in the 2014 European Parliament election, five members identified themselves {{as part of the}} economic liberal faction – Lucke, Starbatty, and Henkel were all among them. It was only natural for their radical tendency to be translated into their policy. Furthermore, numerous economists {{who were involved in the}} party must have exerted a significant amount of influence on its economic policies. Economist Starbatty was the representative of the academic advisory committee of the party, and economist Vaubel, a member of the academic advisory committee under the German Ministry of Economics, was also part of the committee. According to Bebnowski and Förster (2014 : 14 – 18), this economic liberal faction was strongly rooted in ordoliberalism. The ordoliberal standpoint recognizes the role of the state, but holds that it should only exist for the market and not against it, and that the dissolution of the Eurozone was a rightful measure that could free the market from the reigns of politics. Furthermore, ordoliberals believe that in order for the principle of competition to work smoothly, market results should be left entirely to the individuals, and all artificial attempts to correct this under the name of social justice ruled out. Since the AfD was based on such ideals, its economic policies were adjusted to accommodate basic trends such as market liberalism, laissez faire and minimal state intervention philosophies, and anti-interventionism. These principles take form in more specific policies such as passive labor market intervention, reduction of social insurance expenditure, tax rate reduction, and tax repeal. Where the ideals of another faction within the party came in contact with radical market ideology, as it will be discussed below, the agenda of the economic liberal faction was converted into policies without much hindrance.|$|E
