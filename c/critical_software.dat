2500|$|A [...] "false positive" [...] or [...] "false alarm" [...] is when {{antivirus}} software identifies a non-malicious file as malware. [...] When this happens, {{it can cause}} serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable. Recovering from such damage to <b>critical</b> <b>software</b> infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken. For example, in May 2007 a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot.|$|E
