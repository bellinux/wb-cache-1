40|$|International audienceThe role of Si-O, Al-O, and Si-N bonds on the boson peak of {{silicate}} glasses {{has been}} investigated from a study of amorphous Si, SiO(2), and two <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminosilicates</b> with 0 (Ca 28 -O) and 4. 4 (Ca 28 -N) mol % Si(3) N(4). The low-frequency part of the vibrational density of states g(omega) has been calculated from inversion of literature data and new heat capacity measurements. As defined by g(omega) /omega(2), the boson peak correlates with the excess heat capacity observed with respect to Debye T(3) limiting law. That libration of SiO(4) tetrahedra represents {{the main source of}} low-frequency excitations in silica glass is illustrated by the strong difference between the anomalies of amorphous Si and SiO(2) glass and the marked decrease observed for SiO(2) phases of increasing density. When Al substitutes for Si, libration of AlO(4) tetrahedra appears hampered by the presence of a charge-compensating cation. Rigidification of the silicate network resulting from substitution of N for O causes the boson peak of Ca 28 -N to be smaller than that of Ca 28 -O and shifted toward higher frequencies as increased cross-linking hinders libration of SiO(4) or AlO(4) tetrahedra. In agreement with their universal phenomenology, the calorimetric boson anomalies of Ca 28 -O and Ca 28 -N plot on the master curve defined previously by SiO(2) and alkali silicate glasses.

The reactions were monitored for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 84 days. The major cation contents of the solutions were determined. Detailed characterization of cement samples was performed using SEM&EDS and EPMA. Density, porosity and air permeability were also determined in cement samples. Complete carbonation was achieved within 28 days in poz mix and 7 days in lightweight samples, while carbonation in neat cement is limited to about 200 microns after 84 days of reaction. A carbonation zone and a porous transition zone were observed in partially carbonated samples. These reaction zones can be delineated by the elemental profiles, which show Na enrichment and Cl depletion in carbonated cement. The carbonation zone is dominated by <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminosilicates.</b> Micro-analytical techniques show {{that some of these}} phases are compositionally similar to zeolites. Calcium carbonate formed in the carbonation zone and outgrowth of well-formed crystals was also observed. Near the surface, a region leached of calcium carbonate developed. Carbonation causes very little change in both the porosity and permeability in the neat cement sample. An increase in the porosity was measured in fully carbonated poz mix cement; however, the permeability remained essentially unchanged. For the lightweight cement, the permeability increased from 0. 16 to 1. 1 mD after 84 days of reaction, suggesting that carbonation results in the degradation of lightweight cement under the experimental conditions. The integrity of lightweight cement could be compromised if it is in contact with a considerable volume of CO 2 -rich brine that is not previously equilibrated with carbonate minerals...|$|R

Non-process {{elements are}} defined as those elements which are not essential to the chemical process, i. e., are neither active pulping chemicals (e. g., NaOH and Na₂S in the kraft process), nor compounds present {{as a result of}} incomplete conversion of makeup chemicals to active pulping chemicals. Problems associated with the build up of these elements include scaling, fouling and corrosion of heat exchangers, and various operating problems in the preparation of pulping liquors. A better understanding of the solubility of these elements in solutions similar to recovery cycles would facilitate the elimination of these problems. The solubility of aluminosilicates was measured in aqueous solutions of high ionic strengths and hydroxide ion concentrations. Temperature, ionic strength, hydroxide ion concentration and Al/Si ratio were varied to determine their effect on the solubility of aluminum and silicon. Several cations (Ca,Mg,Mn,V,Fe,K) were also studied to determine their effect on the solubility of aluminum and silicon. The results show that the solubility of aluminum and silicon increases with increasing hydroxide ion concentration and temperature, and decreases with increasing ionic strength. The solubility of aluminum and silicon was found to be a complicated function of Al/Si ratio at varying hydroxide ion concentrations and ionic strengths. Magnesium salts were found to decrease the solubility of aluminum when no silicon was present, but increase it when silicon was present. The other salts had no effect on the solubility of <b>aluminosilicates,</b> although <b>calcium</b> <b>aluminosilicates</b> were formed under some conditions.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} the solubility, {{structure}} and chemical composition of <b>calcium</b> (alkali) <b>aluminosilicate</b> hydrate (C-(N,K-) A-S-H) equilibrated at 50 °C is investigated in this paper. The tobermorite-like C-(N,K-) A-S-H products are more crystalline {{in the presence}} of alkalis, and generally have larger basal spacings at lower Ca/Si ratios. Both Na and K are incorporated into the interlayer space of the C-(N,K-) A-S-H phases, with more alkali uptake observed at higher alkali and lower Ca content. No relationship between Al and alkali uptake is identified at the Al concentrations investigated (Al/Si ≤ 0. 1). More stable C-(N,K-) A-S-H is formed at higher alkali content, but this factor is only significant in some samples with Ca/Si ratios ≤ 1. Shorter chain lengths are formed at higher alkali and Ca content, and cross-linking between (alumino) silicate chains in the tobermorite-like structure is greatly promoted by increasing alkali and Al concentrations. The calculated solubility products do not depend greatly on the mean chain length in C-(N,K-) A-S-H at a constant Ca/(Al + Si) ratio, or the Al/Si ratio in C-(N,K-) A-S-H.

The cements formed primarily consist of C-(N-) A-S-H gels, with hydrotalcite and disordered alkali aluminosilicate gels also identified in the solid product assemblages. Deconvolution of the 27 Al MAS NMR spectra enables the identification of three distinct tetrahedral Al sites, consistent with the 29 Si MAS NMR data, where Q 3 (1 Al), Q 4 (3 Al), and Q 4 (4 Al) silicate sites are identified. These results suggest significant levels of cross-linking in the C-(N-) A-S-H gel {{and the presence of}} an additional highly polymerized aluminosilicate product. The mean chain length, extent of cross-linking, and Al/Si ratio of the C-(N-) A-S-H gel decrease slightly over time. The de-cross-linking effect is explained by the key role of Al in mixed cross-linked/non-cross-linked C-(N-) A-S-H gels, because the cross-linked components have much lower Al-binding capacities than the noncross-linked components.

A mixed cross-linked and non-cross-linked tobermorite-like structural model for C-(N) -A-S-H is developed (the CSTM), which more appropriately describes the spectroscopic information available for this phase. Application of the CSTM to a Na 2 SiO 3 -activated slag cement cured for 56 and 180 days indicates the presence of a poorly-crystalline zeolite-like phase. The role of Al in cross-linking of C-(N-) A-S-H is also studied, which provides a more advanced description of the chemistry and structure of C-(N-) A-S-H than previously reported. A thermodynamic model for C-(N-) A-S-H (CNASH_ss) is derived, which greatly advances the utility of thermodynamic modelling of C-(N-) A-S-H-based cements by explicitly defining Al and alkali uptake in this phase. The chemistry of alkali-activated slag (AAS) -based cements is simulated using CNASH_ss and an ideal solid solution thermodynamic model for MgAl-OH-LDH that is also developed in the thesis. This analysis provides a good description of Na 2 SiO 3 -activated slag cement chemistry and accurately predicts chemical shrinkage in this material. Phase diagrams for NaOH, Na 2 SiO 3, Na 2 Si 2 O 5 and Na 2 CO 3 -activated slag-based cements are also simulated. These results can be used to design the chemistry of AAS-based materials. A detailed analysis of C-(N-) A-S-H solubility is presented, for Ca, Al, Si and alkali concentrations most relevant to C-(N-) A-S-H-based cements and at temperatures of 7 - 80 °C. Solubility products for alkali-free C-(N-) A-S-H change slightly between 7 °C and 80 °C and as a function of Al/Si ratio. However, less soluble C-(N-) A-S-H is formed at higher Ca and alkali content. These results are important for understanding the stability of C-(N-) A-S-H in the majority of cement-based materials used worldwide...|$|R
