40|$|We {{investigate}} the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) in converging geometries analytically and computationally. The linear, or small amplitude, regime is first covered {{as it is}} the onset to subsequent non-linear stages of the perturbation growth. While the plane interaction of a shock with a slightly perturbed density interface is classically viewed as a single interface evolving as baroclinic vorticity have been initially deposited on it, we propose a simple but more complete model characterizing the early interaction between the interface and the receding waves produced by the shock-interface interaction, {{in the case of a}} reflected shock. A universal time scale representing the time needed by the RMI to reach its asymptotic growth rate is found analytically and confirmed by ideal gas computations for various incident shock Mach numbers MI and Atwood ratios A, and could be useful especially for experimentalists in non-dimensionalizing their data. Considering again linear perturbations, we then obtain a general analytical model for the asymptotic growth rate reached by the instability during the concentric interaction of an imploding/exploding cylindrical shock with a cylindrical interface containing three-dimensional orthogonal perturbations, in the azimuthal and axial directions. Stable perturbations, typical of the converging geometry, are discovered. Comparisons are made with simulations where the effects of <b>compressibility,</b> <b>wave</b> reverberations, and flow convergence are isolated. Azimuthal and axial perturbation evolution are compared with results obtained for the plane RMI at comparable initial wavelengths. A second interaction occurs when the transmitted shock, produced by the incident converging shock impacting the interface, converges to the axis and reflects to reshock the initially accelerated interface. This leads to highly non-linear perturbation growth. To isolate the complex wave interaction process, the interface is considered initially unperturbed so that the flow is radially symmetric. An accurate visualization procedure is performed to characterize the underlying physics behind the reshock event. We study extensively the cylindrical and spherical geometry, for various MI and for the air -> SF 6 (A= 0. 67) and SF 6 -> (A=- 0. 67) interactions, and draw important differences with the equivalent plane configuration. A hybrid, low-numerical dissipation/shock-capturing method, embedded into an adaptive mesh refinement framework is optimized in order to achieve large-eddy simulations of the self-similar cylindrical converging shock-driven RMI and the turbulent mixing generated by the reshock. Computations are produced for MI= 1. 3 and 2. 0, and for air -> SF 6 SF 6 -> air interfaces. We develop statistics tools to study extensively the growth of the turbulent mixing zone using cylindrical averages as well as various measures such as probability density functions of the mixing and turbulent power spectra, with the objectives of understanding the turbulent mixing in this particular geometry...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{improving}} simulation efficiency for stratified-wavy gasliquid flows. Towards this goad, the simpler nature of incompressible two-phase flows is utilized for predicting hydraulic wave dynamics, both through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Numerical methods proposed for the incompressible two-fluid model include a hybridization of a finite volume method with analytical roll-wave profile solutions, a Method of Characteristics and finite volume hybridizations thereof, and a linearized Riemann solver (Roe scheme.) Theoretical analyses {{based on the same}} model further the understanding of Kelvin- Helmholtz stability in stratified pipe flows and provide a comprehensive account of how the flow stability predictions of numerical simulators depend on model discretization. Kelvin-Helmholtz/von Neumann analysis is shown to be a valuable support tool for choosing numerical scheme and simulation parameters. Finally, a dual grid scheme is proposed which enables us to extend the computational benefits of incompressible flow models to compressible systems. The dual grid scheme effectively decouples the length scales and numerical CFL restrictions of hydraulic (incompressible) waves from that of acoustic (<b>compressibility)</b> <b>waves.</b> Efficiency is observed to be improved by several orders of magnitude {{for a wide range of}} simulation cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{a small amount of}} gas within the saturating liquid of a porous medium on acoustic wave propagation is investigated. It is assumed that the gas volumes are spherical, homogeneously distributed, and that they are within a very narrow range of bubble sizes. It is shown that the compressibility of the saturating fluid is determined by viscous, thermal, and a newly introduced Biot-type damping of the oscillating gas bubbles, with mean gas bubble size and concentration as important parameters. Using a super-saturation technique, a homogeneous gas–liquid mixture within a porous test column is obtained. Gas bubble size and concentration are measured by means of <b>compressibility</b> experiments. <b>Wave</b> reflection and propagation experiments carried out in a vertical shock tube show pore pressure oscillations, which can be explained by incorporating a dynamic gas bubble behaviour in the linear Biot theory for plane wave propagation...|$|R

40|$|In this work, air compressibilty {{effects are}} {{investigated}} during wave interaction with an Oscillating Water Column (OWC) Wave Energy Converter (WEC). Mathematical modelling includes a thermodynamic equation {{for the air}} phase and potential flow equations for the water phase. A simple three dimensional OWC geometry with a linear Power Take Off (PTO) response is considered and both the thermodynamic and potential flow equations are linearised. Analysis of the {{linearised system of equations}} reveals a nondimensional coefficient which we name “compression number”. The flow potential is decomposed into scattering and radiation components, using an analogue of spring-dashpot response and taking into account the additional effects of air <b>compressibility</b> to <b>wave</b> interaction processes. We use these concepts to characterise the relative importance of the air compressibilty effects inside the OWC and to derive novel scaling relations for further investigation of scaling effects in OWC physical modelling.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the weakly-compressive {{high-frequency}} plasma waves which are superposed on a large-amplitude Alfvén wave in a multi-fluid plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and alpha particles. For these waves, the plasma environment is inhomogenous {{due to the}} presence of the low-frequency Alfvén wave with a large amplitude, a situation that may apply to space plasmas such as the solar corona and solar wind. The dispersion relation of the plasma waves is determined from a linear stability analysis using a new eigenvalue method that is employed to solve the set of differential wave equations which describe the propagation of plasma waves along the direction of the constant component of the Alfvén wave magnetic field. This approach also allows one to consider weak compressive effects. In the presence of the background Alfvén wave, the dispersion branches obtained differ significantly from the situation of a uniform plasma. Due to <b>compressibility,</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> are excited and couplings between various modes occur, and even an instability of the compressive mode. In a kinetic treatment, these plasma waves would be natural candidates for Landau-resonant wave-particle interactions, and may thus via their damping lead to particle heating.

The tests were made in the N. A. C. A. 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds Numbers up to 17, 000, 000. The results of the tests showed that the waviness common to airplane wings will cause no serious increase in drag unless the waviness exists on the forward part of the wing, where it may cause premature transition or premature <b>compressibility</b> effects. <b>Waves</b> 3 inches wide and 0. 048 inch high, for example, increased the drag 1 percent when they covered the rear 67 percent of both surfaces and 10 percent when they covered the rear 92 percent. A single wave 3 inches wide and only 0. 020 inch high at the 10. 5 -percent-chord point on the upper surface caused transition to occur on the wave and increased the drag 6 percent. Rib stitching increased the drag 7 percent when the rib spacing was 6 inches; the drag increment was proportional to the number of ribs for wider spacings.

40|$|Flow-generated noise, {{especially}} rotorcraft noise {{has been}} a serious concern for both commercial and military applications. A particular important noise source for rotorcraft is Blade-Vortex-Interaction (BVI) noise, a high amplitude, impulsive sound that often dominates other rotorcraft noise sources. In this thesis the research is to formulate and implement efficient computational tools for the development and study of optimal control and design strategies for complex flow/acoustic systems with emphasis on rotorcraft applications, especially BVI noise control problem. The main purpose of aeroacoustic computations {{is to determine the}} sound intensity and directivity far away from the noise source. However, the computational cost of using a high-fidelity flow-physics model across the full domain is usually prohibitive and it might also be less accurate because of the numerical diffusion and other problems. Taking advantage of the multi-physics and multi-scale structure of this aeroacoustic problem, we develop a multi-model, multi-domain (near-field/farfield) method based on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In this approach the coupling of multi-domains and multi-models is achieved by weakly enforcing continuity of normal fluxes across a coupling surface. For our interested aeroacoustics control problem, the adjoint equations that determine the sensitivity of the cost functional to changes in control are also solved with same approach by weakly enforcing continuity of normal fluxes across a coupling surface. Such formulations have been validated extensively for several aeroacoustics state and control problems. A multi-model based optimal control framework has been constructed and applied to our interested BVI noise control problem. This model problem consists of the interaction of a compressible vortex with Bell AH- 1 rotor blade with wall-normal velocity used as control on the rotor blade surface. The computational domain is decomposed into the near-field and far-field. The near-field is obtained by numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations while far away from the noise source, where the effect of nonlinearities is negligible, the linearized Euler equations are used to model the acoustic wave propagation. The BVI wave packet is targeted by defining an objective function that measures the square amplitude of pressure fluctuations in an observation region, at a time interval encompassing the dominant leading edge <b>compressibility</b> <b>waves.</b> Our control results show that a 12 dB reduction in the observation region is obtained. Interestingly, the control mechanism focuses on the observation region and only minimize the sound level in that region {{at the expense of other}} regions. The vortex strength and trajectory get barely changed. However, the optimal control does alter the interaction of the vortical and potential fields, which is the source of BVI noise. While this results in a slight increase in drag, there is a significant reduction in the temporal gradient of lift leading to a reduction in BVI sound levels. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Particularly, the combined effects of Mach number, Reynolds number, radial heating, and gap spacing are investigated. For a stationary outer cylinder, the primary instability is an axisymmetric mode independent of the Mach number. Increasing Mach numbers have a destabilizing effect for wide gaps, and a stabilizing effect for narrow gaps. For a sufficiently fast, counter-rotating outer cylinder, the primary instability becomes a three-dimensional traveling <b>wave.</b> <b>Compressibility</b> has a stabilizing effect on these modes regardless of the gap width; also, heating at the outer cylinder stabilizes the flow.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on air compressibility {{in the air}} chamber {{and its effects on}} the power conversion of oscillating water column (OWC) devices. As {{it is well known that}} for practical OWC plants, their air chambers may be large enough for accommodating significant air compressibility, the “spring effect,” an effect that is frequently and simply regarded to store and release energy during the reciprocating process of a wave cycle. Its insight effects on the device’s performance and power conversion, however, have not been studied in detail. This research will investigate the phenomena with a special focus on the effects of air <b>compressibility</b> on <b>wave</b> energy conversion. Air compressibility itself is a complicated nonlinear process in nature, but it can be linearised for numerical simulations under certain assumptions for frequency domain analysis. In this research work, air compressibility in the OWC devices is first linearised and further coupled with the hydrodynamics of the OWC. It is able to show mathematically that in frequency-domain, air compressibility can increase the spring coefficients of both the water body motion and the device motion (if it is a floating device), and enhance the coupling effects between the water body and the structure. Corresponding to these changes, the OWC performance, the capture power, and the optimised Power Take-off (PTO) damping coefficient in the wave energy conversion can be all modified due to air compressibility. To validate the frequency-domain results and understand the problems better, the more accurate time-domain simulations with fewer assumptions have been used for comparison. It is shown that air compressibility may significantly change the dynamic responses and the capacity of converting wave energy of the OWC devices if the air chamber is very large...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} aero-heat transfer studies performed in rotating turbine research facilities. Turbine heat transfer research had significant progress {{in the last few}} decades. Since the full-scale operational conditions of a modern gas turbine dictate high temperatures well in excess of 3600 oF and pressure ratios ranging from 20 to 50, experimental forced convection heat transfer research on the gas side of a rotating turbine environment is a techni-cally challenging task. The current paper provides a limited review of turbine heat transfer research in various facilities including short-dura-tion blow-down and large-scale/low-speed turbine systems. Since the final status of any forced convection heat transfer problem is closely related to the detailed structure of momentum transfer in highly 3 D, unsteady, rotating, and turbulent viscous flow environment, emphasis will also be placed on pertinent turbine aerodynamic features existing in turbines. The most significant parameters to simulate in a rotating aero-heat transfer facility can be listed as Reynolds number based on the blade chord, Mach number for <b>compressibility</b> and shock <b>wave</b> ef-fects, tip speed, intensity and scale of free-stream turbulence, Strouhal number for the unsteady wake passing effects, free-stream to wall temperature ratio, coolant to free-stream temperature ratio, specific heat ratio, molecular Prandtl number of the operating gas and a rota-tion number for turbine aero-heat transfer work performed under rota-tional conditions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{collision}} of water drops against small targets was studied experimentally {{by means of}} a high-speed photography technique. The drop impact velocity was about 3. 5 m/s. Drop diameters were in the range of 2. 8 - 4. 0 mm. The target was a stainless steel disk of 3. 9 mm diameter. The drop spread beyond the target like a central cap surrounded by a thin, slightly conical lamella bounded by a thicker rim. By mounting a small obstacle near the target, surface-tension driven Mach waves in the flowing lamella were generated, which are formally equivalent to the familiar <b>compressibility</b> driven Mach <b>waves</b> in gas dynamics. From the measurement of the Mach angle, the values of some flow parameters could be obtained as functions of time, which provided insight into the flow structure. The liquid flowed from the central cap to the liquid rim through the thin lamella at constant momentum flux. At a certain stage of the process, most of the liquid accumulated in the rim and the internal part of the lamella became metastable. In this situation, a rupture wave propagating through the metastable internal part of the lamella caused the rim to retract while forming outwardly directed secondary jets. The jets disintegrated into secondary droplets due to the Savart-Plateau-Rayleigh instability. Prior {{to the end of the}} retraction, an internal circular wave of rupture was formed. It originated at the target and then it propagated to meet the retracting rim. Their meeting resulted in a crown of tiny droplets. A theoretical analysis of the ejection process is proposed.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the settling behaviour and subsequent consolidation of sediments deposited under water has been hampered by the difficulty of recovering high quality samples. There is a need therefore to correlate in situ seismo-acoustic properties of these soils to the geotechnical properties required by engineers. To this end a laboratory study was made during which an instrumented sedimentation column was developed. This apparatus allowed the successful monitoring of compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity, electrical resistivity, pore pressure and bulk density {{in a number of}} natural marine sediments consolidating under self weight introduced into the column as a homogeneous slurry. The seismo-acoustic responses of the sediment samples were observed during primary consolidation, a period of over a thousand hours in some cases. Shear waves were found to be small amplitude waves travelling at velocities of less than Ilm/s. Shear wave velocity was subject to time dependent increase, or creep, thought to be a result of continued clay particle floc interaction during secondary consolidation. The velocity increased with decreasing porosity and increasing overburden but the effect of creep meant that no unique velocity-porosity relationship exists. Empirical relationships were established {{in order to determine the}} degree of consolidation and frame <b>compressibility</b> via shear <b>wave</b> velocity measurement. The Biot theory was used to predict the variation of compressional wave velocity as a function of porosity, bulk density and permeability. Frame and shear modulus measurements indicated that the model is justified in assuming weak soil frame parameters and a mass coupl ing factor equal to unity. The continually changing velocity relationship with porosity and bulk density can be satisfactorily modelled using the Geertsma and smit model. The full Biot model was found to predict permeability with reasonable accuracy in high porosity sediments but failed when applied to lower porosity soils. Results suggested that the soils studied exhibited anisotropy with respect to permeability...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} Afsluitdijk {{project the}} {{discharge}} capacity, which is currently facilitated by two sluice complexes, is increased to cope with future sea level rise. It was decided to realise this by an innovative solution: the pump gate. The steel lifting gates, each containing three pumps, will be implemented in the existing sluice complex in phases, expecting a total of thirteen by the year 2050. This concept provides the possibility of pumping when necessary without hampering the discharge capacity during gravity flow, {{in which case the}} gates are lifted. The gates were designed to withstand quasi-static loads. Mainly due to the presence of the pumps, which have a high weight and require limited vibrations, the dynamic behaviour of the gate may lead to more strict design requirements. Two reference designs are investigated: the regular, and flood defence pump gate. The latter is designed to act as part of the primary flood defence, and is therefore significantly more robust. The analysis of the pump gate is limited to three components: the gate structure with its supports, pumps, and fluid. Standard expressions for the hydrodynamic pressures do not apply to the pump gate and surrounding fluid, mainly due to the three-dimensional vibration shape of the gate and the presence of the pumps. General methods or numeric models to quantify vibrations are not readily available for a continuous system with interacting gate, pumps, and fluid. In this thesis, a method is developed to determine the dynamic behaviour of gate-fluid systems confined by sluices. This method is based on a frequency domain semi-analytical coupled modal analysis, able to directly solve the behaviour of gate and fluid for the linearized equations. Several fluid schematizations are found in literature taking surface <b>waves,</b> <b>compressibility,</b> or neither into consideration. The validity of these schematizations was investigated {{for a wide range of}} water depths and excitation frequencies. Distinct regions were found in which these physical processes do or do not have an effect on the hydrodynamic mass. The so-called `transition region' is characterised by the absence of both <b>compressibility</b> and surface <b>wave</b> effects. The hydrodynamic mass is therefore frequency-independent in this region and no hydrodynamic damping is present. The response of the pump gate reference designs is quantified by a three-dimensional plate model, based on previously described method. Both designs have considerably higher eigenfrequencies than those corresponding to regular wave excitation. For the Den Oever case, the quasi-static approach therefore suffices when considering wave loads. This is not the case for excitations originating from the pumps, which relate to a wider and higher frequency range. As a consequence of the preliminary design phase, exact pump specifications are not available. Results are therefore based on a pump envelope of possible excitations and presented as risks. These apply to the Den Oever gate designs, but are also relevant to the pump gate concept in general. Three response amplitudes were quantified: the gate's deflection, pump vibration velocity and the resulting fluid pressures. Furthermore, based on the amplification of the static deflection an estimation of the maximum stresses is made. For both designs maximum deflections were less than a millimetre, which is negligible considering the dimensions of the gate. This is explained by the relatively small amplitude of the pump excitation forces compared to the total of static loads. Nevertheless, a significant deflection amplification (dynamic/static) is found. When internal stresses are amplified similarly, a risk of fatigue and even direct failure exists for the regular pump gate design. The more robust flood defence pump gate design reduces stresses to acceptable levels. Vibration velocities of the pumps were compared to ISO limits for non-rotating pump parts. For the regular design at several frequencies these limits were exceeded. The robust design is able to limit these velocities considerably. Most concerning is the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations in the fluid. For the regular design, pressure head amplitudes at the suction side up to 0. 5 metre were found. This leads to an increased risk of cavitation, and therewith damage and a reduced efficiency. Furthermore, total head fluctuations over both sides of the pumps can be in the same order as the static pump head. This is expected to lead to an unacceptable reduction in efficiency. The robust flood defence pump gate does reduce these fluctuations over the first range of the investigated excitation frequencies (< 250 rad/s), but for several frequencies leads to a larger response at higher frequencies. %This is likely due to the closer overlap of the structural and fluid eigenfrequencies in that case. %High pump excitation frequencies can therefore be very harmful. The dynamic behaviour of gate and fluid should therefore be considered in further design of the pump gate. Concluding, the dynamic behaviour of the pump gate designs should be considered in further design phases, since several risks were identified. The combination of a robust gate design and limited high frequency pump excitations may lead to an acceptable design.

Readers will learn about typical test objectives, quantities to measure, and flight maneuvers and operations for calibration. The Section informs readers about tower-flyby, trailing cone, pacer, radar-tracking, and dynamic airdata calibration maneuvers. Readers will also {{begin to understand}} how some data analysis considerations and special airdata cases, including high-angle-of-attack flight, high-speed flight, and nonobtrusive sensors are handled. This section {{is not intended to}} be all inclusive; readers should review AGARDograph 300, Volume 1, "Calibration of Airdata Systems and Flow Direction Sensors" for more detailed information. [11 - 1] References 11 - 2, 11 - 3, and 11 - 4 also supply pertinent information to better understand airdata measurement and calibration and related terminology. Airdata are vital to successfully complete an aircraft's mission and are derived from the air surrounding the aircraft. These airdata encompass indicated and true airspeed, pressure altitude, ambient air temperature, angles of attack and sideslip, Mach number, and rate of climb. Typically, pitot and static pressures are sensed and converted (by mechanical means in the instruments themselves) into indications on the altimeter, vertical speed indicator, airspeed indicator, and Machmeter. Similarly, measured local flow angles establish angles of attack and sideslip, and the outside air temperature is measured and indicated in the cockpit. (Instruments that can perform the conversion, such as airspeed indicators, altimeters, and Machmeters, do not correct for errors in the input values.) These measured parameters are commonly input to the airdata computer which, using appropriate algorithms and correction factors (or calibrations, as discussed later), can provide other parameters, such as true airspeed, required by the aircraft's avionics or flight control system. The presence of the aircraft in the airstream causes input errors to the measuring instruments - the aircraft disturbs the air that it flies through, thereby also disturbing the airdata measurements. Figure 11 - 1 shows the airflow around an airplane wing. The air above the wing has lower pressure than the ambient air, while the pressure below the wing is higher than the ambient air. <b>Compressibility</b> and shock <b>waves</b> also disturb the air and affect the measurements. Compressibility effects become important above approximately Mach number 0. 3. As a result the static pressure around an airplane varies considerably with location. Local flow angles also differ from the free-stream flow direction. In straight-and-level flight the airflow rises to the wing leading edge and falls below the trailing edge, causing errors in flow direction measurements. To some extent these errors can be studied in wind tunnels, but wind-tunnel measurements cannot replace in-flight measurements...|$|R
40|$|I study dusty plasma {{produced}} by electrostatically confining melamine formaldehyde microparticles in a radio-frequency glow discharge plasma. Dusty plasma {{is a mixture}} of particles of solid matter (dust), electrons, ions, and neutral gas atoms. The dust particles have a very high charge and a mass compared to the electrons and ions in the ambient plasma. As a consequence, a dusty plasma exhibits collective phenomena such as dust acoustic waves, crystallization, and melting. The discrete nature of dust particles gives rise to compressibility. In this thesis I report findings of four tasks that were performed to investigate dust acoustic <b>waves,</b> <b>compressibility,</b> and melting. First, the nonlinear phenomenon of synchronization was characterized experimentally for the dust acoustic wave propagating in a dust cloud with many layers. I find four synchronized states, with frequencies that are multiples of 1, 2, 3, and 1 / 2 of the driving frequency. Comparing to phenomena that are typical of the van der Pol paradigm, I find that synchronization of the dust acoustic wave exhibits the signature of the suppression mechanism but not that of the phaselocking mechanism. Additionally, I find that the synchronization of the dust acoustic wave exhibits three characteristics that differ from the van der Pol paradigm: a threshold amplitude that {{can be seen in the}} Arnold tongue diagram, a branching of the 1 : 1 harmonic tongue at its lower extremity, and a nonharmonic state. Second, to assess which physical processes are important for a dust acoustic instability, I derived dispersion relations that encompass more physical processes than commonly done. I investigated how various physical processes affect a dust acoustic wave by solving these dispersion relations using parameters from a typical dust acoustic wave experiment. I find that the growth rate diminishes for large ion currents. I also find that the compressibility, a measure of the coupling between the dust particles, have a strong effect on the wave propagation. Comparing the kinetic vs. hydrodynamic descriptions for ions, I find that under typical laboratory conditions the inverse Landau damping and the ion-neutral collisions contribute about equally to the dust acoustic instability. Third, I performed dust acoustic wave experiments to resolve a previously unremarked discrepancy in the literature regarding the sign of the compressibility of a strongly-coupled dust component in a dusty plasma. According to theories compressibility is negative, whereas experiments suggest that it is positive. I find that the compressibility is positive. This conclusion was reached after allowing for a wide range of experimental uncertainties and model dependent systematic errors. Finally, the polygon construction method of Glaser and Clark was used to characterize crystallization and melting in a single-layer dusty plasma. Using particle positions measured in a previous dusty plasma experiment, I identified geometrical defects, which are polygons with four or more sides. These geometrical defects are found to proliferate during melting. I also identify a possibility of latent heat involvement in melting and crystallization processes of a dusty plasma...|$|R
