He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
5|$|At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} is a subtle {{difference}} between them in the mudras, or the position of the hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E

5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

25|$|Frisch's {{investigation}} of a bee’s powers of orientation were significant. He discovered that bees can recognize the desired <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> in three different ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field, whereby the sun is used as the main compass, with the alternatives reserved for the conditions arising under cloudy skies or within a dark beehive.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that among Mesoamerican {{societies}} the concepts of space and time are associated with the four cardinal compass points and linked together by the calendar. Dates or events were always tied to a <b>compass</b> <b>direction,</b> and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented with respect to directionality.|$|E

25|$|MARTA {{switched}} to a color-based identification system in October 2009. Formerly, the lines were named based upon their terminal stations, namely: Airport, Doraville, North Springs, H. E. Holmes, Bankhead, King Memorial, Candler Park, Indian Creek; or by their <b>compass</b> <b>direction.</b> During the transition between the two naming systems, all stations on the Red and Gold lines used their original orange signs, and all stations on the Blue and Green lines used their original blue signs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{regarding}} how one measures direction for this purpose. Some say one should face the direction {{which would be}} the shortest distance to Jerusalem, i.e. the arc of a great circle, as defined in elliptic geometry. Thus in New York one would face north-northeast. Others say one should face the direction along a rhumb line path to Jerusalem, which would not require an alteration of <b>compass</b> <b>direction.</b> This would be represented by a straight line on a Mercator projection, which would be east-southeast from New York. In practice, many individuals in the Western Hemisphere simply face due east, regardless of location. In the presence of an ark that does not face Jerusalem, one should pray toward the ark instead.|$|E
25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|E

50|$|Most beltways in the United States {{do not use}} inner-outer <b>directions,</b> since <b>compass</b> <b>directions</b> are the {{predominant}} way to designate direction on numbered routes. Beltways with a single number for the entire route, such as Interstate 285 in the Atlanta area, are generally given <b>compass</b> <b>directions</b> that change as one travels along the route (what would be the inner loop is instead posted as north, then east, then south, then west, and vice versa for the outer loop).|$|R
25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each <b>compass</b> <b>direction.</b> The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E

2500|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} {{that one might}} use [...] "a kind of ostensive definition" [...] for S, {{by focusing on the}} sensation and on the symbol. Early in The Investigations, Wittgenstein attacks the usefulness of ostensive definition. He considers the example of someone pointing to two nuts while saying [...] "This is called two". How does it come about that the listener associates this with the number of items, rather than the type of nut, their colour, or even a <b>compass</b> <b>direction?</b> One conclusion of this is that to participate in an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the process and context involved, of the form of life. Another is that [...] "an ostensive definition can be variously interpreted in every case".|$|E
2500|$|The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) {{originally}} {{operated the}} line with [...] "westbound" [...] trains heading toward Manhattan and [...] "eastbound" [...] trains heading toward Canarsie, Middle Village, or Jamaica, generally in agreement with <b>compass</b> <b>direction.</b> However, NYCT's railroad directions, which are north and south, replaced the BMT's west and east railroad directions, respectively. This reclassification resulted in services which ran through the BMT Nassau Street Line to Downtown Brooklyn having two south ends. To eliminate any confusion, the directions of train services in the eastern division were switched, with trains running towards Jamaica being considered Northbound. The [...] (later K) and current [...] services were an exception to this, with Jamaica, Broadway Junction, or Metropolitan Avenue remaining the south terminal, since they used the Chrystie Street Connection from the Jamaica Line to the IND Sixth Avenue Line.|$|E
2500|$|Plotting {{a course}} {{required}} knowing the <b>compass</b> <b>direction</b> and distance between point A and point B.

[...] This information was sometimes collected and written down in a pilot's handbook, known as a portolano ("port book", in Italian, equivalent to the Greek periplus, the Portuguese roteiro and the English rutter). [...] These handbooks were used to construct a class of nautical maps known as portolan charts. [...] Portolan charts began being produced in Genoa in the late 13th century, and soon spread to Venice and Majorca. [...] Portolan charts were not gridded by longitude and latitude lines, but rather by a web of compass rhumb lines, giving mariners an idea of only the distance and direction between places.|$|E

30|$|Detailed {{examination}} of the various spectral bands of the spectral images found {{a number of instances}} where the author of the map had made alterations. Some of the alterations were stylistic or unintentional mistakes, others were major alterations as the cartographer’s knowledge of a certain area changed. The most interesting alterations were those of the trade routes giving direct evidence that many of the routes were laid down before the land was drawn in. An analysis of the directions of the trade routes compared with their compass bearings showed while most of the routes were accurately drawn according to the accompanying <b>compass</b> <b>directions,</b> a number of routes were drawn off course relative to the <b>compass</b> <b>directions</b> suggesting that some of these were drawn after the coastlines were painted. The cartographer clearly did not plan the full map from the beginning which was why he had to redraw some of the routes many times and he was running out of space at the southern and western parts of the map forcing the trade routes to be off the <b>compass</b> <b>directions.</b> The drawings were executed first before the coloured paints were applied. Two trade routes were drawn without their corresponding <b>compass</b> <b>directions</b> indicating that the map was perhaps unfinished.|$|R
