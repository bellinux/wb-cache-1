Thus, {{we are trying to}} develop a kind of effective mechanism for the exploration mission of lunar soil coring. This paper presents a rotary-percussive coring drill which is a novel scheme for the deep surface soil acquirement. Two degrees of freedom are included in the proposed drill mechanism. Specifically-designed drill unit including auger and drill bit is employed to finish the coring of the simulant of lunar regolith. We have proposed a novel coring concept named soft-bag coring. Since there is no relative motion between the soft-bag and the <b>cut</b> <b>soil</b> core, the soft-bag method may keep the original stratification of lunar soil. A test-bed has been developed to conduct experimental tests under different drilling parameters and circumstances.

The experimental results indicate that the specifically considered drill mechanism with soft-bag inside can get high coring ratio and excellent stratification of the soil...|$|E

40|$|The road {{widening}} {{carried out}} along National Highway- 40, a {{strategic road corridor}} of north-eastern India, to ease the traffic snarls for geopolitical developments in the region. The newly exposed in situ soil slopes along National Highway- 40 {{are on the verge}} of shear instability, and slope failures occur due to heavy earth cuttings. As a consequence, the road corridor witnesses several geotechnical failures during rainy seasons. The blasting activities initiated and propagated the soil creeps and falls resulting road blockades. Even a small rain shower is enough to undercut and uproot trees and transport boulders and surrounding earth materials up to the corridor. Besides, landslides are also prone to damage demographic areas and settling house units, thus invites for preventive measures towards hill slope management as these slopes make the highway corridor unsafe to the commuters. Therefore, the present study is aimed to investigate the stability of the hill <b>cut</b> <b>soil</b> slopes and to suggest possible stabilisation measures. The study also highlighted that steep soil slopes with high moisture content are prone to landslides mainly due to infiltration, and water flows on the slopes during high and prolonged rainfall. The highly plastic soils rich in silt and clay size particles with high moisture content cause soil/debris slide and flow. The numerical modelling of slopes using Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) codes (version 4. 0) indicates failures in excavated high angle cut slopes. The re-excavation and benching of unstable slopes with geonets or bionets or jute matting to promote vegetation growth were suggested as stabilisation measures by field investigation, laboratory studies and numerical analysis of slopes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to further understand the behavior of the soil under the action of a tillage tool, with the purpose of finding a relation between the tool geometry and the resultant soil seed bed. Thus the problem consisted of understanding the mechanics of producing soil break up and to find a logical method of analyzing it. The problem was solved using fundamental principles of soil mechanics and force equilibrium analyzis. As a result, a mathematical model was developed which describes three failure zones within the <b>cut</b> <b>soil</b> volume. The model can be programmed into a computer to generate maps of normal and shear stresses to visualize the three failure zones. The failure zones are the shear failure zone, the tensile fracturing zone and the no failure zone. The tensile fracturing zone is delimited by the tensile stress reaching the tensile strength of the soil at the given soil moisture content and soil density. The tensile strength of the soil was measured using an apparatus and method designed in this research. The mathematical model gives an explanation of the mechanics of crumbling and the shape of the failed volume, but it does not give information concerning soil aggregate quality and arrangement within the soil furrow. Then, a method of analyzing the formed aggregates was developed which considers some soil physical properties of aggregates. The study concluded that the smaller tool width and the smaller tool rake angle, among the ones used in this research, produced the most efficient geometry in producing the largest amount of soil break up, the most uniform aggregate formation and the most stable aggregate arrangement. The same tool geometry requires less energy per unit volume of soil disturbed. The best performance is produced at the lowest soil water content among those tested...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Magé, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, to evaluate the performance of taro (Colocasia esculenta) intercropped with sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), used as green manure. A randomized blocks design with four replicates was used and the soil of the field plots was classified as Haplic Gleysol. Treatments consisted of taro (1) intercropped with unpruned sunn hemp, (2) intercropped with sunn hemp <b>cut</b> at <b>soil</b> level, (3) intercropped with sunn hemp pruned at its mid-height, and (4) in monoculture. The taro was planted in double rows spaced by 1. 0 m. The planting furrows had a space of 0. 5 m, with rhizomes placed at every 3. 0 m. The experimental plot consisted of four 3. 0 m rows and the useful area corresponded to the five central plants in each of the two central rows. The sunn hemp was sown in parallel lines in the spaces between the taro double rows, 120 days after planting the taro. When the sunn hemp was <b>cut</b> at <b>soil</b> level, an accumulation of 211 kg ha- 1 of N was observed. Besides this, the sunn hemp's biomass promoted the cycling of an average 17 kg ha- 1 of P, 85 kg ha- 1 of K, 151 kg ha- 1 of Ca, and 27 kg ha- 1 of Mg. Worth mentioning, it represented also a deposition of 6. 85 Mg ha- 1 of dry substance. Even when pruned at its mid-height, the sunn hemp still provided 60 % of nutrients relatively to the treatment in which it was <b>cut</b> at <b>soil</b> level. In addition to the nutrient supply, the use of taro intercropped with sunn hemp <b>cut</b> at <b>soil</b> level or pruned at mid-height represented efficient alternatives for controlling the spontaneous vegetation and for reducing taro leaf burning by solar radiation, without compromising the yield of taro.

40|$|Biologically {{mediated}} redox {{processes in}} the riparian zone, like denitrification, can have Substantially beneficial impacts on stream water quality. The extent of these effects, however. depends greatly oil the hydrological boundary conditions. The impact of hydrological processes oil a wetland's nitrogen sink capacity was investigated in a forested riparian fen which is drained by a first-order perennial stream. Here, we analysed the frequency distributions and time-series of pH and nitrogen, silica, organic carbon and oxygen concentrations in throughfall, soil solution, groundwater and stream water, and the groundwater levels and stream discharges from a 3 -year period. During baseflow conditions, the stream was fed by discharging shallow, anoxic groundwater and by deep, oxic groundwater. Whereas the latter delivered considerable amounts of nitrogen (similar to 0 - 37 mg l(- 1)) to the stream, the former was almost entirely depleted of nitrogen. During stormflow, near-surface runoff in the upper 30 <b>cut</b> <b>soil</b> layer bypassed the denitrifying zone and added significant amounts to the nitrogen load of the stream. Nitrate-nitro-en was close to 100 % of deep groundwater and stream-water nitrogen concentration. Stream-water baseflow concentrations of nitrate, dissolved carbon and silica were about 1. 6 mg l(- 1), 4 mg l(- 1) and 7. 5 mg l(- 1) respectively, and 4 mg l(- 1) respectively during discharge peaks. In addition to that macroscale bypassing effect, there was evidence for a corresponding microscale effect: Shallow groundwater sampled by soil suction CLIPS indicated complete denitrification and lacked any seasonal signal Of Solute concentration, which was in contrast to piezometer samples from the same depth. Moreover, mean solute concentration in the piezometer samples resembled more that of suction-cup samples from shallower depth {{than that of the}} same depth. We conclude that the soil solution cups sampled to a large extent the immobile soil-water fraction. In contrast, the mobile fraction that was sampled by the piezometers exhibited substantially shorter residence time, thus being less exposed to denitrification, but predominating discharge of that layer to the stream. Consequently, assessing the nitrogen budget based on suction-cup data tended to overestimate the nitrogen consumption in the riparian wetland. These effects are likely to become more important with the increased frequency and intensity of rainstorms that are expected due to climate change. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
