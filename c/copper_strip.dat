2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and best-known coils still in {{operation}} is the [...] "GPO-1" [...] at Griffith Park Observatory in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by Earle L. Ovington, a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus. For a number of years Ovington displayed them at the December electrical trade show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, using them for demonstrations of high voltage science, which Tesla himself sometimes attended. [...] Called the Million Volt Oscillator, the twin coils were installed on the balcony at the show. Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs. [...] Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. Frederick Finch Strong, a leading figure in the alternative health field of electrotherapy. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't have room to display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since. It consists of a 48 in. (1.2 m) high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} dipping {{time to the}} {{intermetallic}} compound and free solder thickness of Sn-Cu-Ni (SN 100 C) lead-free solder has been investigated. Dipping of <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> in molten solder was carried out using GEN 3 solderability test machine with 20 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, and 240 s of dipping time. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the solder coating on the <b>copper</b> <b>strips.</b> Thickness of IMC, free solder and total solder coating was calculated. The influence of dipping time was established. The results indicated that longer dipping time produced high IMC thickness while the free solder thickness reduced {{with the growth of}} IMC.

50|$|As a result, the {{treatment}} combinations might be randomized such that those treatment runs corresponding to one {{level of the}} concentration (−1) are run first. Each <b>copper</b> <b>strip</b> is individually plated, meaning only one strip at a time {{is placed in the}} solution for a given treatment combination. Once the four runs at the low level of solution concentration have been completed, the solution is changed to the high level of concentration (1), and the remaining four runs of the experiment are performed (where again, each strip is individually plated).|$|E

40|$|A voltammetric {{characterization}} of a dental amalgam and simple solid metal amalgams and their applications for detecting low concentrations of Cu(II) ions in solution is presented. Dental amalgams display {{a series of}} oxidation peaks characteristic of the different metal phases present.

Instead of a dental amalgam a silver amalgam, i. e, Ag-Hg, is recommended as a better option for detecting Cu(II) ions in solution at low concentrations.

30|$|In a MIL, {{since the}} {{geometry}} {{is responsible for}} beam bending, the image quality is restricted by the geometrical and wave aberration. However, the conventional imaging devices with non-flat geometry can be compressed to the flat one using coordinate transformation because metamaterials are able to control light in almost arbitrary manners [122]. A flat metamaterial with gradually varying refractive index was proposed as an alternative metalens [120]. In the third metalens, a gradient-index (GRIN) metalens, spatially varying refractive index {{plays a role in}} bending light. A GRIN metalens is quite similar to a conventional GRIN lens, but the difference is that refractive profile is complicated in GRIN metalens while it is symmetric in the conventional one. A metalens consisting of patterned <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> and an FR 4 as a matrix in which refractive index is addressed by changing a proportion of the <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> was proposed [123]. Since the <b>copper</b> <b>strips</b> are not resonant in the operation frequency, this metalens, or flattened Luneburg lens, exhibited low losses and broadband operation. Because artificial magnetic response is difficult to be fabricated, GRIN metalens in which permittivity distribution is designed in order to focus a plane wave was introduced and achieved a resolution of one-sixth of a wavelength [120]. A resolution of one-hundredth of a wavelength, and either wavelength- or incident angle- dependent focusing was numerically achieved by using metallic waveguide on which subwavelength patterns are non-periodically arranged [124]. A switchable GRIN metalens by shorting the gaps in SRRs were also presented [125].|$|R
