40|$|The fate of virulent Salmonella typhimurium within macrophages of {{guinea pigs}} was {{assessed}} by a suspended cell culture procedure. The present study confirmed that macrophages of normal guinea pigs were capable of inactivating the ingested salmonellae. Macrophages of previously infected guinea pigs were not endowed with any significant increase {{in their ability to}} eliminate the ingested pathogen. However, the immune macrophages were observed to clump together tightly when they were exposed to salmonellae. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of specific <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> on the immune macrophages. When immune macrophages were inactivated with Merthiolate, they agglutinated with both the H and the O antigens of S. typhimurium, but not with the O antigens of other species of Salmonella nor with the O antigens of Escherichia coli. <b>Cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> could be eluted from immune macrophages by incubation in the absence of immune serum. Conversely, <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> could be passively transferred onto normal macrophages by incubation in the presence of immune serum. Furthermore, using immune serum previously adsorbed with the O antigens of S. typhimurium, <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> against the H antigens alone could be transferred onto normal macrophages, or those against the O antigens alone could be eluted from immune macrophages. These data suggest that immune macrophages possess specific <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> against both the H and the O antigens of S. typhimurium. It is proposed that the presence of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> on immune macrophages represents an expression of antibacterial cellular immunity by enhanced clumping and phagocytic activities of the macrophages...|$|E

As young chickens are quite resistant to infection with this organism by 5 weeks of age, ICA does not appear to be a protective immunological reaction. Increase in spleen cell populations exhibiting ICA were not always correlated with high titres of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibody</b> in the circulation of such birds. In fact, a single injection of S. gallinarum elicited high titres of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibody</b> in adult serum, when there was no increase in the level of ICA cells.

40|$|Injection of {{lipopolysaccharide}} from Escherichia coli intravenously into mice {{affected the}} ability of their peritoneal macrophages to adsorb antisheep erythrocyte <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in vitro.

An early evanescent increase in adsorptive capacity took place, which reached a maximum 5 min after injection and was followed immediately by a phase of depressed uptake of antibody. Enhancement of antibody uptake then increased to reach a maximum about 24 hr after injection, before declining slowly. The second enhancement phase was inhibited by prior immunization with E. coli or after multiple injections of lipopolysaccharide. Exposure of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide in vitro did not alter their capacity to take up cytophilic antibody. Changes in the capacity of macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes to adsorb opsonized erythrocytes were induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide and were similar to those induced with respect to the uptake of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> by macrophages...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring Plasmodium falciparum asexual intraerythrocytic development, the host's cell plasma {{membrane}} is modified by {{the insertion of}} parasite proteins. One {{or more of these}} modifications mediate the cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to host vascular endothelium. However, these surface antigens can be the target of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> which promote phagocytosis of the infected erythrocyte. It has been proposed that antibodies directed to epitopes rich in asparagine {{play an important role in}} this process, which has promoted efforts to isolate the corresponding gene(s). We describe here P. falciparum asparagine- and aspartate-rich protein 1 (PfAARP 1), a new giant (circa 700 -kDa) protein associated with the infected erythrocyte membrane which is rich in asparagine and aspartate residues due to the presence of nine blocks of repeats. Topology analysis predicts that PfAARP 1 has multiple transmembrane domains and at least five external loops. Human antibodies immunopurified against a sequence composed exclusively of asparagine and aspartate amino acids derived from PfAARP 1 label the surface of the infected erythrocyte, demonstrating that such motifs are exposed. Interestingly, external loop 4 of PfAARP 1 contains repetitions of these residues, and their possible role as a target of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} role {{has been proposed}} for cytophilic IgOl and IgOJ subclass antibodies and monocytes and macrophages in antimalarial immunity. Here we compared lhe isotype composition and avidity of naturally acquired antibodies, as measured by enzyme immunoassay against a detergent-soluble extract of Plasmodium falciparum schiz-onts, in clinically immune Senegalese adults (n = 33) and semi-immune, adult Amazonian patients (n = 25). Plasma were collected during an acute symptomatic P. falciparum attack and two months later, {{and in the absence}} of recru-descence or reinfection. Specific IgO, IgM, IgA, and IgO subclass antibodies were assessed. The results are sum-marized as follows: 1) high-avidity <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> predorninated in clinically immune Senegalese subjects; 2) acutely ill Amazonian patients produced high levels of low-avidity cytophilic antibody; 3) such a response was shon-lived, since two months later, the concentrations of <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were significantly lower; 4) however, affinity maturation of IgO antibodies was observed in Amazonian patients two months after the acute malaria attack. A c. ::nsiderable proponion (35 - 46 %) of anti-P. falciparum IgOI antibodies produced by African and Amazonian patients was shown to recognize periodate-sensitive carbohydrate epitopes.

40|$|Salmonella is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} facultative intracellular parasite, and host macrophages are regarded as the primary effector cells in both native and acquired immunity in mouse typhoid. This concept has not been unanimously accepted in the literature. Based on cell culture experiments and electron microscopic examinations of infected tissues, we observed that virulent Salmonella typhimurium is killed within polymorphs and macrophages of guinea pigs and mice. In a systemic disease, the organism propagates primarily in the extracellular locations of sinusoids and tissue lesions and within hepatocytes. Hence, {{it is more likely}} to be an extracellular pathogen and its virulence is directly related to its antiphagocytic property. The conspicuous absence of macrophages in the primary lesions of murine salmonellosis disputes the likelihood of their significant role in native resistance to the disease. Acquired cellular immunity is expressed as an enhanced antibacterial activity of macrophages facilitated by <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies</b> rather than as an altered antibacterial action of immune macrophages. It is proposed that acquired immunity in murine salmonellosis is a synergistic manifestation of the innate capacity of polymorphs and macrophages to destroy ingested salmonellae, the activated antibacterial functions of macrophages mediated by <b>cytophilic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> the opsonic and agglutinating actions of antiserum, and the accelerated inflammation associated with delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial antigens.

The addition of purified T lymphocytes did not increase migration inhibition. Normal leucocytes incubated with serum from coeliac patients and washed showed marked migration inhibition when incubated with gluten fraction III.
