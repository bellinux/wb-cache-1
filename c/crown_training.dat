40|$|Plant species {{identification}} and mapping based on remotely-sensed spectral signatures is a challenging task {{with the potential}} to contribute enormously to ecological studies. Success in this task rests upon the appropriate collection and use of costly field-based training data, and researchers are in need of ways to improve collection efficiency based on quantitative evidence. Using imaging spectrometer data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory for hundreds of field-identified tree crowns in Kruger National Park, South Africa, we developed woody plant species classification models and evaluated how classification accuracy increases with increasing numbers of <b>training</b> <b>crowns.</b> First, we show that classification accuracy must be estimated while respecting the crown as the basic unit of data; otherwise, accuracy will be overestimated and the amount of training data needed to perform successful classification will be underestimated. We found that classification accuracy and the number of <b>training</b> <b>crowns</b> needed to perform successful classification varied depending on the number and spectral separability of species in the model. We also used a modified Michaelis-Menten function to describe the empirical relationship between <b>training</b> <b>crowns</b> and model accuracy, and show how this function may be useful for predicting accuracy. This framework can assist researchers in designing field campaigns to maximize the efficiency of field data collection, and thus the amount of biodiversity information gained from remote species identification models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Airborne {{remote sensing}} has an {{important}} role to play in mapping and monitoring biodiversity over large spatial scales. Techniques for applying this technology to biodiversity mapping have focused on remote species identification of individual crowns; however, this requires collection {{of a large number of}} <b>crowns</b> to <b>train</b> a classifier, which may limit the usefulness of this approach in many study regions. Based on the premise that the spectral variation among sites is related to their ecological dissimilarity, we asked whether it is possible to estimate the beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, among sites without the use of training data. We evaluated alternative methods using simulated communities constructed from the spectra of field-identified tree and shrub crowns from an African savanna. A method based on the k-means clustering of crown spectra produced beta diversity estimates (measured as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) among sites with an average pairwise correlation of ~ 0. 5 with the true beta diversity, compared to an average correlation of ~ 0. 8 obtained by a supervised species classification approach.

5000|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} as a three-year-old, Duramente won the Saintpaulia Sho over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 1 February. Two weeks later over the same course and distance, the colt was moved up in class to contest the Grade 3 Kyodo News Service Hai. Ridden by Syu Ishibashi he started 4/5 favourite in a twelve-runner field but was beaten half a length by Sunday Racing's other runner Real Steel.On 19 April Duramente was ridden by Mirco Demuro when {{he was one of}} fifteen colts to contest the 75th running of the Grade 1 Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. The Italian Demuro had recently become one of the first two foreign jockeys (alongside Christophe Lemaire) to receive a full license from the Japan Racing Association. Duramente started 3.6/1 third choice in the betting behind Satono <b>Crown</b> (also <b>trained</b> by Noriyuki Hori) and Real Steel. After racing towards the rear of the field he made a forward move approaching the final turn but veered left, interfering with several other horses when Demuro moved him up to challenge entering the straight. In the closing stages the colt produced a strong burst of acceleration to take the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Real Steel with Kitasan Black two and a half lengths back in third. Demuro, who received a suspension for causing interference said, [...] "He was easy to ride early in the race but he’s very highly strung, it was his first time going right-handed and the crowd was very loud too so he may have over-reacted at the fourth corner—he gave me a bit of a fright".|$|R
40|$|Objective: To review {{risk factors}} for obstetric anal {{sphincter}} rupture (OASR) and possible preventive strategies as well as clinical outcomes {{by means of a}} selected literature review. Material and Methods: I have based my work primarily on articles recommended by my supervisor Professor Anne Cathrine Staff and by her PhD student, lecturer and senior consultant Katariina Laine. I supplemented with some clinical guidelines, reviews and studies identified by a search of the PubMed database. Search terms included obstetric anal sphincter rupture, obstetric anal sphincter injury, obstetric labor complications, perineum, birth, perineal laceration, birth position, water birth, anal incontinence, hands poised, episiotomy. Additional sources are textbooks and a medical dictionary. Results: Main {{risk factors for}} OASR that are well documented are first vaginal birth, birth weight and vaginal operational delivery. Risk factors with some impact are maternal age, gestational age, prolonged second stage of labor, occipito-posterior presentation, high BMI as well as median episiotomy. Further discussed risk factors are: epidural anesthesia, induction of labor and ethnicity. Obstetric techniques with protective effect include the use of vacuum assisted delivery rather than forceps in operational vaginal deliveries, episiotomy only on indication, episiotomy cut with a rather large angle from the midline, manual protection of the perineum during fetal head <b>crowning</b> and well <b>trained</b> accoucheurs. OASR is a strong risk factor for anal incontinence. As many as 30 % to 60 % of women with diagnosed and repaired OASR at delivery experience symptoms of anal incontinence in long term follow-up. Additional comorbidities with OASR are urinary incontinence, pelvic floor prolapse symptoms, sexual dysfunction and reduced health-related quality of life. Conclusions: Obstetric anal sphincter rupture is a complication of vaginal delivery that affects many women due to many vaginal births worldwide. A considerable share of affected patients experience long term health related consequences. Low frequencies of OASR can be achieved by optimizing obstetrical techniques...|$|R
5000|$|The {{two primary}} ways to control Podosphaera macularis are {{cultural}} and chemical control. The {{most effective way}} to manage hop powdery mildew is through preventative measures. Cultural control of the disease include growing powdery-mildew tolerant/resistant varieties of the host plant. Cultural practices that can help prevent the disease include carefully monitoring water and nutrient, reducing initial inoculum, and removing basal growth. Furthermore, pruning, crowning, and/or scratching will aid in further reduction of the disease. Pruning consists of removing shoots before <b>training.</b> <b>Crowning</b> refers to the process of removing the top 1-2 inches of the crown before budbreak. Scratching is done through disturbing the soil surface to remove the top 1-2 inches of buds. All of these methods disturb the overwintering stage of the life cycle of Podosphaera macularis. Likewise, chemical control primarily consists of spraying fungicides in hopes of preventing the disease through the use of early, continuous spraying during the growing season. Thus, prophylactic fungicide programs can be a very effective way in preventing the disease. Since the fungicides are a preventative measure, they are not very useful to use during a full-blown infection. Therefore, the use of fungicides disturbs release of spores and further infection within the disease cycle of Podosphaera macularis. As there are several fungicides that are effective against powdery mildew, it is important to apply the fungicides at specific times. If it is known that powdery mildew is present, spray programs should be started as soon as the shoots emerge. Due to powdery mildew's ability to quickly develop resistance to fungicides, it is important to rotate the fungicides that are used. However, few or no fungicide applications should be used during burr development as these burrs have increased vulnerability to damage. In this case, removing basal growth before flowering and applying a protectant fungicide with long-term residual action should be employed.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was thus}} quite {{in order that}} I should pore longest, there at my fondest corner, over the Barnum announcements--my present {{inability}} to be superficial about which has given in fact the measure of my contemporary care. These announcements {{must have been in}} their way marvels of attractive composition, the placard bristling from top to toe with its analytic [...] "synopsis of scenery and incidents"; the synoptical view cast its net of fine meshes and the very word savoured of incantation. It is odd {{at the same time that}} when I question memory as to the living hours themselves, those of the stuffed and dim little hall of audience, smelling of peppermint and orange-peel, where the curtain rose on our gasping but rewarded patience, two performances only stand out for me, though these in the highest relief. Love, or the Countess and the Serf, by J. Sheridan Knowles--I see that still as the blazonry of one of them, just as I see Miss Emily Mestayer, large, red in the face, coifed in a tangle of small, fine, damp-looking short curls and clad in a light-blue garment edged with swans-down, shout at the top of her lungs that a [...] "pur-r-r-se of gold" [...] would be the fair guerdon of the minion who should start on the spot to do her bidding at some desperate crisis that I forget. I forget Huon the serf, whom I yet recall immensely admiring for his nobleness; I forget everyone but Miss Mestayer, who gave form to my conception of the tragic actress at her highest. She had a hooked nose, a great play of nostril, a vast protuberance of bosom and always the [...] "crop" [...] of close moist ringlets; I say always, for I was to see her often again, during a much later phase, the mid-most years of that Boston Museum which aimed at so vastly higher a distinction than the exploded lecture-room had really done, though in an age that snickered even abnormally low it still lacked the courage to call itself a theatre. She must have been in comedy, which I believe she also usefully and fearlessly practised, rather unimaginable; but there was no one like her in the Boston time for cursing queens and eagle-beaked mothers; the Shakespeare of the Booths and other such would have been unproducible without her; she had a rusty, rasping, heaving and tossing [...] "authority" [...] of which the bitterness is still in my ears. I am revisited by an outer glimpse of her in that after age when she had come, comparatively speaking, into her own--the sight of her, accidentally incurred, one tremendously hot summer night, as she slowly moved from her lodgings or wherever, in the high Bowdoin Street region, down to the not distant theatre from which even the temperature had given her no reprieve; and well remember how, the queer light of my young impression playing up again in her path, she struck me as the very image of mere sore histrionic habit and use, a worn and weary, a battered even though almost sordidly smoothed, thing of the theatre, very much as an old infinitely-handled and greasy violoncello of the orchestra might have been. It was but an effect doubtless of the heat that she scarcely seemed clad at all; slippered, shuffling and, though somehow hatted and vaguely veiled or streamered, wrapt in a gauzy sketch of a dressing-gown, she pointed to my extravagant attention the moral of thankless personal service, of the reverse of the picture, of the cost of [...] "amusing the public" [...] in a case of amusing it, as who should say, every hour. And I had thrilled before her as the Countess in [...] "Love"--such contrasted combinations! But she carried her head very high, as with the habit of <b>crowns</b> and <b>trains</b> and tirades--had in fact much the air of some deposed and reduced sovereign living on a scant allowance; so that, all invisibly and compassionately, I took off my hat to her.|$|R
