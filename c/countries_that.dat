40|$|If {{the world}} oil market {{is at all}} monopolistic, then a {{variable}} import fee (VIF) has more perverse effects than a flat import fee on the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> imposes it. Like an import quota, a VIF makes the importing country's demand for oil less elastic and increases the price paid by buyers in <b>that</b> <b>country.</b> Moreover, a VIF does not necessarily yield any tariff revenue to the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> imposes it. Finally, under very plausible conditions, a VIF may facilitate price discrimination by a monopolistic foreign producer against the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> imposes it. ...|$|R

Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> previously had weak currencies.

5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed countries of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy countries of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer countries of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E
