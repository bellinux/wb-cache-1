50|$|He {{signed for}} Scottish club Heart of Midlothian ("Hearts") on 18 June 2015, {{subjected}} to international <b>clearance,</b> though the <b>contract</b> length was revealed.|$|R
50|$|By June 23, 1958, Morrow had {{obtained}} a US security <b>clearance</b> and had <b>contracted</b> with the CIA {{to prepare a}} Russian manuscript of Doctor Zhivago for distribution to Soviet visitors to the Brussels International World Fair, and also to give copies to sailors on ships bound for the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Peter Cooper, as {{president}} of the New York and Newfoundland Telegraph Company, hired H&K to blast Merlin Rock, which lies at the western end of the narrows in St. John's Harbor, in June 1855. They were successful in accomplishing the work by August of that year, to the <b>contracted</b> <b>clearance</b> of 27 feet.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, {{auditors}} {{noted that}} [...] "due to delay in {{acquisition of land}} / nonacquisition of land, nonreceipt of forest land <b>clearance</b> and poor <b>contract</b> management, the project remained incomplete at various stages with investment of Rs 1695.61 crore (March 2008) resulting in cost overrun by Rs 1461.97 crore (626 per cent) and time overrun by 17 years." ...|$|R
50|$|In September 1991, he {{was sent}} to direct the Royal Ordnance mine <b>{{clearance}}</b> and EOD <b>contract</b> in the Gulf, which he managed {{until the end of the}} mine clearance phase. In July 1992 he was appointed Project Manager of a Royal Ordnance weapons system, but in August 1992 he was recruited by the UN to set up their mine clearance office, which later became UNMAS.|$|R
50|$|The Foschini Case of 1983, where teenage rover/forward, Silvio Foschini did {{not want}} to move to Sydney when South Melbourne did so in 1981/1982 but was refused a {{clearance}} to play with St Kilda, declared previously unchallenged zoning an illegal labour market restraint. Although the VFL retained zoning for two more years, it had to radically alter the system of <b>clearances</b> and player <b>contracts,</b> and in 1985, with the competition less competitive than ever (only six clubs had made the Grand Final since 1972), reform of the system of player trading began. Zoning was replaced with a player draft, which studies have shown to be much more effective at equalising club strength than country zoning ever was.|$|R
5000|$|Korthals Griffons {{are known}} as {{intelligent}} with softer temperaments but with a willingness to please. They do not adapt well to harsh training methods. Most Griffons do not take well to living their lives in kennels. Regular exercise and training is highly recommended. They are extremely people oriented and prefer to be somewhere {{in the vicinity of}} their owners. The breed organizations recommend purchasing from breeders providing health <b>clearances</b> on written <b>contracts</b> on their guarantees. Recent research had discovered the infusion of another breed into the Griffon worldwide. [...] This has caused a split in most countries between those individuals wishing to retain the genuine Korthals Griffon with the clubs recognizing all breedings including the outcross hybrids.|$|R
5000|$|A second {{shipment}} (requiring over 100 containers) {{was agreed}} in 1984, after the Israeli legislative election, 1984 {{but before the}} new government took office, again signed off by Arens. Again the arms ($30-$40m worth) were donated by the Israelis, in return for an expectation of increased military assistance. A Pentagon investigation of a November 1986 complaint from Israel that this expectation had not been met revealed that [...] "The Israeli military attache's office in Washington and the international branch of the Defense Department had reached a secret arrangement: In return for Israel waiving the payment, the U.S. defense contractor Numax was to retain its security <b>clearance</b> and government <b>contracts</b> after being purchased by Israel." [...] Numax Electronics Inc. had been acquired by Israel's Tadiran Electronic Industries in 1983; officially, Numax' classified work was protected by a special arrangement whereby all discussion and work on it {{would be limited to}} employees who were US nationals and had the appropriate security clearance.|$|R
40|$|Several gene {{deficiency}} models {{promote the}} development of “innate CD 8 + T cells ” that have diverse TCRs, but display a memory phenotype and rapidly produce cytokines. We here demonstrate that similar cells develop in Kruppel-Like Factor 2 (KLF 2) deficient mice. However, this is not due to intrinsic deficiency in KLF 2, but rather to interleukin 4 (IL- 4) produced by an expanded population of T cells expressing the PLZF transcription factor. The development of innate CD 8 + T cells in ITK and CBP transcription factor deficient mice is also attributable to this IL- 4 -dependent mechanism. Finally, we show that the same mechanism drives innate CD 8 + T cell differentiation in BALB/c mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of regulation of CD 8 + T cells via PLZF+ T cell production of IL- 4. T cells expressing a diverse repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR) specificities develop in the thymus. Mature, naïve αβ T cells migrate from the thymus and through secondary lymphoid organs. During infection, pathogen specific T cells clonally expand, differentiate into effector cells, and migrate to infected tissues to clear the pathogen. After <b>clearance,</b> T cells <b>contract,</b> leaving a memory population that is again quiescent but differs from naïve T cell...|$|R
