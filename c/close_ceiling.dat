50|$|The Francis {{system was}} simple: Valves would be opened manually, {{allowing}} water to flow through {{an array of}} pipes tucked <b>close</b> to <b>ceilings,</b> and ending with small jets spraying the water. The big issue was that this sprinkler system was throughout the entire building, so any use of the system would flood the entire structure and all its contents. It was not until 1875, that Henry Parmelee invented a sprinkler head that only activated one at a time, {{and that is when}} sprinkler systems became very popular.|$|R

50|$|The team <b>closed</b> the <b>ceiling</b> {{with a new}} {{architectural}} component {{matching the}} original one, to stop the water percolation. This fibreglass component weighs less than the original one, thus reducing unnecessary weight which could damage the structure. To further prevent the rainwater from getting in, the ASI also closed the portion between {{the wall and the}} superstructure by placing slanting stone slabs. In addition, the ASI placed new stone veneers matching the original ones on the northern, southern and western exterior walls of the temple. The ASI also cleaned the dirt that had accumulated on the temple walls over the past few centuries.|$|R

5000|$|Many Oecobiidae build small, {{temporary}} star-shaped webs on {{or under}} rocks, or on walls or gravel. They hide near or below such webs and prey largely on ants, {{giving rise to}} common names such as [...] "anteater" [...] or [...] "miervreter" [...] (Afrikaans for anteater).

5000|$|Hugger {{ceiling fans}} (also known as [...] "flush mount" [...] or [...] "low profile" [...] ceiling fans) have no downrod or canopy like a {{traditional}} mount fan, and the motor housing is mounted {{directly to the}} mount. Hugger style fans generally have spinner motors, and use a special mounting bracket that holds the motor assembly and the motor housing. They are typically used in rooms with low ceilings. A disadvantage to this design it that since the blades are mounted so <b>close</b> to the <b>ceiling,</b> the air movement is greatly reduced.|$|R

In this research we tried to improve indoor thermal environment in meeting rooms on bridges that connected northern and southern buildings of Niigata Institute of Technology, Kashiwazaki, Niigata, JPN, by using floor carpets. We showed that thermal loss from floor surface to pilotis was greatly reduced because of large thermal resistance of carpets.

At last he separated a wall of bushes and disappeared within the aperture his hands had made.

40|$|Population {{receptive}} field (pRF) analysis {{is a popular}} method to infer spatial selectivity of voxels in visual cortex. However, it remains largely untested how stable pRF estimates are over time. Here we measured the intersession reliability of pRF parameter estimates for the central visual field and near periphery, using a combined wedge and ring stimulus containing natural images. Sixteen healthy human participants completed two scanning sessions separated by 10 – 114 days. Individual participants showed very similar visual field maps for V 1 -V 4 on both sessions. Intersession reliability for eccentricity and polar angle estimates was <b>close</b> to <b>ceiling</b> for most visual field maps (r>. 8 for V 1 - 3). PRF size and cortical magnification (CMF) estimates showed strong but lower overall intersession reliability (r≈. 4 –. 6). Group level results for pRF size and CMF were highly similar between sessions. Additional control experiments confirmed that reliability {{does not depend on}} the carrier stimulus used and that reliability for pRF size and CMF is high for sessions acquired on the same day (r>. 6). Our results demonstrate that pRF mapping is highly reliable across sessions...|$|R
50|$|Blockhouses {{may be made}} of masonry where available, {{but were}} {{commonly}} made from very heavy timbers, sometimes even logs arranged {{in the manner of}} a log cabin. They were usually two or even three floors, with all storeys being provided with embrasures or loopholes, and the uppermost storey would be roofed. If the structure was of timber, usually the upper storey would project outward from the lower so the upper storey defenders could fire on enemies attacking the lower storey, or perhaps pour water on any fires. When the structure had only one storey, its loopholes were often placed <b>close</b> to the <b>ceiling,</b> with a bench lining the walls inside for defenders to stand on, so that attackers could not easily reach the loopholes.|$|R

40|$|Conversational {{speech is}} {{characterized}} by prosodic variability which makes pitch accent prediction for this genre especially difficult. The linguistic literature points out that complex features such as information status, contrast and animacy help predict pitch accent placement. In this paper, we use a corpus annotated for such features {{to determine if they}} improve prominence prediction over traditional shallow features such as frequency and part-of-speech, or over new ones that we introduce. We demonstrate that while correlated with prominence, complex linguistic features do not improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of our classifier is quite <b>close</b> to the <b>ceiling</b> defined by variability in human accent placement.

40|$|The use of methamphetamine, {{a highly}} {{addictive}} stimulant drug, during pregnancy {{is an increasing}} problem in New Zealand. However, at present, {{little is known about}} the effect of methamphetamine in utero on child development. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of prenatal methamphetamine exposure on preschool measures of executive function among 4 -year-olds. To address this aim, 25 children who had been prenatally exposed to methamphetamine, and 25 control children who were matched for all other environmental and drug exposure-related variables, were assessed on three performance tests of executive function; the Day/Night task, the Bear/Dragon task and the Gift Delay (wrap) task. In addition, mothers or caregivers of these children completed the BRIEF-P measure of child executive functioning. Children who were exposed to methamphetamine in utero were rated as exhibiting significantly more executive functioning difficulties on the BRIEF-P scale than controls and also demonstrated a trend towards poorer performance on the Day/Night task. However, the methamphetamine-exposed children performed better than controls on the Gift Delay (wrap) task and no differences were found for the Bear/Dragon task with performance <b>close</b> to <b>ceiling</b> for both groups. The results of the study indicate that prenatal exposure to methamphetamine in the context of a range of environmental risk factors may influence certain aspects of executive function development in preschool-aged children and suggest that additional studies with larger sample sizes are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Subjects (n 5 40) {{performed}} a delayed item recognition task for visually presented letters with three set sizes (1, 3 or 6 letters). Accuracy was <b>close</b> to <b>ceiling</b> at all set sizes, {{so we took}} set size {{as a proxy for}} WM load (i. e. the amount of information being maintained in WM). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal associated with the delay period increased in a nearly linear fashion with WM load in the left inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (possibly Broca’s area, BA 44 / 45), right anterior insula, bilateral caudate, bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 6), bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA 9 / 46), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (with foci in both BA 39 and 40), left superior parietal lobule (BA 7), medial frontal gyrus (BA 6), anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (BA 8). These results lend support to the idea {{that at least some of}} the cortical mechanisms of WM maintenance, potentially rehearsal, exhibit a scaling with WM load. In contrast, the delay-related fMRI signal in hippocampus followed an inverted U-shape, being greatest during the intermediate level of WM load, with relatively lower values at the lowest and highest levels of WM load. This pattern of delay-related fMRI activity, orthogonal to WM load, is seemingly not consonant with a role for hippocampus in WM maintenance of phonologically codable stimuli. This finding could possibly be related more to the general familiarity of the letter stimuli than their phonological codability per se...|$|R

Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung <b>close</b> to the <b>ceiling</b> of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|R
