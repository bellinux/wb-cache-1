Many websites offer the [...] "instant" [...] background check, which will search a compilation of databases containing public information for a fee. These [...] "instant" [...] searches originate from a variety of sources, from statewide court and corrections records to law enforcement records which usually stem from county or metro law enforcement offices.

It is result of a common project realized by the Faculty of Security Studies and Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade, which had started in December 2007. The scope of the TOC search data base is to provide in-depth research and analysis on terrorist incidents, terrorist groups, organizations, their members, leaders and also links and relations between the individuals and groups. The idea is to integrate data from variety of sources, including foreign and domestic news, professional security journals, reports and databases, academic works.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency {{began the}} {{investigation}} into the discharges in 1997, and federal officials served two <b>criminal</b> <b>search</b> warrants at the plant in 1999. According to EPA and U.S. Department of Justice officials, Tyson continued to illegally dump wastewater after the search warrants were executed, prompting an EPA senior trial attorney to remark that: [...] "Having done this work for nearly 20 years, I don't recall any case where violations continued after the execution of two search warrants. That's stunning." [...] Under the federal and state plea agreements, Tyson agreed to pay $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the Pettis County School Fund and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund to help remedy the damage.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{certified}} private pilot himself, Samit was suspicious, suspecting that Moussaoui was plotting {{an act of}} international terrorism against the United States. He therefore sought permission to search Moussaoui's belongings which were known to include several bags and suitcases, and a laptop computer. The first application to obtain a <b>criminal</b> <b>search</b> warrant was denied by FBI Headquarters on the ground of insufficient evidence. A second application to search was made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, but this was also denied. The FBI did obtain a search warrant for the belongings, but only after the September 11th attacks. The Minneapolis Field Office had received a report from Moussaoui's home government of France that linked him to Islamic terrorism, but the FBI Headquarters in Washington {{did not believe that}} evidence was sufficient to present to the FISA court for a search warrant. On the question of using foreign government intelligence to validate a request for a domestic search warrant through the FISA court, it is unclear if the Field Office could have appealed administratively to the White House National Security Council. Had the belongings been opened before September 11, knives, flight manuals, and other clues would have been found. [...] Whether these clues would have sparked a national emergency or simply been treated like the August 6 memo entitled Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US is subject to debate.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{scholarship}} {{on the effect}} of the increasing number of female judges leads to three contrasting sets of expectations. Early writings and views of affirmative-action activists suggested that female judges would be more liberal than male judges. On the other hand, a series of empirical studies suggest that we should expect no gender differences. In contrast to both of these perspectives, several feminist scholars suggest that women will be more liberal only when that position expresses support for full participation in the community. These contrasting expectations were tested by analyzing the votes of appeals court decisions in three issue areas. No differences were discovered between male and female judges in obscenity or <b>criminal</b> <b>search</b> and seizure cases. However, in employment discrimination cases, female judges were significantly more liberal than their male colleagues...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} with private protection and <b>criminal</b> <b>searching</b> activities. In rich and heterogeneous neighbourhoods, criminals {{are more willing to}} spend resources to compare potential victims by searching for the most suitable victim. Therefore, private protection {{is more likely to be}} observed, and consequently serve as a base of comparison for criminals. If it is costly to observe and compare several victims, criminals will be more inclined to spend resources when the potential gains of comparison are high. Consequently, crime diversion e¤ect induced by this increased observability stimulates private protection in richer and more diverse neighbourhoods. This in turn increases the perceived heterogeneity of the potential victims, which encourages <b>criminals</b> to <b>search</b> even more, which stimulate private protection, and so on. Therefore, there is an amplifying e¤ect present in equilibrium. There implications of our model are tested using data from the Canadian Victimization Survey...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this analysis is whether « routine activities » of drug dependent criminals {{are associated with the}} spatial concentration of crime committed by these criminals. This problem is tested in a series of analyses including an investigation of the spatial pattern of the residential burglaries committed by drug dependent burglars using W. A. V. Clark's spatial choice housing search models. While Clark used the home and work place as nodes in the housing search, we use the home and drug market place as nodes in the <b>criminal</b> <b>search</b> of drug addicts. If the addict supports his or her habit with property crime, these nodes are expected to be a focal point for criminal activity in a distance minimizing scenario. The data indicate that the spatial concentration of property crime about drug market places means that a « crime containment » policy practiced by many police agencies is doomed to failure. Property criminals will continue to probe outward from a containment area which encompasses a drug market place. In fact, drug dependent property criminals may act as a vanguard for spatially expanding drug markets. Drug sellers and drug dependent property criminals seem to operate in a symbiotic relationship...|$|E

40|$|For <b>criminal</b> <b>searches,</b> the {{necessity}} of matching photographs with sketches is increasing. Previously, matching was performed manually by a human observer, a time‐consuming process whose accuracy can {{be affected by the}} level of human expertise. Therefore, we propose a new face recognition algorithm for photographs and sketches. This research is novel in the following three ways. First, to overcome the decrease in matching accuracy due to pose and illumination variation, we use eye alignment and retinex filtering to normalize pose, size and illumination. Second, we compare the performance of various face recognition methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), local binary pattern (LBP), local non‐negative matrix factorization (LNMF), support vector machine‐discriminant analysis (SVM‐DA) and modified census transform (MCT), for the matching of photographs and viewed sketches. Third, these five face recognition methods are combined on the basis of score‐ level fusion to enhance matching accuracy, thereby overcoming the performance limitations of single face recognition methods. Experimental results using a CUHK dataset showed that the accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of uni‐modal face recognition methods...|$|R
