5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. <b>Cooling</b> <b>fans</b> may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} seven radiators, and four {{electric}} <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> {{are needed to}} cool the engine and related components under the aluminium bonnet of the RS6.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{losses are}} mainly due to {{resistive}} losses in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> are present, also occur.|$|E

25|$|More {{efficient}} amplifiers run cooler, {{and often}} do not need any <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> even in multi-kilowatt designs. The {{reason for this is}} that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.|$|E
25|$|The main {{alternator}} is a Brush BA1006A type, providing {{power for}} the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing {{power for the}} radiator fans, lubrication and fuel oil pumps, traction motor <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> and air compressors amongst others.

25|$|The AL6 {{featured}} design elements pioneered on {{the earlier}} classes, {{such as the}} general construction of the bodies and bogies, and control systems. However some design features were unique, such as squared-off front ends, {{as opposed to the}} raked back noses of the earlier designs. Another difference was the lack of a second pantograph. The <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> on the AL6 were also specially designed to produce less noise than the earlier locos.|$|E
25|$|The M26 saw {{service in}} the Korean War. When the war began in June 1950, the four American {{infantry}} divisions on occupation duty in Japan had no medium tanks at all, having only one active tank company each, equipped with M24 Chaffee light tanks. When these divisions were sent to Korea {{at the end of}} June 1950, they soon found that the 75mm gun on the M24 could not penetrate the armor of North Korean T-34 tanks, which had no difficulty penetrating the M24's thin armor. Three M26 Pershing tanks were found in poor condition in a Tokyo ordnance depot. They were hastily brought back into operation, despite having to use improvised fanbelts. These three M26s were formed into a provisional tank platoon commanded by Lieutenant Samuel Fowler and sent to Korea in mid-July. When used to defend the town of Chinju, the tanks soon overheated when the substitute fan belts stretched and the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> stopped working, and so the only three American medium tanks in Korea were lost.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{changes were}} a {{steering}} damper with a reservoir and dual <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> with a larger, curved radiator. Because of increased vibration from the longer stroke, {{the fuel tank}} was put on floating mounts. All told, the changes for 2008 resulted in a dry weight of , [...] heavier than the prior generation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrical}} system was completely revised for 2008. [...] Changes included a 180-amp alternator, twin electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> electronic throttles, and completely new VENOM engine management system. CAN bus architecture has been combined with pre-existing systems {{to allow for}} regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher-capacity fuel pump and filtration system.|$|E
2500|$|Mark III, IIIA and IIIB, {{made for}} the Crusader tank, with reduced height to fit the engine bay, by {{redesigning}} the oil pump and relocating the water pump. The air compressor was reinstated to enable pneumatically-operated braking and steering. [...] Significant problems were experienced in desert use (the North African Campaign), and the Mk III went through multiple revisions. [...] This included three different chain drive designs for the ancillary <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> a revised valve adjustment mechanism, increased compression ratio, revised oil feeds, and two water pump replacements.|$|E

2500|$|The {{handbrake}} is now electronic. Additionally, {{the seats}} {{differ from the}} old style, slightly resembling the new Range Rover Sport with <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> optional on the HSE/Vogue and standard on the Supercharged. Heated seats are standard across the board and the premium seats from the BMW era are no longer available. The HVAC system was also updated with more vents and quieter operation. That, along with the acoustic laminated windscreen lower noise. An increase in interior storage is mainly attributed to the new split-dual glovebox. [...] And then in a return to original Range Rover styling, more wood inserts {{have been added to}} the doors and centre console. Midway through production of the 2007 model (around production date of January 2007) the style of the key was changed from the BMW design to Land Rover's current [...] "switchblade" [...] type.|$|E
2500|$|From 1982 to 1984, Tokyu Car built 45 of a heavily-specialized, meter-gauge RDC {{design for}} the Taiwan Railway Administration under license from Budd. [...] Designated the DR2800 series, the units are {{organized}} into 15 permanently-coupled 3-car sets (30 powered driving cars and 15 trailers). [...] Like other RDC trainsets before them, each cab unit only has a cab {{at one end and}} two cab units bracket a trailer in a standard set. [...] Unlike other RDC sets, however, the trailer's diesel engine is used exclusively to provide head-end power for the entire 3-car set, while the engines in the driver car are used for propulsion. [...] To prevent dependency on the trailer's engine for cooling, the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> of the driver cars are driven hydraulically instead of electrically. [...] This configuration results in each set producing 700HP for a top speed of 110km/h. [...] All 15 sets are still in service.|$|E
2500|$|Such a superintelligent AI {{with access}} to the Internet could hack into other {{computer}} systems and copy itself like a computer virus. Less obviously, even if the AI only had access to its own computer operating system, it could attempt to send hidden Morse code messages to a human sympathizer by manipulating its <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> Professor Roman Yampolskiy takes inspiration from the field of computer security and proposes that a boxed AI could, like a potential virus, be run inside a [...] "virtual machine" [...] that limits access to its own networking and operating system hardware. An additional safeguard, completely unnecessary for potential viruses but possibly useful for a superintelligent AI, would be to place the computer in a Faraday cage; otherwise it might be able to transmit radio signals to local radio receivers by shuffling the electrons in its internal circuits in appropriate patterns. The main disadvantage of implementing physical containment is that it reduces the functionality of the AI.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} to study the {{variable}} frequency control against the compressor and the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> of an air-cooled chiller, and continues to measure and collect the actual operating data, by use of such data as the chilled water supply/return temperature, chilled water flow rate, power consumption, and ambient wet-bulb temperature to conduct the COP analysis of the air-conditioning system. The experimental results show that proper use of the frequency converter to change the operation frequency of the compressor and of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> indeed can effectively enhance the COP of the air-cooled chiller operation, and reduce the power consumption of the compressor and the <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> of the air-cooled chiller to achieve the energy-saving effect...|$|R
