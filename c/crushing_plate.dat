50|$|While {{there is}} no solid {{evidence}} {{of members of the}} Ptychodus species living among other durophagous sharks like members of Heterodontidae (bullhead sharks), it is believed that this Cretaceous macropredator was the precursor to <b>crushing</b> <b>plate</b> teeth seen in many similar sharks and rays. Ptychodus would have been a benthic predator, straying from the upper layers of the oceans that would have been inhabited by Mosasaurs, Pliosaurs, other sharks such as the Cretoxyrhina, which it was ill-equipped to tackle or compete with. It was capable of growing to enormous size because of this, decreasing the contact it had with macropredatory organisms, and securing a vast food source with little to no competition.Its biological range was linked to the Western Interior Seaway, where it was restricted to the middle and southern end, away from the highly concentrated remains of Cretoxyrhina and Squalicorax in the same period. It is believed that Ptychodus species not only preferred this area because of the subtropical environment, but due to the higher concentration of their prey source Cremnoceramus, Volviceramus {{and other members of the}} inoceramids.|$|E
5000|$|Ptychodus {{was about}} 10 m long and was {{unearthed}} in Kansas, United States. It {{was covered in}} placoid scales like other members of Hybodontoidea, reinforced with a large cartilaginous skeleton, and was a bearer of large serrated spines along the dorsal fin. [...] Unlike the colossal nektonic planktivores Rhincodon (whale sharks) and Cetorhinus (basking sharks) which relied upon gill rakers to acquire their food, the Ptychodus had a massive arrangement <b>crushing</b> <b>plate</b> teeth. A Ptychodus jaw contains many teeth, up to 550 teeth, 220 of which are on the lower jaw and 260 in the upper jaw. These teeth were very large as well. Paleontologists believe that the largest tooth plate measured 55 centimeters in length and 45 centimeters in width. There are two distinct formations of tooth plate between the genus; one being juxtaposed, non-overlapping tooth rows and another being imbricated tooth rows. It is believed that the shape coincides with the diet of the species and their geographic locations, but the time it lived has a big part as well. Ptychodus marginalis teeth differ from Ptychodus polygyrus. P marginalis was in the Middle Cenomanian to Middle Turonian deposits in the English Chalk, while P. polygyrus were in the Late Santonian-Early Campanian deposits.|$|E

40|$|To {{test the}} Blade Runners concept for {{reducing}} ice induced vibration and loads on structures a simple configuration {{consisting of a}} single stationary blade on a rigid flat metal <b>crushing</b> <b>plate</b> was chosen for ice crushing tests in NRC/OCRE 2 ̆ 019 s Large Cold Room facility. Five wedge-shaped columnar-grained freshwater ice samples were crushed against a thick plate with a low-profile blade on it {{and the results were}} compared with those from another five crushing experiments using a plate without a blade. The two crushing plates were made of aluminum and had identical characteristics other than that one of them had a blade on it. The blade had an isosceles right triangular section profile with a height of 1 mm and base of 2 mm. The blade spanned the length of the plate and was centered relative to the wedge-shaped ice samples and parallel with their long axes. Tests were conducted at - 10 oC and the nominal <b>crushing</b> <b>plate</b> displacement rate was 10 mm/s. High-speed imaging was used to observe the ice contact zone, by viewing through the ice samples, as it evolved and moved around somewhat during the tests. Load records from the tests using the bladeless <b>crushing</b> <b>plate</b> exhibited a high-amplitude sawtooth load pattern, resulting from fairly regular ice spalling events, that is typical of ice crushing in the brittle regime. This type of spalling behaviour, and associated sawtooth load pattern, is responsible for ice induced vibration of structures when ice sheets encroach on them. The average loads were roughly the same during either set of tests. However for those tests where the plate with the blade on it was used it was observed that when the blade was in the hard zone region of the ice contact area the load pattern was dramatically affected. In those cases the blade effectively smoothed the sawtooth loading pattern by greatly increasing the spalling rate and reducing the spall size. Consequently the amplitudes of the load sawteeth were significantly reducedPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{stiffness}} of swing plates {{has not been}} varied with changes in rock strength. Rock strength has only been of interest {{because of the need}} to know the maximum force exerted by the toggle for energy considerations. Thus a swing plate, stiff enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (q_u) of up to 308 MPa, may be overdesigned (and, most importantly, overweight) for crushing a softer fragmental limestone, amphibolites. Design of lighter weight jaw crushers will require a more precise accounting of the stresses and deflections in the <b>crushing</b> <b>plates</b> than is available with traditional techniques. Efforts to decrease energy consumed in crushing have lead to consideration of decreasing the weight of the swing plate of jaw crushers for easily crushed material. In the present work the design of the swing jaw plate using point-load deformation failure (PDF) relationships along with interactive failure of rock particles as a model for such a weight reduction. The design of the corrugated swing jaw plate is carried out by using CAD i. e. jaw <b>crusher</b> <b>plate</b> has been solid modeled by using CatiaV 5 R 15.

40|$|Crushing {{along the}} fiber axis of undirectional E-glass fiber {{composites}} rods was examined {{to determine the}} effects of fiber volume fraction, fiber diameter, matrix compressive yield strength, crush rate, fiber surface treatment, and <b>crush</b> <b>plate</b> geometry.

The crush load stability was found to be independent of fiber content and fiber diameter but not of matrix yield strengt. The crush load became less stable as the yield strength increased. The crush behavior of specimens containing clean fibers was about the same as with sized fibers, but specimens with a release agent on the fiber surface crushed with less energy absorption that decreased even as the fiber content increased, but the crush load was more stable than with sized or clean fibers. The volume specific energy absorption was greater when the rod specimens were crushed against concave surfaces than against a flat plate.

The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the influence of crushing speed on the rupture behavior and the energy absorption capability of composite materials. Two materials are tested: a carbon-epoxy unidirectional prepreg, and a carbon-epoxy fabric. For both materials, three different plate configurations are tested (three different stacking sequences). The crushing device is an improved <b>plate</b> <b>crushing</b> setup with stabilizing guides, which can be used both on a standard static traction/compression test machine, or on a drop tower. For static tests, a 20 mm/min velocity is applied to the specimen all along the 100 mm crushing stroke. For dynamic tests, only the initial velocity can be imposed. Three initial speeds were chosen: 2, 5 and 9 m/s. A high-speed camera is used during tests to visualize the global behavior of the plate, and the rupture modes in the crushing front.

40|$|Lithium orthosilicate (Li 4 OSi 4) pebbles are {{considered}} to be a candidate as tritium breeder in the helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) blanket. Their contact strength is of concern since they might be crushed in the blanket under thermomechanical load. Crush tests for single pebbles are carried out to evaluate their strength. In these tests, single pebbles are crushed by a pair of parallel plates. In this way, the crush load, i. e., the maximum contact force between pebble and plates before failure of the pebble occurs, can be obtained. In this study, the influence of the plate material used in the crush tests on the crush load is investigated. Single Li 4 OSi 4 pebbles are <b>crushed</b> by <b>plates</b> made of aluminum alloy (AL) and tungsten carbide (WC), respectively. Two corresponding crush load distributions are obtained.

As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw <b>crusher.</b> Jaw <b>plate</b> wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws.

Advanced design rules {{are available for}} quantifying the various plate debonding mechanisms and consequently the shear and flexural capacities of the plated sections.

This exclusion may reduce the application of plating, in particular to retrofitting buildings where ductility is often a requirement, or it may require the development of a radically different approach to design that does not rely implicitly on ductility. In this paper, it is shown that the commonly used neutral axis depth approach for moment redistribution in RC flexural members cannot be used for most plated structures because plate debonding often occurs before the concrete <b>crushes.</b> Tests on <b>plated</b> flexural members are also reported which show that moment redistribution can occur.
