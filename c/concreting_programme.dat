Since the 70 ´s and currently, non formal education (NFE) programmes are being used by International Agencies, NGOs and Governments to promote universal education and gender equality. These goals have been approached from different political discourses along time, making NFE an instrument characterised and defined in various ways. At present NFE appear as a mechanism in the Millennium Development Goals Report and in the Educational Policy in Ethiopia involving in theory the participation and empowerment of direct and indirect beneficiaries. In this context, this study looks at the power dynamics and gender relations that are generated in a NFE programme in Ethiopia specifically an Alternative Basic education centre, questioning the absence of theory in NFE programmes currently and its consequence of not approaching education as an empowerment element or pragmatic instrument to challenge the status quo. Through a gender analysis of various aspects of the <b>concrete</b> <b>programme</b> we arrive to the theoretical discourse that embraces this new era of post development.

In this vein, {{the need to}} improve social cohesion in developing countries has been repeatedly emphasized by the European Union at the multilateral {{as well as at the}} bilateral level. At the multilateral level the intention on the part of the European Union to link the Lisbon Strategy to the Copenhagen process, implemented under the auspice of the United Nations, might be underscored. At the bilateral level the relevance conferred on social cohesion in the relationship with Latin-American countries is also remarkable. The European experience in the social field is influencing in a very subtle way the design of regional mechanisms addressed to fostering social cohesion in Latin-America. Beyond this diffuse influence, more <b>concrete</b> <b>programmes,</b> such as the EuroSocial Programme, have been set up by the European Union with a view to offering some support for increasing social cohesion in that region. The developing countries engaged in negotiations with the European Union should exploit further the harmful effect that incoherencies within the European Union’s external action might have for the European Union itself.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{solutions}} to problems of water scarcity and increasing demand on the available finite fresh water {{has resulted in the}} emergence of a new water governance regime guided by the integrated water resources management framework. The framework is deeply imbedded in neo-liberal discourses that have dominated development paradigms in recent decades. Using the experience of the Mazowe catchment as a case study, this thesis explores the realities and challenges faced in reforming the water sector in Zimbabwe. The thesis relies on methodologies derived from the phenomenological paradigm and institutionalist-oriented analytical approaches to assess the water reforms in relation to three key themes namely, equitable access to water, institutional reconfiguration and stakeholder participatory processes. The study found out that while the water policy and legislation in Zimbabwe has been significantly improved to address historical inequities, there are no specific strategies formulated and implemented to operationalize the new water policy into <b>concrete</b> <b>programmes</b> and projects that address poverty and achieve equity. The thesis argues that improving conditions for accessing water will be useless if it is not supported by specific financial and technical assistance packages that enable the disadvantaged groups to engage in productive water use and alleviate poverty. In addition, while a lot of progress has been made in setting up the new institutional structures for managing water, a considerable amount of capacity building needs to be carried out before these institutions can be effectively expedite their mandate. More attention should also be paid to appropriate scales and boundaries for water resources management in the Mazowe catchment and the rest of the country...|$|R

40|$|Although {{community}} participation in health {{has become a}} major plank in WHO's Primary Health Care platform, comparatively little <b>concrete</b> <b>programme</b> data has been collected which helps to define its potentials and problems. In an effort to expand knowledge in this area, a study of three Church-related community health programmes in Southeast Asia was undertaken. All three programmes have the stated goal of 'having the community take responsibility for its own health care' and as a concrete step in this direction, have developed training programmes for community health workers (CHWs). Starting about the same time, 1973 - 1975, they provide data for comparative examination of the development of {{community participation}}. As part of the study, a questionnaire was designed to elicit information from three categories of programme participants (the medical professionals, the community development workers and the CHWs) in community health programmes. It sought to discover their attitudes about the objectives of community health programmes; impact and measurements of success of these programmes; the role of health services; the role of medical professionals and community development workers in community health programmes; the role and training of community health workers; and financing community health programmes. The hypothesis of the investigation was that all three categories of programme participants in one programme share attitudes distinct from participants in the other two programmes. Although, due to technical reasons, {{it was not possible to}} test this hypothesis, the survey produced other conclusions. One was that the categories of professional people (the medical and community development workers) in all three programmes share attitudes which are distinct from the CHWs in all three programmes. Secondly, participants in the same programme most often exhibit the same attitudes when a programme has initiated an activity which enables the CHW to gain experience in health work. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{media are}} noticeably {{changing}} {{the qualities of}} urban public spaces, which {{can no longer be}} considered a purely physical construct. Yet, the extent to which contemporary digital media can be used to promote other forms of spatial agency remains a critical issue. Whereas the impact of technology from a macro perspective offers a globalizing and homogenizing image, its role in the production of space at a local scale is less clear (Kirsch 1995). The aim {{of this study is to}} argue for digital public spaces as a <b>concrete</b> <b>programme</b> to support the articulation of a third notion of public space that emerges at the interface of physical–digital hybrid spaces (Stikker 2013). The project for digital public spaces is posed as one that pursues enabling citizens’ rights to participation and appropriation (Purcell 2002) of physical–digital hybrid spaces. It is argued that while physical and digital spaces do not stand in opposition, their operational models do not fit seamlessly either. Therefore, the research is particularly concerned with how to design for the conditions that allow a dialogical relation between physical and digital features of space, and enable citizens to actively participate in the production of physical–digital hybrid spaces, and for which a dialectical mode of analysis is required. Following a cumulative narrative, the study explores different characterizations of digital public spaces, which have been articulated through design-led action research projects conducted in collaboration with academia, creative industries, citizens and public authorities. The study accomplishes a novel application of the unitary theory of space proposed by the Marxist French philosopher and sociologist, Henri Lefebvre (1992), which is revisited to develop a novel framework to reveal the social production 3 of physical–digital hybrid spaces. The framework is developed through practice, and extensively applied throughout the thesis illustrating three distinctive dominating perspectives of physical–digital hybrid spaces: substitution, co-evolution and recombination (Graham 1998). The framework has proved to be a flexible and insightful method of analysis that: enables approaching the social production of physical and digital spaces individually and in relation to one another; to understand how different spatial configurations allow for participation and appropriation; and in turn, to re-contextualize the right to the city (Lefebvre 1996) in digital public spaces...|$|R
