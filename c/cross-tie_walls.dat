40|$|The {{cross-tie}} {{wall is a}} kind {{of magnetic}} domain wall composed of a main straight wall and crossing subwalls and observed in magnetic thin films. This wall contains two kinds of magnetic vortex structures: “circular vortex” and “antivortex. ” At the cores of both vortices, the existence of a spot with perpendicular magnetization has been theoretically predicted. We have detected the perpendicular magnetization spots at each vortex core and identified the direction of it by applying magnetic force microscopy imaging to <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> in patterned rectangular thin permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) films.

Here, a detailed investigation of the coupling of an antivortex to in-plane rotating magnetic fields is presented. The resonant response is imaged by time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy to determine the amplitude {{as well as the}} phase of the gyration. The experimental results are compared with the analytical model of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator derived from the Thiele equation.

40|$|Neel {{walls and}} <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> are two {{structures}} commonly seen in ferromagnetic thin films. They are interesting because their internal length scales are not determined by dimensional analysis alone. This paper studies (a) the repulsive interaction of one-dimensional Neel walls and (b) the internal length {{scale of the}} cross-tie wall. Our analysis of (a) is mathematically rigorous; it provides, roughly speaking, the first two terms of an asymptotic expansion for the energy {{of a pair of}} interacting walls. Our analysis of (b) is heuristic, since it rests on an analogy between the cross-tie wall and an ensemble of Neel walls. This analogy, combined with our results on Neel walls and a judicious choice of parameter regime, yields a specific prediction for the internal length scale of a cross-tie wall. This prediction is consistent with the experimentally observed trends...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) {{has been used}} to study magnetization processes in four high moment CoFe films. While all films were of similar total thickness, 50 nm, the differences between them were the inclusion or otherwise of a seed layer and the introduction of nonmagnetic spacers to form laminated films. The detailed reversal mechanism for easy and hard axis reversals of each film was investigated. As expected <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> were observed in the films with thicker CoFe layers and wall displacements between layers were seen with the introduction of one or more spacer layers. Magnetization dispersion was reduced as multilayering was introduced. In the laminated film with three spacer layers, defect areas where the local magnetization distribution differed markedly from the surrounding film were observed. Cross-sectional TEM showed that layer roughness increased through the stack and this was the probable cause of the localized magnetic anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study a {{two-dimensional}} model for micromagnetics, which consists in an energy func-tional over S 2 -valued vector elds. Bounded-energy congurations {{tend to be}} planar, except in small regions which {{can be described as}} vortices (Bloch lines in physics). As the characteristic -length " tends to 0, they converge to planar divergence-free unit norm vector elds which jump along line singularities. We derive lower bounds for the energy, which are explicit functions of the jumps of the limit. These lower bounds are proved to be optimal and are achieved by one-dimensional proles, cor-responding to Neel walls, if the jump is small enough (less than = 2 in angle), and by two-dimensional pro les, corresponding to <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls,</b> if the jump is bigger. Thus, it provides an example of a vector-valued phase-transition type problem with an explicit non-one-dimensional energy-minimizing transition layer.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between ferromagnetic domain formation and exchange bias {{in a series}} of NiFe/NiO samples with varying NiO thicknesses has been investigated using the magneto-optic Kerr effect and magnetic force microscopy. Below a critical thickness (15 nm) of NiO, the exchange bias HE is zero and ripple domains exist in the NiFe layer. Above this critical thickness, <b>cross-tie</b> type domain <b>walls</b> appear concurrently with the appearance of exchange bias. Both the number of <b>cross-tie</b> domain <b>walls</b> and the exchange bias increase with an increase in NiO thickness, reaching a maximum at 35 nm NiO, after which both show a gradual decrease.

40|$|Photoemission {{electron}} microscopy {{was used to}} visualize the motion of magnetic domains on a sub-nanosecond timescale. The technique exploits the imaging of magnetic domains using soft X-ray circular dichroism, with the special feature that the instrument utilizes a fast image acquisition system with intrinsic 125 ps time resolution. The overall time resolution used is about 500 ps. Different domains and domain movements have been observed in lithographically-produced Permalloy structures on a copper microstrip-line. A current pulse of I = 0. 5 A with rise times of about 300 ps switched the Permalloy islands from a Landau-Lifshitz type domain configuration into metastable s-state domain configurations. A pulse with opposite direction could reverse these s-type patterns. Photoemission {{electron microscopy}} was employed to observe the domain movements while repeating current pulses passed the microstrip-line. Using small unipolar amplitudes, only the <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> of the s-type patterns disappear and the pattern becomes "fuzzy", e. g. the domain rims are not sharp and some domains change their size. Before the structure switches at a current threshold, it is more fluctuating as shown by significant differences in sharpness of the islands rim and the inter-domain boundaries show. The device behavior complicates when a bi-polar pulse is applied. Switching and oscillating of domains is observed in various manners, e. g. very tiny domains appear and unify again.

40|$|In soft {{ferromagnetic}} materials, the smoothly varying magnetization {{leads to}} the formation of fundamental patterns such as domains, vortices and domain walls 1. These have been studied extensively in thin films of thicknesses up to around 200 [*]nanometres, in which the magnetization is accessible with current transmission imaging methods that make use of electrons or soft X-rays. In thicker samples, however, in which the magnetization structure varies throughout the thickness and is intrinsically three dimensional, determining the complex magnetic structure directly still represents a challenge 1, 3. We have developed hard-X-ray vector nanotomography with which to determine the three-dimensional magnetic configuration at the nanoscale within micrometre-sized samples. We imaged the structure of the magnetization within a soft magnetic pillar of diameter 5 [*]micrometres with a spatial resolution of 100 [*]nanometres and, within the bulk, observed a complex magnetic configuration that consists of vortices and antivortices that form <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> and vortex walls along intersecting planes. At the intersections of these structures, magnetic singularities—Bloch points—occur. These were predicted more than fifty years ago 4 but have so far not been directly observed.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of patterned CoFeB films have {{attracted much attention}} for spin configurations and magnetization processes of nanostructured elements in that CoFeB has desirable properties including magnetic softness, large magneto-impedance, high spin polarization, and epitaxial registry with MgO(100). In this experiment, micron-sized CoFeB islands with various thicknesses, deposited by a sputtering process, were investigated in order to study their slow micro-magnetic properties {{as a function of}} an externally applied magnetic field as well as their remanent domain configurations. Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) of the array at zero applied field revealed that despite a large variation in CoFeB thickness, the remanent domain configurations could be classified into several unique domain configurations. Selected islands of dimensions from 0. 25 µm x 0. 25 µm to 16 µm x 16 µm were studied using MFM equipment. In addition, the creation and annihilation of magnetic vortex and antivortex pairs in <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> on CoFeB islands of 16 µm x 4 µm were investigated using MFM in the presence of an applied field. The first vortex-antivortex pair is nucleated in a 4 -domain Landau pattern from a section of a 180 degree Néel wall {{as a consequence of the}} formation of an end domain closure pattern. The vortex-antivortex pair creation satisfies the condition that the closure domain vortices have the same chiralities. Pair annihilation was found to occur in two steps: a rapid advance of the vortices toward the more or less fixed antivortices followed by a deceleration caused by the decrease in local susceptibility. There is a spread in the annihilation fields that does not depend upon the core polarity but is determined by energy minimization...|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} Neel walls separating antiparallel domains in {{very thin}} ferromagnetic films are found, {{on the basis}} of accurate calculations, to have a shape differing significantly from the linear rotation model suggested by Neel. In this 180 [degree] rotation, three regions can be distinguished: a central one where the magnetization [ [...] . ] rotates rapidly (positive demagnetizing energy) and two adjacent regions extending in the neighboring domains where the rotation is very much slower. In these "tail" portions of the curve, the direction of [ [...] . ] is determined mostly by a balance between the anisotropy torque and the torque due to the internal field. The calculations have been performed for permalloy films with thicknesses ranging from 0 to 200 [angstroms]. The walls extend up to several microns, in each of the adjacent domains (of the order of 15 [microns] at a thickness of 200 [angstroms]. As a continuation of the study of infinite Neel walls, the case of double walls (360 [degree] rotation) and of <b>cross-tie</b> <b>walls</b> is also analysed on a semiquantitative basis. The main characteristics of these two configurations can be explained {{on the basis of}} the new model found for the pure Neel walls. In a second section, the internal demagnetizing field H[subscript i] is calculated as a function of the shape, the thickness and the edge profile of the film. Along the edges perpendicular to the easy direction, the growth of peaks of reverse magnetization is studied when the external field varies. Also the detailed configuration of the internal field at the edge is found to depend strongly on the profile of the latter. By varying the slope of a tapered edge, it is shown that (H[subscript i]) [ [...] . ] can be reduced to such a small value that nucleation will take place only at an external field larger in absolute value than the normal coercive force of the film. Thus the hysteresis curve along the easy direction is noticeably altered and very square.

40|$|The <b>cross-tie</b> domain <b>wall</b> {{structure}} in micrometre and sub-micrometre wide patterned elements of NiFe, and a thickness range of 30 to 70 nm, {{has been studied}} by Lorentz microscopy. Whilst the basic geometry of the cross-tie repeat units remains unchanged, their density increases when the cross-tie length is constrained to be smaller than the value associated with a continuous film. This occurs when element widths are sufficiently narrow or when the wall is forced to move close to an edge under the action of an applied field. To a very good approximation the cross-tie density scales with the inverse of {{the distance between the}} main wall and the element edge.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{coupling}} and dynamics in magnetic microstructures. Time-resolved photoelectron emission microscopy (TR-PEEM) serves as experimental method. This method allows {{on the one hand}} an element-specific imaging of the magnetization, which is an essential advantage for multilayered samples, on the other hand the magnetization dynamics can be followed stroboscopically on a picosecond time scale. With short magnetic pulses precession and gyration modes are excited in magnetic single- and multilayered microstructures. Their frequency depends particularly on the domain configuration and the interaction of the magnetic layers. The excited modes in Permalloy (Py) microstructures with different shape and domain configuration are contrasted. It is shown that the precession frequency is higher {{in the presence of a}} <b>cross-tie</b> <b>wall.</b> Micromagnetic simulations in addition give insight to the vortex dynamics, especially to the influence of (i) domain walls on the vortex gyration and (ii) the magnetization precession in the domains on the switching of the vortex core. The trilayer microstructures consist of a Py layer and a Co layer, separated by a thin Cu layer. First the interaction of the magnetic layers through the non-magnetic Cu spacer layer is investigated statically, i. e. without excitation. It is shown that the domain walls in the magnetically softer Py layer have a complex inner structure depending on the thickness of the Cu layer. This observation is compared to micromagnetic simulations and explained by magnetostatic strayfields. The magnetization dynamics of the trilayer microstructures is mainly investigated by micromagnetic simulations. They show that (i) the magnetization dynamics is influenced by the coupling in both, the magnetically harder as well as in the magnetically softer layer, and (ii) the gyration of the domain walls depends on their inner structure in the Py layer. To extend the user experiment SPEEM at BESSY II for time-resolved measurements, a femtosecond laser system has been set up, which started its operation during this thesis.

The pure Permalloy (M 80 Fe 20) film (a = 3. 53 Angstrom) consisted of face-centered cubic nanocrystallites. Films prepared with 8 % O- 2 and 34 % O- 2 in the assist beam consisted of rock-salt CoO (a = 4. 27 Angstrom) and spinel CO 3 O- 4 (a = 8. 21 Angstrom).

Externally prepared NiO films of 60 nm thickness were cleaned by heating in UHV. Ultrathin layers of Fe {{in the range of}} 1 – 27 nm were deposited on top of the NiO film and were analyzed at specific coverages. Iron grows as a polycrystalline film with the grains increasing in size with the thickness.

Magnetic force microscopy images of the 1 nm thick film show randomly oriented magnetic grains with an average domain size of 30 nm.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the work {{carried out by the}} author on thin {{magnetic}} multilayer films that were deposited using a closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) system. The sputtering system was developed by TEER Coatings Ltd and has to date been used only for micron thick films. This study of magnetic multilayers is prompted by the interesting properties they exhibit and their application as read heads and magnetic sensors. In addition, TEER Coatings would like to market the CFUBMS system as a nanoscale deposition system for these applications. This project involved the deposition of nanoscale magnetic multilayer films using the CFUBMS system. Optimisation of the deposition conditions for nanoscale deposition was first carried out. The magnetic properties, magnetic domain structure during reversal and the microstructure of trilayer and multilayer films was analysed and the affect of thickness changes determined. In addition, interface modification by annealing and ion-bombardment was carried out on trilayer films and the effect on magnetic properties and microstructure was studied. Changes in the sputtering power, gas pressure, bias voltage and deposition time were shown to affect the film deposition rate. The effects of increasing gas pressure and bias voltage were shown not to affect the deposition rate very much when compared to much greater effect of increasing the target power. Changes in the magnetic properties, domain structure and microstructure were observed with varying Py, Au and Cu layer thicknesses in both trilayer and multilayer films. Single, double and <b>cross-tie</b> domain <b>walls</b> were all observed in the domain structure of films during magnetisation reversal. In addition, crystalline texture was induced in films by increasing the Au layer thickness. A comparison of as-grown, annealed and ion-bombarded films showed that interface modification results in changes in the magnetisation reversal mechanism, saturation field and coupling strength of the films. In addition, the author developed a method for extracting the total film thickness and top surface roughness from LAXRR profiles.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Current {{compression}} perpendicular-to-grain (c-perp) {{design values}} for wood members {{are based on}} mean stress using the ASTM D 143 specimen. Base design value, as determined from 0. 04 -in deformation in the ASTM specimen, is applied to all c-perp applications. While the standard ASTM test was presumably believed to adequately reflect relevant c-perp applications {{at the time it}} was developed (likely railroad <b>cross-ties,</b> <b>wall</b> plates and similar cross-sections), the specimen has limited applicability to many of today's c-perp bearing applications. Previous work has shown that wood-on-wood c-perp bearing is a more severe case as opposed to metal-on-wood bearing. End bearing conditions have been shown to represent a more severe c-perp loading scenario as opposed to load applied over central area. Research has shown that c-perp behavior of wood members is dependant on angle of applied load to annual ring orientation and that the most severe loading case is usually at an angle between 30 and 60 degrees to direction of applied load. Past studies also suggest that depth of member affects c-perp MOE and that higher aspect ratio may lead to instability of the member. As the c-perp behavior observed in the ASTM testing procedure is that of continually increasing stress with increasing deflection and densification, c-perp is generally believed to be serviceability rather than a life safety issue. However, in engineered wood applications, c-perp bearing may occur at areas where structural cohesiveness of a member is necessary to transmit forces through fasteners, such as truss plates. In such scenarios, c-perp has the potential to be a life safety issue. A study was designed to evaluate c-perp behavior of typical as-constructed assemblies in which members experience c-perp stresses near their longitudinal end through wood-on-wood contact. The study included both finite element analysis and experimental testing. Two as-constructed assemblies were evaluated in the study. These included assembly of the bottom chord of a truss bearing on the top plate of a wall (BC assembly) and assembly of the compression chord of a shear wall bearing on the bottom plate (BP assembly) of a wall. Finite element analysis modeled wood material as a composite with alternating earlywood and latewood layers with infinite radius of curvature. BC, BP and ASTM configurations were modeled both with load applied perpendicular and parallel to annual rings. Three BC assemblies were tested. These included BC- 2 X 4, BC- 2 X 8, and BC- 2 X 12, which had nominal 2 X 4, 2 X 8, and 2 X 12 members as bottom chord members, respectively. Therefore, within BC test assemblies aspect ratio of the bottom chord members varied greatly. The three BC geometries were each tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir top plate material. BP configuration was also tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir bottom plate material. For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. Results were analyzed utilizing a variety of statistical methods. Finite element analysis revealed that strain was more uniform throughout depth of the bottom chord member when loaded perpendicular to annual rings than when loaded parallel to annual rings. In BC tests majority of deflection was found to occur in the bottom chord member. In BP test, the majority of deflection was found to occur within the bottom plate with only minimal deflection occurring in the longitudinally loaded compression chord. Due to varying assembly depths, 0. 04 -in, deflection was found to be a poor criterion for determining c-perp stress values. In order to account for assembly depth, stress values were based on system strain. As 0. 04 -in, deflection corresponds to two percent strain in the 2 -in, deep ASTM specimen, it was determined that stress determination be based on 2 -percent system strain. Due to large settlement effects observed in the tested wood-onwood assemblies, an offset strain was adopted as the method for determining and comparing stress values across differing assemblies and configurations tested. Within BC tests, the species of top plate material was not found to significantly affect assembly performance. This was due to the overwhelming influence of bottom chord behavior on system behavior. Within BP tests there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a significant difference between Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir tests. It was recommended that further BP tests be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to determine the influence of wood species on c-perp behavior of bottom plate members. Mean stress values of BC and BP assembly tests were found to be significantly lower than that of corresponding ASTM tests of the main member. This finding lends justification to the Canadian 2 / 3 reduction factor for these scenarios as well as to the design procedures suggested by German researchers. It was determined that the ASTM c-perp test does not adequately represent these bearing scenarios. Adjustment factors are recommended for wood-on-wood bearing and opposite side end bearing. Aspect ratio was found to affect c-perp failure mode and led to high potential for sudden and catastrophic failure of members. Fifteen percent of 2 X 12 members tested failed prior to NDS design stresses due to premature failure of the nominal 2 X 12 bottom chord member. It was estimated that the odds of a 2 X 1 2 failing catastrophically are at least 16 times that of a 2 X 8 failing catastrophically. It was determined that as aspect ratio increases c-perp becomes a life safety as well as a serviceability issue and an adjustment factor for aspect ratio is recommended...|$|R
