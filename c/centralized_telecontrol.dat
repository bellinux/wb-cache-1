50|$|The West German {{shipping}} canals {{serve the}} mass transportation in the Ruhr region between the rivers Rhine and Ems direction North sea and via the Mittelland Canal to the Weser, Elbe, Oder and Vistula.This canal network shows the highest traffic density in Europe. The canals are state-owned by the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung”).The construction of artificial shipping canals was {{necessary in the}} industrialisation period of the Ruhr due to lacking transportation routes via capable, navigable rivers. The oldest part, the Dortmund-Ems Canal, is connecting the eastern Ruhr since 1898 with the North Sea. In 1914 the connection to the Rhine followed via the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Datteln-Hamm Canal was opened, too. In 1930 the Wesel-Datteln Canal was finished. All these connected waterways need to bridge altitude differences between the starting point, the connected harbours and the arrival point. For these purposes there are today e.g at the Rhine-Herne Canal 5 sluices and at the Wesel-Datteln Canal 6 sluices; at the Henrichenburg boat lift two ancient and two actually utilized sluices facilitate the bypassing of the altitude difference within the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal to Dortmund harbour. To feed the planned canal system with water already in 1905 before {{the construction of the}} Datteln-Hamm Canal the decision was passed by the Prussian State to use 10 m³/second water from the river Lippe - the only relevant river in the area - for the compensation of evaporation, infiltration and loss of water from the sluices). That was leading from 1914 on to severe water management problems in the river Lippe where in dry summers only 4 m³/second water was left downstream. From 1926 on the newly established water board Lippeverband negotiated with the competent authorities and finally the governmental waterway administration (“Reichswasserstraßenverwaltung”) confirmed to reduce the water abstraction to 7,5 m³/second from 1938 on. The industrial development of the coal and steel industry and especially the coal-fired power stations after World War II meant a growing demand of service water (from the canals and the river Lippe) and a growing discharge of too warm and/or unsatisfactory treated waste water into the river Lippe. Negotiations of the Lippeverband with the government of North Rhine Westphalia and with the Federal Waterways Authority (Bundeswasserstraßenverwaltung) were finally from 1968 on leading to new regulations: The ’’Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle’’ WWK was established, consisting of representatives of the Lippeverband and the water users, accompanied by the Federal Waterways Authority and the Environment Ministry of North Rhine Westphalia. Moreover, the permission for maximum discharge of the Lippe into the West German canal system was increased to 10 m³/second again but now with the additional limitation to guarantee a minimum discharge of 10 m³/second in the Lippe, too, otherwise the water abstraction for the canals had to be limited. This regulation was possible because of already constructed pumps at the sluices that started compensating partly the loss of water from locking.In the years 1973-1978 a series of new pumping stations was established that could serve the canals “upstream” from the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and discharge “downstream” in case the Lippe has enough water to supply with. Parallel pumping systems had been developed along the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Wesel-Datteln Canal/ Datteln-Hamm Canal, all controlled and supervised from a <b>centralized</b> <b>telecontrol</b> station.|$|E
40|$|Connection {{new source}} of {{electrical}} energy into distribution network is important for existing one for reasons its rating and dimensioning. It is even evaluate, whether possibility connection new source in to network is real and do not endanger continuous running distribution system. This work has shown, what conditions are need realize for connection source into distribution network in view of voltage ratio. Next it must incidence harmonic current and affecting <b>centralized</b> <b>telecontrol</b> signal about reasoning. Against a background examination connection source are administrative acts, which forms basis of successful connection. On basis lets request of connection mostly study of connection working up. This study contains concrete calculation and examination individual factors for connection new source. Next put mind to connection wind power station, because wind power stations are very special source for connection into distribution network. Bigger demands are putting on them and stricter examination of connection to site must be done. Because during time unit (day, week and month) they have various strain diagram. Which makes higher straining of distribution and necessity have reserve of electrical energy for case fail wind power station owing to windless ness. In the end, there is referred to practical examination example of possibility connecting. As this example was chosen examination of wind park to 110 kW network with 32 MVA installed power from view of voltage ratio. Solution process is given by replacement of part of given Picells link and by calculation steady state of node site system with Gauss-Seidels iteration method. After that follows evaluation of voltage change in the site before and after connection of source to the network, {{which can not be}} higher than 2 %. In this example is this condition satisfied and from a view of voltage ratio there is nothing to obstruct for connection new source to network...|$|E
