40|$|Several {{emerging}} countries’ jurisdictions {{are going}} to implement Basel II prudential directives. For this reason, {{it is interesting to}} ask if capital regulation effectively contributed to strengthen banks operating in emerging markets. Throughout this paper we will attempt to give an answer to this problematic. The success of Basel I prudential mechanism known as the <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio</b> and his adoption by the majority of emerging countries will permit us to test if capital standards, largely inspired from <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio,</b> that regulate banks in these countries, have really influenced banks prudential behaviour. Using a non-parametric approach, we found mitigated results, since it seems obvious that more conformity of banks to capital standards induced more profitability to these institutions, restricted their leverage and strengthened their ability to hedge anticipated losses during distress episodes. However, the results also show that in emerging countries, contrary to developed countries, higher conformity to capital standards was not followed by an improvement in credit quality. Consequently, we remain doubtful toward the ability of this prudential mechanism in achieving his principal target in emerging countries’ banking systems that is reducing credit risk. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the extended stakeholder corporate governance model in credit unions {{and the extent}} to which inherent managerial entrenchment impacts upon their operational decisions. Using Australian credit union data and the introduction of Basle-type capital adequacy regulations as a case study, we demonstrate that credit union management will opt to manage capital adequacy ratios through the application of accounting manipulations instead of applying policies that increase operating margins. In particular, credit unions with capital adequacy ratios below the <b>Cooke</b> <b>Ratio</b> of 8 % will undertake risky accounting reclassifications. Our results support the view that regulators should consider the heterogeneity of financial institutions before imposing (possibly) inappropriate template regulation with a one-shoe-fits-all regulation.

40|$|Existing {{institutions}} of banking regulation force banks to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios. These regulations intend {{to guarantee the}} solvency of banks and to protect depositors against excessive risk-taking by bank-owners. By the same token, however, they may have consequences for investment finance. The paper asks in a standard principal-agent-setting what these consequences are and argues that excessive minimum capital adequacy ratios form an obstacle to investment finance of poorly capitalized firms which {{do not have access}} to direct finance via capital markets.

30|$|It can {{be argued}} that the neo-Schumpeterian school that has made such major {{progress}} in the modern study of innovation as recombination of knowledge (including knowledge-embedded technologies) has answered important aspects of that puzzle. Thus we can say with confidence that innovation has limits without being reductionist about its circumscription. Innovation is a creative, commercially (socially) relevant and novel recombination of old and new knowledge and technologies. “Relevance” here denotes novelty may have to await the removal of other innovatory bottlenecks Balconi et al. (2010). Accordingly time economies often interrupt innovation profitability: even novel methods of “knowledge insurance” such as milestone payments and special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are fashioned in recognition of the risk entailed in expectations of future rewards. Underlying that institutional willingness on the part of public and private innovation funding agents to execute such investment risks is what ECT theorists of economic evolution like Kauffman (2008) refer to the “purposiveness” of innovative action. As ECT suggests, surrounded by Lego bricks of all kinds, the innovative actor may veer from cognitive listlessness to paralysis in the search for inspiration by clear, purposive action. Only then are the appropriate recombinant, related varieties of knowledge and artifacts/technologies selected for assembly as purposive innovations. At high levels of complexity, self-organization of innovation processes are implied where the “global controller” used to manage the blueprint decision-making of earlier eras as described for assembly of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Boisot et al. (2011). Among the associated advances, the analysis of the value curve also now shows the structuring of innovation value exchanged through “open innovation” in relation to the “power laws” of intellectual capital:labour and locational <b>ratios</b> (<b>Cooke</b> 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{the impact}} of the <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio</b> on risk profile and on the {{behaviour}} of commercial banks in Basel Committee non-members countries. Using a non-parametric test and a simultaneous equation model, we observe {{that there is not a}} significant impact of regulatory capital on risk-taking. In these countries, banks? capitalization and risk-taking are sensitive to the macroeconomic and regulatory environment, as well as to political interference and to the quality of equity capital instruments. In the perspective of the adoption of Basel III Capital Standards, it is important for emerging countries that supervision authorities give more attention to the specificities of their banking systems.

40|$|The rules {{established}} by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{do not seem to}} provide the condition for a safe international financial system. After the creation of an international public rule, the <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio,</b> in the 1980 s, financial supervisors have left to the private sector the authority to write the new regulatory standards of the 1990 s. The new rules ended up with a weaker quality of risk supervision. In spite of that result, the Basel Committee is now following the same logic in credit risk operations. Paradoxically, this contribute to make international finance a zone of international ungovernance. JEL Classifications : G 28 Chavagneux Christian.

The {{implementation}} of this reform implies the setting up, within the banks, of news approaches of internal ratings, which {{have a major impact}} on the banks internal organization. The consequences of these approaches on the internal structure are studied relying on the organizational architecture theory. The recourse to a case study enables us to analyze the process of implementation of internal ratings’ approaches. It also allows appraising the effects of it upon; the allocation of decision making rights, and the internal system of control of the individuals within the studied French mutual banking company.

The Influence of Private Players on International Financial Regulation, by Christian Chavagneux and Eric Nicolas Financial globalization {{raises the}} problem of monitoring the risks - particularly market risks — taken by financial institutions. Recent developments tend to show that this monitoring is increasingly difficult in terms of applying general rules of good conduct of the <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio</b> type {{in view of the}} growing complexity of market activities and is increasingly moving towards a form of self-regulation by financial institutions themselves. Only the large financial institutions, particularly the American ones, now seem to have more or less the ability to control these risks. The supervisory authorities and smaller-sized financial institutions no longer appear to be capable of controlling them. Furthermore these self-regulation practices seem difficult to apply and do not constitute a guarantee sufficient to ensure the security of world finance, which currently appears to be a factor for instability of globalized capitalism.

40|$|The banking {{sector is}} under {{prudential}} regulations set internationally by the Basel Committee, {{in order to}} ensure its strength, stability and mitigate competitive inequities. Its founding principle is based on a minimum solvency ratio introduced in 1988 {{in the form of the}} <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio,</b> resulting in a harmonization of the rules of banking supervision governing the level of own funds. Basel II was introduced after the various financial crises of the 1990 s (the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis, and the Brazilian and Argentinean crisis). Despite a series of reforms, Basel II has quickly shown its limitations with the 2007 crisis that has strongly impacted the financial markets and the world economy generally. In this context, the Basel Committee has developed within Basel III a number of requirements which aim at strengthening the resilience of the banking institutions and financial system. These adjustments will be applied to the three pillars already in place and relate to capital, liquidity and systemic risks. The new Basel provisions relating to the calculation of the numerator of the solvency ratio are declined according to the triptych: strengthening the quality of prudential eligible own funds instruments, increase of the statutory deductions provided by Basel II, and higher minimum thresholds of solvency ratios. Furthermore, a limitation of the lever, calculated from the balance sheet and elements of off-balance sheet based on non-weighted by the risks, will be introduced. The Basel III criteria entering into force between 2013 and 2018 constitute one of the major challenges to which the banking sector will face. The real impact of the Basel III reform will depend on the attitude of the banks that will have to change in their strategy, their cost structure and policy of remuneration of the shareholders. A reform which will have therefore an impact on the world economy ensuring as estimated by Governors and supervisors, stability and long term economic performance. This paper will present the main adjustments proposed by the Basel Committee...|$|E
40|$|The {{connection}} between the concepts of regulatory capital and economic capital appears at first glance to be relatively obvious. Prudential standards, from which the notion of regulatory capital directly stems, are intended to ensure the soundness and stability of individual financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole. Thus the capital ratio links the concerns of regulators to those of bank directors and stockholders, resulting in a partial convergence in the methods for calculating regulatory and economic capital, and also, to some extent, in the objectives underlying those calculations. Over the past two decades, the convergence in the methodologies underlying these two concepts has been reinforced by the establishment of increasingly sophisticated prudential mechanisms – from the <b>Cooke</b> <b>ratio</b> in 1988 to the recent innovations introduced by the Basel II Accord – and by the parallel development of more efficient tools for measuring and analyzing banking risks. Thus the new Basel Accord, in providing a measure of regulatory capital that better reflects the risks inherent in each type of portfolio, resembles in many respects the methods that banks use to measure economic capital. In a banking environment that is both more risky and more competitive, efforts {{on the part of}} banks and supervisors to improve the solvency of the banking system must take into account the capacity of banks to earn profits while limiting excessive risk-taking. In the pursuit of profits, banks have a clear interest in reducing their credit risk, since this will tend to increase their margins, all other things being equal. This reduction in credit risk improves the efficiency of banks, {{and at the same time}} helps guarantee the financial health of individual institutions and the stability of the financial system as a whole. Despite these links, regulatory capital and economic capital do not necessarily coincide, because they serve fundamentally different objectives. The ultimate objectives of supervisors are to protect depositors, ensure the soundness of fi nancial institutions, and prevent financial crises. The objective of bank directors is to maximize the return to their shareholders, by maximizing the profits generated by the bank’s activities through the optimal allocation of capital across different business lines. Thus economic capital is concerned with the internal management of the institution, while regulatory capital is about ensuring the solvency of the institution and of the financial sector as a whole. While the tendency for regulatory capital and economic capital to converge is generally viewed as beneficial, a perfect alignment of the two concepts would not be desirable, for several reasons. To begin with, internal systems for measuring risks still have serious limitations, and the methods for measuring different types of risk are still very fragmented. Furthermore, the objectives of large financial conglomerates are not always consistent with the goal of financial stability. Finally, an alignment of internal practices could result in a higher degree of correlation of risk exposures across institutions, increasing systemic risk in the banking system. ...|$|E
