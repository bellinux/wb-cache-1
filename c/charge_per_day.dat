40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{examines}} {{the cost of}} providing trauma services in trauma centers organized by publicly administered trauma systems, compared to hospitals {{not part of a}} formal trauma system. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. Secondary administrative discharge abstracts for a national sample of severely injured trauma patients in 44 trauma centers and 60 matched control hospitals for the year 1987 were used. STUDY DESIGN. Retrospective univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the impact of formal trauma systems and trauma center designation on the costs of treating trauma patients. Key dependent variables included length of stay, <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> per patient, and charge per hospital stay. Key impact variables were type of trauma system and level of trauma designation. Control variables included patient, hospital, and community characteristics. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Data were selected for hospitals based on (1) a large national hospital discharge database, the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project, 1980 - 1987 (HCUP- 2) and (2) a special survey of trauma systems and trauma designation undertaken by the Hospital Research and Educational Trust of the American Hospital Association. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. The results show that publicly designated Level I trauma centers, which are the focal point of most trauma systems, have the highest charge per case, the highest average <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> and similar or longer average lengths of stay than other hospitals. These findings persist after controlling for patient injury and health status, and for demographic characteristics and hospital and community characteristics. CONCLUSIONS. Prior research shows that severely injured trauma patients have greater chances of survival when treated in specialized trauma centers. However, findings here should be of concern to the many states developing trauma systems since the high costs of Level I centers support limiting the number of centers designated at this level and/or reconsidering the requirements placed on these centers...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{models have}} been used to assess the {{influence}} of clinical and demographic factors on hospital charge and length of stay (LOS). Hospital costs constitute a significant proportion of overall expenditure in health care. With escalating costs, knowing the correlates of LOS and in-hospital cost is important for decisions on allocating resources. However, hospital charge and LOS are correlated. We describe two regression models that permit estimation of mean charges as a function of patient hospital stay and adjust for the influence of patient characteristics and treatment procedures on LOS and charge. In the first model, the mean charge over a specified duration is a weighted average of the expected cumulative charge, with weighting determined by the distribution of LOS. The second model for LOS and charge explicitly accounts for their correlation and yields estimates of the average charge per average LOS. The methods are applied to assess mean charges and mean <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> by cardiac procedure in a cohort of patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, while adjusting for the impact of patient demographic and clinical factors on LOS and charge. For relatively short hospital stays, and when only total hospital charges are available, these models provide a flexible approach to estimating summary measures on resource use while controlling for the effects of covariates on LOS and charge.

40|$|There {{are four}} large {{limestone}} quarries, located nearby Cairo metropolitan. Drilling and blasting operations {{are used to}} extract limestone for the cement industries. In these quarries, the blast vibration should be kept below a certain limit. One of these quarries is Tourah Portland Cement Company (TPCC) limestone quarry which, lies near important and historical large caves, within Tourah Mountain. Therefore, control of blast vibration level becomes very critical. A series of multi-holes blasts have been performed to answer several questions about the optimum scaled distance {{that can be used}} safely to avoid caves damage, what constitutes true timing and initiation system?, and their relation to the blast vibration level?. Four Tri-axial geophones located in a linear array, over a distance of 1. 0 km (0. 621 miles) from the quarry faces, they have synchronized by means of a GPS timing reference. The data retrieved from the geophones and subjected to different steps of processing and analysis. The field tests showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the blast vibration level between top and bottom initiation systems, containing the same explosive charge per delay intervals. In the upper bench, the results showed that the blast optimization of vibration level requires small delay intervals at distance more than 800. 0 m (875 yards), between shot point and caves. This study helped TPCC limestone quarry to remain operating since the government permitted the continuation of blasting operations. In addition, the advantages of using Nonel system in comparison with VA electrical detonators, could lead to convince the government to raise the permitted explosive <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>day...</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{barriers}} to implementation of road user charging is how to design a scheme that is simultaneously acceptable {{to the public and}} effective in achieving its objective. The aim of this research was to study how road user charging can be designed to achieve acceptability and effectiveness. Acceptability was reflected by voting behaviour, in which individuals were asked whether they were willing to vote for charging schemes. Effectiveness in reducing congestion was evaluated by mode switching of commuters. The research demonstrated the effects of the system benefits (car and bus travel time reduction, environmental improvement and revenue use) and the system features (charging levels, charging methods, charged times and charged areas). It also investigated the impacts of personal characteristics and perceptions. The research also examined the effect of selfish and social perspectives, reflected by the perceptions of benefits to self and to society, on acceptability. Paper based SP questionnaires were distributed to residents and employees in Leeds and London between November 2000 and March 2001. A total of 830 responses were received. The analysis technique was based on random utility theory, which was used to formulate the multinomial-logit based models. The standard logit model was used to demonstrate the overall effects of variables for the whole sample. The segmentation model, based on the incremental factors, was used to identify the different effects for different groups of people. The random parameters logit model was used to examine taste variations (heterogeneity) among individuals frorn unobserved factors, which were unable to be captured by the segmentation model. The study found that although more highly effective charging schemes (with higher levels of charge) were less acceptable, while more highly acceptable schemes (with lower levels of charge) were not substantially less effective. In other words, effective charging schemes were not always unacceptable. Acceptability varies substantially across system characteristics. Acceptable road user charging schemes can be designed by limiting the area of charge to within the city centre and having a fixed <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> Support would be increased significantly if the scheme was expected to bring substantial environmental improvement.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} significant trends over time have occurred in resource use {{associated with the use of}} extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in critically ill adults. MethodsAll adult admissions involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were examined by using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (years 1998 - 2009). Trends in volume, outcome, and resource use (including hospital charges, length of stay, and <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> were analyzed. ResultsAn estimated total of 8753 admissions involved extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over the study period. Overall length of stay was 18. 3 ± 1. 3 days. Total hospital charges averaged $ 344, 009 ± $ 30, 707 per admission, with average <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> of $ 40, 588 ± $ 3099. Cumulative national charges for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation admissions increased significantly from $ 109. 0 million in 1998 to $ 764. 7 million in 2009 (P = . 0016). <b>Charges</b> <b>per</b> patient and length of stay also increased significantly (P = . 0032 and. 0321, respectively). The increasing trend in the number of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation admissions during the study period was not statistically significant (P = . 19). The post-cardiotomy group had more favorable outcomes and lower resource use. A shift was observed in the relative case-mix of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation admissions over the study period, with a relative decrease in the post-cardiotomy group and increases in the cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and lung transplant groups. ConclusionsThese results suggest that dramatic increases in resource use associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are not solely the result of increased volume, but in part are due to a shift toward extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in patient groups (other than in the post-cardiotomy setting) with greater resource use and worse outcomes...|$|R
