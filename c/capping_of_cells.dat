Having previously demonstrated {{the importance of the}} Lin 28 /let- 7 /Myc axis in CaP, we tested the hypothesis that Lin 28 is overexpressed in CaP and that it activates AR and promotes growth <b>of</b> <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> We analyzed human clinical CaP samples for the expression of Lin 28 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and IHC. Growth characteristics <b>of</b> <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> lines transiently and stably expressing Lin 28 were examined. The clonogenic ability <b>of</b> <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> expressing Lin 28 was determined by colony formation and soft agar assays. Increase in expression of AR and subsequent increase in transcription of AR-target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, luciferase assays, and ELISA. LNCaP cells stably expressing Lin 28 were injected into nude mice, and tumorigenesis was monitored. We found that Lin 28 is overexpressed in clinical CaP compared to benign prostates. Overexpression of Lin 28 enhanced, while down-regulation reduced, growth <b>of</b> <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> Lin 28 enhanced the ability <b>of</b> <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> to form colonies in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent conditions. LNCaP cells stably expressing Lin 28 exhibited significantly higher tumorigenic ability inÂ vivo. Lin 28 induced expression of the AR and its target genes such as PSA and NKX 3. 1.

40|$|Conventional myosin II is an {{essential}} protein for cytokinesis, <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> surface receptors, and development <b>of</b> Dictyostelium <b>cells.</b> Myosin II also {{plays an important role}} in the polarization and movement <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> All conventional myosins are double-headed molecules but the significance of this structure is not understood since single-headed myosin II can produce movement and force in vitro. We found that expression of the tail portion of myosin II in Dictyostelium led to the formation of single-headed myosin II in vivo. The resultant cells contain an approximately equal ratio of double- and single-headed myosin II molecules. Surprisingly, these cells were completely blocked in cytokinesis and <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> concanavalin A receptors although development into fruiting bodies was not impaired. We found that this phenotype is not due to defects in myosin light chain phosphorylation. These results show that single-headed myosin II cannot function properly in vivo and that it acts as a dominant negative mutation for myosin II function. These results suggest the possibility that cooperativity of myosin II heads is critical for force production in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Germline {{stem cells}} in the Drosophila ovary are {{maintained}} by a somatic niche. The niche is structurally and functionally complex and contains four cell types, the escort, cap, and terminal filament cells and the newly identified transition cell. We find that the large Maf transcription factor Traffic jam (Tj) is essential for determining niche cell fates and architecture, enabling each niche in the ovary to support a normal complement of 2 - 3 germline stem cells. In particular, we focused on the question <b>of</b> how <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> form. Cap cells express Tj and are considered the key component of a mature germline stem cell niche. We conclude that Tj controls the specification <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> as {{the complete loss of}} Tj function caused the development of additional terminal filament cells at the expense <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> and terminal filament cells developed cap cell characteristics when induced to express Tj. Further, we propose that Tj controls the morphogenetic behavior <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> as they adopted the shape and spatial organization <b>of</b> terminal filament <b>cells</b> but otherwise appeared to retain their fate when Tj expression was only partially reduced. Our data indicate that Tj contributes to the establishment <b>of</b> germline stem <b>cells</b> by promoting the cap cell fate, and controls the stem cell-carrying capacity of the niche by regulating niche architecture. Analysis of the interactions between Tj and the Notch (N) pathway indicates that Tj and N have distinct functions in the cap cell specification program. We propose that formation <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> depends on the combined activities of Tj and the N pathway, with Tj promoting the cap cell fate by blocking the terminal filament cell fate, and N supporting cap cells by preventing the escort cell fate and/or controlling the number <b>of</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> precursors...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> surface receptors {{has been}} examined by a double fluorescence staining procedure that permitted simultaneous {{observations of the}} distribution of a surface-bound ligand together with intracellular actin or myosin. At an early stage in the <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> the T- 25 antigen or the H 2 histocompatibility antigens on mouse splenic T lymphocytes, or of concanavalin A receptors on HeLa cells, when the specific receptors in question were collected into patches that were distributed over the entire cell surface, the intracellular membrane-associated actin or myosin was also accumulated into patches that were located directly under the receptor patches. These and other results have led us to propose a general molecular mechanism for the process <b>of</b> <b>capping,</b> in which actin and myosin are directly involved. It is suggested that membrane-associated actin is directly or indirectly bound to an integral protein or class of proteins, X, in the plasma membranes <b>of</b> eukaryotic <b>cells.</b> When any receptor in the membrane is aggregated by an external multivalent ligand, the aggregate binds effectively to X, whereas unaggregated receptors do not bind to X.

Elution of the material bound to fetuin yielded low but reproducible amounts of protein, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 2 % of the protein mass of the input sera. This material has been identified by immunoelectrophoresis in agar and by zone electrophoresis on cellulose acetate as immunoglobulin. The Ig fractions bound and agglutinated erythrocytes of various species, and also bound to cells from various mouse tissues including heart, kidney, thymus, and spleen. In all cases, the binding was inhibited by glycoproteins such as fetuin and thyroglobulin, by a glycopeptide isolated from fetuin, and by some bacterial lipopolysaccharides.

40|$|Abstract Background The c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), {{also known}} as ponsin, localizes to focal adhesions and stress fibers and is {{involved}} in signaling events. Phosphorylation has been described for the other {{two members of the}} sorbin homology family, vinexin and ArgBP 2, but no data exist about the putative phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CAP.</b> According to previous findings, CAP binds to tyrosine kinase c-Abl. However, it is not known if CAP is a substrate of c-Abl or other tyrosine kinases or if phosphorylation regulates its localization. Results We here show that CAP is Tyr phosphorylated by and interacts with both c-Abl and c-Src. One major phosphorylation site, Tyr 360, and two minor contributors Tyr 326 and Tyr 632 were identified as Abl phosphorylation sites, whereas Src preferentially phosphorylates Tyr 326 and Tyr 360. Phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>CAP</b> was not necessary for its localization to focal adhesions and stress fibers, but Tyr 326 Phe substitution alters the function <b>of</b> <b>CAP</b> during <b>cell</b> spreading.

Further, vinblastine treatment <b>of</b> <b>capped</b> calls resulted in the formation of numerous paracrystals that were confined to the cytoplasm underlying the <b>capped</b> region <b>of</b> the membrane; uncapped cells displayed paracrystals that were randomly dispersed in the cytoplasm. Exposure <b>of</b> fixed <b>cells</b> to fluorescein thiocarbamyl colchicine, which localizes colchicine binding proteins, revealed an intensely fluorescent region that corresponded to the cap; this staining pattern was absent in uncapped cells. These findings indicate that concanavalin A mediated capping modifies the cytoplasmic disposition of microtubules and colchicine binding proteins. Further, it is suggested that the <b>capped</b> region <b>of</b> the plasma membrane is a preferred site of microtubule polymerization...|$|R

In these Con A-treated <b>cells,</b> the association <b>of</b> cytoplasmic proteins with cell membranes was suggested by observing their Triton shells. The transition from G-actin to F-actin occurred in these <b>cells.</b> The association <b>of</b> membrane lipid with cytoplasmic proteins extracted from AH cells was studied by {{the isolation of}} protein-bound liposomes and phase transition release. The analysis of isolated liposomes revealed that many cytoplasmic proteins which specifically associated with liposomes were cytoskeletal elements including F-actins. The association of proteins with liposomes was affected by the lipid composition of the liposomal membrane and by the Ca 2 + concentration of the incubation medium. The strong interaction of liposomal membrane with cytoplasmic proteins or isolated cytoskeletal proteins was demonstrated also by phase transition release using carboxy fluorescein-containing liposomes. These experiments showed {{that there was a}} strong affinity between lipid membrane and cytoskeletal elements including F-actins and that the amount of F-actin increased due to Con A treatment. The association of the submembranous microfilaments with the cell membrane may contribute to <b>capping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cells</b> caused by Con A. </p...|$|R
