40|$|Background: Adequate {{nutrition}} {{is needed}} to ensure optimum growth and development of infants and young children. Understanding of the risk factors for stunting and severe stunting among <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> {{less than five years}} in North Maluku province is important to guide Indonesian government public health planners to develop nutrition programs and interventions in a post conflict area. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with stunting and severe stunting among <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> less than five years in North Maluku province of Indonesia. Methods: The health and nutritional status of <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> less than five years was assessed in North Maluku province of Indonesia in 2004 using a cross-sectional multi-stage survey conducted on 750 households from each of the four island groups in North Maluku province. A total of 2168 <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> 0 - 59 months were used in the analysis. Results: Prevalence of stunting and severe stunting were 29 % (95 %CI: 26. 0 - 32. 2) and 14. 1 % (95 %CI: 11. 7 - 17. 0) for <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> 0 - 23 months and 38. 4 % (95 %CI: 35. 9 - 41. 0) and 18. 4 % (95 %CI: 16. 1 - 20. 9) for <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> 0 - 59 months, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for stunted <b>children</b> were <b>child's</b> <b>age</b> in months, male sex and number of family meals per day (&# 8804; 2 times), for <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> 0 - 23 months, and income (poorest and middle-class family), <b>child's</b> <b>age</b> in months and male sex for <b>children</b> <b>aged</b> 0 - 59 months.
