40|$|The {{effect of}} {{deformable}} and rigid connectors {{and influence of}} connection parameters on the behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> is examined. Both the elastic and plastic behaviour are discussed, but the former one is the main concern. Deformable connectors cause slip in the joint, which results in redistribution of internal forces {{and changes in the}} deformed shape of the beam compared to the connection with rigid connectors. The aim {{of this study is to}} complement the analytical methods and develop numerical models – based on the author's experimental research – capable to provide reliable parametric studies of three-dimensional structural models of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> with deformable and rigid connectors. At first, the partial interaction problem, behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> in the case of various loading types, recent development and real behaviour of connections of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> is discussed in the introduction. It is followed by a detailed literature survey serving the purpose of this study. This survey comprises two main parts: analytical and numerical models of <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> Among the analytical models, statical and energy methods are considered. The author also developed a new kind of energy method based on variational calculation for determination of shear force distribution of shear connectors of <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> The new method is in compliance with the experimental and the latest theoretical investigations.

Experimental studies are followed by parametric studies based on analytical and finite element analyses in order to examine how changes in the connector stiffness affect the behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> Based on these parametric studies, new design formulas are developed for design practice.

40|$|The use of {{advanced}} composite materials for rehabilitation and repair of deteriorating infrastructure has been embraced worldwide. The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming and labor intensive. A total of 38 specimens {{made of steel}} and carbon fibers were prepared and tested to investigate the possibility of galvanic corrosion. Two simulated aggressive environments and three different amounts of epoxy coating were used. Potentiodynamic polarization and galvanic corrosion tests were conducted. The results of the experiments showed the existence of galvanic corrosion however the rate of such corrosion could be decreased significantly by epoxy coating. A total of 21 specimens made of S 5 x 10 A 36 steel beams were prepared and tested to determine the effectiveness of CFRP patch on fatigue life of notched beam. The results showed that not only CFRP patch tends to extend the fatigue life of a detail more than three times, but also it decreases the crack growth rate significantly. To investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} epoxy bonded CFRP sheets in repair and retrofit of <b>composite</b> <b>girders,</b> a total of six large-scale steel-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> made of W 14 x 30 A 36 steel beam and 7. 5 cm. thick by 91 cm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. Three different numbers of CFRP layers and three different damage level in Range were considered. The retrofitting test results showed that epoxy bonded CFRP Sheet increased the ultimate load carrying capacity of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods. The repair test results showed that epoxy bonded CFRP sheet could restore the ultimate load carrying capacity and stiffness of damaged steel-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> The ultimate capacity of the repaired beam was predicted by traditional methods of analysis of steel-concrete composite beams, which was fairly conservative.

40|$|Up {{until today}} {{reinforced}} concrete {{has been used}} in most cases for the manufacturing of bridge decks. Depending {{on the quality of the}} work carried out, defects can already occur after only a few years. These defects mostly appear in the form of corrosion of the steel reinforcement due to concrete's sensitivity to de-icing salts and water. To reduce maintenance costs, which are mainly caused by corrosion of the steel reinforcement, attempts were made to eliminate the steel reinforcement in the bridge deck. This was achieved for example by replacing the whole concrete bridge deck with an FRP 1 bridge deck. FRP bridge decks, besides the advantage of the absence of steel reinforcement, exhibit the advantage of a low dead load (approx. 20 % of a comparable concrete deck) combined with high strength. These properties resulted in the fact that today more than 200 bridges with FRP decks are in service worldwide. Most of them need steel or concrete main girders to bridge the required span. Despite the many bridges already in service, assessment of their load-bearing capacity or deflections still remains difficult. Some of the reasons for this this are as follows: Geometry and material properties vary considerably between different FRP bridge-deck types. The problem of the connection between main girders and bridge decks has only been partially solved. No design method exists which allows determination of the stresses and deflections of <b>composite</b> <b>girders,</b> and takes the degree of composite action of the bridge deck into account. This thesis contributes to solve these problems. Experiments with two different bridge decks were carried out in order to determine the necessary system properties (in-plane compression and shear resistance and in-plane compression and shear stiffness) for the calculation of the load-bearing behavior of steel/FRP <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> The method developed to determine the system properties can also be applied to other FRP bridge decks (e. g. sandwich decks). In a second step, four <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> (two with each bridge deck) were manufactured by bonding the bridge decks onto conventional steel girders. Local failure of the bridge deck, as occurs in girders with stud or bolt connections, is therefore prevented and a clear load transfer in the joint is assured. One of the two girders, with each bridge deck system, was tested statically and the other statically and under fatigue loads. The results of the girder experiments showed that adhesive bonding is a reliable connection technique, since failure always occurred first in the bridge deck and then in the adhesive layer. The stiffness and failure load of the <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> could be increased considerably in comparison with the pure steel girder. The determined system properties concerning in-plane shear and compression stiffness were confirmed with the girder experiments. The results of the experiments with the <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> were compared with results of an analytical design method for concrete/wood girders adapted for steel/FRP <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> It was shown that the load-bearing behavior of <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> consisting of steel main girders and adhesively- bonded FRP bridge decks can be determined with good accuracy in the linear-elastic region. Furthermore a design method was developed which allows the loadbearing capacity of the steel/FRP <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> investigated in this thesis to be determined with very good accuracy. Subsequently a parameter study was carried out in order to verify the assumption of full composite action in the adhesively- bonded joint. This is one of the requirements for application of the developed design methods. The study showed that the assumption is applicable for different adhesives and even for thicknesses up to 50 mm.

The flexural behavior of such hybrid FRP composite girders was investigated.

40|$|At present, {{steel is}} one of the most {{important}} structural materials. Properties of particular importance in structural usage are high strength, compared to any other available material, and ductility. With rising of economical issue and coming up of constructional renaissance, the advent of HSS has helped to stop the progress of those predicaments. The steel up-to-the-minute mills produce quite a lot of grades of steel of interest to the structural designer. In contrast with many of the higher strength steels that have been available in the past, the modern higher strength steels show more favorable price-to-strength ratios than structural steel carbon steel. However, prospective disadvantages associated with the use of HSS include reduced ductility and poor weld characteristics. The most prospective gain of using HSS in <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> models, as been shown in this paper, is reducing the structural depth and weight. Not many researchers have coped with application of HSS in composite structures. Preceding studies on HSS were, focused mostly on bare steel elements (Haaijer 1961, Frost, Schilling 1964 and Suzuki et al. 1994).

40|$|In {{continuous}} concrete-steel <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> bridges, {{the concrete}} {{contribution to the}} composite action at interior supports is impaired because the concrete deck is in tension. Post-tensioning introduces compression to the structure and reinstates the contribution of concrete to the composite action. Janssen and Spaans (1994) proposed a post-tensioning scheme, which involved using concrete end diaphragms as anchorage and concrete intermediate diaphragms as draped points for steel tendons. In the short-term, this scheme produces structurally and economically efficient structures. Long-term efficiency, however, can only be assessed once the time dependent effects caused by creep, shrinkage, and relaxation are considered. ^ In this study, finite element models were used to study the time dependent effects in post-tensioned <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> bridges. How post-tensioning induced stresses, internal forces, and deflection change with time were investigated. Parametric studies were conducted to study how changes in these quantities were affected by bridge geometry, material properties and surrounding conditions. Finally, a simplified design approach to account for time dependent effects was proposed. ^ It was found that time dependent effects in terms of change in stresses and internal forces are considerable. While shrinkage has the most profound effect in terms of prestress loss, creep {{plays a major role}} in terms of stress changes and moment redistribution. Change in deflection is small due to the cancellation effects of creep and shrinkage. Despite the time dependent change in the post-tensioning effect, substantial material saving can still be realized in this type of bridge. Post-tensioned <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> bridges still represent structurally and economically efficient structures. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper informs {{about the}} results of {{research}} in the field of hybrid composite structures with GFRP element. The first part presents some results of push tests on hybrid composite girders of the “I” shape with reinforced concrete flanges and GFRP wall. The concrete dowels and contact surface roughening were used to arrange the connection between concrete and GFRP wall. The 3 specimens of composite girders and the 2 comparative concrete girders were tested. The incremental short-term bending load tests were performed and compared to FEM analysis on 3 D models in ATENA system. Some results are presented {{in the second part of}} the paper. Sufficient coincidence of the load response between the test results and numerical simulations of hybrid girders was recorded. The exceeding of the concrete dowel resistance has been observed and it seems to be the main reason of the <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> bending failure. However, the global resistance of <b>composite</b> <b>girder</b> was higher than the comparative RC girders. Higher concrete strength contributed to the global resistance increasing due to higher resistance of concrete dowels, which allowed better utilization of GFRP wall bending resistance of hybrid structure...|$|E
30|$|Oehlers and Park (1992) {{presented}} 25 push-off {{tests of}} shear studs {{in a series}} of studies of shear transfer in <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> At failure loads, concrete in front of the stud crushed, leading to combined bending and shear in the studs. The authors concluded that the longitudinal cracks near the crush-prone region reduced the strength of concrete under tri-axial compression. In this case, the stud capacity is likely reduced by 10 percent. Transverse reinforcement near the shear studs were found beneficial to the strength of the shear studs because it confined the tri-axial compression zones.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} method for {{short and long}} term analysis of steel-concrete continuous <b>composite</b> <b>girders</b> with fractionated slab castings is proposed by taking into account the flexibility of the shear connection and the concrete behavior at early ages (concrete autogenous shrinkage and hydration thermal strain). The numerical solution is achieved by means of a finite element approach in conjunction with the step-by-step procedures. The proposed method is applied to a four span continuous composite deck by analyzing the tensile stresses in the slab produced by two different casting sequences...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the step-by-step procedure for using Elastic Theory {{to calculate the}} internal stresses in <b>composite</b> bridge <b>girders</b> prestressed by the Preflexing Technology, called Prebeam in Japan and Preflex beam worldwide. Elastic Theory approaches preflex beams {{the same way as}} it does the conventional <b>composite</b> <b>girders.</b> Since preflex beam undergoes different stages of construction, calculations are made using different sectional and material properties. Stresses are calculated in every stage using the properties of the specific section. Stress accumulation gives the available stress in a section of interest. Concrete presence in the section implies prestress loss due to creep and shrinkage, however; more work is required to be done in this field. In addition to the graphical presentation of this application, this paper further discusses important notes of graphical comparison between the results of an experimental-only research carried out on a preflex beam, with the results of simulation based on the elastic theory approach, for an identical beam using Finite Element Modeling (FEM) by the author...|$|R
