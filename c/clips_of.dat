40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of various shrub control treatments (N+P fertilization, <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa and clipping combined with N+P fertilization), to reduce shrub cover and encourage the growth of palatable herbaceous vegetation. Dry matter production and Crude Protein (CP) content of palatable herbaceous vegetation were determined annually from 2004 to 2006. Experimental plots received rains of 691. 7, 532. 9 and 595. 7 mm during the 3 study years compared to mean growing season rainfall of 486. 6 mm. Forage production was increased significantly by <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa (409. 4 vs 335. 5 g DM m- 2, p< 0. 05) and clipping combined with N+P fertilization (454. 6 vs 335. 5 g DM m- 2, p< 0. 05). On average over the 3 years, crude protein concentration increased by fertilization (9. 18 vs 8. 26 %, p< 0. 05) and fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa (9. 35 vs 8. 26 %, p< 0. 05). N and P fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa significantly (p< 0. 05) affected S-RUE. The highest S-RUE of 3. 09 kg forage ha- 1 mm- 1 was obtained with N+P fertilization combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa. On average over the 3 years, nutrient use efficiency with N+P application combined with <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomis fruticosa for all treatments was higher than without clipping. The increases in plant production per kg fertilizer applied, for N+P application both and without <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> Phlomi...|$|R

5000|$|The EBN {{modus operandi}} {{was to take}} cable {{television}} broadcasts and remix them with a funky beat, often having the lyrics [...] "sung" [...] not by a singer but by half-second sound clips from TV, spliced together. For example, the lyric [...] "electronic behavior control system" [...] would be created with a <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> Ross Perot saying [...] "electronic", followed by a <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> George H. W. Bush saying [...] "behavior", then Ted Koppel saying [...] "control", and finally a <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> Bill Clinton saying [...] "system". This technique has been named video scratching.|$|R

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The <b>clips</b> <b>of</b> {{the people on}} Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, {{making it difficult to}} read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the <b>clips</b> <b>of</b> Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
