40|$|Fluorinated {{non-ionic}} surfactants were assessed as adjuvants for tribenuron-methyl, triflusulfuron-methyl and foramsulfuron. The compared adjuvants included hydroxy-terminated fluorinated polyether (PF- 151 N), poly- oxyethylene-alpha-fluoro-omega-(2 -hydroxyethyl) poly(difluoromethylene) (Zonyl FSN- 100), and polyoxyethyl- ene(23) lauryl ether (Brij 35). Greenhouse experiments {{were performed to}} evaluate these surfactants both for their efficacy in controlling weeds and selectivity to crops. Tribenuron-methyl and triflusulfuron-methyl absorp- tion into <b>catchweed</b> and giant foxtail leaves due to surfactant addition was also estimated. Zonyl FSN- 100 and Brij 35 allowed {{a reduction in the}} application rate of triflusulfuron-methyl to nearly 1 / 2 of the labelled rate to control redroot pigweed. The foramsulfuron rate was reduced by more than 50 % to control barnyardgrass thanks to the addition of Zonyl FSN- 100 and it controlled giant foxtail only applied at the maximum labelled rate and mixed with Zonyl FSN- 100. Tribenuron-methyl activity against poppy was only slightly enhanced by the use of adjuvants. Tribenuron-methyl efficacy was clearly enhanced by the use of adjuvants to control catchweed; how- ever, the required dose was not lower than the labelled one. The addition of adjuvants induced slight phytotoxic- ity in the crops. Brij 35 caused the greatest absorption of triflusulfuron-methyl into giant foxtail leaves and of tribenuron-methyl into <b>catchweed</b> leaves...|$|E
40|$|DuPontTM OmneraTM LQMTM (DPX-SGE 27) (5 g/l metsulfuron-methyl, 30 g/l thifensulfuron-methyl, 135 g/l fluroxypyr) {{represents}} with {{an application}} rate of 1 l/ha a new “herbicide” solution in cereals. DuPontTM OmneraTM LQMTM {{is characterized by}} a very good efficacy, a broad weed spectrum, a broad application window (BBCH 20 – 39 in winter cereals; BBCH 12 – 39 in spring cereals) and a very good crop safety. DuPontTM OmneraTM LQMTM is formulated as oil dispersion. Several years of field trials demonstrate the efficacy of DuPontTM OmneraTM LQMTM against mayweed (Matricaria chamomilla), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), common chickweed (Stellaria media), but also against difficult weeds like wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus) and especially against <b>catchweed</b> bedstraw (Galium aparine) ...|$|E
40|$|Noninversion tillage with tine- or disc-based cultivations {{prior to}} crop {{establishment}} {{is the most}} common way of reducing tillage for arable cropping systems with small grain cereals, oilseed rape, and maize in Europe. However, new regulations on pesticide use might hinder further expansion of reduced-tillage systems. European agriculture is asked to become less dependent on pesticides and promote crop protection programs based on integrated pest management (IPM) principles. Conventional noninversion tillage systems rely entirely on the availability of glyphosate products, and herbicide consumption is mostly higher compared to plow-based cropping systems. Annual grass weeds and <b>catchweed</b> bedstraw often constitute the principal weed problems in noninversion tillage systems, and crop rotations concurrently have very high proportions of winter cereals. There is a need to redesign cropping systems to allow for more diversification of the crop rotations to combat these weed problems with less herbicide input. Cover crops, stubble management strategies, and tactics that strengthen crop growth relative to weed growth are also seen as important components in future IPM systems, but their impact in noninversion tillage systems needs validation. Direct mechanical weed control methods based on rotating weeding devices such as rotary hoes could become useful in reduced-tillage systems where more crop residues and less workable soils are more prevalent, but further development is needed for effective application. Owing to the frequent use of glyphosate in reduced-tillage systems, perennial weeds are not particularly problematic. However, results from organic cropping systems clearly reveal that desisting from glyphosate use inevitably leads to more problems with perennials, which need to be addressed in future research...|$|E
40|$|An organic {{long-term}} {{field experiment}} with two factors {{has been carried}} out since 1998 at the experimental station Gladbacherhof, University of Giessen. Effects of 3 different farm types (with lifestock raising, stockless farming with rotational set-aside, stockless farming only cash crops) combined with 4 tillage treatments (mouldboard plough, two-layer-plough, reduced tillage depth and tillage without plough) on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on the coverage rate of arable wild plants (weed coverage), the range of weed species, the abundance of C. arvense (L.) Scop. (Canada thistle) and the weed phytomass during harvest time of the main crops dependent on farm type and soil tillage. It can be concluded that, compared to conventional economic weed thresholds, the weed coverage was generally relatively low and only limited ranges of species were found. Wild arable plants probably did not have any impact on yields of the cultivated plants due to intensive mechanical regulatory measures. In stockless organic farming without alfalfa-grass in the crop rotation Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Canada thistle) might become a problem whereas this perennial root-weed does not seem to raise a long term problem in a soil tillage system without ploughing. In all treatments the abundance of weeds like Galium aparine L. (<b>catchweed</b> bedstraw) and Stellaria media L. (chickweed) was high. However, none of the farm types or soil tillage systems succeeded in providing evidence of promoting rare species or encouraging biodiversity. In order to achieve this special support measures should be implemented...|$|E
