25|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a <b>capital</b> <b>loss,</b> the after-tax <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|E
25|$|Bullish investors {{may choose}} to {{leverage}} their position by borrowing money against their existing assets and then purchasing gold on account with the loaned funds. Leverage is also {{an integral part of}} buying gold derivatives and unhedged gold mining company shares (see gold mining companies). Leverage or derivatives may increase investment gains but also increases the corresponding risk of <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> if/when the trend reverses.|$|E
25|$|In business, {{fractional}} ownership is a percentage share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset {{on behalf of}} the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly depreciating assets, the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> and optionally purchase a fraction of a new asset.|$|E

25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> to the buyer.|$|E
2500|$|Rising (or falling) {{interest}} rates rarely rise {{by the same}} amount all along the yield curve—the curve rarely moves up in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long maturity's rate will change much less, flattening the yield curve.

2500|$|Capital gains: and {{qualified}} dividends may be taxed {{as part of}} taxable income. [...] However, the tax {{is limited to a}} lower tax rate. [...] Capital gains include gains on selling stocks and bonds, real estate, and other capital assets. [...] The gain is the excess of the proceeds over the adjusted basis (cost less depreciation deductions allowed) of the property. [...] This limit on tax also applies to dividends from U.S. corporations and many foreign corporations.

2500|$|Mandatory {{convertibles}} are {{a common}} variation of the vanilla subtype, especially on the US market. Mandatory convertible would force the holder to convert into shares at maturity—hence the term [...] "Mandatory". Those securities would very often bear two conversion prices, making their profiles similar to a [...] "risk reversal" [...] option strategy. The first conversion price would limit the price where the investor would receive the equivalent of its par value back in shares, the second would delimit where the investor will earn more than par. Note that if the stock price is below the first conversion price the investor would suffer a <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> compared to its original investment (excluding the potential coupon payments). Mandatory convertibles {{can be compared to}} forward selling of equity at a premium.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{the effect}} of {{abolition}} was gradual; the freed slaves were not absolutely manumitted, but instead entered a form of forced apprenticeship which lasted four years for house slaves and six years for field slaves.Slavery Abolition Act 1833, section 4 [...] The terms of the forced apprenticeship required them to provide 45 hours unpaid labour a week to their former masters, and prohibited them from leaving their residence without the masters permission. The effect, deliberately, was to phase out reliance on slave labour rather than end it with a bang. The Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands would later legislate to reduce this period to four years for all slaves to quell rising dissent amongst the field slaves. Although, {{the economics of the}} abolition of slavery in the British Virgin Islands are difficult to quantify, there was undeniably a considerable impact. Not least the original slave owners suffered a huge <b>capital</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] Although they received £72,940 from the British Government in compensation, this was {{only a fraction of the}} true economic value of the manumitted slaves.It is difficult to quantify precisely the value of the freed slaves, but in 1798 the total value of slaves in the British Virgin Islands had been estimated at £360,000. It is likely that figure would have increased considerably during the subsequent 36 years, particularly as the price of slaves rose enormously after the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807.Equally, whilst they lost the right to [...] "free" [...] slave labour, the former slave owners now no longer had to pay to house, clothe and provide medical attention for their former slaves. The former slaves now usually worked for the same masters, but instead received small wages, out of which they had to pay for the expenses formerly borne by their masters. Whilst some former slaves amassed savings, which clearly demonstrates that in net terms the slave owners were less well off as a result of abolition, it appears that other factors made significant contributions to the Territory's economic decline.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, Keynes {{suggested}} that, {{because of}} fear of <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> on assets besides money, {{there may be a}} [...] "liquidity trap" [...] setting a floor under which interest rates cannot fall. While in this trap, interest rates are so low that any increase in money supply will cause bond-holders (fearing rises in interest rates and hence <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> on their bonds) to sell their bonds to attain money (liquidity).|$|R

By examining social <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> we attempt to provide a more nuanced analysis of member turnover. In this context social capital is modelled from a social network perspective where the loss of more central members has more impact. We find that only a small proportion of Wiki Projects are in a relatively healthy state with low levels of membership turnover and social <b>capital</b> <b>losses.</b> The results show that the relationship between social <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> and project performance is U-shaped, and that member withdrawal has significant negative effect on project outcomes.
