The influence of the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping concentration on the HEMT properties is investigated by Hall measurements and by electrical DC and RF characterisation of transistor devices. Hall mobility is found to decrease with increasing sheet concentration, while the gate leakage current increases. The device with the highest <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping concentration of 10 (19) cm(- 3) is provided with a GaN cap layer to reduce gate leakage. The transistors based on modulation doped layer structures show much higher DC performance than the undoped device. Best RF properties are obtained for a doping level of 5 x 10 (18) cm(- 3).

The {{influence of}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layer on device performance is investigated by Hall, channel conductivity, small signal RF and delay time evaluation. While the doping layer improves the DC performance it degrades the RF behaviour of the device with the highest <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> doping of 5 x 1018 cm– 3. The channel conductivity measurements show identical dependence of the mobility on carrier concentration for all samples. The saturation velocity, extracted by evaluation of the total delay time as function of the inverse drain current, decreases from 0. 86 x 107 cm/s for the undoped device to 0. 7 x 107 cm/s for the highest doped HEMT.

Deeper QWs imply stronger inhomogeneity of carrier distribution across the active region and support large residual charges of marginally located N-side and P-side QWs. Drift-diffusion transport approximation underestimates the minority <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> to marginal QWs which results in higher degree of injection inhomogeneity in transport simulation.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Logistics and supply chain and management, the Hybrid Hub and Spoke system has certain {{complexities}} regarding the selection of the hub location in the supply chain facility system. The performance and efficiency of the network route selection and hub location depends upon the percentage savings that has been made by choosing the appropriate location for the hub to maintain the efficient flow of the goods within the network. Hub location selection mostly depends on the profit margins shared by the <b>carrier,</b> <b>supply</b> and demand status of the facility and amount of flow of the goods through the facilities. This research develops a mathematical model using Centralized Carrier Collaborative and Multi-Hub Location Problem. The model encompasses various cost like costs of transportation for Direct Transport and Collaborative Transport, cost related to loading, unloading and operations, holding costs and maintenance cost, these are incorporated in taking decision for locating hub within a set of nodes/facilities. A Genetic algorithm meta-heuristic is used to solve the large size problems. The solution obtained using this meta-heuristics are compared with solution obtained from using Lagrangian Relaxation approach.

It evaluates whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of fuel cell propulsion systems in the transport sector. This contribution therefore determines full fuel cycle data for the energy demand and emissions as well a economic data. The different paths of a hydrocarbon-based fuel supply are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO 2 emissions from the fuel cycle. The technical systems analysis of fuel cell propulsion systems was realised with dynamic simulation models for driving cycles. The energy consumption and emission reduction potentials in the German passenger car transport sector were estimated for the introduction of fuel cell propulsion systems. Therefore scenario calculations were carried out to indicate how {{the results of the}} single analysis of technology and fuel supply concepts affect the German transport sector. The application of fuel cell electric vehicles in comparison to advanced internal combustion engine vehicles identifies a small CO 2 emission reduction potential for the German transport sector depending on the assumed full fuel cycles. The reduction of limited emissions can be expected to be much greater, which can help to reduce local smog problems.

40|$|Alternative {{energy sources}} {{have to be}} {{considered}} to overcome problems such as energy security and climate change associated with fossil fuel. Biomass {{is one of the most}} interesting alternative sources because is renewable, sustainable and widely available. Also biomass which is carbon-based differs from the other renewable energy sources because of their utilization for the energy <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> obtained by biological or thermochemical process. Biofuels need high efficient energy conversion technologies such as fuel cells because of their low energy content. Fuel cells are clean, efficient and silent, but need pure hydrogen as fuel. High temperature fuel cells (HTFCs) are more suitable for application of biofuel because they can include an internal reforming which give them fuel flexibility and because their electrodes are more tolerance against fuel contaminants. The research is focussed on molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) because of its technology that is more advanced than Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and because of its soon appearing at the marketplace as a commercial product. The most suitable biofuel for MCFC is biogas because reformed methane and carbon monoxide are fuels and carbon dioxide is a diluent. Biogas impurities such as sulphur compounds, mercaptanes, siloxanes and halogenated hydrocarbons affect cell performances. Hydrogen sulphide, which is the most important biogas impurities, reacts either chemically or electrochemically with the electrolyte and the anode affecting the power density and lifetime of the cell [1 - 4].

40|$|The task of {{this work}} was to {{fabricate}} and characterize AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on sapphire and silicon substrates. For this reason the HEMT fabrication technology had to be developed and optimized on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire and silicon substrates. The optimization of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure on sapphire substrate has been done using RoundHEMT technology. Effects of the AlGaN barrier layer thickness and doping density of AlGaN <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layer and its influence on the electrical properties of HEMTs were studied. The doping density of 5 x 1018 cm- 3 and 12 nm thick barrier layer gave the best DC performance, i. e. IDSS= 354 mA/mm and gm= 132 mS/mm. On an optimized layer structure {{the influence of the}} transistor layout to its electrical properties has been studied by changing the source to drain distance and by varying the gate width. The maximal frequency of oscillation of 64 GHz and cutoff frequency of 37 GHz have been measured. The influence of the different gate widths onto the device performance was studied with multi-finger HEMTs. The HEMTs on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure on sapphire substrate have shown desirable performances but due to poor thermal conductivity of sapphire substrate they are not suitable for high temperature and high power application. The suitability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrates have been proved by RoundHEMT device. After the first difficulties connected with not suitable structure quality and crack structure have been overcame the RoundHEMT with very promised DC performances had been fabricated on the doped AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The devices with source to drain spacing of 3 µm and the gate length of 0. 3 µm have shown maximal saturation current of 0. 82 A/mm which was the highest value compared to values published in that time for similar AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Optimizing the fabrication technology and using better quality of layer structure linear HEMTs with excellent RF performance were fabricated. Devices with 0. 5 (respectively 0. 7) µm gate length yielded cutoff frequency of 32 (20) GHz and maximal frequency of oscillation 27 (22) GHz. The obtained fmax to fT ratio was 0. 85 and 1. 08 for devices with 0. 5 and 0. 7 µm gate respectively. Non-insulating substrates also lower the cutoff frequency. This small value indicates a parasitic conduction due to non-insulating silicon substrate. Evaluated channel temperature for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on sapphire substrate compared to HEMTs on silicon substrate has shown that (at 6 W/mm dissipated power) the temperature in channel of the HEMT on sapphire substrate is 320 °C in comparison to 95 °C for HEMT on silicon substrate. The effect of doping concentration in the <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrate on DC and RF performance was studied at four samples with varying doping density. An improvement of the performance of HEMT devices is obtained with use of appropriate passivation. Influence of SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 passivation on undoped and doped AlGaN/GaN HEMTs was studied. Hall effect measurements have shown an increase of the 2 DEG concentration after applying both types of passivation. An improvement of DC and RF performance was observed in the case of Si 3 N 4 passivation for all four samples. Nearly two times higher output power density was observed for undoped AlGaN/GaN HEMT after applying Si 3 N 4 passivation. The influence of passivation layers on AlGaN/GaN is still not fully understood and further work requires deeper investigations. Finally, preparation and characterization of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon substrate have shown that this device can be a good candidate for mass production of devices for high-frequency, high-power and high-temperature applications. However, further studies related to the material structure improvements and to better understanding of DC/RF dispersion (traps, strain effect, etc.) should be performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper {{concerns}} the current discussion on {{the contribution of the}} hydrogen economy to a "sustainable energy system". It considers whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy <b>carrier</b> <b>supply</b> can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of hydrogen as a new secondary energy carrier. Possible production paths for hydrogen from hydrocarbon-based, renewable or carbon-reduced/-free primary energy carriers are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO 2 emissions from the fuel cycle. Hydrogen has to be packaged by compression or liquefaction, transported by surface vehicles or pipelines, stored and transferred to the end user. Whether generated by electrolysis or by reforming, and even if produced locally at filling stations, the gaseous or liquid hydrogen has to undergo these market processes before it can be used by the customer. In order to provide an idea of possible markets with special emphasis on the German energy sector, a technical systems analysis of possible hydrogen applications is performed for the stationary, mobile and portable sector. Furthermore, different "business as usual" scenarios are analysed for Germany, Europe and the World concerning end energy use in different sectors. The very small assumed penetration of hydrogen in the analysed scenarios up to the year 2050 indicates that the hydrogen economy is a long-term option. With reference to the assumed supply paths and analysed application possibilities, hydrogen can be an option for clean energy use if hydrogen can be produced with carbon-reduced or -free primary energy carriers like renewable energy or biomass. However, the energetic use of hydrogen competes with the direct use of clean primary energy and/or with the use of electric energy based on renewable primary energy. As a substitution product for other secondary energy carriers hydrogen is therefore under pressure of costs and/or must have advantages in comparison to the use of traditional energy carriers.
