40|$|Summary &mdash; A wet <b>condensation</b> <b>heater</b> {{has been}} {{modified}} to disinfect drain water in greenhouses {{in addition to}} pro-viding heating and CO 2. Various kinds of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and one virus (tobacco mosaic virus [TMV]) originating from either pure cultures or substrate extracts were introduced into the disinfection circuit above the heater. Water was checked downstream {{for the number of}} microorganisms surviving the heat treatment. Fungi were destroyed after 30 s at 58. 9 °C, and most of the bacteria except some spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus polymyxa were destroyed after 45 s at 65. 2 °C. Complete elimination of TMV particles was more difficult to achieve but their number was greatly reduced, limiting the probability of plant infection. The microbial density was significantly decreased at relatively low temperatures (less than 75 °C for 2 min) and so the efficacy of the heater was attributed to a combined effect of both temperature and UV irradiation from the flame. Addition of a nonpathogenic microorganism to the substratum is proposed to compensate for the lack of complete efficiency observed with high flow rates of drain water. This introduced microorganism could occupy the free space and limit an invasion by a pathogen surviving the treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{market is}} very competitive, {{for this reason}} it has to increasing the performance {{of each of the}} basic elements of the car. The mirrors has gone from being inert elements that do not consume energy to has dispose of actuators and sensors that need to be fed. The features that have these elements are different: · Electrochrome glass. · Power folding. · Glass regulation (Glass actuator). · Heating to prevent ice or <b>condensation</b> (<b>Heater).</b> · Blinker. · Daylight (DRL). · Blind Spot Detector (BSD). · Puddle Lamp. The mirrors are exposed to atmospheric factors and must pass a extreme quality tests for go out to the market. Overcoming these tests depends of a lot of attributes, one is be watertight, this attribute is reduced by connecting electrical cables. This project proposes to replace these electrical connections for wireless power systems and wireless communications. Power is transmitted by magnetic induction following the international standard Qi (Wireless Power Consortium). Moreover, the drive control unit (Electronic Control Unit, ECU) Zigbee transceivers used to send control commands to the actuators. Currently, there are a large number of manufacturers of integrated circuits at the Qi standard. We used one of these circuits, specifically bq 500215 to the power transmitter and the bq 51025 to the power receiver. The system implemented can transmit a maximum power of up to 10 W with an efficiency which can be 80 %, through an isolation barrier of 5 mm. This project was implemented in the company Idneo Techonologies SL, within the Department of Hardware Auto...|$|E

50|$|If {{dehumidification}} is required, {{then the}} cooling coil is employed to over-cool {{so that the}} dew point is reached and <b>condensation</b> occurs. A <b>heater</b> coil placed after the cooling coil re-heats the air (therefore known as a re-heat coil) to the desired supply temperature. This process {{has the effect of}} reducing the relative humidity level of the supply air.|$|R
40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a scheme to mitigate condensation on an assembly used to cool a processor module System performance of an IBM RS/ 6000 ® workstation was improved by cooling to subambient temperatures the CMOS circuits of a single-chip module (SCM) mounted on a card. However, when refrigeration temperatures are sufficiently low, the temperature of all or {{a portion of the}} card on which the module is mounted can fall below the environmental dew point, resulting in unwanted <b>condensation.</b> Strategically placed <b>heaters</b> can maintain the temperature of the card surface above the dew point, but at the expense of increasing the total heat load the refrigeration unit must remove from the system. A 3 D finite element analysis was used to investigate some of the key parameters that affect the thermal packaging design of a refrigeration-cooled low-temperature processor module with the objective of preventing condensation on exposed module card surfaces with minimal power input to the added heaters...|$|R
