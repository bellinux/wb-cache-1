5|$|Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the {{principal}} one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching,</b> which emphasises support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of {{education and health care}} in the world.|$|E

The <b>Catholic</b> Church's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> has also been considerably influential to the development of social policy.|$|R

One diocesan case study set within the United States describes explicit questions about religious mission, but also addresses implicit topics including financial responsibility, appropriate leadership, {{and the relationship}} between inner city schools and the Church.

25|$|Rerum Novarum is {{considered}} a foundational text of modern <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching.</b> Many of the positions in Rerum novarum were supplemented by later encyclicals, in particular Pius XI's Quadragesimo anno (1931), John XXIII's Mater et magistra (1961), and John Paul II's Centesimus annus (1991).|$|E

50|$|Pope Leo XIII, {{amidst the}} Industrial Revolution and {{concerns}} about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers wrote the first social encyclical of modern times, Rerum novarum ("Of new things"), in 1891, {{under the influence of}} the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler. This 1891 encyclical set the tone for the <b>Catholic</b> Church's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> to follow. It rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. It argued for the establishment of a living wage and for the right of workers to form trade unions.|$|R

25|$|The Industrial Revolution brought many {{concerns}} about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, in 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum, which set in context <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions.

5000|$|Manning {{was among}} the strongest {{supporters}} of the pope and especially {{of the doctrine of}} papal infallibility. In contrast Cardinal Newman acknowledged this doctrine but thought it might not be prudent to define it formally at the time. Manning promoted a modern <b>Catholic</b> view of <b>social</b> justice. These views are reflected in the papal encyclical Rerum novarum issued by Pope Leo XIII. It was the foundation of modern <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> justice <b>teaching.</b> <b>Catholic</b> parochial schools, subsidised by the government, were set up in urban areas to serve the largely Irish element. Manning spoke for the Irish Catholic labourers and helped settle the London dock strike of 1889. [...] He gained acclaim for building a new cathedral in Westminister, and for encouraging the growth of religious congregations largely filled by the Irish.|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} {{established}} in 1961 by Toni Pellegrini, a former secrerary general of the Labour Party. Pellegrini had fallen out with Dom Mintoff during the 1961 politico-religious crisis, and the new party was a direct answer to Mintoff's dispute with the Catholic Church in Malta then led by Archbishop Michael Gonzi. It was designed to attract the Catholic vote of traditional Labourites refused to vote for Mintoff's Labour Party due to its anticlerical stance. It was often cited to be a resurrection of the (Catholic) Labour Party founded in 1921 by Michael Gonzi and sought to expound <b>Catholic</b> (leftist) <b>social</b> <b>teaching.</b> Its other aim was to deny Mintoff's party as many votes as possible and still be a party loyal both to the Church and the Queen.|$|R

25|$|The Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems (1923–1937) was {{conceived}} by Fr. Raymond McGowan {{as a way}} of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching.</b> Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due in part to lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.|$|E

He {{was the first}} chancellor (top official) of the FRG, 1949–63, and until his death was the founder {{and leader of the}} Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a coalition of conservatives, ordoliberals, and adherents of Protestant and <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging European Union, established the country's armed forces (the Bundeswehr), and became a pillar of NATO as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauer's government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and Israel after the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>{{teaching}}</b> {{is based}} on the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those who need it, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying on hands.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{whether the}} <b>Catholic</b> Church’s <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> {{has something to}} tell antitrust scholars and masters of competition policy. Although papal encyclical letters and other documents {{are not meant to}} provide an analytical framework giving clear answers to complex competition questions, {{this does not mean that}} these thoughts cannot benefit businessmen, scholars, and policy makers. The Vatican teaching helps us remember that business and morality do not belong to two different worlds, and that markets should serve the whole Man. It acknowledges the positive role of free markets,that is, the exercise of economic freedom as being an important part of human dignity, yet warns that competition can be preserved only if it is curbed both by moral and statutory rules. It is certainly not easy to find a balance between the commandments to “love your neighbor” and “not collect treasure on earth. ” I argue that either antitrust law or other forms of self- or government regulation should prohibit market conduct that undermines business virtues...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a century}} of the <b>Catholic</b> C hurch's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> is a topic of many {{economical}} and sociological studies. However, there is an absence of a compact political scientific view on the basis and principles of the Church's social doctrine. A description and evolution of {{the dimensions of the}} C hurch's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> seen from the view of political is the topic of this thesis. The C hurch's <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> represents a compact group of documents, although different in some details, in which the Catholic Church expresses its view on economical and political aspects of human existence. A primary resource for C h u rch 's teaching in this field is the aristotle-thomistic philosophical reflexion of human social existence that considers some human anthropological natures to be essential for a determination of his social existence. The subject of the C hurch's social doctrine therefore represents a compact system in its historical perspective suited to its historical operation...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is notable}} that the Catholic church {{recognises}} the separate identities of Scotland and of England and Wales. The denomination in Scotland is thus governed {{by its own}} hierarchy and Bishops' Conference, not {{under the control of}} English bishops. In recent years, for example, {{there have been times when}} it was especially the Scottish Catholic bishops who took the floor in the United Kingdom to argue for <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> and moral <b>teaching.</b> Interestingly, the presidents of the Bishops' Conferences of England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland do meet formally to discuss [...] "mutual concerns", though they are separate national entities.

500|$|A {{specialist}} in Catholic social doctrine argues, circa 1994, that [...] "the words 'bank' and 'banking' are almost nonexistent {{in the documents}} of modern <b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching.</b> Perhaps because the medieval teaching was never formally retracted that money was unproductive and therefore money lending at interest was therefore immoral, yet the church itself became an active investor....

40|$|This article {{identifies}} the liberties of the Church and the City of London which {{were intended to}} be protected by Magna Carta from 1215. The liberties intended were a recognition of a form of autonomy for the Church and the City and have no connection with the individual freedoms that are identified for protection by modern human rights instruments. The clauses in Magna Carta conferring that autonomy are among the very few {{that have not been}} repealed, but they have not been asserted for hundreds of years. While the idea of church autonomy has resonance with the ideas of subsidiarity and sphere-sovereignty developed in <b>Catholic</b> and Calvinist <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> from the late nineteenth century, recent American jurisprudence suggests that religious autonomy may {{be the best way to}} defend religious liberty in the future. This article suggests that, just as English kings were persuaded to provide towns, colonial endeavours and eventually corporate free enterprise with limited autonomy for a fee, so charters conferring limited autonomy on religious communities may provide a philosophical and practical basis from which to defend religious liberty in the future, even if the assertion of individual religious liberty becomes politically incorrect...|$|R
500|$|<b>Catholic</b> <b>social</b> <b>teaching,</b> {{reflecting}} the concern Jesus showed for the impoverished, places a {{heavy emphasis on}} the corporal works of mercy and the spiritual works of mercy, namely the support and concern for the sick, {{the poor and the}} afflicted.

[...] Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter Rerum novarum which upholds the rights and dignity of labor and the right of workers to form unions.|$|E
