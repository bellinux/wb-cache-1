40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether it is possible to reduce a <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse, which is needed for selective nerve stimulation. Simulation is performed using a two-part simulation model: a volume conductor model to calculate the electrical potential distribution inside a tripolar cuff electrode and a human fiber model to simulate the fiber response to simulation. Selective stimulation is obtained by anodal block. To obtain anodal block of large fibers, long square pulses (> 350 μs) with a relatively high currents (1 - 2. 5 mA) are usually required. These pulses might not be safe for a long-term application because of a high <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse. In this study, several pulse shapes are proposed that have less <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse compared with the conventional square pulse and would therefore be safer in a chronic application. Compared with the conventional square pulse, it was possible to reduce the charge with all proposed pulse shapes, but the best results are obtained with a combination of a square depolarizing pulse and a blocking pulse. The <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> pulse was up to 32 % less with that pulse shape than with a square pulse. Using a hyperpolarizing anodal prepulse preceding a square pulse, it was not possible to block nerve fibers in a whole nerve bundle and to obtain reduction of a <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> phase. Reduction of the charge could be achieved only with spatially selective blocking. The <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> phase was larger for the combination of a hyperpolarizing anodal prepulse and a two-step pulse than for the two-step pulse alone...|$|R

Greater Marshfield Community Health Plan of Wisconsin was not successful in controlling charges during the demonstration period.
