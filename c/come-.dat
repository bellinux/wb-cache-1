5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he <b>come-</b> be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E

Of this frequent examples will occur.

On the whole, the resemblance to the typical Mycenaean culture is more striking than the difference." [...] [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, vol. i. pp. xiii.-xv. 1900.] ...|$|E

50|$|In 1980 {{there was}} a number of incidents, {{including}} a messy pile-up at the Le Gasomet hairpin. Alfa Romeo driver Bruno Giacomelli spun entering that corner {{and came to a}} dead stop, with his Alfa's nose mere feet away from the apex of the corner. In a rather impatient attempt {{to get out of this}} precarious situation he had put himself in, Giacomelli had put his Alfa in reverse, and as a result, a number of oncoming cars, all attempting to avoid Giacomelli, who had reversed onto the racing line, had to come to a dead stop in order to avoid hitting Giacomelli. This created an accordion-effect accident, which led to 4 other cars also crashing, including Jarier, who had crashed a lot heavier than any of the other drivers by hitting Italian Elio de Angelis's Lotus with some force. But the worst accident was yet to <b>come-</b> Clay Regazzoni in an Ensign crashed appallingly when his brakes failed at 180 mph at the end of Shoreline Drive. While going off the course, the Swiss driver hit Ricardo Zunino's crashed and stationary Brabham at full speed. He then hit the wall next to the track and went straight-on past Queen's Hairpin and crashed into retaining tire barriers head-on, still moving extremely quickly. This devastating accident did not seem to be survivable. Regazzoni did survive, but with severe spinal injuries, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down; he never raced in F1 again but did race again in other forms of motorsports, albeit with hand controls rather than pedals. Brazilian Nelson Piquet dominated that race weekend, it was the first of his twenty-three F1 victories, with his countryman Emerson Fittipaldi taking 3rd.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} concemed with two {{different}} linguistic problems raised by Catalan no-pm negative clauses, and will examine their representational effects. It {{is argued that}} pas can occur {{within the boundaries of}} a Tense Dependent subordinate clause if, and only if, there is a modal constituent c-commanding the NegP, and the structural requirements for the condition of logical absorption are not satisfied. The first squib deals with general restrictions on the use of no-pas in structures which contain a subordinate clause, while the second squib deals more specifically with restrictions on the use of rw-pas in expletive contexts. These restrictions are exemplified in (1) and (2). Compare on the one hand (la) with (lb), which for some speakers is absolutely ungrammatical, whereas for others it shows some degree of ill-formedness. On the other hand, compare (2 a) with (2 b), which cannot be used under the expletive interpretation licensed by (24. (1) a.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} Andrej Rozman’s creative {{reception of}} Jean-Baptiste Poquelin Molière’s <b>come-</b> dies The Miser and The Imaginary Invalid. The Miser, {{which had been}} translated into Slovenian a number of times, was recast in 2007 by the Slovenian comedy writer as a comic one-man play featuring Harpagon as an entrepreneur, who discusses many topical Slovenian problems {{in front of the}} audience, with occasional allusions to his son and daughter, whom he wants to marry off according to his economic interests. In this modern version, everything is explained and solved by the daughter’s phone call. In 2011, The Imaginary Invalid inspired another of Rozman’s plays, Hiphophondrija, which features the family father as a chatty tycoon. Closest to the original is the scene with the yo- ung doctor. Both texts are travesties, rendering Molière’s plots in a lower register and setting them in contemporary Slovenia. On the other hand, certain scenes which come closest to Molière are couched in ‘precious’ idiom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Mobile cloud {{is a new}} {{emerging}} technology {{which can be used}} to enable users to enjoy abundant multimedia applications in a pervasive computing environment. Therefore, the scheduling of massive multimedia flows with heterogeneous QoS guarantees becomes an important issue for the mobile cloud. Generally, the predominant popular cloud-based scheduling algorithms assume that the request rate and service time, are available for the system operator. However, this assumption can hardly be maintained in many practical scenarios, especially for the large-scale mobile cloud. In this article, we consider the scheduling problem for a practical mobile cloud in which the above parameters are unavailable and unknown. Taking into account the performance of the users and the impartial free time among the servers, the highlight of this article lies in proposing a blind online scheduling algorithm (BOSA). Specifically, we assign available multimedia servers based on the last timeslot information of the users ’ requests, and route all the multimedia flows according to the first <b>come-</b> first-served rule. Moreover, we design detailed steps to apply the BOSA to a content recommendation system, and show that the proposed BOSA can achieve asymptotic optimality...|$|E

This edition of ENS NEWS reflects that reality. With the political and media focus on nuclear safety understandably sharper than before Fukushima, and the process for elaborating the stress tests criteria having proven to be quite a can of worms, it would be logical to assume that the wind might have been taken out of the nuclear industry’s sails. And yet, in spite of the anti-nuclear fraternity whipping up a media storm, and notwithstanding the negative political fall-out that has occurred in Germany, Italy and Switzerland, the nuclear industry has charted a relatively steady course through stormy waters. The European nuclear community as a whole has emerged reasonably unscathed from the unfolding drama in Japan. It has been quick to assert its commitment to learning the lessons of Fukushima and putting them to good use and to reaffirm its safety credentials. Safety has alway...|$|E

40|$|In 1965, {{when the}} Khrushchev era of {{persecution}} {{of the church}} came to an end, Fr Niko 1 ai Eshliman and I wrote {{an open letter to}} Patriarch Aleksi I denouncing the church authorities- the patriarch, the synod and the bishops- for their collaboration, servility and complicity in the persecution of the church. As a result we were punished. Patriarch Aleksi I received an order from the KGB and the Council for Religious Affairs to ban us from church ministry. Obedient to the persecutors of the church, he denied us the opportunity to fulfil our priestly duty. It was only 21 years later, on the wave of the political amnesty accompanying per-estroika, that I was freed from exile in Yakutia. At the same time, by order of that same KGB, the Holy Synod revoked the decision of Patriarch Aleksi I concerning me. The late priest Eshliman was, however, not rehabilitated into the church. In those remarkable days I could have foreseen only in a nightmare that in the kaleidoscopic series of events shortly to <b>come-</b> the collapse of the USSR, of com-munism, {{of the power of the}} soviets and the KGB- I would again be repressed; but this time by the free 'good will ' of the patriarch and the bishops. And repressed even more cruelly than before- by defrocking: even the godless state security did not go as far as that. This appeal, Your Holiness, is one more desperate attempt to get through to the conscience of the head of the church, who carries the whole weight of responsibility for the current state of affairs in the Moscow Patriarchate. As regards the resolution to defrock me, I consider it uncanonical for the following reasons: 1 The Holy Synod, the highest church administrative body, was wrong to take the decision as it contradicts a resolution of the highest legislative body of the Russia...|$|E
