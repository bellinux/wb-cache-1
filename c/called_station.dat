25|$|The {{familiar}} tones that <b>called</b> <b>Station</b> 51 {{into service}} were initiated by dispatch using a Motorola Quik Call I unit, a radio listening {{on a common}} paging frequency {{for a pair of}} special audio tones assigned to that station. For a large incident, one could often hear many sets of tones calling many stations, but only a specific pair would sound the buzzer for Station 51.|$|E
25|$|Nottingham station, briefly {{known as}} Nottingham City and for rather longer as Nottingham Midland, is a railway station and tram {{stop in the}} city of Nottingham. It is the {{principal}} railway station of the city of Nottingham and the Greater Nottingham area. It is also a nodal point on the city's tram system, with a tram stop that was originally <b>called</b> <b>Station</b> Street but is now known as Nottingham Station.|$|E
25|$|A {{track with}} a {{spot at the}} station to board and {{disembark}} trains is <b>called</b> <b>station</b> track or house track {{regardless of whether it}} is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a platform, the track may be called platform track. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called passing track. A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track.|$|E
50|$|In games (especially limit games) {{with many}} <b>calling</b> <b>stations,</b> an effect <b>called</b> {{schooling}} can cause <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> to accidentally play less incorrectly. For example, {{it is often}} incorrect to draw to an inside straight because the probability of making the draw is too low to justify the expense of calling a bet to see the next card. However, the presence of many <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> can inflate {{the size of the}} pot, making it correct, or at least less incorrect, to draw to inside straights and other longshot draws.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} station building, {{dating from}} the station's opening in 1865, is {{on the south side}} of the line and to the east of the present ticket office and concourse, being separated from this by a long footbridge (a public right of way) linking the residential roads of Goldstone Villas and Hove Park Villas. The section of road on which the original building stands is <b>called</b> <b>Station</b> Approach. It is currently in commercial use. [...] The design is very similar to that of the buildings still in use at West Worthing, Shoreham-by-Sea, Portslade and London Road stations, and the former Kemptown station in Brighton.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverhampton's first railway {{opened in}} 1837, {{with the opening}} of the Grand Junction Railway, the first long-distance line in Great Britain. [...] The main station for the city was, however, not located in the city centre, but at Wednesfield Heath, now Heath Town on the east side of the city. This station was {{considered}} to be a First Class station, though its location was obviously not ideal and it became a goods station after passenger services ceased in 1873. [...] The station buildings were demolished in 1965, but the main station area is now a nature reserve just off Powell Street, <b>called</b> <b>Station</b> Fields and part of the edge of the northbound platform is still in situ. The track running through the station site is, however, still in use.|$|E
2500|$|Dolphin took {{personal}} {{charge of}} the secret project to develop a 37ft [...] miniature submarine, which was code named the Wellfreighter. [...] developed during World War II by [...] the [...] British Special Operations Executive. [...] Classified Top Secret for over 50 years, {{it is only in}} recent times that Government files detailing the existence of this project have been made available for historical research. The Welfreighter was intended to provide landing and supply of secret agents behind enemy lines, as well as use for gathering of coastal intelligence and carrying Special Forces personnel on sabotage operations, as well as the deployment of mines in enemy harbours. A sea trials unit was set up at Goodwick near Fishguard in West Wales <b>called</b> <b>Station</b> IXa where the prototypes were tested. In 1944 several were sent to Australia for tropical testing.|$|E

50|$|Calling {{station is}} a poker {{term used to}} pejoratively {{describe}} someone who consistently calls bets and rarely (if ever) raises, regardless {{of the strength of}} his/her hand. In Texas hold 'em and other community card poker games, <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> are sometimes rewarded for their poor play by lucky cards that come on the board, often encouraging unskilled players to overestimate their skill level. Many <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> can be found on low stakes tables both on the internet, in online poker rooms, and in traditional bricks and mortar card rooms.|$|R

60|$|When {{a variety}} has arisen, the CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE are such as to {{exercise}} an influence {{which is exactly}} {{comparable to that of}} artificial selection. By Conditions of Existence I mean two things,--there are conditions which are furnished by the physical, the inorganic world, and there are conditions of existence which are furnished by the organic world. There is, in the first place, CLIMATE; under that head I include only temperature and the varied amount of moisture of particular places. In the next place there is what is technically <b>called</b> <b>STATION,</b> which means--given the climate, the particular kind of place in which an animal or a plant lives or grows; for example, the station of a fish is in the water, of a fresh-water fish in fresh water; the station of a marine fish is in the sea, and a marine animal may have a station higher or deeper. So again with land animals: the differences in their stations are those of different soils and neighbourhoods; some being best adapted to a calcareous, and others to an arenaceous soil. The third condition of existence is FOOD, by which I mean food in the broadest sense, the supply of the materials necessary to the existence of an organic being; {{in the case of a}} plant the inorganic matters, such as carbonic acid, water, ammonia, and the earthy salts or salines; in the case of the animal the inorganic and organic matters, which we have seen they require; then these are all, at least the two first, what we may call the inorganic or physical conditions of existence. Food takes a mid-place, and then come the organic conditions; by which I mean the conditions which depend upon the state of the rest of the organic creation, upon the number and kind of living beings, with which an animal is surrounded. You may class these under two heads: there are organic beings, which operate as 'opponents', and there are organic beings which operate as 'helpers' to any given organic creature. The opponents may be of two kinds: there are the 'indirect opponents', which are what we may call 'rivals'; and there are the 'direct opponents', those which strive to destroy the creature; and these we call 'enemies'. By rivals I mean, of course, in the case of plants, those which require for their support the same kind of soil and station, and, among animals, those which require the same kind of station, or food, or climate; those are the indirect opponents; the direct opponents are, of course, those which prey upon an animal or vegetable. The 'helpers' may also be regarded as direct and indirect: in the case of a carnivorous animal, for example, a particular herbaceous plant may in multiplying be an indirect helper, by enabling the herbivora on which the carnivore preys to get more food, and thus to nourish the carnivore more abundantly; the direct helper may be best illustrated by reference to some parasitic creature, such as the tape-worm. The tape-worm exists in the human intestines, so that the fewer there are of men the fewer there will be of tape-worms, other things being alike. It is a humiliating reflection, perhaps, that we may be classed as direct helpers to the tape-worm, but the fact is so: we can all see that if there were no men there would be no tape-worms.|$|E
