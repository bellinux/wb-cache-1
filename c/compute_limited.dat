With the launch of Terra, NASA created a data-rich environment where {{the challenge is to}} fully utilize the data collected from EOS however, despite unprecedented amounts of observed data, {{there is a need for}} increasing the frequency, resolution, and diversity of observations. Current terrestrial models that use remote sensing data were constructed in a relatively data and <b>compute</b> <b>limited</b> era and do not take full advantage of on-line learning methods and assimilation techniques that can exploit these data. NASA has invested in visualization, data mining and knowledge discovery methods which have facilitated data exploitation, but these methods are insufficient for improving Earth science models that have extensive background knowledge nor do these methods refine understanding of complex processes. Investing in interdisciplinary teams that include computational scientists can lead to new models and systems for online operation and analysis of data that can autonomously improve in prediction skill over time...|$|E

40|$|<b>Computing</b> <b>limit</b> is a {{fundamental}} task in mathematics and different mathematical concepts are {{defined in terms of}} limit computations. Among these mathematical concepts, we are interested in three different types of <b>limit</b> computations: first, <b>computing</b> the <b>limit</b> points of solutions of polynomial systems represented by regular chains, second, computing tangent cones of space curves at their singular points which can be viewed as <b>computing</b> <b>limit</b> of secant lines, and third, <b>computing</b> the <b>limit</b> of real multivariate rational functions. For <b>computing</b> the <b>limit</b> of solutions of polynomial systems represented by regular chains, we present two different methods based on Puiseux series expansions and linear changes of coordinates. The first method, which is based on Puiseux series expansions, addresses the problem of computing real and complex limit points corresponding to regular chains of dimension one. The second method studies regular chains under changes of coordinates. It especially <b>computes</b> the <b>limit</b> points corresponding to regular chains of dimension higher than one for some cases. we consider strategies where these changes of coordinates can be either generic or guided by the input. For computing the Puiseux parametrizations corresponding to regular chains of dimension one, we rely on extended Hensel construction (EHC). The Extended Hensel Construction is a procedure which, for an input bivariate polynomial with complex coefficients, can serve the same purpose as the Newton-Puiseux algorithm, and, for the multivariate case, can be seen as an effective variant of Jung-Abhyankar Theorem. We show that the EHC requires only linear algebra and univariate polynomial arithmetic. We deduce complexity estimates and report on a software implementation together with experimental results. We also outline a method for computing the tangent cone of a space curve at any of its points. We rely on the theory of regular chains and Puiseux series expansions. Our approach is novel in that it explicitly constructs the tangent cone at arbitrary and possibly irrational points without using a Standard basis. We also present an algorithm for determining the existence of the limit of a real multivariate rational function q at a given point which is an isolated zero of the denominator of q. When the limit exists, the algorithm computes it, without making any assumption on the number of variables. A process, which extends the work of Cadavid, Molina and V´elez, reduces the multivariate setting to <b>computing</b> <b>limits</b> of bivariate rational functions. By using regular chain theory and triangular decomposition of semi-algebraic systems, we avoid the computation of singular loci and the decomposition of algebraic sets into irreducible components...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{software}} product {{line is a}} family of {{software product}}s that share {{a common set of}} mandatory features and whose individual products are di↵erentiated by their variable (optional or alternative) features. Family-based analysis of software product lines takes as input a single model of a complete product line and analyzes all its products at the same time. As the number of products in a software product line may be large, this is generally preferable to analyzing each product on its own. Family-based analysis, however, requires that standard algorithms be adapted to accomodate variability. In this paper we adapt the standard algorithm for <b>computing</b> <b>limit</b> average cost of a weighted transition system to software product lines. Limit average is a useful and popular measure for the long-term average behavior of a quality attribute such as performance or energy consumption, but has hitherto not been available for family-based analysis of software product lines.
