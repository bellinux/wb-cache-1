40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} is to study bra fit and comfort according to different sizes, <b>cup</b> <b>seaming</b> techniques, and locations within the bra structure. Two participants were invited, whose breast sizes are linked together through sister sizes (34 C and 32 D). Based on common bra production methods, three basic style bra prototypes were developed with different <b>cup</b> <b>seaming</b> techniques; horizontal, vertical, and combined seams. These prototypes {{were used to assess}} bra fit and comfort on each participant at 8 different locations. Fit and comfort were evaluated based on the pressure being exerted by the bra. The pressure data was collected using the Novel Pliance X Expert System (Munich, Germany) ...|$|E
40|$|Commercial bra {{designs are}} {{inadequate}} in overcoming {{all of the}} bra's problems. Physical and physiological problems for the human body are commonly caused due to the poor design of bra components: for example, pressure from tight shoulder straps, pain rashes resulting from rigid underwires, irritation by bra <b>cup</b> <b>seams</b> and so on. The bra is closely fitted to the wearer. It is important and necessary to evaluate and analyze bra design problems {{in order to provide}} suitable methods to alleviate those problems. This paper reviews and evaluates the design problems of commercial bras in technical terms of fit, support, cup shape, underwire, sizing, elastics and fastening. The causes and effects of those problems are also discussed with physiological concerns. An interview survey with 80 women was conducted in order to obtain women's desires concerning bra design factors, and to investigate the statistics on the typical bra components which would commonly cause uncomfortable feelings.

25|$|England again changed opener {{for their}} series against South Africa, with Alex Hales opening and Moeen Ali moving {{back down the}} order. Nick Compton also {{returned}} to the side. England won the first game by 241 runs, after passing 300 in both innings, before a fit again Steven Finn helped bowl South Africa out for 174 in their second innings. After a high scoring second match, in which Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow both hit centuries, England won the third game of the series thanks to a superb bowling display from Stuart Broad. The victory gave England an unassailable 2–0 series lead with one game left to play. England lost {{the final game of}} the series after a batting collapse in the second innings. Despite winning the first two ODIs in convincing fashion, England lost the final three games of the series to lose the ODI series 3–2. However, Alex Hales' form with the bat was a major positive for England as was the emergence of Reece Topley in the bowling unit. England lost both of the T20 games they played to mean they ended the tour with five straight defeats. They were thrashed by nine wickets in the final game of the series, and their last game before the T20 World <b>Cup,</b> with England's <b>seam</b> bowlers being unable to cope with AB de Villiers, Quintin de Kock or Hashim Amla.|$|R
