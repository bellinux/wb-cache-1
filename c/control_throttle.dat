50|$|After {{seeing a}} {{need in the}} Hydroflight Sports {{community}} for a wireless remote <b>control</b> <b>throttle,</b> Merrell teamed up with (title) Jeff Elkins to create one. In August 2014 they designed and began manufacturing their beta version of their wireless remote <b>control</b> <b>throttle,</b> aptly named “The F4 Flight Controller”.

40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} {{nonlinear}} systems has been putting especial {{attention in the}} use of Artificial Intelligent techniques, where fuzzy logic presents one of the best alternatives due to the exploit of human knowledge. However, several fuzzy logic real-world applications use manual tuning (human expertise) to adjust control systems. On the other hand, in the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) field, the longitudinal <b>control</b> (<b>throttle</b> and brake management) is an important topic because external perturbations can generate uncomfortable accelerations as well as unnecessary fuel consumption. In this work, we utilize a neuro-fuzzy system to use human driving knowledge to tune and adjust the input-output parameters of a fuzzy ifthen system. The neuro-fuzzy system considered in this work is ANFIS (Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{ability to perform}} an inclination change maximizes the maneuverability of an orbiting space vehicle. Most maneuvers utilize a combined plane change and orbital transfer to the new orbit. This costs {{more in terms of}} energy and fuel than an in-plane change of orbits. The amount of DV and fuel required for such an energyintensive inclination change exceeds the benefit of performing the maneuver. However, this paper demonstrates that a winged re-entry vehicle, based on the currently proposed X- 37, has the necessary thrust to change planes and then perform an in-plane transfer to achieve a new orbit. Using SIMULINKâ and LABVIEWâ simulation tools, this research found that the use of the aerodynamic lift of a winged re-entry vehicle produced more than 12 Ê» of inclination change with the minimal DV achievable. Through small orbital maneuvers and atmospheric reentry, the aerodynamics of the lift vector demonstrated that the spacecraft retained sufficient energy to prevent perigee collapse using an orbital regulation code to <b>control</b> <b>throttle</b> setting.

40|$|AbstractA Smart Clamping Force Control (SCFC) {{is adapted}} to hold {{sensitive}} workpiece using magnetic proximity switch during a machining operation on the CNC machine tool. It has been ascertained that work-holding of different workpiece materials and shapes during machining operation {{is one of the}} problems encountered during CNC milling machining operations. This work proposes a novel clamping strategy for workpieces with the aid of SCFC. The purpose of the study is to adjust the forward movement of the clamp and reduce the damage caused by the clamp on the workpiece, this depends on the material of the work-piece. The speed of the clamp is reduced using the inlet flow <b>control</b> <b>throttle</b> valve and a magnetic proximity switch (MPS). It provides careful handling of workpiece and prevent it from damage and as well optimizes the forward movement of the cylinder. The proposed strategy is based on dynamic machine loading in which the impact of applied forces were monitored to optimize the clamping control system of the machine tool. The mode of operation and performance of the SCFC were simulated in the FluidSIM® software, and the validated results was presented on Festo workstation. This work therefore further elucidate the fundamental design criterion for machine tool clamping forces and the sustainable manufacture of its components...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that a human}} pilot uses {{the same set of}} generic skills to control a wide variety of aircraft. If this is true, then {{it should be possible to}} construct an electronic controller which embodies this generic skill set such that it can successfully control difference airplanes without being matched to a specific airplane. In an attempt to create such a system, a fuzzy logic controller was devised to <b>control</b> <b>throttle</b> position and another to control elevator position. These two controllers were used to control flight path angle and airspeed for both a piston powered single engine airplane simulation and a business jet simulation. Overspeed protection and stall protection were incorporated in the form of expert systems supervisors. It was found that by using the artificial intelligence techniques of fuzzy logic and expert systems, a generic longitudinal controller could be successfully used on two general aviation aircraft types that have very difference characteristics. These controllers worked for both airplanes over their entire flight envelopes including configuration changes. The controllers for both airplanes were identical except for airplane specific limits (maximum allowable airspeed, throttle lever travel, etc.). The controllers also handled configuration changes without mode switching or knowledge of the current configuration. This research validated the fact that the same fuzzy logic based controller can control two very different general aviation airplanes. It also developed the basic controller architecture and specific control parameters required for such a general controller...|$|E
40|$|A Modular Power Management System (MPMS) is {{an energy}} {{management}} system intended for highly modular applications, {{able to adapt}} to changing hardware intelligently. There is a dearth {{in the literature on}} Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), which has previously not addressed the implications for software operating within this architecture. Namely, the adaptation of control laws to changing hardware. This work proposes some approaches to address this issue. Control laws may require adaptation to overcome hardware degradation, or system upgrades. There is also a growing interest in the ability to change hardware configurations of UASs (Unmanned Aerial Systems) between missions, to better fit the characteristics of each one. Hardware changes in the aviation industry come with an additional caveat: in order for a software system to be used in aviation it must be certified as part of a platform. This certification process has no clear guidelines for adaptive systems. Adapting to a changing platform, as well as addressing the necessary certification effort, motivated the development of the MPMS. The aim of the work is twofold. Firstly, to modify existing control strategies for new hardware. This is achieved with generalisation and transfer earning. Secondly, to reduce the workload involved with maintaining a safety argument for an adaptive controller. Three areas of work are used to demonstrate the satisfaction of this aim. Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) is proposed for the derivation of new control laws. The EBL domain theory embodies general control strategies, which are specialised to form fuzzy rules. A method for translating explanation structures into fuzzy rules is presented. The generation of specific rules, from a general control strategy, is one way to adapt to controlling a modular platform. A fuzzy controller executes the rules derived by EBL. This maintains fast rule execution as well as the separation of strategy and application. The ability of EBL to generate rules which are useful when executed by a fuzzy controller is demonstrated by an experiment. A domain theory is given to <b>control</b> <b>throttle</b> output, which is used to generate fuzzy rules. These rules {{have a positive impact on}} energy consumption in simulated flight. EBL is proposed, for rule derivation, because it focuses on generalisation. Generalisations can apply knowledge from one situation, or hardware, to another. This can be preferable to re-derivation of similar control laws. Furthermore, EBL can be augmented to include analogical reasoning when reaching an impasse. An algorithm which integrates analogy into EBL has been developed as part of this work. The inclusion of analogical reasoning facilitates transfer learning, which furthers the flexibility of the MPMS in adapting to new hardware. The adaptive capability of the MPMS is demonstrated by application to multiple simulated platforms. EBL produces explanation structures. Augmenting these explanation structures with a safetyspecific domain theory can produce skeletal safety cases. A technique to achieve this has been developed. Example structures are generated for previously derived fuzzy rules. Generating safety cases from explanation structures can form the basis for an adaptive safety argument...|$|E
