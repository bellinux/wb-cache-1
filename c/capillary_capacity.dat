40|$|Abstract. The {{classical}} {{mass balance}} equation is usually used {{to model the}} transfer of humidity in unsaturated macroscopically homogeneous porous media. This equation is highly non-linear due to the pressure-dependence of the hydrodynamic characteristics. The formal homogenization method by asymptotic expansions is applied to derive the upscaled form of this equation in case of large-scale heterogeneities of periodic structure. The nature of such heterogeneities may be different, resulting in locally variable hydrodynamic parameters. The effective <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> and the effective hy-draulic conductivity are defined as functions of geometry and local characteristics of the porous medium. A study of a two-dimensional stone-mortar system is performed. The effect of the second medium (the mortar), on the global behavior {{of the system is}} investigated. Numerical results for the Brooks and Corey hydrodynamic model are provided. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the model in relation to the effective hydrodynamic parameters of the porous structure is presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{experimental verification}} of the mathematical model of unsaturated flow in double-porosity soils {{developed by the}} asymptotic homogenization method. A series of one-dimensional infiltration experiments {{was carried out in}} a column filled with a double-porosity medium composed of a mixture of sand and sintered clayey spheres arranged in a periodic manner. The unsaturated hydraulic properties of each porous material were obtained from independent infiltration experiments by inverse analysis and some additional tests. They were used to calculate the effective parameters of the double-porosity medium, i. e., the effective hydraulic conductivity and the effective <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The numerical solution of the macroscopic boundary value problem, consisting of a highly nonlinear integrodifferential equation, was obtained using the Fortran code DPOR_ 1 D presented by Lewandowska et al.

There are no publicly available measured values of the seal capacity of these Plio-Pleistocene caprock mudstones. We developed, tested and applied a systematic approach to evaluate the permeability and <b>capillary</b> seal <b>capacity</b> of mudstones at shallow depth (400 - 900 m) using new grain size analysis data of offshore and onshore Cenozoic mudstones and publicly available pressure data. The calculations showed that the vertical permeability of the mudstones varies between 2. 8 E- 20 and 1. 1 E- 18 m 2. Most of the pore throat radii of the mudstones vary between 0. 5 and 1. 5 μm. The gas column heights were also calculated for 10 offshore wells and all samples from these wells.

Significant growth of the water content was noted in both studied noodles at aw of about 0. 75. Above aw = 0. 75 some capillary condensation probably occurred. Based of the BET equation, the monolayer capacity was determined for the two types of noodles (noodle I – 6. 34 and noodle II – 5. 78 g (100 g d. m.) - 1) and – on its basis- their proper sorption area (MI – 222. 9 and MII – 202. 9 m 2 g- 1).

40|$|The {{presented}} thesis comprises nine-year {{observations that}} {{were aimed at}} assessing phytotrophic soil regimes. The data were obtained in farm fields of agricultural enterprises {{in a part of}} Kromeriz district with intense agricultural production. The topsoil samples were taken in selected fields from the area of 25 m 2 in a normal crop rotation (other crop each year) in the period from March to September in 1988 - 1996. To assess physical soil properties, the samples were taken using Kopecky roller probes (from the depth of 15 to 20 cm) in three replicates The following parameters were determined: bulk density as a parameter necessary to quantify all volume characters, maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> as one of possible parameters of pore distribution and soil water management, and soil moisture. In samples (0 - 30 cm), humus content and quality, exchange response, cation exchange capacity, contents of exchange calcium, magnesium, potassium, and nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were determined. Regression analyses, analyses of variance, multivariete statistical methods and Statgraphics and Grapheprograms were used. An annual variation was calculated for all the studied properties using a method onon-linear regression. Our experiments show that the higher anthropogenic influence on the studied process, the longer period necessary for proving the regime. In water content, for instance, the nine-year period was sufficient. In bulk density, maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity,</b> humus quality, cation exchange capacity, exchange calcium content and nitrate nitrogen content, only 50 % of cases were proved. Seasonal dynamics of exchange response, humus content and potassium content were proved at two locations and in the content of magnesium and amonnium nitrogen in one of six cases only during the nine-year period. The period could be probably shortened by higher intensity of samplings (e. g. 14 -day intervals). In this case, however, we face an economical point of view and it is not clear if longer observations are important to eliminate the effects of the year. In case the same method is used, we recommend to conduct the observations for 15 years. After further extending and completing our findings on soil regimes, it will be necessary (if we want to determine an average value) to assess correction coefficients for samplings in different time periods in order to eliminate the temporal variation. Considering the fact that the content of exchange calcium can differ by 5000 kg. ha - 1, magnesium by 130 and potassium by 1450 kg. ha - 1 during the year, these values highly surpass doses supplied with mineral fertilizers. These findings could be used particularly in precision farming.

The participa-tion of the resistance vessels under these conditions was minimal. The prevailing venous oxygen tension then was reduced by several means and the response of vascular resistance and <b>capillary</b> exchange <b>capacity</b> to the same stresses was reexamined. At the lower prevailing venous Po 2, the sensitivity of the resistance vessels to metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances was greatly increased.

The thermal conductivity and capillary pressure of {{the surface of a}} ceramic LHP wick prototype have been modified by growing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The presence of a thin layer of MWCNTs increased the thermal conductivity of wick specimens between 18. 87 and 26. 42 % for temperatures ranging from - 50 to 50 °C. The thermal conductivity of the grown MWCNTs calculated considering a mean layer thickness of 5 μm was 59 W/mK. The effective pore diameter of zircon ceramic wicks decreased from 0. 54 to 0. 31 μm leading to an important increase in capillary pressure. The maximum heat transfer capacity and thermal resistance of the designed by-layer wick have been determined.

However, {{even on the}} same localities, different systems of vegetation classification de-scribe the forest types according to the naturally dominant tree species with different accuracy. A set of 20 representative natural beech stands in the borderland between the Bohemian Massif (Hercyni-an biogeographical subprovince) and the Outer Western Carpathians (Westcarpathian subprovince) was selected in order to compare textural, hydrostatic, physico-chemical and chemical properties of soils between the included geomorphological regions, bioregions and biotopes. Differences in the soils of the surveyed beech stands were mainly due to volume weight and specific weight, maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> (MCC), porosity, base saturation (BS), total soil nitrogen (Nt) and fulvic acids. Specifics in the relations between these soil characteristics indicated that transient trans-Hercynian beech forests developed in the borderland between the two compared subprovinces. Soils of the investigated Hercynian beech forests were generally characterized by lower BS and lower Nt. Soils of the trans-Hercynian beech forests were more similar to the Carpathian beech forest soils than soils in the other Hercynian beech forests. Soils of the trans-Hercynian and Carpathian beech forests showed similarly higher BS, deeper occurrence of humic substances, lower specific weight and also higher MCC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new laboratory dataset on the moisture-pressure relationship above a dispersive groundwater wave in a two-dimensional vertical unconfined sand flume aquifer driven by simple harmonic forcing. A total of five experiments {{were conducted in}} which all experimental parameters were kept constant except for the oscillation period, which ranged from 268 s to 2449 s between tests. Moisture content and suction head sensor pairings were co-located at two locations in the unsaturated zone both approximately 0. 2 m above the mean watertable elevation and respectively 0. 3 m and 0. 75 m from the driving head boundary. For all oscillation periods except for the shortest (T= 268 s), {{the formation of a}} hysteretic moisture-pressure scanning loop was observed. Consistent with the decay of the saturated zone groundwater wave, the size of the observed moisture-pressure scanning loops decayed with increasing distance landward and the decay rate is larger for the shorter oscillation periods. At the shortest period (T= 268 s), the observed moisture-pressure relationship was observed to be non-hysteretic but with a <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> that differs from that of the static equilibrium wetting and drying curves. This finding is consistent with observations from existing one-dimensional vertical sand column experiments. The relative damping of the moisture content with distance landward is higher than that for the suction head consistent with the fact that transmission of pressure through a porous medium occurs more readily than mass transfer. This is further supported by the fact that observed phase lags for the unsaturated zone variables (i. e. suction head and moisture content) relative to the driving head are greater than the saturated zone variables (i. e. piezometric head). Harmonic analysis of the data reveals no observable generation of higher harmonics in either moisture or pressure despite the strongly non-linear relationship between the two. In addition, a phase lag of moisture content relative to the suction head was observed indicating that the response time of the moisture content to watertable motion is greater than that of the pore water pressure. The observed moisture-pressure dynamics are qualitatively reproduced using a hysteretic Richards’ equation model. However, quantitative differences exist which are likely to be due to previous findings that demonstrated that the Richards’ equation model is unable to accurately reproduce the observed watertable wave dispersion, particularly at shorter period oscillations...|$|E

Two lands were chosen to present minimization process at one of them and classical plowing process at the second of them. Soil pits were dug in both versions and a description of soil profiles according to the Comprehensive Survey Methodology of Agricultural Soils (NĚMEČEK 1967) was carried. Intact soil samples were taken in ten terms, four replications, from the depths (center roller) : 5 cm, 17 cm and 30 cm. Bulk samples were taken also from these depths (range 10 cm). The average volume of macroaggregates (> 0. 5 mm) was reduced during the experiment from 39, 67 % in 2012 to 33, 52 % in 2014 in a variant of plowing. The average volume in a variant of minimization changed only minimally. The volume of microaggregates in a variant of plowing incereased during the years. This volume was amounted to 3, 71 % in 2002, while in 2014 the figure was 4, 21 %. The volume of microaggregates decreased in a variant of minimization from 4, 18 % in 2012 to mere 2, 51 % in 2014. The influence of basic tillage to bulk density was not statistically proven however there was extreme compaction found at the depths of 30 cm in both versions. Statistically highly significant effect of basic agrotechnics on total porosity was found. It was the value of 45, 27 % in a variant of plowing and the value of 34, 06 % in a variant of minimization. Highly significant effect of basic agrotechnics on maximal capillary water capacity was found. The value of maximal <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> was 37, 40 % of a volume in a variant of plowing.

This paper {{presents the results of}} migration modelling of the Oseberg Syd area of the Viking Graben incorporating fault rock <b>capillary</b> properties. Seal <b>capacity</b> is calculated in the model as a function of Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR), i. e. the percentage shale in the sequence moved past a point on a fault. Over 3 000 model realisations were run for different SGR to fault seal capacity relationships and the calculated hydrocarbon distributions were compared with known distributions. Realisations were ranked according to the closeness of fit between model and actual oil-water contacts for 7 traps. The best-fit to all 7 traps was provided by realisations with significant seal capacity at SGR values greater than ca. 0. 2; a value which is in agreement with an independently derived fault-by-fault calibration between SGR and seal capacity. The level of fill calculated for an individual trap is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the seal capacity relationship because it is controlled not only by the seal capacities of the faults that bound the trap, but also by the pattern of fill-spill of upstream traps. This sensitivity to minor changes in seal capacity introduces large uncertainties when fault seal capacity relationships are used in a predictive mode and emphasises the requirement for migration modelling in fault seal prospect evaluation...|$|R

However, the soil interior hydrological and ecological effects {{will be affected by}} the grassland vegetation degradation. This research was carried out in the source region of the Yellow River, where grassland vegetation was in severe degradation, with the methods of choosing typical areas and quadrates to collect soil samples and doing experiments in laboratory. Some important results were obtained from this research which mainly contained four aspects as follows. (1) With the increasing of grassland degradation degrees, the <b>capillary</b> water holding <b>capacity</b> and saturated water content decreased in all soil layers as a whole. However, the <b>capillary</b> water holding <b>capacity</b> and saturated water content increased when the grassland degradation from middle degree to heavy degree in all soil layers. (2) With the increasing of grassland degradation degrees, the field water capacity first increased and then decreased in the 0 ∼ 10 cm layer and decreased in the means of “increasing-decreasing- increasing-decreasing” manners in the 10 ∼ 20 cm, but it gradually increased in the 20 ∼ 30 cm layers. (3) Soil saturated water content was mainly affected by the soil bulk density and total phosphorus, and the soil <b>capillary</b> water holding <b>capacity</b> was mainly affected by the soil bulk density, while the soil field water capacity was mainly affected by the total nitrogen.

In every village I took four samples of arable land and four samples of permanent grassland. An average of these results was created for each village. Soil samples were collected into core sample holders. In a review of the literature there are described the physical properties of soil, the procedure for processing results and the characterization of selected locations from the climatic, pedological, geological, hydrological and agroecological point of view. The resulting average values are, to a porosity 41, 8 %, density 1, 54 g. cm- 3, specific gravity 2, 6 g. cm- 3, the minimum air capacity 6, 7 % and a maximum <b>capillary</b> water <b>capacity</b> 35, 1 %. According to the classification of grain on these locations are found mainly middle heavy soil, loam and sandy loam...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{fault zone}} analysis is to accurately estimate fault mechanical and hydraulic properties {{that may influence}} the connectivity either across a fault or along a fault and between reservoirs under variable stress conditions. Fault seal capacity is the term {{used to describe the}} ability of the fault to impede the migration of one or more fluid types under certain stress constraints. Academics and industry technologists have developed a number of techniques for assessing various physical characteristics of faults and these have often been grounded either in outcrop analogues or observations of faults in the subsurface thought to be either trapping hydrocarbons or showing evidence of breach. These techniques tend to be process specific, targeting fault rock strength, reactivation potential, across fault <b>capillary</b> seal <b>capacity,</b> or up-fault leakage potential. After examining these various components individually a holistic fault seal analysis can be assembled...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{it can be}} {{hypothesized}} that differing capillary phenomena on structured surfaces with different wettabilities caused the CHF difference between the oxidized silicon nano/microsurfaces and the Teflon-coated nano/microsurfaces. According to the bubble dynamics visualization results shown in Figure 3, the apparent contact angles of oxidized silicon and Teflon-coated nano/microstructures were almost the same under actual boiling conditions. Hence, capillary phenomena are the only remaining factor. Decisively, {{the total amount of}} water absorbed into the nanostructures was clearly different for the two cases. The water absorbed by the hydrophilic nanostructures was able to penetrate {{into the bottom of the}} nanocavities, which was not possible in the hydrophobic nanostructures because of the existence of nanobubbles [26, 28]. In conclusion, the CHF difference between the oxidized silicon and Teflon-coated nano/microstructures was apparently caused by the difference in <b>capillary</b> pumping <b>capacity,</b> which in turn is related to the presence of nanobubbles on the hydrophobic nanostructured surfaces.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse {{structure}} resistance, capillary rise, mechanical strength and other physical properties in fine textured soil in North Libya. The examination of these characteristics was carried out on laboratory modelled soil aggregates (1 cm 3 volume) with special methods developed in the Soil Science Department of the Agricultural University in Poznan. The samples were taken from red soils (Terra Rossa) occurring in the Cyreneica Region. All these soils belong to clayey textured group. Investigations have shown surprisingly low resistance to dynamic and static water action for dry aggregates and very high for moist ones. Percentage of Secondary aggregation* is very high, in most cases exceeds 80 % of total soil mass. The secondary microaggre-gates with diameter of 3 - 1 mm and 1 - 0. 5 mm predominate. The maximum <b>capillary</b> water <b>capacity</b> of soil aggregate models in "free swelling* conditions is so high that it is incomparable to soil porosity...|$|R
40|$|The present pot {{experiment}} studied {{the effect of}} different soil moisture contents (60 - 70 % CWC (<b>capillary</b> water <b>capacity)</b> - control; 30 - 35 % CWC - water stress) on buckwheat productivity, the gas exchange parameters and health of buckwheat nuts. It was found that water deficit affected adversely certain biometric features investigated (plant height, number of nuts per cluster) and caused a decrease in seed weight per plant. It was also shown that water stress reduced {{the values of the}} investigated gas exchange parameters (photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, intercellular-space CO 2 concentration, and stomatal conductance) relative to the control treatment. Different soil moisture contents did not have a clear effect on fungal colonization of seeds. The multiplex PCR assays did not enable the detection of the genes responsible for mycotoxin synthesis. Under water deficit conditions, an increase was found in the content of albumin and globulin fractions as well as of glutelin fractions...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical fault {{reactivation}} is {{a mechanism}} where high fluid pressures generated within a fault zone {{can change the}} effective stress such that an optimally orientated fault segment will rupture. This style of strain has been recognized in three settings: (1) deep crustal locations at greenschist and higher-grade metamorphism with fluid generation; (2) active plate boundaries where tectonic stresses can result in seismicity; and (3) hydrocarbon column buoyancy pressure reactivation of critically stressed fault-bound traps. This paper examines category 3 {{in the context of}} mechanical fault reactivation and capillary processes. For water-wetting fault rock, mechanical reactivation may be reached prior to the <b>capillary</b> seal <b>capacity.</b> However, the non-wetting fluid cannot access the fault rock pore space until the hydrocarbon column height reaches the capillary threshold pressure. At the threshold pressure, the non-wetting fluid enters the fault rock imparting a buoyancy pressure in excess of the mechanical reactivation threshold causing rupture. This suggests that in certain circumstances the mechanical fault reactivation by buoyancy pressure is more accurately predicted by the capillary threshold pressure than mechanical reactivation pressure...|$|R

We aim at investigating oxygen transfer into the blood at rest or exercise. The first task consists in describing nonlinear effects of the oxygen transfer under normal conditions. We also include the possible diffusion limitation in oxygen transfer observed in extreme regimes involving parameters such as alveolar and venous blood oxygen partial pressures, <b>capillary</b> volume, diffusing <b>capacity</b> of the membrane, oxygen binding by hemoglobin and transit time of the red blood cells in the capillaries.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the changes of {{physical}} and hydrophysical property of haplic stagnosol in four different variants of a farmyard manure application. The experimental location is situated {{on the border between}} the cereal and the forage production area. Different amounts of the farmyard manure (0 t/ha, 15 t/ha, 30 t/ha, 45 t/ha) were applied on each variant. The soil probe was dug out. The soil profile was described using the KPZP Comprehensive Methogology (Souborná metodika KPZP, Němeček, 1967) and the soil samples were taken. Then the core samples were taken into the Kopecky's cylinders from the depth (the centre of the cylinders) of 15 cm and 27 cm in six periods. The loose samples were taken from the same depths as well. A decrease of bulk density of dried soil was identified in the variant with the highest application of the farmyard manure. A growth of porosity, a water-holding <b>capacity</b> and a <b>capillary</b> water <b>capacity</b> were identified on the variant with 45 t of the farmyard manure in 15 cm depth. The difference of the soil structure between the variants is not reflective because of the heterogeneity of haplic stagnosol...|$|R
