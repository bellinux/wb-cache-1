25|$|Others, such {{as former}} Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G.

He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the new fiscal year in July 2003, the {{approved}} budget restored a reduced funding level to the affected WCS facilities. To keep the Prospect Park and Queens Zoos open, the WCS had to close two classroom-based instructional programs, lay off the supporting full- and part-time instructors, and double admission fees. Funding levels for the Wildlife Conservation Society were restored in the 2007 city budget, though vulnerability to shortfalls remain. In the opening months of 2009, the WCS itself faced the prospect of losing its fiscal year 2010 New York State funding. While not citing specifics concerning Prospect Park Zoo, the Wildlife Conservation Society reported in the NY Daily News that the proposed <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> involve [...] "'layoffs [...] would cut across the board,' and include 'front-line workers' in sales, groundskeeping and other positions, and include both union and nonunion positions".|$|E

When not flowing, the head <b>cut</b> <b>will</b> resemble a very short cliff or bluff. A small plunge pool may be present {{at the base of the}} head cut due to the high energy of falling water.

2500|$|On May 22, 2017, Mulvaney {{presented}} President Trump's $4.1 trillion budget. The budget includes {{cuts to the}} United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and {{the social}} safety net and increases in funding for defense spending and paid family leave. The [...] "America First" [...] budget included a 10.6% decrease in domestic program spending and a 10% increase in military spending, in addition to $1.6 billion for a border wall. [...] The budget would remove $272 billion from welfare programs, including $272 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. [...] The budget would also remove $800 billion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security disability benefits, while removing nothing from Social Security retirement or Medicare benefits. [...] Mulvaney projected the budget will not add to the federal deficit because future tax <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> lead to 3% GDP growth.

2500|$|Testing of the JLTV was {{temporarily}} halted in early October during the two-week U.S. Government shutdown of 2013. [...] Civilian workers were furloughed and test sites were closed within hours. [...] Work restarted immediately when the shutdown ended, though one site remained closed until 22 October. [...] The Army and Marine Corps have vowed commitment to buying nearly 55,000 JLTVs {{even in the}} face of sequestration cuts. [...] This level of support is given while major acquisition programs like the Ground Combat Vehicle were in danger of cuts (and eventually cancelled), which potentially meant the Army was favoring replacing Humvees more than the M2 Bradley. [...] Army leaders worried that the Marines' priority with the Amphibious Combat Vehicle program could cause them to back out of JLTV procurement. [...] However, the Marines said procurement plans for the two efforts did not overlap and should not conflict with each other. [...] The number of light vehicles that will need to be reduced due to cuts is still being determined, but it is hoped that the <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> be directed to the existing Humvee fleet rather than planned JLTV numbers.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have a tax cut, and these tax <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E

60|$|There are few poets {{whose works}} contain slighter hints of their {{personal}} history than those of Keats; yet there are, perhaps, even fewer whose real lives, or rather the conditions upon which they lived, are more clearly traceable in what they have written. To write {{the life of a}} man was formerly understood to mean the cataloguing and placing of circumstances, of those things which stood about the life and were more or less related to it, but were not the life itself. But Biography from day to day holds dates cheaper and facts dearer. A man's life, so far as its outward events are concerned, may be made for him, as his clothes are by the tailor, of this cut or that, of finer or coarser material; but the gait and gesture show through, and give to trappings, in themselves characterless, an individuality that belongs to the man himself. It is those essential facts which underlie the life and make the individual man that are of importance, and it is the cropping out of these upon the surface that gives us indications by which to judge of the true nature hidden below. Every man has his block given him, and the figure he <b>cuts</b> <b>will</b> depend very much upon the shape of that,--upon the knots and twists which existed in it from the beginning. We were designed in the cradle, perhaps earlier, and it is in finding out this design, and shaping ourselves to it, that our years are spent wisely. It is the vain endeavor to make ourselves what we are not that has strewn history with so many broken purposes and lives left in the rough.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{attachment}} for a CUT is the front-end loader or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a <b>CUT</b> <b>will</b> have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled three-point hitch.

Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated roll over protection structures just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include Kubota, John Deere Tractor, New Holland Ag, Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson.
