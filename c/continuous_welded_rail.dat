25|$|In 2005 and 2007, Amtrak {{replaced}} the ties on the bridge, installed <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> and installed new deck-level maintenance walkways, changes meant {{to extend the}} life of the bridge by 20 to 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{the line}} was improved, {{inspection}} techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing jointed track by <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at rail joints on the Southern Region.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the running surface). This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{a part of}} the Keystone Corridor upgrade {{projects}} {{conducted by}} Amtrak and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the line was upgraded in 2007 with new concrete ties, <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> and overhead lines and substations.

50|$|There {{would be}} two {{separate}} tracks, each electrified on the 25 kV AC system. In the deep tunnel section there would be separate bores for each track. The track would consist of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete foundations - 'slab track'. The tunnel would be controlled by BR's standard three-aspect colour light system together with their automatic warning system (AWS). This would permit train frequencies of 90 seconds, although initial proposals envisaged a 2.5 minute headway.|$|R
25|$|Under privatisation, many {{services}} {{ceased to}} operate {{for a variety}} of reasons. Among these were previously iconic routes such as Buenos Aires - Posadas and Buenos Aires - Bariloche. Recently however, the national government has been replacing very large segments of track in important corridors and routes, using <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete sleepers to accommodate trains running at speeds of 160km/h. Many of these improvements are nearing completion while others are under way and some are in the planning stages.|$|R
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a broken rail. The Ministry of Transport report criticised the maintenance of the line, especially following a recent increase of the maximum speed of trains over the route. Following the accident the maintenance of the line was improved and plans accelerated for replacing jointed track by <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Amtrak {{upgraded}} the NEC {{north of}} New York to ready {{it for the}} higher-speed Acela Express trains. Dubbed the Northeast High Speed Rail Improvement Program (NHRIP), the effort eliminated grade crossings, rebuilt some bridges, and modified some curves. Concrete railroad ties replaced wood ties, and heavier <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR) was laid down.|$|E
25|$|Rails are {{produced}} in fixed lengths {{and need to}} be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal fishplates (jointbars in the US), producing jointed track. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR).|$|E
25|$|More recently, the {{government}} has begun nationalising some of these private companies or simply not renewing their contracts, {{while at the same}} time, the state-owned Trenes Argentinos began re-opening services and improving on the once private services using completely new rolling stock, including services from Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires-Rosario-Cordoba. In many cases, the Argentine Government has completely replaced, or {{is in the process of}} replacing, the existing infrastructure with <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete sleepers.|$|R

5000|$|As at December 31, 2009, {{the total}} {{operational}} kilometers of railway is 85 281 km, including the track gauge of [...] — 84 446 km, {{the length of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> 74.4 thousand km, the railway network operated by 166 975 switches, 138 tunnels and 30,727 bridges.The length of lines equipped with automatic block (AB) and centralized control, is 62,055 km, or 72.9%. Devices of railway automation and remote control on the Russian railway network served with 203 distance signaling, centralization and blocking and with one technical center of automation and remote control.|$|R
25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E
25|$|Joints {{are used}} in <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes {{straight}} across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut {{at an angle to}} give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an expansion joint) gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR), {{sometimes referred}} to as ribbon rails. In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930 and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|This trend {{continued}} in the following years and the government began re-opening services and improving on the once private services using completely new rolling stock, including long distance services like the one from Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires-Rosario-Cordoba. This new-found investment in the railways has not been limited to rolling stock since, in many cases, the state has completely replaced, or {{is in the process}} of replacing, the existing infrastructure with <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete sleepers and undertaking other works such as renovating level crossings and building new railway bridges. The freight network has also received significant investment from China, with two investments totalling US$4.8 billion made in 2013 and 2015.|$|R

40|$|The in-situ {{measurement}} of thermal stress in slender beams, or long <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> may prevent structural anomalies.

40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance of sleepers, rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails.</b> However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance of sleepers. In view of the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance of sleepers. Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types of concrete sleepers. The results of the pullout tests revealed the effects of the sleeper shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number of sleepers on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance of sleepers is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The lack of lateral {{resistance}} in a curved railway track can produce misalignment problems {{due to the}} centrifugal forces when the trains pass through. Moreover, {{most of the times}} <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> (CWR) are used in nowadays railway tracks, which can induce the track buckling as a result of thermal loads caused by high temperature gradients. A new sleeper has been designed to provide higher {{lateral resistance}} of the track. A finite element model has been developed to analyze the lateral movements of an actual curved track subjected to lateral resistance problems. Then, variations on the finite element model have been made to study the response of the track when different sleepers are used. Thus, the performance of the different sleepers in the modeled track has been analyzed, resulting that the inclusion of the new sleeper in the track can improve the lateral resistance between 39 and 55 % with respect to a track with conventional sleepers made of wood or concrete...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} and dangerous failure modes in <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> is fatigue crack propagation terminated by brittle fracture.

The investigations presented here comprise weld material characterization, simulation of fatigue crack propagation and finally {{the determination of the}} failure probability using the Monte Carlo method. The effect of various parameters, such as axle weight, initial crack size, residual stresses, fatigue crack propagation threshold and date of inspection were analyzed. The results show that, independent of the date of the last inspection, almost any failure event happens in wintertime. This is in accordance with practical experience. However, from the proposed analysis it is evident that the main parameter controlling rail fracture is not only the minimum local temperature, but the temperature range over the whole year. Finally, the results are compared to the standard rail classification method...|$|R

40|$|The <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> used {{in most of}} the United States lack {{expansion}} joints of any sort. This {{leads to}} a much smoother ride and a longer service life for rails and wheels, but also causes extreme temperatures to induce high stresses in these rails. In very warm conditions these stresses can incite sudden buckling of the rails, which is dangerous and difficult to predict. To alleviate these risks rail stresses need to be regularly monitored, but current practices are slow and labor intensive. This research develops a non-contact prototype apparatus designed to quickly measure longitudinal stress in rails. The measurement is performed by generating a Rayleigh wave along the surface of the web of the rail and analyzing the polarization of the Rayleigh wave some distance further down the rail. An evaluation of this measurement technique is performed on rails of varying age and surface condition in a lab environment. A set of guidelines is then established to ensure the successful recreation of these results in a field environment. From these guidelines, a 3 D model is developed to aid in the construction process. Finally, a prototype is manufactured based on this design...|$|R
40|$|This study studied {{an effect}} of a new guard rail on the {{stability}} of curve tracks with CWR and revealed a mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small radius curve tracks with CWR and also analyze the degree of the new guard rail for enlarging the pave range of small radius curve tracks with CWR. In order to achieve these, an improved load-deformation method for calculating the stability of tracks with <b>Continuous</b> <b>Welded</b> <b>Rails</b> (CWR) is suggested and verified. The {{results indicate that the}} improved load-deformation method not only has the same accuracy as the improved unified formula in specification, but also has the same clear and simple characteristics as the original load-deformation method. The mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small radius curve tracks with CWR is that the CWR stability can be greatly improved by increasing the stiffness of the track framework under conditions of maintaining the same cross-sectional area of the rails. The CWR with the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 230 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be relaxed 23. 3 %. If combined with the roadbed strengthening measures, the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 140 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be further relaxed 53. 3 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{extensive}} usage of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> a number of rail joints still exist in the track. Although {{a number of them}} exist as part of turnouts in the yards where the speed is not of concern, the Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) that exist in ballasted tracks remain a source of significant impact loading. A portion of the dynamic load generated at the rail joints due to wheel passage is transmitted to the support system which leads to permanent settlements of the ballast layer with subsequent vertical misalignment of the sleepers around the rail joints. This vertical misalignment of the adjacent sleepers forms a source of high frequency dynamic load raisers causing significant maintenance work including localised grinding of railhead around the joint, re-alignment of the sleepers and/or ballast tamping or track component renewals/repairs. These localised maintenance activities often require manual inspections and disruptions to the train traffic leading to significant costs to the rail industry. Whilst {{a number of studies have}} modelled the effect of joints as dips, none have specifically attended to the effect of vertical misalignment of the sleepers on the dynamic response of rail joints. This paper presents a coupled finite element track model and a rigid body track vehicle interaction model through which the effects of vertical misalignment of sleepers on the increase in dynamic loads around the IRJ are studied. The finite element track model is employed to determine the generated dip from elastic deformations as well as the vertical displacement of sleepers around the joint. These data (dip and vertical misalighments) are then imported into the rigid body vehicle-track interaction model to calculate the dynamic loads...|$|R

Depending on design speed, banking and the forces deemed acceptable to the passengers, curves often exceed a 5 kilometer radius. Tilting trains have been developed for achieving greater comfort for passengers, so higher speeds are possible on curvy tracks. Although a few exceptions exist, zero grade crossings is a policy adopted almost worldwide, with advanced switches utilizing very low entry and frog angles. Magnetic levitation trains fall under the category of high-speed rail due to their association with track oriented vehicles; however their inability to operate on conventional railroads often leads to their classification in a separate category.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{structural}} problems in the railroads made of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> is buckling in hot weather and breakage or pulling apart in cold weather. Buckling is usually caused by the high compressive stress due to thermal load or weak track conditions, and sometimes vehicle loads. The prevention of track buckling {{is related to the}} determination of the temperature, called rail neutral temperature, at which the net longitudinal force in the rail is zero. 	In the project presented in this thesis we investigated the capability of a novel sensing system to indirectly measure applied stress in rails and predict incipient buckling. This system consists of a simple and cost-effective transducer, recently developed at the University of Pittsburgh, which enables the generation and detection of highly nonlinear solitary waves (HNSWs), which are compact non-dispersive mechanical waves that can form and travel in highly nonlinear systems such as granular, layered, or porous materials, where they are conventionally generated by the mechanical impact of a striker. To prove the feasibility of this novel system to predict buckling temperature or measure applied stress, we investigated numerically and experimentally the interaction between solitary waves propagating along a chain of granular particles and slender beams of different shapes, lengths, and boundary conditions. We found that the geometric and mechanical properties of the beam or thermal stress applied to the beam alter certain features of the solitary waves. 	Overall, the work presented in this thesis was articulated in four main tasks: 1) literature review; 2) create a semi-analytical model; 3) design and test new transducers; and 4) conduct a series of experiments including a field test at the University of California, San Diego. 	This HNSWs approach does not require many electronic accessories and shows a good sensitivity to the properties of the material that is at the interface with the chain of particles. Moreover, it only observes the propagation of solitary waves within the transducer without the waves in the rail...|$|R
40|$|A rail is an {{important}} and the most heavily laden element in the railway superstructure, because it functions as both the running surface used for vehicle guidance and the beam directly transmitting the load of the vehicles to the ballast bed and the railway substructure. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the characteristics of rails and provides a theoretical background relating to rail stresses resulting from traffic load, temperature change and production procedures. When rail vehicles move, enormous contact stresses are produced in the contact zone between the wheel and the rail, which often causes damage to the running surface. Curves with smaller diameters cause particular wear of the rails because of the strongest dynamic effects of the vehicle on the rail. The thesis thus presents the most common surface defects, defines rail wear and outlines currently available techniques of rail grinding and lubrication.
