500|$|To {{adjust to}} {{potential}} audio feedback and leakage and obtain a usable take, Chavarria tried having Badu sit in an overstuffed chair six feet behind the mixing console and use alternate microphones {{such as a}} Neumann M 269 or AEA R44 ribbon microphone with Sony MDR-V900 headphones into a Furman headphone mixer. However, Badu felt she could not perceive all of her voice's frequencies with the headphones and often discarded them to move towards the studio monitors. He also considered situating her in an equilateral triangle with the two speakers, one {{of which would be}} placed out of phase in order to have the leakage cancel itself. However, according to him, the mic has to be stationary, while Badu [...] "likes to hold the mic like an MC. She is at home as a live performer." [...] He said of working around audio spills and adapting to Badu's methods, [...] "We worked to make her vocals fit into the track, phase-wise ... What did work was to keep the monitors fairly low and turn the microphone out of phase, and we would move her around the room until she found a spot where the leakage was reasonable and where she felt comfortable and could hear herself. But just as often she would just sit in that <b>chair</b> <b>behind</b> the board in the A Room." ...|$|E

There is a small hole in the office wall covered by what Archie calls a [...] "trick picture of a waterfall."

The <b>chair</b> <b>behind</b> Wolfe's desk is custom-built, with special springs to hold his weight; according to Archie, it is the only chair that Wolfe really enjoys sitting in. Near the desk is a large chair upholstered in red leather, which is usually reserved for Inspector Cramer, a current or prospective client, or the person whom Wolfe and Archie want to question. In the short story [...] "The Squirt and the Monkey," [...] Wolfe and Archie have a hidden tape recorder and microphone installed in the office, with controls in the kitchen. In the story [...] "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo," [...] the system is modified to transmit sound to a speaker in the front room.|$|E
