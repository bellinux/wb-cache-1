40|$|Zaporizhzhya is a six unit {{nuclear power}} plant site located near Energodar, Ukraine. [A° " 5] All six units are of the VVER- 1000 design. At {{the time of the}} fire {{described}} here, Ukraine {{was a part of the}} former Soviet Union. Plant construction on Unit 1, begun in 1980, was in its last stages when a severe cable fire occurred on January 27, 1984. As a result, the plant's initial operations were delayed until late 1984 (November[AI° 4] or December[A 10 5]). The plant began commercial operations in April 1985. IA 1 ° 3 At the time of the fire, some of the cable penetration seals were not installed yet, and there were other penetration seals that had been reopened for inspection. The other units at the site began operations between 1985 and 1995. A 10. 2 Chain of Events Summary On January 27, 1984, Unit 1 was in the last stages of construction and apparently the reactor was not activated yet. At 17 : 15, a fire was reported at elevation 13. 2 m of the Control Building. It was later postulated that a failure in the terminal box No. 114 had caused the fire. The features of the box and the nature of the initiating fault are not clear from the available information. The reports postulate that a loose item had fallen into the box. The fire propagated via cables coming out of the terminal box and into a <b>cable</b> <b>shaft</b> where i...|$|E

5000|$|A {{terrorism}} unit is assembled at {{the building}} to get any further terrorists out of the building. Meanwhile, Jennifer and Mark discover a recent suicide could {{be linked to the}} incidents, as his extremely superstitious widow believes his soul has returned to punish others. Jennifer and Mark enter the building to discover and stop the threat once and for all. During the entry, Jennifer is taken into custody posing as a METEOR executive. During her first attempt to prove this fraud, she receives {{a phone call from a}} friend to explains that while Steinberg's time working on the [...] "fucking chips" [...] as they are called in the movie, has been revoked, Steinberg continued to work on the project except not with dolphin brains. Eventually, Mitchell abandons Steinberg for fear of his own reputation being ruined. Mark manages to get into the Millennium Building and discovers a large bio-chip in the form of a brain in an elevator shaft. It is assumed that this brain is alive and controlling the elevators. He attempts to destroy using a screwdriver, but this attempt fails when it sends a flaming elevator down to kill him. Mark barely escapes while the elevator kills a SWAT officer who was barely out of the elevator shaft before he was sliced in half from his waist down with the upper half of his body sliding across the floor. Marshall gets a hold of a stinger missile launcher and is about to destroy the organ when Steinberg intervenes, threatening him. Jennifer appears, having escaped custody and frees Marshall. As Mark tries to destroy the organ a third time, the police enter, giving Steinberg the opportunity to hold Jennifer hostage. Jennifer manages to escape thanks to Steinberg being unable to recognize one of his superiors. Steinberg is grabbed by the elevator <b>shaft</b> <b>cables</b> and pulled in, along with Mark. At the last second, Jennifer kicks the stinger launcher to Mark, who proceeds to destroy the organ. Steinberg's mutilated corpse falls seconds later.|$|R
