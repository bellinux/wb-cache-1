50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The timing gear has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft timing gear from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>timing</b> gear.|$|E

50|$|Piston engines {{normally}} use valves {{which are}} driven by camshafts. The cams open (lift) the valves for {{a certain amount of}} time (duration) during each intake and exhaust cycle. The timing of the valve opening and closing, relative to the position of the crankshaft, is important. The camshaft is driven by the <b>crankshaft</b> through <b>timing</b> belts, gears or chains.|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} {{bachelor}} thesis {{is to explore}} the possibility of replacing the traditional arrangement of <b>crankshaft</b> and <b>timing</b> mechanism in combustion engines. The aim of this work is to design the default parameters for the selected engine performance. After designing the default parameters are designed and created CAD models of basic engine components. Subsequently developed a basic overview of alternative concepts of internal combustion engines and elaborated a basic available analysis of the structure.

50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine application the timing belt or chain connects the crankshaft to the camshaft(s), which in turn control the opening and closing of the engine's valves. A four-stroke engine requires that the valves open and close once every other revolution of the <b>crankshaft.</b> The <b>timing</b> belt does this. It has teeth to turn the camshaft(s) synchronised with the crankshaft, and is specifically designed for a particular engine. In some engine designs the timing belt may also be used to drive other engine components such as the water pump and oil pump.|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a computer program}} developed by Wärtsilä Switzerland which provides a three-dimensional model of the shafting for the calculation of coupled vibrations, alignment and whirling in a ship propulsion plant. Based on the fi nite-element method the program covers both dynamic and static problems. Each node has six degrees of freedom. The following features are included: calculation in frequency range and time domain, linear and nonlinear bearing characteristic, consideration of variation of running gear inertia, and optimization of engine parameters. The mathematical model of the shaft line with all associated parameters and boundary conditions are represented by calculation results and validated by measurement. An everyday example for the calculation of coupled axial vibrations with the associated measured data is shown in this paper. Furthermore the infl uence of the variation of torsional inertia is demonstrated and a possibility for reduction of torsional stress in the <b>crankshaft</b> by injection <b>timing</b> optimization is explained. As an example for the static capabilities the reverse bearing offset calculation based on measured web defl ections, bearing loads and bending moments is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{cam shaft}} and its {{associated}} parts control the opening and closing of the two valves. The associated parts are push rods, rocker arms, valve springs and tappets. It consists of a cylindrical rod running over {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism as they rotate. This shaft also provides the drive to the ignition system. The camshaft is driven by the <b>crankshaft</b> through <b>timing</b> gears cams are made as integral parts of the camshaft and are designed in such a way to open and close the valves at the correct timing and to keep them open for the necessary duration. A common example is the camshaft of an automobile, which takes the rotary motion of the engine and translates it in to the reciprocating motion necessary to operate the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders. In this work, a camshaft is designed for multi cylinder engine and 3 D-model of the camshaft is created using modeling software pro/Engineer. The model created in pro/E is imported in to ANSYS. After completing the element properties, meshing and constraints the loads are applied on camshaft for three different materials namely aluminum alloy 360, forged steel and cast iron. For that condition the results have been taken has displacement values and von misses stresses for the static state of the camshaft. After taking the results of static analysis, the model analysis and harmonic analysis are done one by one. Finally, comparing the three different materials the best suitable material is selected for the construction of camshaft...|$|R
