60|$|After some {{conversation}} {{among these}} gentlemen, from which I might have supposed {{that there was}} nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners, at any expense, and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors, we began our inspection. It being then just dinner-time, we went, first into the great kitchen, where every prisoner's dinner was in course of being set out separately (to be handed to him in his cell), with the regularity and precision of clock-work. I said aside, to Traddles, that I wondered whether it occurred to anybody, that there was a striking contrast between these plentiful repasts of <b>choice</b> <b>quality,</b> and the dinners, not to say of paupers, but of soldiers, sailors, labourers, the great bulk of the honest, working community; of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well. But I learned that the 'system' required high living; and, in short, to dispose of the system, once for all, I found that on that head and on all others, 'the system' put an end to all doubts, and disposed of all anomalies. Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system, but THE system, to be considered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Different {{consumer}} demands different quality, which {{determines that}} existence of different {{quality of the}} same product is reasonable. The article uses two-stage game of fully non-perfect information. Through two-stage game analysis, the article concludes that whether new entrants should enter the market is not only related with the fixed cost of entry, the number of consumers and the highest taste of consumers, but also related to the <b>quality</b> <b>choices</b> of incumbents; after entrants enter the market, the <b>choices</b> of <b>quality</b> are decided by the <b>quality</b> <b>choices</b> of incumbents...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} demand {{uncertainty}} and imperfect competition on market entry and product <b>quality</b> <b>choice.</b> We allow for either fixed or flexible quality. Under a fixed <b>quality</b> <b>choice,</b> the follower chooses a higher quality provision. Quality is shown to generally increase with the volatility of demand. The strategic <b>quality</b> <b>choice</b> by the follower may trigger the exit of the leader. Furthermore, flexibility in the leader's <b>quality</b> <b>choice</b> can constitute a strategic disadvantage. Finally, the degree of horizontal differentiation between the supplied goods plays a pivotal role in determining the market structure in the long run. Copyright � 2009 The Authors.

40|$|Information load {{at various}} {{thresholds}} has been asserted {{to cause a}} decline in decision quality across several domains, including marketing (Eppler and Mengis 2004). The influence of each information load dimension may vary by study and context (Malhotra 1982; Lurie 2002; Lee and Lee 2004). Given the explosion of information available on the internet, attracting an estimated 144 million U. S. users (Burns 2006 a), this experimental research examined how three dimensions of online product information load influenced consumers’ perceived cognitive effort. To the researcher’s knowledge, online product breadth, depth, and density have not been empirically tested together, in a multi-page within website context. A nationwide panel of 268 adult consumers participated in the web-based consumer electronics online search and selection task. Results suggest that a consumer’s perceived cognitive effort with the search and selection task negatively influences <b>choice</b> <b>quality</b> and decision satisfaction. Although product breadth directly influenced both <b>choice</b> <b>quality</b> and cognitive effort negatively, cognitive effort mediated product depth’s influence on <b>choice</b> <b>quality</b> and decision satisfaction. The perception of informational crowding also negatively influenced cognitive effort. Additionally, a choice involvement scale was adapted and developed based upon Schwartz’s (2004) Maximizer and Satisficer scale. Results suggest that the higher one’s choice involvement (tendency toward being a Maximizer), the lower one’s perceived cognitive effort with the search and selection task. Both product and choice involvement demonstrated a direct negative influence on cognitive effort, lending further empirical support for the information processing theory of consumer choice (Bettman 1979). A stimulus-organism-response framework, adapted from environmental psychology, was employed to model the relationships among the constructs tested. Results suggest that this framework may be helpful for guiding future online consumer research...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship and difference between <b>choice,</b> <b>quality</b> of life, and depression among residents from independent and assisted living facilities. This study was an expansion of the Vohnout (2011) study. Questionnaires were distributed to 202 residents living in a Midwestern retirement village. The questionnaires contained a demographic questionnaire, the Duncan Choice Index: Self-Care and Leisure (Duncan-Myers & Huebner, 2000), the Quality of Life Rating (Gust, 1982), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage, 1983). A total of 102 questionnaires were returned producing a response rate of 50 %. The study found a statistically significant correlation between <b>choice,</b> <b>quality</b> of life, and depression in assisted and independent living participants. A moderate correlation (ρ = 0. 45, p < 0. 01) between choice and quality of life, a low correlation (ρ =- 0. 21, p < 0. 05) between choice and depression, and a moderate correlation (ρ =- 0. 53, p < 0. 01) between quality of life and depression were found. Therefore, the more choice a person had the higher he or she rated quality of life. Also, the more depressed a person was the lower his or her quality of life an...|$|E
