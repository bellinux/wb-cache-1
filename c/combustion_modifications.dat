40|$|<b>Combustion</b> <b>modifications</b> to {{minimise}} NOx emissions {{have led}} to the existence of reducing conditions in furnaces. As regulations demand lower NOx levels, it is possible (to a degree) to continue to address these requirements with increased levels of combustion air staging. However, in most practical situations, a number of adverse impacts prevent the application of deep combustion air staging. One of the more important limitations is the increased corrosion that can occur on wall tubes exposed to fuel rich combustion environments. Current boiler corrosion monitoring techniques rely on ultrasonic tube wall thickness measurements typically conducted over 12 to 24 month intervals during scheduled outages. Corrosion coupons are also sometimes used; typically require considerable exposure time to provide meaningful data. The major drawback of these methods is that corrosion information is obtained after the damage has been done. Management of boiler waterwall loss and system optimisation therefore requires a real-time indication of corrosion rate in susceptible regions of the furnace.

40|$|Two {{promising}} <b>combustion</b> <b>modification</b> approaches {{applicable to}} pulverized coal fired boilers are presented: "Oxygen-Enriched Combustion" (OEC) for NOx control and "Oxy-Combustion" (PC-OC) for CO 2 capture. Oxygen-enriched air rather than air {{is used as}} an oxidizer in the OEC technology. Unlike flue gas treatment technologies, OEC directly impacts the NOx formation process by significantly reducing the conversion of coal bound nitrogen to NOx. Pilot-scale and full-scale tests have shown 20 to 30 % NOx reduction from an optimized staged-air baseline. In addition to the overall cost competitiveness and the reduced capital requirements, other significant advantages of the O 2 -enriched technology vs. existing low NOx technologies are presented. The PC-OC technology is shown as a cost-effective technology for CO 2 capture from existing or new coal-fired power plants. Pure oxygen diluted in recycled flue gases is used as an oxidizer. The process has been successfully demonstrated and extensively characterized at pilot-scale level (1. 5 MWt). The tests have shown substantial benefits of the PC-OC technology, in terms of NOx reduction (60 - 70 % from air-baseline), overall plant efficiency, etc. The cost effectiveness of this capture technology compared to competitive amine scrubbing technology was investigated. The cost of CO 2 avoided was around $ 36 /ton for the new PC-OC cases, about $ 48 /ton on a retrofit PC-OC case, which is about 25 to 40 % cheaper than the amine scrubbing system.

40|$|Closed accessLow-temperature {{combustion}} in {{diesel engines}} offers attractive benefits through simultaneous {{reduction in the}} nitrogen oxide emissions and the soot emissions. However, {{it is known that}} the in-cylinder conditions typical of low-temperature combustion operation tend to produce high emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, reducing the combustion efficiency. The present study develops from the hypothesis that this characteristic poor combustion efficiency is due to the in-cylinder mixture preparation strategies which are non-optimally matched to the requirements of the low-temperature combustion mode. In this work, the effects of three key fuel path parameters, namely the injection fuel quantity ratio, the dwell and the injection timing, on the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions were examined using a central-composite-design design-of-experiments method. The experiments were performed on a single-cylinder diesel research engine operating in a mixing-controlled low-temperature combustion mode at high and moderate exhaust gas recirculation rates with a split fuel injection for all conditions. The experiments identified the potential of fuel metering control for optimising the hydrocarbon emissions in low-temperature combustion by showing the effects of the fuel control parameters on the fuel mixing quality and the emission formation mechanisms.

40|$|Emission {{from the}} {{combustion}} processes can cause adverse effect to the environment. The formation of pollutants such as NOx, CO, CO 2 and SOx are hazardous and {{harmful to the}} ecosystem. The awareness about the pollution due to the combustion activities, particularly in industrial field has set off {{an effort to find}} more comprehensive and enhanced technologies to reduce these pollutants. There are several methods {{that can be used to}} reduce the emissions of these pollutants either by <b>combustion</b> <b>modifications</b> or post combustion treatment.

The function of the secondary air is to reduce the peak flame temperatures, which theoretically reduce the emissions of NOx emissions. The primary concern for this research is to study the effectiveness of the air staging in reducing NOx, CO, SO 2, and UHC emissions from the combustion process. The results obtained showed significant reduction in all major pollutants, i. e., a 31. 8 percent reduction for CO emission, 16. 8 percent for NOx, 12. 7 percent for SO 2 and 10. 3 percent for UHC.

Although, they are a very high char yield system, they are relatively flammable if not flame retarded. The large amount of char (60 % to 70 %) appears to form too slowly to prevent the violent degradation and rapid mass loss characteristic of these materials. During combustion we observed, as others have that the char cracks under the pressure from rapid volatilization. The combustion samples burn in a characteristic and unusual manner. As the resin heats up some char forms, however, it appears to crack and many gas “jets ” form {{on the surface of the}} sample. These “jets ” ignite and burn violently much like small blow-torches. This results in a 30 % mass loss in only 1 - 2 minutes. However, the flammability behavior of the cyanate ester nanocomposites is different. The char which forms during combustion appears to crack less, and the number and intensity of the gas/flame “jets ” is reduced, this gives a 50 % lower heat releas...|$|R
50|$|Engine tuning is an adjustment, {{modification}} of the internal <b>combustion</b> engine, or <b>modification</b> to its control unit, otherwise known as its ECU (Engine Control Unit). It is adjusted to yield optimal performance, to increase an engine's power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be mutually exclusive, and an engine may be detuned with respect to output (work) in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due to lessened stress on engine components.|$|R
40|$|Under {{sponsorship}} of the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), McDermott Technology, Inc. (MTI), the Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W), and Fuel Tech teamed together to investigate an integrated solution for NOx control. The system was comprised of B&W's DRB- 4 Z{trademark} low-NO{sub x} pulverized coal (PC) burner technology and Fuel Tech's NO{sub x}OUT{reg_sign}, a urea-based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) technology. The technology's emission target is achieving 0. 15 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu for full-scale boilers. Development of the low-NOx burner technology has been a focus in B&W's combustion program. The DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner (see Figure 1. 1) is B&W's newest low-NO{sub x} burner capable of achieving very low NO{sub x}. The burner is designed to reduce NO{sub x} by diverting air away from {{the core of the}} flame, which reduces local stoichiometry during coal devolatilization and, thereby, reduces initial NO{sub x} formation. Figure 1. 2 shows the historical NO{sub x} emission levels from different B&W burners. Figure 1. 2 shows that based on three large-scale commercial installations of the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burners in combination with OFA ports, using Western subbituminous coal, the NO{sub x} emissions ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 18 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. It appears that with continuing research and development the Ozone Transport Rule (OTR) emission level of 0. 15 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu is within the reach of <b>combustion</b> <b>modification</b> techniques for boilers using western U. S. subbituminous coals. Although NO{sub x} emissions from the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner are nearing OTR emission level with subbituminous coals, the utility boiler owners that use bituminous coals can still benefit from the addition of an SNCR and/or SCR system in order to comply with the stringent NO{sub x} emission levels facing them...|$|R
