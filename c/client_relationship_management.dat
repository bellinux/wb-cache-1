40|$|Knowledge {{creation}} and organizational learning have become central concerns in strategic management. This chapter analyzes customer relationships {{as a source}} of new organizational knowledge. Knowledge absorption from customer relationships involves two key processes of organizational learning: creating new knowledge within the firm from <b>client</b> <b>relationships</b> and leveraging this new knowledge within the firm and in <b>client</b> <b>relationships.</b> The <b>management</b> of such learning and knowledge leveraging processes is critical to a firm's ability to build new organizational competences. These processes are examined in the context of knowledge intensive business service firms including both specialist and general management consulting firms, to gain insights into processes of strategic organizational learning. After presenting two brief case studies of knowledge absorption from clients, some implications for knowledge management in various kinds of <b>client</b> <b>relationships</b> are considered. This chapter contributes to the competence-based view of competition by developing a typology of <b>client</b> <b>relationships</b> and an integrative framework that helps to clarify several important types of knowledge absorption opportunities...|$|R

The company needs a system to track orders and improve workflow. HiP needs a system which not only tracks orders, but also stores all client information in a database. This client information can be used for a variety of marketing and contact reasons. It is an important and integral part of HiP's <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> (CRM). The lack of a cohesive CMS at HiP caused many fundamental business problems, such as lost orders, missed billing statements, and over/under billing.

This paper reports findings of an exploratory study with the objective of examining the perceived benefits regarding uptake of apps in New Zealand {{construction sector}}. Using self-administered questionnaire survey, feedback was received from the major construction trade and professional organisations in New Zealand.

By best practice, we understand specific marketing tools and strategies built upon real needs and heterogeneous consumer preferences, addressed directly in a relevant way, aiming at clients’ long-term retention. We should also {{take into consideration}} the highly competitive market, with rapid changes in purchase and consumption behavior, while the ever-increasing degree of technology changes fundamentally not only the speed, but also the information content. Since past years we can talk about consumer behavior analysis based on multiple criteria, including the emotional or moral components, consumers’ expectations, and life style, as understanding such variables is the main pillar of relationship marketing. The main objectives rely upon building long-term relations, client retention, and loyalty.

The population of Associated Landscape Contractors of America 2003 online member list (2049 companies) was organized into four strata based on company size. A stratified random sample of 400 companies was selected. We received 137 completed questionnaires (35 % response rate). Most of the population was either satisfied or extremely satisfied (52 %) with college graduates recently hired; only 8. 1 % of the population was dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied. When respondents were asked to consider four knowledge categories, a majority (53 %) said recent graduates were deficient in business knowledge, followed by construction (25. 1 %), horticultural (9. 6 %), and design (5. 1 %) knowledge. When respondents were asked to rate the importance of topics that could be taught in undergraduate landscape contracting programs, business topics (personnel management, estimating and bidding, and clientele management) were identified as their top three choices. The population also named three business-related skills (<b>client</b> <b>relationships,</b> time <b>management,</b> and managing employees) among the five most important skills for landscape contracting professionals. Despite the stated importance of business knowledge and training, 68. 3 % of the population said when hiring for an entry-level landscape contracting position, they prefer candidates with strong horticultural skills over those with strong business skills.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. After {{facing the}} {{economic}} recession, the South–African and global business sectors started revaluating their human {{capital and the}} positions they represent within an organisation. Each individual now had {{to prove that they}} contributed towards the organisation’s bottom line, as each and every cent had to be counted and accounted for. Some functions within organisations could easily prove their contribution towards the bottom line by providing production or sales outputs. The public relations practitioners and the corporate communication efforts they offered, however, faced a bleak future, as their contribution towards the tangible assets was very rarely recognised (Kim, 2000 : 276). The financial services sector however, in which an advisor’s contribution towards the organisational bottom line is easily quantified, started to acknowledge the need for this sector to improve upon its ‘softer’ intangible assets such as client communication and <b>client</b> <b>relationships.</b> The sector believes that communication establishes <b>relationships,</b> and sound <b>client</b> <b>relationships</b> {{is the only way to}} sell financial products and services, as people seldom entrust their life earnings or financial dreams to strangers (Christiansen & DeVaney, 1998 : 7). Public relations practitioners know how to use communication optimally in the quest for building <b>client</b> <b>relationships,</b> and financial services need those skills in order to sell their products and contribute towards the bottom line. These two functions could thus work together towards the achievement of their goals - public relations to prove their bottom line contribution, and the financial services sector towards improving <b>client</b> <b>relationships.</b> These statements led to the general Research Question of this study: “What is the nature of the relationship between (i) corporate communication efforts, (ii) client communication satisfaction and (iii) <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, and these concepts’ <b>relationship</b> to (iv) <b>client</b> economic contribution, within a financial services organisation?” This Research Question is answered from the systems theory as meta–theory with the support of the strategic communication, excellence and <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> theories, and Futurum Financial Group (FFG) services as the financial services organisation for this study. A qualitative and quantitative research approach was followed to establish the constructs, and the relationships between the constructs. The Financial Advisors and public relations practitioner in FFG have a good understanding of the need for strategic communication efforts, and a relationship between their efforts and the client communication satisfaction and <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction could therefore be indicated. A further <b>relationship</b> between the <b>client</b> communication satisfaction and <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and the client economic contribution was also established. Recommendations to improve the situation within FFG included a better focus on database administration, corporate communication consistency, Financial Advisor diligence, and providing clients with more frequent updates regarding their financial situation. The greatest strengths were client–advisor trust and corporate communication professionalism. This study thus contributes to the argument that communication efforts add tangibly, by means of client economic contribution, to the organisation’s bottom line, within the financial services industry. The study furthermore provides some recommendations for the financial services industry to improve their communication skills in order to build <b>client</b> <b>relationships.</b> Master...|$|R
30|$|The {{marketing}} effort undertaken by ocean carriers {{is on an}} individual firm basis and can differentiate between {{the parties to the}} alliance in terms of <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> from the moment the first encounter is made until final delivery of the cargoes to the destination (Panayides and Wiedmer, 2011). Similar to major air carriers, ocean carriers are limited in differentiation on the vessel asset. Airlines can offer enhanced services, (beds, meals, luggage delivery, etc.) to avoid being a commodity. Air carriers can command premium rates for premium service, though larger customers can demand the premium service at a rate they dictate predicated on volume. Ocean carriers can differentiate on elements important to beneficial cargo owners (BCO’s). For example, documentation for cargo movements is of critical importance and must be managed by BCO’s. Ocean carrier information, including where the cargo is in transit and when it will arrive at the next milestone, invoicing, global account coverage, etc. are aspects that can be controlled by the carrier and provided to BCO’s (Landon, 2015). The growing power of NVOCCs within trade lanes is due to their ability to more adequately provide the visibility into their ocean-borne cargo and other “soft services” that are important to the BCO without the expense of operating the equipment assets; they can leverage the available capacity to their advantage. Control of key service trade lanes where ocean carriers have a disproportionate amount of vessel slots can also allow them to market themselves as having full control of the service.|$|E
40|$|What {{alternative}} {{strategies are}} {{being pursued by}} firms to capture profit in global value chains? In what ways are the sources of competitive advantage changing as they move up the value chain from low end to high end work, potentially changing the structure and boundary of the existing industry? This paper examines these questions {{by focusing on the}} outsourcing and offshoring of legal services, known as Legal Process Outsourcing (LPO). Legal services were chosen for study in order to highlight the relevance of both technological and institutional factors that influence value chain dynamics. In particular, the study examines how the nature of professions impact on make-or-buy decisions and industry structure. The legal services value chain is conceptualized as consisting of three blocks, namely knowledge and information management (KIM), consultative advice and representation (CAR), and <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> (CRM). The study shows that legal services are being unbundled, with the KIM component being separated by ownership and geography from CAR and CRM components. To assess the actual extent of disintegration, the study identifies the conditions under which demand and supply for LPO services is generated. Those conditions on the demand side include the corporatization of law firms and pressures on global corporations to cut legal costs. From the supply perspective, the study identified three distinctive strategies for LPO providers to capture profit, depending on their mode of entry influencing their initial capability mix, and whether or not the value chain is driven by a corporation or a law firm...|$|E
40|$|The term return {{has been}} used in the {{accounting}} world {{since the beginning of the}} accounting age. In common parlance, it means to receive something in addition to the principal value invested or to receive something in lieu of a sacrifice. The term investment is used in conjunction with the term return to bring out the true meaning of return. Can this concept be extended to the principal value invested for acquiring information technology solutions? Yes. As any investments made must have a yield, so too must investments in information technology. However, the nature of return expected from an investment in information technology may not be purely identifiable as an accounting profit or yield (e. g., rent on property), as the nature of investment itself is not a single item of ownership that has an exchange value. The typical IT investments, such as ERPs, e-business solutions, knowledge management solutions or <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> solutions, involve investments in application software, hardware, consulting/implementation, training and communication infrastructure. This makes it difficult to link the benefits to any specific IT investment. In contrast, property or equity shares are classified as assets, for which the return and realizable value are identifiable. Thus, there is significant difference in the nature of investment and the nature of return in an asset vis-à-vis information technology. The nature of return in the case of IT investments is intangible and, hence, difficult to quantify. Investing in technology provides a competitive advantage as this enables a firm to introduce change, impacting the industry and competitive structure. However, investment in physical assets may not necessarily result in a competitive advantage. I...|$|E

The empirical results of this study were fourfold. First, greater employees' relational and client orientation resulted in higher relationship quality. Second, better financial providers'(employees') attributes resulted in higher relationship quality. Third, higher relationship quality resulted in better relationship continuity. Fourth, committed <b>client</b> <b>relationships</b> resulted in <b>client</b> satisfaction, loyalty, positive word of mouth, and promotion.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{contributes}} {{to the study of}} work-life balance practices in very constrained environments such as Professional Service Firms. We start by highlighting the distinctive features of Professional Service Firms’ incentive system, which is rooted in the 19 th c. Cravath law firm and assumes that young professionals are willing to sacrifice their personal life to be eventually co-opted partner. We show that a few recent studies lead us to question this assumption and wonder whether this specific system may have lost its incentive power. We then ask the following question: Do Professional Service Firms intend to respond to growing demands of work-life balance and how can they accommodate them?Our study is based on the combination of exploratory interviews of 9 Human Resources directors and 6 partners in 9 consulting firms with an in-depth comparative case study of two Finance and Management consulting firms’ practices in the matter. It {{contributes to}} the understanding of work-life balance in Professional Service Firms in several ways. First, we confirm that consulting firms are confronted with demands of flexibility. Yet, we find that Human Resources Directors and Partners have two distinct standpoints on the issue: a first group explains this phenomenon is in line with the normal functioning of the up-or-out system, while a second group admits struggling to retain some promising consultants and trying to address their demands. Our comparative case study then shows that consulting firms attempt to accommodate demands of work-life balance and flexibility through a number of arrangements concerning: time, location, project assignment and <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management.</b> Given the considerable discrepancy observed between the firm providing financial advice and the firm providing management advice, we then discuss how contingent consulting firms’ capacity to respond to work-life balance demands may be. We go on to propose a framework of analysis of work-life balance arrangements in Professional Service Firms highlighting the role played by the leverage model, fee billing practices, the length of projects and their location, which are all strongly influenced by the type of advice provided. Finally, we discuss the role played by professional service firms’ organisational constraints in favouring or discouraging these arrangements...|$|E
40|$|Audit objective, {{criteria}} and scope: The {{objective of the}} audit {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO’s) complaints and other feedback management systems in supporting service delivery. To form a conclusion against this objective, the ANAO examined if the ATO has: well-planned and designed complaints and other feedback management arrangements; sound processes to manage complaints and other feedback; and effectively analysed complaints and other feedback to inform service delivery. The focus of the audit was primarily on the ATO’s management of complaints. The ATO’s management of compliments and other feedback was also examined, where possible. The audit did not examine the formal objection process that allows taxpayers to dispute an ATO decision, but did examine the interaction between the objection and complaints management processes. Overall conclusion While complaints represent a client’s expression of dissatisfaction with an agency’s administration, effective complaints handling can help to restore good relations with the client and inform processes to strengthen administration and reduce costs. As a major Australian Government agency that deals with many millions of clients, the ATO receives a considerable amount of client feedback—around 27 000 complaints and 4000 compliments and other items of feedback in 2012 ‒ 13. The significant {{increase in the number of}} complaints received in the three years from 2009 – 10, averaging over 42 000 for that period, contributed to a marked decline in client satisfaction with the complaints handling processes in 2011 ‒ 12. The Community Perceptions Survey (July 2012) and Professionalism Survey (May 2012) both identified complaints handling as an area requiring improvement. Avoiding spikes in complaint numbers, or better still reducing the total number of complaints, requires the ATO to proactively address issues that can give rise to complaints. In addition to declining client satisfaction, increases in complaint numbers are costly to manage. In the absence of ATO analysis, the ANAO estimated that, if the number of complaints in that year had been the same as in 2010 – 11, the ATO would have incurred additional employee costs in the order of $ 8 million to manage the workload. Accordingly, it is important that the ATO puts in place strategies to minimise complaints occurring in the first place, particularly when major business and process changes are being implemented and for the annual tax time. The ATO’s complaints handling framework is well-designed and its management arrangements are generally sound. The complaints reengineering project has strengthened complaints handling, and there has been a rebound in client satisfaction and community perceptions in the 2013 surveys. Nevertheless, opportunities remain to more fully address the principles of fairness, accessibility, responsiveness, integration and efficiency outlined in the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s Better Practice Guide to Complaint Handling. There are also opportunities to improve complaints handling practices, including better understanding of issues which were the subject of complaints and the needs of complainants. In addition, there is scope for the ATO to: improve reporting against complaints handling timeliness measures, and to develop other performance measures; implement a more coherent agency-wide quality assurance framework for complaints and other feedback; and limit sensitive information about named officer complaints from being included in records on the ATO’s <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>management</b> computer system, and implement measures to periodically check that ATO officers have not accessed these records inappropriately. In addition, while there have been instances where the ATO has used complaints intelligence to address systemic issues that give rise to complaints, there is scope for it to better use intelligence from client feedback to more actively inform service delivery and improve efficiency. This includes developing strategies to minimise complaints occurring in the first place and better managing taxpayer’s expectations by keeping them informed throughout their dealings with the ATO. The ANAO has made three recommendations aimed at improving the ATO’s handling of complaints and its monitoring and reporting of performance in managing complaints...|$|E

40|$|Legal professions {{involved}} in the justice system focusing on the attorney - <b>client</b> <b>relationship.</b> Abstract The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the attorney - <b>client</b> <b>relationship,</b> especially some of the essential elements of this relationship. The thesis is composed of five chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines the attorney as a one of the legal professions {{involved in}} the justice system, looks at the reasons of formation and existence of these professions and gives a brief insight in the attorney - <b>client</b> <b>relationship's</b> history. Chapter Two deals with the ways the attorney - <b>client</b> <b>relationship</b> is created. It can be both contractually and non-contractually (appointing by court and determination by Czech Bar Chamber). Chapter Three is the largest chapter of the thesis and is subdivided into two parts. The first part concentrates on the attorney's rights and duties, such as for example duty to protect and promote client's interests, duty to follow client's instructions, duty of confidentiality, duty to be insured, right to remuneration and others. The second part focuses on the client's rights and duties and explains them as a counterpart of the attorney's rights and duties, because of the synallagmatic character of the attorney - <b>client's</b> <b>relationship.</b> Chapter four is engaged in the ways the [...] ...|$|R
