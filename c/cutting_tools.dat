40|$|Abstract: The {{failure cause}} and failure mode of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is {{analyzed}} {{based on the}} reliability analysis on <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> of vertical shearing machine. Reliability calculation model is established, and experimental research on <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is operated. The {{results show that the}} critical failure mode of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is electric die grinder. The crucial failure cause is that in the shearing process, the UO 2 ceramic in the fuel components is crushed into particles with high hardness, these hard material will lead to tool wear. The reliability of <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> is 0. 892, which can’t achieve the spent fuel reprocessing working shearing machine reliability requirements.

5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> of the Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards {{the needs of}} highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
