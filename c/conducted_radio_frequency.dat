The aim is to identify suitable measurement procedures at present not available both in the literature and in EMC standards. The data acquisition system (personal computer and data acquisition board) is approached as a whole system and subjected to the more relevant conducted interference considered by EN standards, electrical fast transient and noise by <b>conducted</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> field. Experimental tests, carried out in a shielded environment, highlight the relevance of a specific EMI characterisation of this apparatus...|$|E

40|$|Automation of DC photoinjector designs using {{a genetic}} {{algorithm}} (GA) based optimization is an accepted practice in accelerator physics. Allowing the gun cavity field profile shape to be varied can extend {{the utility of}} this optimization methodology to superconducting and normal <b>conducting</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (SRF/RF) gun based injectors. Finding optimal field and cavity geometry configurations can provide guidance for cavity design choices and verify existing designs. We have considered two approaches for varying the electric field profile. The first {{is to determine the}} optimal field profile shape that should be used independent of the cavity geometry, and the other is to vary the geometry of the gun cavity structure to produce an optimal field profile. The first method can provide a theoretical optimal and can illuminate where possible gains can be made in field shaping. The second method can produce more realistically achievable designs that can be compared to existing designs. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation for these two methods for generating field profiles for SRF/RF guns in a GA based injector optimization scheme and provide preliminary results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the behavior of}} electron bunch charge produced in an L-band normal <b>conducting</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> cavity (RF gun) from Cs 2 Te photocathodes illuminated with ps-long UV laser pulses when the laser transverse distribution consists of a flat-top core with Gaussian-like decaying halo. The produced charge shows a linear dependence at low laser pulse energies as expected in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime, while its dependence on laser pulse energy is observed to be much weaker for higher values, due to space charge limited emission. However, direct plug-in of experimental parameters into the space charge tracking code ASTRA yields lower output charge in the space charge limited regime compared to measured values. The rate of increase of the produced charge at high laser pulse energies close to the space charge limited emission regime seems to be proportional {{to the amount of}} halo present in the radial laser profile since the charge from the core has saturated already. By utilizing core + halo particle distributions based on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi-analytical emission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge {{for a wide range of}} RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement uncertainties.

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the behavior of}} electron bunch charge produced in an L band normal <b>conducting</b> <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> gun from Cs 2 Te photocathodes illuminated with ps long UV laser pulses and presumed homogeneous flattop laser transverse distribution. The measured charge shows the expected linear dependence in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime at low laser pulse energies. At higher laser pulse energy, the measured charge in the space charge limited emission regime should saturate, assuming an ideal homogeneous flattop laser transverse distribution. However, this behavior is not observed experimentally. Instead of saturating, the measured charge continues to increase with laser pulse energy, albeit with much weaker dependence than in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime. Simulations with the space charge particle tracking code ASTRA show that the charge saturates as expected using a homogeneous flattop laser transverse distribution. The discrepancy between simulations and measured excess charge {{may be attributed to}} the presence of unintentional Gaussian like decaying radial halo beyond the core of the otherwise presumed homogeneous flattop core. The rate of increase of the measured charge at high laser pulse energies seems to be proportional to the amount of halo despite charge saturation in the core of the transverse laser radial profile. By utilizing core halo particle distributions based on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi analytical emission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge {{for a wide range of}} RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement uncertaintie...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{the human}} body implantable medical devices have been {{experiencing}} a rapid development. Medical implants are an integration of sensing technologies, nano/micro technologies, and wireless communication technologies and are developed as innovative approaches for in vivo body health monitoring, essential life function supporting and diseases controlling/regulating.

Additionally, marketing opportunities related to RFID usage have been argued to exist. Despite this, limited research has focused on RFID in a marketing context which constitutes the research gap for this study. Â  A literature review on the subject area yielded an overview of the existing literature within the field. The literature review identified a research gap that constitutes the purpose of this study. The purpose is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of <b>Radio</b> <b>Frequency</b> IDentification technology and whether it enhances retailersâ€™ marketing opportunities. The study was of a qualitative nature and was conducted through a multiple case study. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with four companies. An archival analysis was performed in addition to the interviews. The interview data reveals that RFID technology adoption still has barriers to overcome, especially in regards to the identified marketing opportunities. Based on the conclusions of this study recommendations for managerial implications were formed. The findings of the study were able to support previous research stating that the main challenge for RFID adoption is the cost of the equipment. However, the previously identified marketing opportunities were not fully supported by the interviewed companies, thus, this area of research needs to be developed further. ...|$|R

The survey is wide field, contemporaneous, multi-epoch, and multi-resolution in nature and was <b>conducted</b> at low <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> between 140 and 200 MHz. The multi-epoch and ultra wide field (but relatively low resolution) part of the survey was provided by 15 nights of observation using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) {{over a period of}} approximately a month, contemporaneous with K 2 observations of the field. The multi-resolution aspect of the survey was provided by the low resolution (4 â€§) MWA imaging, complemented by non-contemporaneous but much higher resolution (20 â€³) observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The survey is, therefore, sensitive to the details of radio structures across a wide range of angular scales.
