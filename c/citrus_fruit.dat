5|$|In September 1918, Laffoon {{moved to}} San Antonio, Texas, where {{he opened a}} law {{practice}} and managed a <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> business near Galveston. Though he had intended {{this to be a}} permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months in Texas. In 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated Trice Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.|$|E

In this study, the effects of X-irradiation on Xcc growth either in the suspension or on the surface of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were investigated. The suspension containing 1 × 107 cfu/ml of Xcc was irradiated with different absorbed doses of X-irradiation ranging from 50 to 400 Gy.

40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight of Garut citrus fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight of the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining of Garut citrus acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
