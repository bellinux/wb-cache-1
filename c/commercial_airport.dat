5|$|Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} European cities in the United States. Its {{location}} at the mouth of the Passaic River (where it flows into Newark Bay), has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Today, Port Newark-Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast. In addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal <b>commercial</b> <b>airport</b> in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.|$|E

5|$|Before Tropical Storm Danielle {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, a small-craft {{advisory}} was issued, and later, gale warnings were posted for Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On Saint Vincent, {{the threat of the}} storm forced the closure of the main <b>commercial</b> <b>airport,</b> as well as schools, businesses, and stores. Further west, Danielle briefly posed a threat to Jamaica, prompting officials in that country to issue a tropical storm watch. Two months earlier, the precursor to Tropical Storm Andrew killed 49people on the island; to avoid a recurrence, the Jamaican government worked to evacuate fishermen from two small islands as a precaution.|$|E

The Quad City International Airport across the river in Moline, Illinois, is the closest <b>commercial</b> <b>airport.</b> Major railroads include the Iowa Interstate Railroad and the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern. Two national U.S. recreation trails intersect in Davenport: the Mississippi River Trail and the American Discovery Trail.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} various {{agreements}} between the US <b>commercial</b> <b>airports</b> and the airlines {{each of which}} has defined how the risk, responsibilities, and reward of running an airport should be shared among them. The airport–airline financial relationships at the nation’s <b>commercial</b> <b>airports</b> are based on four basic approaches: the residual cost, the compensatory, the hybrid, privatization approaches. In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive review of airport–airlines financial agreements, and develop an analytical model to measure the financial performance of the US <b>commercial</b> <b>airports.</b> In general, compensatory airports have had a higher marginal contribution to profitability than residual airports...|$|R

5|$|The idea to {{construct}} a new airport for Hyderabad was first conceived around 1997 by the N. Chandrababu Naidu administration. The existing <b>commercial</b> <b>airport,</b> Begumpet Airport, was unable to handle rising passenger traffic. The State Government initially considered converting Hakimpet Air Force Station to civilian use; however, the Air Force refused. When the State proposed {{the construction of a}} new airport for the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport. By October 1998, the State had narrowed down to three possible locations for the new airport: Bongloor, Nadergul and Shamshabad. Due to its convenient location near two highways (NH 44 and NH 765) and a railway line, Shamshabad was selected in December 1998.|$|E
5|$|The second-largest <b>commercial</b> <b>airport</b> is William P. Hobby Airport (named Houston International Airport until 1967) which {{operates}} primarily short- to medium-haul domestic flights. However, in 2015 Southwest Airlines launched service {{from a new}} international terminal at Hobby airport to several destinations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since 1969. Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air Terminal Museum located in the old terminal building {{on the west side}} of the airport. Hobby Airport has been recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports in the world and for customer service by Airports Council International.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only <b>commercial</b> <b>airport</b> within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E
