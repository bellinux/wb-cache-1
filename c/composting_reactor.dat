Based on results of experimental research already reported by us, criteria {{for the proper}} design and operation of the bio-toilet system were established. In addition, size of the <b>composting</b> <b>reactor</b> was determined attending such criteria and based on results of drying tests conducted in a laboratory-scale drying device designed by us. Design procedure considered the daily water loading, due to contributions of urine and feces, as the main criterion. Organic loading, in terms of feces/sawdust ratio (F/S) resulted to be a non-governing factor for the design, because it was very low.

However, mixing frequency was considered an important factor for operating the system. Establishment of operation criteria led to the formulation of a operation scheme where three main zones are distinguished: i) “green zone ” where the best composting performance is expected; ii) “yellow zone ” where biodegradation can be conducted but performance {{is not the most}} efficient; iii) other zones where operation of the bio-toilet is not recommended because odor problems and human health risk will develop, or in the worst case, biodegradation of feces will not occur. 1...|$|E
40|$|Composting is a {{powerful}} process {{for the treatment of}} the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (MSWs), yard and green wastes. The process is performed aerobically by means of specific micro organisms that utilize organic matter for their metabolism producing, as metabolites, water, carbon dioxide and humus (a solid substance that can be utilized for agricultural uses). Composting of organic solid residues has a positive environmental impact because it reduces the volume of solid wastes to be landfilled and, consequently, the production of methane (often characterized by low recovery efficiency) due to the anaerobic degradation of organic solids. Indeed, the release of methane in the environment is very dangerous because the effect of methane as greenhouse gas is about 20 times higher than that of carbon dioxide. In this paper, a mathematical model of the composting process is presented in order to predict its performance and to contribute to the solution of practical design problems. Energy and mass balance equations, with typical kinetic expressions for degradation of organic matter, provide the basis of the composting model. The process was split into two stages: in the first, the "Running phase", the substrate biodegradation reactions take place, while in the second, the "Loading phase", air and water are supplied to the <b>composting</b> <b>reactor.</b> The effects of the characteristic time of each phase on the BVS, oxygen and water concentrations inside the <b>composting</b> <b>reactor</b> were also studied. © 2010 WIT Press...|$|E

30|$|The VS content (organic content) of the {{composting}} materials {{in all the}} reactors decreased with time (Fig.  3) due to microbial decomposition of organic matter. The overall VS destruction (over a period of 60  days) in <b>composting</b> <b>reactors</b> of sorghum straw and sorghum straw[*]+[*]saw dust was observed to be higher (56 % and 58 %, respectively) than in finger millet straw (40 %) and in soybean straw (39 %). This result is clearly due to higher moisture and lower TS and VS contents observed in sorghum straw than in the remaining straws/saw dust (Table  1). Lower VS (higher moisture) content in sorghum straw reduced the carbon load in the reactor (better C/N ratio) and enabled better microbial activity as well as decomposition. In the <b>composting</b> <b>reactors</b> of finger millet straw and soybean straw, higher VS load would have created imbalance in C/N ratio resulting in reduced microbial activity/decomposition. Also, finger millet straw and soybean straw indicate higher structural recalcitrance to microbial destruction due to their higher VS contents and thus lower VS destruction was observed.|$|R

The effect of three temperature regimes performed at the constant level of 16 % O 2 in the compost gas was studied in eight experimental runs in the compost reactor. The effect of reduced O 2 levels of 2. 5 and 1 % in the compost gas was studied in two experimental runs for one of the above temperature regimes. It was found that the highest rate of degradation was achieved when the temperature was actively regulated to below 40 °C during a low pH phase.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are needed for}} manure treatment that can capture nutrients, reduce emissions of ammonia and nuisance odours, and kill harmful pathogens. A reactor concept was developed for simultaneous treatment of separately collected liquid and solid fractions of pig manure.

This results in two marketable products, a concentrated liquid nitrogen fertiliser (NH 4 NO 3) without phosphorus, and a stabilised, solid organic fertiliser, which is free of pathogens and weeds. By connecting the two reactor systems, emissions of ammonia and odours are abated as ammonia emitted from the composting is trapped in the liquid fraction and odorous compounds emitted from the liquid are degraded in the <b>composting</b> <b>reactor.</b> The concept was physically simulated by coupling a 80 -L compost reactor to a 10 -L bubble column.

Solid waste generation has gone rapidly high in the Kathmandu Valley over the last decade due to booming population and rapid urbaniza-tion. Finding appropriate landfill sites for the disposal of solid wastes generated from the households of the Kathmandu Valley has always been a major problem for Nepalese government. 65 % of total generated wastes from the households of Nepal consist of organic materials. As large fractions of generated household wastes are organic in na-ture, composting can be considered {{as one of the best}} sustainable ways to recycle organ-ic wastes generated from the households of Nepal. Model Community Society Development (MCDS), a non-governmental organization of Nepal carried out its small-scale project in five households of the Kathmandu Valley by installing <b>composting</b> <b>reactors.</b> This thesis is based on this small-scale project and has used secondary data provided by MCDS Nepal for carrying out the study.

30|$|The {{maturity}} of compost is {{also related to}} the presence of humic acids (HA) in the composts. HAs are normally generated towards the last stage of composting (Veeken et al. 2000), which requires several weeks to a few months (Inbar et al. 1990). They are extremely important soil components because they constitute a stable fraction of carbon, thus regulating the carbon cycle and the release of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur (Stevenson 1984). In this study, humic acid (HA) content in all the composting reactors increased with time (0.001 % to 1.85 %) indicating that the microbial decomposition occurred efficiently (Fig.  3). Compost maturity has been reported to be closely related {{to the presence of}} humic acids (Tiquia 2005). Because, after composting, humic acid content is significantly increased contributing to the stability of soil organic matter and thus indicating that the compost is mature enough for subsequent land application (Zhou et al. 2014). Humic substances are generated during microbial decomposition/activity in two ways (Lopez et al. 2002) (1) lignin derivatives are oxidized from side chains of lignin which form the core structure of humic substances, and (2) during the polymerization of monomers. In the present study, humic acid content was observed to be higher in the <b>composting</b> <b>reactor</b> of sorghum straw[*]+[*]saw dust (HA- 1.85 %) than in sorghum straw (1.65 %), soybean straw (1.52 %) and in finger millet straw (1.42 %).

Air pycnometers currently used for this purpose are custom made instruments operating under different conditions (sample volume, initial pressure, etc.).

In this study, AFP measurements have been performed in more than 50 samples {{of a wide range of}} composting materials using two different custom made pycnometers, one of them coupled to a <b>composting</b> <b>reactor</b> allowing in situ AFP measurement. While temperature variation during AFP measurement has been discarded as an error source, the determination of the sample volume has been found to be a significant factor affecting the air filled porosity calculation. Regarding the initial pressure to use, a compromise between accuracy and practicality has to be established for each pycnometer design as AFP values obtained with diverse initial pressures (from 200 to 500 kPa gauge pressure) were found to present no statistical differences. An initial pressure in the range of 300 - 500 kPa (gauge pressure) is recommended. In conclusion, there is a need for a standard methodology for AFP determination or prediction at industrial scale.

The removal of heat in order to make it avail-able for domestic use requires that air be blown through the composting mass in a closed reactor.

40|$|On-site {{sanitation}} {{systems have}} gained {{much interest in}} recent years. One such system is the urine diverting composting toilet, which are promoted to sanitize human excreta for recycling them into fertilizer. A　composting toilet using waste material as bulking agent {{has the potential to}} trap pathogens that might be contained in human feces. Unfortunately, in some marginal area, composting toilet could not get specific conditions for destroy all pathogens. Several studies have reported the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in composting toilet. However, the removal of intestinal parasites has not been so far studied since parasites tend to have stronger resistance than pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the fate of intestinal parasites and pathogenic bacteria in the composting toilet for sanitizing compost from composting toilet. Chapter 1 describes the background and the objectives of this research. The literature review has summarized {{the state of the art}} regarding to the removal of pathogens in composting toilet, the inactivation mechanisms of the pathogen organism cells during the composting process and the different adequate post-treatments for sanitizing compost. Chapter 2 deals with the removal of intestinal parasites (helminthes eggs and protozoan cysts) and that of pathogenic bacteria during the composting process in a composting toilet. Batch experiments were conducted by composting human feces in an aerobic <b>composting</b> <b>reactor</b> during 60 days. The results showed that among parasites, protozoan cysts (Entamoeba hystolitica) were present in humans feces collected at high concentration (854 /g mean) than helminthes eggs (Ascaris lumbricoides) (204 /g mean). A mesophilic temperature, desiccation and alkaline pH were obtained during the composting process. Compared to pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella sp), which were eliminated totally after 30 composting days, helminthes eggs were reduced after 35 days; while protozoan cysts were still present after 60 days. In high concentration, protozoan cysts have survived stronger than helminthes eggs in the composting toilet and may constitute a sanitary risk when used as fertilizer. Because of the persistence of intestinal parasites in composting toilet, both helminthes eggs and protozoan cysts are good indicator for the removal of intestinal parasites. Chapter 3 elucidates the inactivation mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria cells in composting toilet during the composting process. The inactivation mechanisms were evaluated by culture E. coli strain as pathogenic bacteria in 3 types of media namely Tryptic Soy Agar, Desoxycholate Agar and Compact Dry EC. By comparing, the inactivation rate constant of E. coli, the damaged components and/or functions of bacteria cell were estimated in three different composting matrixes (sawdust, rice husk and charcoal). The results showed that composting process and composting matrixes did not significantly affect inactivation rate of pathogenic bacteria; however, these differences affected damaging component or function of the bacteria cells. The composting process damaged the bacteria cell from membrane and enzyme to metabolisms while the composting matrix damaged from membrane to enzymes and metabolisms. However, the composting process, when accompanied with alkaline pH, changed the damage part of bacteria more lethally with nucleic acid damage. iiiChapter 4 evaluates the post-treatment of compost by storage treatment for a short time. Fresh composts produced in composting toilet with continuous feces supply, were stored for 2 months, in uncontrolled conditions. The microbiology analysis of fresh and stored composts, showed that, both composts contained indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms, enterococci, spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia), pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella) and intestinal parasites (helminthes eggs and protozoan cysts), at levels above suggested limits for compost quality. There was no significant difference of the microbial level in fresh and stored composts exanimated, thus the storage period tested resulted in slow reduction of microorganisms for compost quick sanitizing. However the microbial level in fresh and stored composts from a composting toilet was known and their health implications suggested further sanitizing treatments. Chapter 5 evaluates the post-treatment of compost by solar heating as thermal treatment. Fresh composts from composting toilet were inoculated with indicator microorganisms and subjected to solar heating (direct sunlight and solar box). The inactivation rate constant and the decimal decay of microorganisms in compost were estimated by using the inactivation kinetics. The result showed that the temperature regime produced by direct sunlight and solar box were categorized in mesophilic (> 30 °C) and pasteurization (> 70 °C), respectively. The log reduction of microorganisms in compost by solar box was significantly higher than that of direct sunlight. The inactivation of microorganisms was slower in compost heated by direct sunlight but fast in compost heated by solar box, thus the decimal decay occurred rapidly with solar box heating while it was prolonged with direct sunlight heating. The high and uniform temperature distribution obtained with solar box during heating proved to be an efficient option for sanitizing compost. Chapter 6 evaluates the post-treatment of compost by urea addition as alkaline treatment. Fresh composts from composting toilet were inoculated with indicator microorganisms and subjected to different urea concentrations (0. 5 - 2 % w/w) and temperatures (22, 32 and 42 °C). The inactivation kinetics parameters were determined in relation to pH, ammonia content and temperature during treatment time. The results showed that urea addition to compost enhanced inactivation of microorganisms. The inactivation rate constants of all microorganisms tested were positively correlated to the increase of NH 3 (aq) concentration and temperature. The relationship between inactivation rate of microorganisms and ammonia through urea concentration and temperature were established. Therefore, the best decimal decay of E. coli, enterococci and A. eggs occurred with 2 % w/w urea concentration at 42 °C within 0. 9, 1. 1 and 1. 4 days, respectively. Urea treatment has proved to be an efficient option for safe use of compost from composting toilet.

40|$|At the Fraunhofer-Institut ILV a {{laboratory}} test system {{was developed for}} measuring the degree and rate of degradation of biodegradable plastics in a compost environment. Compost is a very heterogeneous environment which does not allow to prove total biodegradation of a plastic because of limited possibilities to analyze metabolites in compost. Therefore, the microbial degradation of a plastic is measured under standardized conditions in an aerated, synthetic aqueous medium where the plastic is the sole source of carbon for micro-organism. The synthetic mineral medium is inoculated with a mixed microbial population from the aqueous eluate of mature compost. The biodegradation process is monitored by measuring the carbon dioxide production resulting from the microbial metabolism. Completeness of biodegradation is assessed by conducting a carbon balance, i. e. only if 100 % of the plastic's carbon is transformed by microbial action to carbon dioxide or is built into new biomass the plasti c is called biodegradable. The rate of biodegradation in the synthetic aqueous medium, however, {{is different from the}} compost environment. Therefore, on a second test level biodegradation is measured in a compost simulation test by adding the plastic to a fixed bed made from mature compost. The rate of biodegradation is assessed by measuring the difference in carbon dioxide formation of a <b>compost</b> <b>reactor</b> with the addition of polymer to a <b>compost</b> <b>reactor</b> without polymer. The aqueous tests as well as the composting tests are conducted with a time dependent temperature profile comparable to the natural self heating process during composting. Completeness of biodegradation, however, can only be proved in the aqueous test, because the build up of new biomass and the formation of soluble metabolites can only be measured therein. Results of the aqueous biodegradation test for a starch based biodegradable plastic were compared to a compost simulation test. After a period of 45 days identical c arbon dioxide formation resulting from the biodegradation process was measured in both test systems. The rate of biodegradation, however, was significantly higher in the aqueous system. It could be shown that magnesium in cocoa products can be very well determined by means of flamme AAS after chemical digestion in a microwave. The result of both ashing techniques (pressure and microwave) were in good agreement. The specific advantage of this microwave digestion method is represented...|$|R
40|$|Whereas Earth-based <b>composting</b> <b>reactors</b> that {{effectively}} control the process are batch operations with bottom-to-top airflow, in extraterrestrial application both the fresh waste {{and the air}} need to be introduced from above. Stabilized compost and used air would exit below. This materials flow pattern permits the addition of waste whenever generated, obviating the need for multiple reactors, and the incorporation of a commode in the lid. Top loading in turn dictates top-down aeration, so that the most actively decomposing material (greatest need for heat removal and O 2 replenishment) is first encountered. This novel material and aeration pattern was tested in conjunction with temperature feedback process control. Reactor characteristics were: working, volume, 0. 15 m 3; charge, 2 kg dry biomass per day (comparable to a 3 - 4 person self-sufficient bioregenerative habitat); retention time, 7 days. Judging from temperature profile, O 2 level, air usage, pressure head loss, moisture, and odor, the system was effectively controlled over a 35 -day period. Dry matter disappearance averaged 25 % (10 - 42 %). The compost product was substantially, though not completely, stabilized. This demonstrates the compatibility of top-wise introduction of waste and air with temperature feedback process control...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{complete removal}} of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) in 15 days using an in-vessel composting system, which is amended with TNT-degrading bacteria strains. A mixture of TNT, food waste, manure, wood chips, soil and TNT-degrading bacteria consortium are co-composted for 15 days in an aerobic environment. Variations in the TNT degradation rates are assessed when <b>composting</b> <b>reactors</b> are operated at different carbon/nitrogen ratios (C/N), aeration rates, TNT concentrations and TNT-degrading bacteria inoculum loads. Changes in TNT concentrations are measured using high performance liquid chromatography, and C/N are determined using elemental analysis every 5 days. Temperature and moisture {{of the system}} are measured every 6 hours. Optimum TNT degradation performance is achieved by combining C/N of 20 / 1 and a 5 L min- 1 aeration rate. Complete removal is achieved for TNT concentrations of 2, 10, and 100 g kg- 1 in 15 days by the help of Citrobacter murliniae STE 10, Achromobacter spanius STE 11, Kluyvera cryocrescens STE 12, and Enterobacter amnigenus STE 13 bacteria strains. The final products of composting are used to cultivate four different plant seedlings for 10 weeks and showed no toxic effect, which is promising for the potential agricultural use of TNT-contaminated lands after remediation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|To monitor {{emissions}} of NH 3 and N 2 O during composting and link these to ammonia oxidation {{rates and the}} community structure of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). A laboratory-scale <b>compost</b> <b>reactor</b> treating organic household waste was run for 2 months. NH 3 emissions peaked when pH started to increase. Small amounts of N 2 O and CH 4 were also produced. In total, 16 % and less than 1 % of the initial N was lost as NH 3 -N and N 2 O-N respectively. The potential ammonia oxidation rate, determined by a chlorate inhibition assay, increased fourfold during the first 9 days and then remained high. Initially, both Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas populations were detected using DGGE analysis of AOB specific 16 S rRNA fragments. Only Nitrosomonas europaea was detected under thermophilic conditions, but Nitrosospira populations re-established during the cooling phase. Thermophilic conditions favoured high potential ammonia oxidation rates, suggesting that ammonia oxidation contributed to reduced NH 3 emissions. Small but significant amounts of N 2 O were emitted during the thermophilic phase. The significance of different AOBs detected in the compost for ammonia oxidation is not clear. This study shows that ammonia oxidation occurs at high temperature composting and therefore most likely reduces NH 3 emissions...|$|R
