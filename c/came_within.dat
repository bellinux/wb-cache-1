Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although he was unable to run in the last twenty minutes of the session due to brake issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso <b>came</b> <b>within</b> one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie <b>came</b> <b>within</b> the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E

Rather than continuing westward, {{where it}} would have hit near Cape Canaveral, Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream, turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September11 and September12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130mph (215km/h) winds while remaining offshore.|$|E

According to Sky and Telescope magazine, this year Vesta <b>came</b> <b>within</b> about 6 degrees of 1 Ceres {{during the winter}} of 2012 and spring 2013. Vesta orbits the Sun in 3.63 years and Ceres in 4.6 years, so every 17 years Vesta overtakes Ceres (the last overtaking was in 1996). On December 1, 2012, Vesta had a magnitude of 6.6, but decreasing to 8.4 by May 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Article One <b>came</b> <b>within</b> {{one state}} of the number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the general}} method {{to compute the}} inverse square root was to {{calculate}} an approximation for , then revise that approximation via another method until it <b>came</b> <b>within</b> an acceptable error range of the actual result. Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. The key of the fast inverse square root was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the square root with another method and calculating the reciprocal via floating point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit floating point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other floating point specifications.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group <b>came</b> <b>within</b> 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives <b>came</b> <b>within</b> two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship <b>came</b> <b>within</b> range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Whitlam {{was seen as}} a {{leadership}} contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene. Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell, Eddie Ward, and Reg Pollard, were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam. In 1960, after losing three elections, Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell, with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader. Calwell <b>came</b> <b>within</b> a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger 1961 election. He had not wanted Whitlam as deputy leader, and believed Labor would have won if Ward had been in the position.|$|E

The Belgians refused to yield but Montgomery claimed to have got his way by placing himself under the command of the Belgian forces, knowing that when the Germans <b>came</b> <b>within</b> artillery range the Belgians would withdraw.|$|E
