Wicksell had defined the natural rate as that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level. <b>Credit</b> <b>creation</b> and credit destruction induce changes in the price level and {{in the level of}} economic activity.

25|$|As {{a medium}} of exchange, money {{facilitates}} trade. It {{is essentially a}} measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for <b>credit</b> <b>creation.</b> Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants {{as to what is}} exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.|$|E
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank <b>credit</b> <b>creation,</b> imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E

25|$|The García {{government}} {{reacted to}} the growing external deficit {{in exactly the same}} way as had the governments of Velasco and of Belaúnde—by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the façade of control. To some degree, they were growing in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services—gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services—were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing agricultural expansion. Still another direction of Central Bank <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold down the cost of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.|$|E

5000|$|Innes {{goes on to}} {{note that}} {{a major problem in}} getting the public to {{understand}} the extent to which monetary systems are debt based is the challenge in persuading them that [...] "things are not the way they seem" [...] A Quantity Theory of Credit was proposed in 1992 by Richard Werner, whereby <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> is disaggregated into credit for GDP and non-GDP (financial circulation). The approach is tested empirically in a general-to-specific econometric time series model and found to be superior to alternative and traditional theories. Werner found that bank <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> for GDP transactions Granger-causes nominal GDP growth, while <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> for financial transactions explains asset prices and banking crises.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} possible {{model of}} <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> assumes all loans borrowed from banks in a fractional-reserve banking system are re-deposited to the system. This allows simple {{calculation of the}} amount of credit created. In practice, though, cash leakages occur in the form of sums of money borrowed from banks but not re-deposited, and in the form of funds deposited in banks but not lent out. Cash leakage, in this case, lowers the ability of <b>credit</b> <b>creation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Proponents {{believe that}} a {{sustained}} period of low interest rates and excessive <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment. According to the theory, the business cycle unfolds in the following way: low interest rates tend to stimulate borrowing from the banking system. This leads {{to an increase in}} capital spending funded by newly issued bank credit. Proponents hold that a credit-sourced boom results in widespread malinvestment. A correction or [...] "credit crunch" [...] - commonly called a [...] "recession" [...] or [...] "bust" [...] - occurs when the <b>credit</b> <b>creation</b> has run its course. Then the money supply contracts (or its growth) slows causing a curative recession and eventually allowing resources to be reallocated back towards their former uses.|$|E
