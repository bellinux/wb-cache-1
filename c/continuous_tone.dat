25|$|Halftone is the reprographic {{technique}} that simulates ones it is <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> imagery {{through the use}} of equally spaced dots of varying size. 'Halftone' {{can also be used to}} refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{a signal}} is given, {{such as a}} series of tones (ex. <b>Continuous</b> <b>Tone),</b> or a voice announcement. Upon {{receiving}} the signal, building occupants of schools, hospitals, factories, shopping centers, etc. proceed to a designated location, usually an interior room or corridor with no windows, and assume a protective position.|$|E
25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the radiogoniometer work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an incoming signal, or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the <b>continuous</b> <b>tone,</b> and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E
50|$|Truly <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> can be {{achieved}} that are equivalent to photographs, without the use special techniques such as half-screen printing.|$|R
50|$|When pixel art is {{displayed}} {{at a higher}} resolution than the source image, it is often scaled using the nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm. This avoids blurring caused by other algorithms, such as bilinear and bicubic interpolation—which interpolate between adjacent pixels and work best on <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> but not sharp edges or lines. Nearest-neighbor interpolation preserves these sharp edges, but it makes diagonal lines and curves look blocky, an effect called pixelation. Thus, hybrid algorithms have been devised to interpolate between <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> while preserving the sharpness of lines in the piece; such attempts include the 2xSaI, Super Eagle, and the high-quality hqx algorithms.|$|R
50|$|Highly {{atmospheric}} {{and fast}} Speedcore is called flashcore. When a song reaches 1000 bpm, {{the music is}} known as extratone. However, when beats {{are in the range}} of 1000-1500 bpm the individual beats become indistinguishable, and turn into <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Fire alert: three 15-second <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> {{separated}} by seven-second intervals. All firemen of volunteer fire brigades should report to their fire station immediately. This signal is used less and less, as many fire brigades alert their members {{by use of}} pagers.|$|R
50|$|Flood alerts {{consist of}} twelve low <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> each lasting 20 seconds. The flood alert is {{activated}} once the general siren is sounding. If {{heard by the}} population in danger zones (such as near dams) they must leave the danger area immediately or find shelter.|$|R
50|$|Photogravure is an {{intaglio}} printmaking or {{photo-mechanical process}} whereby a copper plate is {{coated with a}} light-sensitive gelatin tissue which {{had been exposed to}} a film positive, and then etched, resulting in a high quality intaglio print that can reproduce the detail and <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> of a photograph.|$|R

50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Viennese printer Karel Klíč {{introduced}} a combined intaglio and photographic process. Photogravure retained the smooth <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> of photography but was printed using a chemically-etched copper plate. This permitted a photographic image to be printed on regular paper, {{for inclusion in}} books or albums.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, the {{advantage}} of dye-sublimation printing has been {{the fact that it}} is a continuous-tone technology, where each dot can be any color. In contrast, inkjet printers can vary the location and size of ink droplets, a process called dithering, but each drop of ink is limited to the colors of the inks installed. Consequently, a dye-sublimation printer produces true <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> appearing much like a chemical photograph. An inkjet print is composed of droplets of ink layered and scattered to simulate <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> but under magnification the individual droplets can be seen. In the early days of inkjet printing, the large droplets and low resolution made inkjet prints significantly inferior to dye-sublimation, but some of today's inkjets produce extremely high quality prints using microscopic droplets and supplementary ink colors, producing superior color fidelity to dye-sublimation.|$|R
5000|$|As per NFPA 72, 18.4.2 (2010 Edition)Temporal Code 3 is the {{standard}} audible notification in a modern system.

40|$|Interspike {{interval}} histograms {{of spontaneous}} and stimulated activity were computed from spike discharges of single {{units in the}} cochlear nucleus. These histograms indicate {{that a number of}} different types of spontaneous discharge patterns exist in the nucleus. The type of spontaneous activity of a given unit is related to its activity in response to <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b> Correlations were found between the discharge patterns of units and their anatomical locations within the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} how judgments of perceived duration {{are influenced by}} the properties of the signals that define the intervals. Participants compared two auditory intervals that could be any combination of the following four types: intervals filled with <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> (filled intervals), intervals filled with regularly-timed short tones (isochronous intervals), intervals filled with irregularly-timed short tones (anisochronous intervals), and intervals demarcated by two short tones (empty intervals). Results indicate that the type of intervals to be compared affects discrimination performance and induces distortions in perceived duration. In particular, we find that duration judgments are most precise when comparing two isochronous and two continuous intervals, while the comparison of two anisochronous intervals leads to the worst performance. Moreover, we determined that the magnitude of the distortions in perceived duration (an effect akin to the filled duration illusion) is higher for tone sequences (no matter whether isochronous or anisochronous) than for <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b> Further analysis of how duration distortions depend on the type of filling suggests that distortions are not only due to the perceived duration of the two individual intervals, but they may also be due to the comparison of two different filling types...|$|R

We {{introduce}} a concept for a rehabilitation aid for blind persons that will present, on a sonic display, coarse optical information {{obtained from a}} spectacle-mounted camera. The aid will serve blind persons who have no light sense or who can at most detect ambient light.

40|$|Barn owls (Tyto alba) can use {{sound to}} catch prey in total darkness. Two barn owls {{were trained to}} strike {{protected}} loudspeakers emitting various artificial sounds. The accuracy of localization depended on the frequency, bandwidth, and temporal pattern of the test sound. <b>Continuous</b> pure <b>tones</b> of frequencies below 6 kHz and above 9 kHz were hard to localize. The accuracy improved as the frequency increased from 6 to 9 kHz. Within this range continuous sounds containing two frequencies were more accurately localized than either frequency alone. Sustained wide‐band noises always assured precise localization. The owls localized tone bursts more accurately than <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b> Whatever signals were used, accurate localization was {{largely due to the}} owls' ability to use the sounds for guiding the flight direction. The midcourse correction could occur during a flight lasting as short as 1 sec. When the signal was switched from one speaker to another after takeoff, the birds could strike the second speaker...|$|R
