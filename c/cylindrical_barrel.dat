5000|$|Gradually, rifles {{appeared}} with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>barrels</b> cut with helical grooves, the surfaces between the grooves being [...] "lands". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of breech-loading weapons, {{as it was}} not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which {{may have been a}} loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and, of course, loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.|$|R

40|$|Peaty clay {{obtained}} from the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway route was tested in the laboratory for its consolidation characteristics. The main objective was to quantify the improvement in peaty clay {{by the use of}} pre-fabricated vertical drains (PVD). Two large-scale model set-ups were erected to monitor the consolidation process of peaty clay, one without the use of PVD, and the other with the PVD installed. Both tests were conducted by depositing remoulded peaty clay in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>barrels,</b> and load was applied by several increments. Settlements and pore-water pressure were monitored over a long period. Axi-symmetric conditions were simulated by these tests. Based on the test results, the performance of PVD in accelerating the consolidation process is quantified. The model test results are back-analysed using the finite difference method, in order to give an indication of an appropriate numerical modeling process which can be used to model other instances of similar process. In addition, the effect of sample size and the duration of the load increment period on consolidation in peaty clay is investigated. Tests were carried out in three different sizes of specimen dimensions. Values of c, were calculated by several methods found in the literature, after carrying out tests using different load increment periods. Load increment periods for different sample thicknesses were calculated according to Terzaghi theory, for time simulation tests. The time necessary to obtain a specified degree of consolidation was calculated by an appropriate equation. The values of c, obtained by these methods are of the same order for the time simulation tests. The secondary compression index of the peaty clay is found to be very high. The improvement of shear strength in peaty clay due to consolidation is also investigated. Shear strength of peaty clay was measured at the end of laboratory tests and the results were compared with the strength of sample taken prior to consolidation. Soil strength after the treatment was evaluated by undrained triaxial tests, vane shear tests and consolidated drained triaxial tests. Soil strength before the treatment was evaluated only by vane shear tests as sample preparation with the soft soil was not possible. Gain in shear strength in peaty clay due to consolidation is quantified...|$|R

50|$|Barrels come in 3 basic shapes: Cylindrical, torpedo, or ton. Cylindrical barrels are {{the same}} {{diameter}} along their entire length and so tend to be long and thin.

This makes them fatter than a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>barrel</b> of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw. Torpedo shaped barrels are widest at the point end and taper towards the rear. This keeps the weight as far forward as possible but like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.|$|E

This mechanism consists of a hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>barrel</b> which is sealed at one end with the projectile and at the other with a long-handled plunger.

5000|$|A <b>cylindrical</b> cam or <b>barrel</b> cam is a cam {{in which}} the {{follower}} rides {{on the surface of}} a cylinder. In the most common type, the follower rides in a groove cut into the surface of a cylinder. These cams are principally used to convert rotational motion to linear motion parallel to the rotational axis of the cylinder. A cylinder may have several grooves cut into the surface and drive several followers. Cylindrical cams can provide motions that involve more than a single rotation of the cylinder and generally provide positive positioning, removing the need for a spring or other provision to keep the follower in contact with the control surface.|$|R
50|$|While {{standard}} rifle barrels taper from breech to muzzle, {{high precision}} rifles will often use a barrel with far less taper, called a heavy barrel, sometimes leaving the <b>barrel</b> <b>cylindrical</b> {{all the way}} to the muzzle, called a bull barrel. Either technique greatly increases the stiffness of the barrel by enlarging the average diameter, but this process adds significant weight as well. This can greatly increase the mass of the barrel, however; going from a lightweight sporter contour to a heavy barrel contour can double the mass, and a going to a bull barrel contour can more than triple it. Fluting, consisting of grooves machined in the outer surface of the barrel to remove material, can reduce the weight and improve heat dispersion while maintaining most of the stiffness.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground: The {{centriole}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} enigmatic organelles in the cell. Centrioles are <b>cylindrical,</b> microtubule-based <b>barrels</b> found in the core of the centrosome. Centrioles also act as basal bodies during interphase to nucleate the assembly of cilia and flagella. There are currently only a handful of known centriole proteins. Results: We used mass-spectrometry-based MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) to identify the protein composition of basal bodies (centrioles) isolated from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This analysis detected the majority of known centriole proteins, including centrin, epsilon tubulin, and the cartwheel protein BLD 10 p. By combining proteomic data with information about gene expression and comparative genomics, we identified 45 cross-validated centriole candidate proteins in two classes. Members of the first class of proteins (BUG 1 –BUG 27) are encoded by genes whose expression correlates with flagellar assembly and which therefore may play a role in ciliogenesis-related functions of basal bodies. Members of the second class (POC 1 –POC 18) are implicated by comparative-genomics and -proteomics studies to be conserved components of the centriole. We confirmed centriolar localization for the human homologs of four candidate proteins. Three of the cross-validated centriole candidate proteins are encoded by orthologs of genes (OFD 1, NPHP- 4, and PACRG) implicated in mammalian ciliary function and disease, suggesting that oral-facial-digital syndrome and nephronophthisis may involve a dysfunction of centrioles and/or basal bodies. Conclusions: By analyzing isolated Chlamydomonas basal bodies, we have been able to obtain the first reported proteomic analysis of the centriole...|$|R
