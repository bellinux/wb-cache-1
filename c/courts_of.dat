These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States <b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the <b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the <b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> Appeals were made in his second.|$|E

Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law.
