5000|$|To {{resolve the}} {{conflicting}} interpretations, Van Antwerpen {{began with the}} plain meaning of CAFRA. <b>Criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> is not permitted unless (1) a substantive provision exists for civil forfeiture of the criminal proceeds at issue; and (2) there is no specific statutory provision that permits <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> of such proceeds. Thus, we read the statute ... permitting <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> when no <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> provision applies to the crime charged against a particular defendant but civil forfeiture for that charged crime is nonetheless authorized. In Croce, Dalzell had said it was [...] "highly unlikely that, in passing the broad language of CAFRA, Congress intended to silently remove the limitations on <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> in mail fraud cases." [...] While that [...] "presents a plausible construction of the statute, we are not persuaded," [...] Van Antwerpen commented. CAFRA stated that [...] "a forfeiture is authorized {{in connection with a}} violation of an Act of Congress" ...|$|E

50|$|The judge {{sentence}}d Banks to {{five years}} in prison, varying the sentence upward by three months from the maximum range specified by the sentencing guidelines. An in personam <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> judgment was also entered against him. Banks appealed to the Third Circuit, citing those among seven possible grounds for reversing the conviction. Foremost among them, he argued that notice of the possibility of variance was required prior to the sentencing and that the district court lacked the statutory authority to order the <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{text of the}} {{statutes}} may have been ambiguous when read by themselves, allowing for Dalzell's Croce interpretation. But Van Antwerpen believed the statute's legislative history justified the court's more expansive reading in the [...] case. A House committee's report on the bill had explicitly stated that its goal was [...] "to extend proceeds forfeiture (both civil and criminal) to the crimes enumerated in the money laundering statute." [...] Congress had also removed the language restricting <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> to mail and wire frauds affecting financial institutions {{from the list of}} crimes for which forfeiture was authorized, he noted. [...] "In our view, Van Antwerpen concluded, [...] "Congress's expansion of the crimes for which civil forfeiture is available taken in conjunction with its decision to enact legislation which broadened the range of crimes for which <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> was available, can only be viewed as intent to make <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> essentially coextensive with civil forfeiture." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{journalist}} Sarah Stillman, a major {{turning point}} in forfeiture activity was {{the passage of the}} Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. This law permitted local and federal law enforcement agencies to divvy up the seized assets and cash. Civil forfeiture allowed federal and local governments to [...] "extract swift penalties from white-collar criminals and offer restitution to victims of fraud", according to Stillman. From 1985 to 1993, authorities confiscated $3 billion of cash and other property based on the federal Asset Forfeiture Program which included both civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeitures.</b> The methods were supported by the Reagan administration as a crime fighting strategy.|$|R

5000|$|The federal {{mail fraud}} statute {{authorized}} civil forfeiture as a punishment for any conviction, and criminal in personam forfeiture for [...] "special circumstances" [...] frauds that victimized a financial institution. As {{part of the}} Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), Congress had added language allowing federal prosecutors to request, upon presentment of the indictment or information bringing the charges, <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> for any crime punishable by civil forfeiture where <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> was not specifically authorized. The government had done so in this case, but Banks argued that the [...] "special circumstances" [...] provisions of the mail fraud statute controlled, barring it from having that request granted where the fraudulent scheme had not victimized a financial institution.|$|E

50|$|The {{tests to}} {{establish}} {{the burden of proof}} are different; in civil forfeiture, the test in most cases is whether police feel there is a preponderance of the evidence suggesting wrongdoing; in <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture,</b> the test is whether police feel the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a tougher test to meet.|$|E
50|$|On March 29, 2007, the dispensary was raided by {{the local}} Sheriff Pat Hedges in {{cooperation}} with the DEA (DEA).

5000|$|Prosecutors choose civil {{forfeiture}} {{not because of}} the standard of proof, but because it is often the only way to confiscate the instrumentalities of crime. The alternative, <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture,</b> requires a criminal trial and a conviction. Without {{civil forfeiture}}, we could not confiscate the assets of drug cartels whose leaders remain beyond the reach of United States extradition laws and who cannot be brought to trial. Moreover, <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeiture</b> reaches only a defendant's own property. Without civil forfeiture, an airplane used to smuggle drugs could not be seized, even if the pilot was arrested, because the pilot invariably is not the owner of the plane.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the timely and controversial topic of constitutional limits on punitive damages and brings a criminal punishment theory perspective {{to the analysis}} of this issue. The question of how to determine when punishment is unconstitutionally excessive has been and continues to be a subject of intense debate in the courts and scholarly circles. The United States Supreme Court has subjected <b>criminal</b> sanctions, <b>criminal</b> <b>forfeitures,</b> and punitive damages to a proportionality requirement, but the Court uses different approaches to the proportionality analysis {{depending on the type of}} punishment. In the criminal context, the Court has retreated in large part from proportionality review, deferring to legislative maxima for criminal sentences. By contrast, where there is no legislative cap on the punitive damages a jury can award, the Court has undertaken a more active role in determining the proportionality of punitive damages. Similarly, where there is no legislative limit to the amount of property that can be forfeited, the Court has engaged in a more active proportionality review. An analysis of the Supreme Court's different proportionality reviews demonstrates that the different approaches are explained by the presence or absence of legislative limits on punishment. This Article examines the nature of punishment and the requirements for just punishment-notice, proportionality, and limits-and applies these principles to punitive damages. It concludes that a system that imposes no limits on the amount of punitive damages awards contravenes the principle of notice and leaves courts with little guidance in assessing the excessiveness of particular awards. To bring punitive damages into conformity with the principles of just punishment and to provide courts with a benchmark for evaluating the proportionality of punitive damages awards, the Article concludes with proposals for legislative limits on such awards. Because of the importance of limits on punishment, including punitive damages, this Article suggests how states can impose caps on punitive damages awards that serve the policy interests of punishing and deterring wrongful and harmful conduct, and how states can use caps to justify large awards in appropriate cases that will survive excessiveness challenges...|$|R

5000|$|In civil cases, {{the owner}} {{need not be}} judged guilty of any crime; it is {{possible}} for the Government to prevail by proving that someone other than the owner used the property to commit a crime (this claim seems outdated and as such would be contradicted by the [...] "innocent owner" [...] defense).

50|$|Civil {{procedure}} cases generally involve {{disputes between}} two private citizens, often about money or property, while criminal procedure involves a dispute between {{a private citizen}} and the state, usually because a law has been broken.

40|$|The {{deprivation}} {{of the proceeds}} of crime has been a feature of criminal law for many years.

The primary objective {{of this article is to}} determine if the asset forfeiture measures employed in the South African criminal justice system are in need of any reform and/or augmentation in accordance with the "spirit, purport and object" of the South African Constitution.
