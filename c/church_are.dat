50|$|The present <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} <b>church</b> to <b>be</b> built at this site. The first <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church</b> and it <b>is</b> first written about in {{historical}} records in 1306.

The fourth (and present) <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1863.|$|R
50|$|St John the Baptist <b>Church.</b> This <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1720, {{at the same}} time that the St. Nicholas <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built, {{although}} the difference between the types of architecture of the two <b>churches</b> <b>is</b> quite remarkable. Whereas the St. Nicholas <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> all wooden, the St. John <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> made out of white plastered walls with wooden supports.|$|R
5000|$|The Church of the Epiphany <b>is</b> Lauren’s oldest <b>church</b> {{building}} still operating. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed in}} 1846. [...] The First United Methodist Church represents Romanesque Revival architecture. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1897. In 1834, the First Baptist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> originally built. The {{name of the}} original <b>church</b> <b>was</b> Laurensville Baptist <b>Church.</b> In 1850, the first sanctuary was built. In 1893, the second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> constructed. The present sanctuary was built in 1958. The First Presbyterian <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized on April 1, 1832, but the present <b>church</b> structure <b>was</b> built in 1891. The first preacher of the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> Samuel B. Lewers. He served the church for eighteen years. The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> built {{in the style of}} Victorian Gothic Revival architecture.|$|R
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>are</b> examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, {{there are}} {{original}} century-old images and church ornaments. Adjoining the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> a convent, sacristy, adoration room/chapel, and an ecclesiastical museum {{in honor of}} the Our Lady of Turumba. The museum contains clothes, perfumes, jewelry, and other historic memorabilia. The original oil painting, found by fishermen, can also be found inside the chapel.|$|E

50|$|This <b>church</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} <b>church</b> on this site. The first known <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church</b> from the 13th century. A second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built around the}} year 1600, and the third (and present) <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1868.|$|R
50|$|The white, wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1866 {{to replace the}} old Sauda <b>Church</b> which <b>was</b> located in the nearby village of Saudasjøen (the old <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down after this <b>church</b> <b>was</b> completed). The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built using designs by the famous church {{architect}} Hans Linstow. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 26 September 1866 by the parish priest P. R.

50|$|In 1670, {{the first}} Kaarli <b>Church</b> (Charles's <b>Church)</b> <b>was</b> built here, {{named after the}} Swedish king Charles XI. The wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> for Estonians and local Finns. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> burned down during the Great Northern War in August 1710. The {{short-lived}} second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in the 19th century, but was torn down when the third Kaarli <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1870.|$|R
5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} six Commonwealth war graves: in {{the east}} part of the ground are buried two British Army soldiers of World War I and north-north-west of the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> buried three soldiers and an airman of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} <b>church</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model {{which had been}} established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer walls}} of the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> {{constructed}} of red sandstone with grey ashlar dressings; the roofs are slate. The church plan consists of a nave, with a square tower {{to the west and}} a chancel and apsidal sanctuary to the east. There is a clergy vestry at the south-east corner of the building.|$|E
50|$|The first Austevoll <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} the middle ages on the small island of Sandtorv. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down and moved to Austevollshella on the island of Hundvåko in the 1650s. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> in use for over 200 years. In 1891, the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> torn down and a new church (the present <b>church)</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt on the nearby island of Huftarøy in the village of Storebø.

50|$|A new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built on}} the same site to replace the old <b>church.</b> This <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1726 {{and it was a}} timber framed <b>church.</b> That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> used until 1888 when it too was torn down {{to make room for the}} present <b>church</b> which <b>is</b> much larger. The present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1888 by the architects Solheim and Tengesdal. The white, wooden <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 18 July 1888.|$|R
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman <b>church</b> <b>are</b> of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic <b>church</b> <b>are</b> generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E
5|$|The red {{sandstone}} {{building is}} faced with grey ashlar and consists of a nave, chancel, square tower and a Norman-style apse. Its furnishings include a Georgian staircase, a Jacobean pulpit, box pews and hatchments. There are eight bells in the tower. Outside the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> {{the remains of a}} stone preaching cross.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} Anglican churches in Shrewsbury. Methodists, Baptists and the United Reformed <b>Church</b> <b>are</b> also represented, {{alongside}} newer church groups including Elim Pentecostal and Newfrontiers. Shrewsbury Evangelical Church meets {{in the former}} Anglican parish church of St Julian at the Wyle Cop end of Fish Street. Shrewsbury's first non-Christian place of worship, a Muslim centre, was approved in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The stave <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{demolished}} in 1710, and {{a wooden}} cruciform <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built on the}} site.

50|$|The first <b>church</b> at Skånevik <b>was</b> {{built before}} 1340. That <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church,</b> and <b>was</b> in use until 1683 {{when it was}} {{demolished}} and replaced by a timber-framed church built by Olle Bysemb and Erich Fyllingsnes. In 1900 the second <b>church</b> <b>was</b> demolished after a new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built a close by. The third <b>church</b> <b>is</b> still in use.|$|R
5000|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>churches</b> on {{this site}} for many centuries. There {{were at least}} three known churches on the site before the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> constructed. The first known <b>church</b> <b>was</b> a stave <b>church</b> that little <b>is</b> known about. The second known church {{replaced}} the previous church and that existed until the 1700s when it burned down due to a lightning strike. The third <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built to replace that one and it lasted until 1896 when it was torn down after a new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built. The previous <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> all located closer {{to the village of}} Roald. The present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> constructed in 1894, a little closer {{to the center of the}} island. The cornerstone of the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> laid on 7 October 1892 and the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on 24 January 1894 by the Bishop Waldemar Hvoslef.

A wrought-iron gilded chancel screen built by William Edney in 1710 still stands under the tower.|$|E
5|$|At {{the top of}} this {{organizational}} {{framework is}} the biennial General Council, the highest governing body of the Assemblies of God. All ordained and licensed ministers and one delegate per Assembly of God <b>church</b> <b>are</b> entitled to attend and participate at the General Council. The size of General Council is not static but fluctuating, changing from year to year as there is no requirement that pastors attend or that churches send delegates. In general, however, there are over 3,000 voting members.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> bronze plaques {{commemorating the}} eleven local {{people who died}} in World War I and the six {{who were killed in}} World War II. There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword {{standing}} on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> {{established}} in Laconia. The Laconia Presbyterian <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized in 1874 and {{met in the}} town hall and private homes until 1880, when the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built on Cross St. The Laconia Methodist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized in 1842. The minister traveled from Mauckport, about seven miles to the southwest, to conduct services. The present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1874 on Main St.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a {{cruciform}} basilica with {{a western}} tower. The original <b>church</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in 1467 by Burgundian troops. A new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built and subsequently devastated by fire in 1584 during the Eighty Years' War. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1592. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> again destroyed in 1654, {{this time by}} Lorraine troops. [...] The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and deacon Adriaen Wuestenraed {{played a major role}} in this reconstruction. In 1695 the church and the interior were completed. The interior was executed in Baroque style.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built later. A frame Methodist <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1860 {{and the first}} Presbyterian <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in c.1864.

5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the <b>church</b> <b>are</b> monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades. These restrictions {{do not apply to}} recreational activities, where wearing bathing suits is permitted. Women wear a head covering during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the <b>Church</b> <b>are</b> considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{associates}} of the Church include Mark Mothersbaugh, Mojo Nixon, Paul Mavrides, Paul Reubens, members of Negativland, David Byrne, and R.Crumb. Crumb, a cartoonist, provided early publicity {{for the church}} by reprinting Sub Genius Pamphlet #1 in his comics anthology Weirdo. References to the <b>Church</b> <b>are</b> present in several works of art, including the Internet-based collaborative fiction Ong's Hat, the comic book The Middleman, the band Sublime's album 40oz. to Freedom, and the television program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E
