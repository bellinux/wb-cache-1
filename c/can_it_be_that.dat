500|$|The Chinese {{had long}} taken an {{interest}} in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, [...] "When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how <b>can</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?" [...] Shen maintained that the larynx {{was the beginning of}} a system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach. Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three. [...] Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.|$|E

[...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else <b>can</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances.
