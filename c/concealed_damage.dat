We conducted a number of surveys on damaged wooden wall specimens in laboratory. The experiment results indicate that the high-frequency radar waves can penetrate the wooden walls. Deformations of wooden structures (about 2 cm displacement) inside the wall, as well as the concealed small metal nails (about 3 mm in diameter and less than 2 cm in length) and bolts can be clearly imaged.

40|$|A {{technique}} is developed to model instrumented buildings with a second-generation performance-based earthquake engineering approach, producing a damage and loss estimate {{shortly after the}} cessation of strong motion. It estimates the likely locations of <b>damage</b> (including <b>concealed</b> structural <b>damage),</b> potentially saving the owner time and money by focusing post-earthquake safety and repair inspections. It provides a rapid estimate of repair costs, allowing the owner quickly to apply for recovery funds or an insurance claim. The method uses basement accelerograms, a stochastic structural model, and nonlinear time-history structural analysis to estimate probabilistic engineering demands (structural response). Structural response is input to fragility functions for each damageable assembly to estimate probabilistic physical damage on a component-by-component basis. Probabilistic repair costs for each assembly are calculated and summed, and contractor overhead and profit are added to produce a probability distribution of total repair cost. A simple Bayesian-updating technique employs upper-story accelerograms to refine the stochastic structural model. It is found in application that using the upper-story accelerograms produces only a modest change in the distributions of damage and repair cost, {{because most of the}} uncertainty in repair cost results from the uncertainty in the fragility functions and cost distributions, not from uncertainty in the structural model...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{wireless}} conversational and broadcasting multimedia applications offer particular transmission {{challenges as}} reliable content delivery cannot be guaranteed. The undelivered and erroneous content causes significant degradation in quality of experience. The H. 264 /AVC standard includes several error resilient tools to mitigate this effect on video quality. However, the methods {{implemented by the}} standard {{are based on a}} packet-loss scenario, where corrupted slices are dropped and the lost information <b>concealed.</b> Partially <b>damaged</b> slices still contain valuable information {{that can be used to}} enhance the quality of the recovered video. This study presents a novel error recovery solution that relies on a joint source-channel decoder to recover only feasible slices. A major advantage of this decoder-based strategy is that it grants additional robustness while keeping the same transmission data rate. Simulation results show that the proposed approach manages to completely recover 30. 79 % of the corrupted slices. This provides frame-by-frame peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gains of up to 18. 1 %dB, a result which, to the knowledge of the authors, is superior to all other joint source-channel decoding methods found in literature. Furthermore, this error resilient strategy can be combined with other error resilient tools adopted by the standard to enhance their performance. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Macadamia nuts (‘nuts-in-shell’) are {{subjected}} to many impacts from dropping during postharvest handling, resulting in damage to the raw kernel. The effect of dropping on roasted kernel quality is unknown. Macadamia nuts-in-shell were dropped in various combinations of moisture content, number of drops and receiving surface in three experiments. After dropping, samples from each treatment and undropped controls were dry oven-roasted for 20 min at 130 ◦C, and kernels were assessed for colour, mottled colour and surface damage. RESULTS: Dropping nuts-in-shell onto a bed of nuts-in-shell at 3 % moisture content or 20 % moisture content increased the percentage of dark roasted kernels. Kernels from nuts dropped first at 20 %, then 10 % moisture content, onto a metal plate had increased mottled colour. Dropping nuts-in-shell at 3 % moisture content onto nuts-in-shell significantly increased surface damage. Similarly, surface damage increased for kernels dropped onto a metal plate at 20 %, then at 10 % moisture content. CONCLUSION: Postharvest dropping of macadamia nuts-in-shell causes <b>concealed</b> cellular <b>damage</b> to kernels, the effects not evident until roasting.

40|$|Based on interviews, {{the purpose}} of the article is to study how Roma and Jews {{experience}} every- day violations and hate crime and how the victims deal with this exposure. The victims’ narratives are analysed using, for example, theories and research on anti-Semitism, anti-Ziganism, everyday racism and power relations. During the post-war period Jews have largely been seen by the majo- rity population as belonging to the white ”Swedishness”, while the Roma belong to one of many deeply despised minorities that often are exposed to everyday violations and hate crime. However, there is anti-Semitism in Sweden that in certain situations and circumstances is explicitly expres- sed in the form of abuse, threats or violence. The article describes and analyses how the victims of hate crime deal with this exposure and how the crimes affect them. Some Roma and Jews ”are forced” to live a kind of double life because they are afraid of being ”exposed” as a Roma or a Jew. For example, Jewish and Roma symbols are often spontaneously <b>concealed.</b> The <b>damage</b> that hate crime causes is spread beyond the individual to the victim’s entire group, a form of ”message crimes”. The consequences for the individual concerned can be very serious. Roma and Jewish groups as a whole can also be affected by the restrictions imposed on their lives...|$|R

Current codes and standards assess fire performance of exterior wall assemblies subjected to external ignition sources. However, test methods do not address the potential fire hazard resulting from ignition of combustible insulation within the wall cavity. A fire performance test has been developed that evaluates the fire propagation behavior of combustible insulation in a configuration that is representative of the actual installation. The test utilizes a full scale cavity wall assembly and offers fire performance evaluation of insulation of any thickness for either a 51 [*]mm or 102 [*]mm wide air space. A propane sand burner was selected as the ignition source; in addition to being reliable and repeatable, its heat output was carefully calibrated to be representative of potential ignition scenarios that may occur within a cavity wall.

An acceptable sample will produce a peak chemical heat release rate less than 100 [*]kW and a maximum visible flame height less than 1. 8 [*]m.

40|$|The {{compression}} {{of space and}} time that accompanies cultural evolution is being accelerated by digital communications technology. The rapid transmission of information and computer-mediated communication are key factors in economic and geopolitical development. Networks such as the Internet are now able to handle images, sounds, texts and virtual objects. These can be stored, reproduced, combined and distributed. This digital miscegenation creates a virtual, recombinant culture that signifies how human society is evolving in the postmodern era. In universities, the Internet is already an important medium of communication, a way of enhancing access to educational resources and a means of creating interactive communities of learning. This will not merely enhance educational practice as it is now. Like technological developments before them, it will also change our view of what education is, or needs to be. This, in turn, will influence the values and the sensitivities that are implicitly transmitted in the educational process. Over and above its practical effects on education, the Internet is bound up in wider geopolitical movements and pressures. As a backdrop to considering the Internet as a medium for education, this article considers some of these geopolitical movements. The conclusion will be that the often rosy image created by advocates of digital communications technology may need balancing by consideration of some darker possibilities. As a matter of social geography, it enhances uniformity, urban concentration and the commodification of cultural practices, including education. Two themes are considered here. On the one hand, following the more optimistic views of educationalists, such as Illich and Wells, there is the hope that the Internet will act as a liberating, democratizing force that will make knowledge more freely and widely available. On the other hand, following the more pessimistic concerns of geographers and cultural theorists, such as Harvey and Baudrillard, there is the fear that the Internet will accelerate the loss of cultural diversity and will help to <b>conceal</b> the <b>damage</b> that technology is inflicting on the cultural and on the natural environment.

50|$|The Synod of Zamość, 1720, {{tried to}} move the Eastern churches united with Rome closer to the Latin Rite. The {{decisions}} of the synod forbade a number of Eastern traditions, including the erection of an iconostasis in Greek Catholic churches. Smaller altarpieces were suggested instead.

40|$|This thesis {{suggests}} a cultural logic of financialisation {{in terms of}} (re) presentation of information and (re) configuration of temporality, {{both of which are}} critically undertaken and regulated by financial narrative. This narrative functions, following Bourdieu, as “the sign of wealth” in our times. It is time for cultural theorists and activists to approach finance as a set of epistemic cultural processes beyond the economic, which modulates epistemological and ontological contexts, affecting actors’ cognition and behavior in value production and realisation. Financialisation is supported and maintained by narrative intervention in valorising the onto-phenomenological level of the economic. From this perspective, financialisation is suggested as a disinformation campaign, through which the cognitive dissonance of the financial mechanism is effectively contained, <b>concealing</b> its <b>damaging</b> effects and thus valorising the financial mechanism. It implements an intensification of the transactional orientation as the legitimate mode of value production and circulation. Sustaining and amplifying the transactional orientation of investment banking among the actors in the financial markets, the financial system conceals cognitive dissonance through its operativity of information. It works towards {{the construction of a new}} financial reality, stimulating belief and guiding action⎯without which financial integrity, credit relations, and transactional orientation could not be sustained. Observing the contemporary culture-finance relationship from the perspective of value politics under financial capitalism, this thesis analyses specific aspects of homology between culture and finance from the perspective of the cultural logic of financial narrative. This is seen as a frame of value transference and a device of activation as well as of domination. Exploring the possibilities of a cultural theory of value, this project, first of all, focuses upon the question of value and the actual process of value formation associated with operativity and performativity of narrative. Narrative is analysed as the cognitive operation constitutive of financial narrative politics for value transference in the discourse of financial crisis, which has been, as this thesis upholds and examines, systematically operated throughout the Korean financial crisis. It mainly revisits the value theories and narrative analyses of Simmel, Marx, Ricoeur, Jameson, and Genette to articulate an economic theory of value in the cultural politics of narrative. Following Ricoeur, it sees this as a mechanism of value transference, and it is here correlated with the financial doctrine of entanglement and contagion. Through a narrative, wherein utterances and statements around a primal event, or crisis, perform as the collective operativity of information, a value is constructed and transferred to inform and motivate actors. Narrative structure, from which the nexuses of intentionalities of the financial system are formulated and transmitted, is proposed as a meta-frame of cultural valorisation. It valorises economic value for the (re) production of dominant financial value, without which any unprecedented application of ‘methodology,’ such as a ‘shock doctrine,’ of economic prescription cannot be legitimised and extrapolated. This project begins with the argument in Chapter 2 that narrative exploits uncertainty as a resource for performativity, and thus necessitates a new standard, thereby regulating and activating heterogeneous actors in the markets. A financial crisis is the crucial point of narrativity in the constitution of a legitimate guiding structure, exploiting uncertainty in order to manage risk⎯ thus producing a narrative as a frame of self-reference. The narrative identifies the new main value by effectively performing the uncertainty of a financial crisis. In this regard, the chapter proposes that the necessity of negating (or guaranteeing) the fundamental contradiction, or “the self-abolishing contradiction,” bolstered by the sheer size of the entanglement and contagion in finance capitalism, is authenticated and initiated by a preliminary cultural operation of a discursive approach to the crisis. The discourse is not a randomly disseminated rhetoric, but is presented as a narrative in which temporal reconfiguration and sequences of action are carefully guided to represent the main event as a source of cognition and action for contextual control; a certain sequence of events is thereby thematised and anticipated through the interpretation of the event in question, with clear intentions by the main financial narrator. Narrative opens a performative field of objectification in which the power relationship between the main narrator and the object, the narratee, is established and coordinated. The narrative emphasis in a collapse, for instance, one that is yet to come, grounds the operativity and performativity through which actors are informed and motivated, while implementing and legitimising the necessary official description. Articulating the intentions of the system, and its employment of capitalistically reconfigured temporality, as well as its representation of information into narrative, Chapter 3 suggests that narrative is the objectifying field of value and value-transference, in which the textuality of everyday narrative is produced to direct actors as the ushering force of the main value. Proposing value as a guiding force of cognition and action, the chapter closely inquires into the value-forming process, arguing that narrative process is an inevitabl...|$|R
