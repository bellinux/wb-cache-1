In this article, {{we report}} the {{fabrication}} of novel poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) nanocomposites based on PLLA and magnesium-aluminium layered double hydroxides (MgAl-LDH) which were mixed the polylactide with <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> (PLA-COOH) in acetone. Both the X-ray diffraction data and {{transmission electron microscopy}} images of the PLLA/LDH nanocomposites indicate {{that most of the}} LDH layers were disorderly exfoliated into the PLLA matrix. The thermal degradation behaviors of PLLA and its nanocomposites were studied using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at heating rates from 5 to 40 °C/min. The TGA profiles of the PLLA/LDH nanocomposites show less thermal stability than that of neat PLLA due to the presence of Mg and Al which has a drastic influence on thermal stability of PLLA. The activation energy of PLLA, 1 wt% and 3 wt % PLLA/LDH nanocomposites were 158, 140 and 130 kJ/mol, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{vapor phase}} {{peroxide}} test {{was developed and}} compared to aqueous Fenton’s test and to in-situ fuel cell operation. FTIR {{was used to examine}} the ratio of carboxyl created by degradation to a CF 2 overtone band. A mechanism for attack of the PFSA ionomer in fuel cells is suggested. Background It is well known that perfluorinated ionomers degrade in fuel cells over time evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride and sulfuric acid. Some investigators have also shown the presence of small fluorinated fragments (1). The exact mechanism has been the source of much speculation and experimentation over the years (2). Initially it was thought that hydrogen peroxide was formed either in the membrane or at a catalyst site and that peroxide derived free radicals attacked the carboxyl end groups on the ionomer chain. The degradation of the carboxyl yields carbon dioxide and a mechanism can be written which shows further degradation via radicals causing the formation of HF and regenerating a new <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> (3). This process can repeat until the ionome...|$|E
40|$|Recycling and reusing of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabrics waste are {{essential}} for reducing serious waste of resources and environmental pollution caused by low utilization rate. The liquid-phase polymerization method has advantages of short process flow, low energy consumption, and low production cost. However, unlike prepolymer, the material characteristics of PET fabrics waste (complex composition, high intrinsic viscosity, and large quality fluctuations) make its recycling a technique challenge. In this study, the falling film-rotating disk combined reactor is proposed, and the continuous liquid-phase polymerization is modeled by optimizing and correcting existing models for {{the final stage of}} PET polymerization to improve the product quality in plant production. Through modeling and simulation, the weight analysis of indexes closely related to the product quality (intrinsic viscosity, <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> concentration, and diethylene glycol content) was investigated to optimize the production process in order to obtain the desired polymer properties and meet specific product material characteristics. The model could be applied to other PET wastes (e. g., bottles and films) and extended to investigate different aspects of the recycling process...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} addn. -fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) polymn. technique has been employed to synthesize linear a,w -telechelic polymers with either hydroxyl or <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> Me methacrylate, Bu methacrylate, and Bu acrylate were polymd. with RAFT polymn. The polymns. exhibited the usual characteristics of living processes. Telechelic polymethacrylates {{were obtained from}} a hydroxyl monofunctional RAFT polymer with a two-step chain-end modification procedure of the dithioester <b>end</b> <b>group.</b> The procedure consisted of an aminolysis followed by a Michael addn. on the resulting thiol. The different steps of the procedure were followed by detailed anal. It was found that this route was always accompanied by side reactions, resulting in disulfides and hydrogen-terminated polymer chains as side products next to the hydroxyl-terminated telechelic polymers. Telechelic poly(Bu acrylates) with <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were produced in a single step procedure with difunctional trithiocarbonates as RAFT agents.

The effect of the epoxy chain extender on the flowability and mechanical properties of PET was investigated. The melt flow index (MFI) of the chain-extended PET dramatically decreased as the diepoxy was added to the PET. The impact strength and elongation-at-break of the chain-extended PET also increased as MFI of PET decreased.

40|$|Isolated {{purified}} contractile tail sheaths of bacteriophage T 2 L {{were analyzed}} for their carboxyl terminal amino acids by carboxypeptidase treatment and hydrazinolysis. Glycine and serine {{were identified as}} the only two <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> Using corrections for the yields of these two amino acids upon hydrazinolysis, we calculated that there are 154 (± 30) moles of C-terminal glycine and 130 (± 45) moles of C-terminal serine per mole of sheath. It appears likely that sheaths contain two types of polypeptide chains in equal numbers, probably 144 of each.

40|$|Copoly(ethylene terephthalate-imide) s (PETI) were {{prepared}} by melt polycondensation of bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and imide containing oligomer, i. e., 4, 4 '-bis[(4 -carbo- 2 -hydroxyethoxy) phthalimido]diphenylmethane (BHEI). The apparent rate of polycondensation reaction was faster {{than that of}} homo poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) due {{to the presence of}} imide units. The PETI copolymers with up to 10 mol % of BHEI unit in the copolymer showed about the same molecular weight and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> content as homo PET prepared under similar reaction conditions. The increase in T-g of copolymer was more dependent on molar substitution of BHEI than on substitution of BHEN, reaching 91 degrees C with 8 mol % BHEI units in the copolymer from T-g = 78. 9 degrees C of homo PET. In the case of PETN copolymer, 32 mol % of bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) naphthalate (BHEN) units gave T-g of 90 degrees C. The maximum decomposition temperature of PETI copolymer was about {{the same as that of}} homo PET by TGA analysis. The char yield at 800 degrees C was higher than that of homo PET.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{preparation}} and physical properties of biodegradable nanocomposites fabricated using poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and magnesium/aluminum layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDH). The MgAl-LDH with molar ratio of Mg/Al = 2 were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. In {{order to improve}} the chemical compatibility between PLLA and LDH, the surface of LDH was organically-modified by polylactide with <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> (PLA-COOH) using ion-exchange process. Then, the PLLA/LDH nanocomposites were prepared by solution intercalation of PLLA into the galleries of PLA-COOH modified LDH (P-LDH) in tetrahydrofuran solution. Both X-ray diffraction data and Transmission electron microscopy images of PLLA/P-LDH namocomposites indicate that the P-LDHs are randomly dispersed and exfoliated into the PLLA matrix. Mechanical properties of the fabricated 1. 2 wt. % PLLA/P-LDH nanocomposites show significant enhancements in the storage modulus when {{compared to that of}} neat PLLA. Adding more P-LDH into PLLA matrix induced a decrease in the storage modulus of PLLA/P-LDH nanocomposites, probably due to the excessive content of PLA-COOH moleculars with low mechanical properties. The thermal stability and degradation activation energies of the PLLA and PLLA/P-LDH nanocomposites can also be discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{geosynthetic}} products {{has been}} steadily increasing {{in the construction of}} structures such as retaining walls, steepened slopes, and landfills for the containment of hazardous waste. The lack of information on durability has limited the full utilization of geosynthetics. To assess the durability of polyester (PET) geosynthet-ics, an accelerated testing protocol was developed and a test program implemented. The test results indicated that low-tenacity PET commercial geosynthetic products were more susceptible to hydrolytic degradation than high-tenacity geosynthetics due to lower molecular weight and a high number of <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> (CEG). Tests con-ducted in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions exhibited the same trends...|$|R

30|$|Waltz et al. {{used the}} conductometric {{titration}} {{to calculate the}} amount of amine end-group in nylon 66 (polyhexamethylene adipamide). The pre-treatment of the sample under study, consisted of dissolving the polymer using purified phenol and shaking the system. Then 95 % ethanol and distilled water were added. After that, conductometric titration was carried out using, 0.1  N hydrochloric acid and slow stirring. As phenol {{was not a good}} solvent for the determination of the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> because after equivalent point, it reacts with the base, the benzyl alcohol is used instead. Even though the conductance found was lower than that expected for the solvent previously used (phenol–ethanol–water) and the cut point of the two straight lines was not so sharp, the results obtained by conductometric titration were in agreement with the ones obtained by titration using an indicator [7]. In this research work to analyze the amine and carboxyl end-group is necessary to dissolve the sample of polymer under study, which considerably increases the time needed for the determination. Another important statement presented, is to find the correct solvent or mixture of solvents that do not incorporate an error in the interpretation of the results obtained.|$|R

A Haake mixer 600 was used to record the torque during the chain extension reaction.

Shear rate also had some effects on the reaction rate. The effect of the diepoxy chain extender on the flowability, thermal stability, and mechanical properties of PBT were investigated. The melt flow index (MFI) of the chain-extended PBT dramatically decreased as the diepoxy was added to PBT. In addition, the notched Izod impact strength and elongation-at-break of the chain-extended PBT also increased. The chain-extended PBT is more stable thermally.

40|$|To date, surface {{structuring}} of metallic implants {{for use in}} {{load bearing}} bone implantation focuses on the coating of their surface with hydroxyapatite (HA) through plasma spraying. Despite the inherent disadvantages of this method, research on alternative coating techniques {{has been slow to}} yield suitable results, mostly {{due to the lack of}} surface tailoring for efficient osseointegration coupled with inefficient coating adhesion to the implant surface. Through the presented work we provide a new route for the formation of nanostructured functional coatings of HA onto titanium implant surfaces employing amino acids to not only potentially induce osteogenic cell activity, but to aid the attachment of HA onto the titanium surface. Briefly, crystalline, partially carbonated HA nanoparticles were synthesised through a novel sol-gel route employing CaCl 2 and Na 2 HPO 4 as precursors and L-arginine or L-lysine to facilitate nanoparticle formation and gellation and to control the viscosity of the slurries. The grafted amino acids were in turn used to attach the HA coating through covalent interactions between the amino acid <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> and the TiOH groups on the titanium surface.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of some thermoplastic elastomers grafted with maleic anhydride (MA) or with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) as compatibilizer precursors (CPs) for blends of {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) with polyamide- 6 (PA) has been studied. The CPs were produced by grafting different amounts of MA or GMA onto a styrene-block- (ethylene-co- 1 -butene) -block-styrene copolymer (SEBS) (KRATON G 1652), either in the melt or in solution. A commercially available SEBS-g-MA copolymer with 1. 7 wt% MA (KRATON FG 1901 X) was also used. The effect of the MA concentration and of other characteristics of the SEBSg- MA CPs was also studied. The specific interactions between the CPs and the blends components were investigated through characterizations of the binary LDPE/CP and PA/CP blends, in the whole composition range. It was demonstrated that the SEBS-g-GMA copolymers display poor compatibilizing effectiveness due to cross-linking resulting from reactions of the epoxy rings of these CPs with both the amine and the <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of PA. On the contrary, the compatibilizing efficiency of the MA-grafted elastomers, as revealed by the thermal properties and the morphology of the compatibilized blends, was shown to be excellent.

Ny 6 polymers terminated with one specific reactive chain end (-COOH or NH 2) were reacted with different amounts of CP 20 XA to study the kinetic order of the reactions. All Ny 6 -CP 20 XA reacted products soluble in trifluoroethanol (TFE) were well characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, FT-IR and (1 H and 13 C) NMR techniques. The MALDI-TOF {{results show that the}} oxazoline rings react with the <b>carboxyl</b> chain <b>ends</b> of Ny 6 following second-order kinetics. The reactions with amino chain ends are very fast and high amounts of gels are produced in just 5 min heating, whereas traces of gel are formed when Ny 6 C 00 H and CP- 20 XA are reacted for 60 min. The gels were characterized by FTIR analyses, and also by MALDI-TOF MS after partial acid hydrolysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectra reveal also that oxazoline rings can react with -NH amide groups along the Ny 6 chains, and with secondary amino groups formed by a condensation reaction involving the elimination of ammonia from two amino chain ends. These side reactions could be responsible of the formation of the gels. The polymerization of CP 20 XA was also observed, and the oligomers formed could also react with Ny 6 samples during the melt mixing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanism}} of hydrolytic degradation of poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA 50) matrix was {{examined in the}} presence of a tertiary amine, namely caffeine, in order to elucidate the influence of this basic compound on the hydrolytic cleavage of polyester chains. Caffeine was incorporated into PLA 50 in various contents (0 to 20 %) by blending in acetone followed by solvent evaporation. The resulting blends were processed to 1. 5 mm thick plates and 0. 3 mm thin films by compression moulding. Degradation was carried out under standardized conditions, i. e. in isoosmolar pH = 7. 4 phosphate buffer at 37 °C. The effects of caffeine on degradation characteristics were rather complex and largely depended on the blend composition. For low contents (2 %), it is suggested that caffeine was molecularly dispersed in matrices and accelerated considerably the degradation with respect to caffeine-free devices. However, the increase of degradation rate was not proportional to caffeine content due to the combined effects of base/carboxyl <b>end</b> <b>group</b> interaction, crystallization and matrix-controlled or channeling-controlled diffusion of caffeine. In the early stages of degradation, the overall catalytic effect was larger for devices with low caffeine contents than for highly loaded ones where caffeine was in crystallized state and thus less available for basic catalysis. At the later stages, however, the neutralization of <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> became predominent and governed the degradation in the case of highly loaded devices. From a general viewpoint, plates degraded slightly faster than films. Moreover, crystalline residues composed of oligomeric stereocomplex were obtained for both plates and films...|$|R

Gold nanocrystals possess unique chemical and physical properties which can offer new opportunities for early diagnosis and therapeutics. In this investigation, a one-pot approach was used for the synthesis of FA-CHI@Au nanocomposite (NC). FA-CHI was obtained by the reaction of <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of folic acid with the amino groups of chitosan. A HAuCl 4 solution was added into a premixed solution of FA-CHI at 90 ºC and the reaction took place for 3 h. The NC formed had a gold metal core of anisotropic structures with many irregular branches. The shell of NC was a layer of FA-CHI (10 nm in thickness). The diameter of the NC was about 75 nm and the zeta potential was + 37. 5 mv in pure water. Upon excitation with a red visible laser (633 nm), the NC fabricated elicited greatly improved surface enhanced Raman scattering signals when using Rhodamine B as Raman reporter. The NC was able to target tumor biomarkers such as folate receptors on cancer cells owing to the FA on the surface of NC. The FA-CHI shell provided good stability for both Au nanoparticles and small Raman reporters and should improve both in vitro and in vivo usability of FA-CHI@Au nanocomposite. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 2011 Spring Meeting of the European Materials Research Society (E-MRS), Nice, France, 9 - 13 May 2011...|$|R

The strategic importance of His 1 has been confirmed, and we have previously identified an aspartic acid critical for activity at position 9. While these findings have led to a series of pure glucagon antagonists, the details of specific glucagon-receptor interactions that switch on the ensuing signaling events are still not readily apparent. The requirement for serine was tested by the chemical synthesis of a series of analogs containing substitutions for the hydrophilic hydroxyl group in each of the highly conserved serine residues at positions 2, 8, 11, and 16 of glucagon. The resulting analogs were analyzed in rat hepatocyte membranes for their receptor-binding affinities as well as their abilities to stimulate adenylate cyclase. Positions 2 and 8 were the most sensitive to modification, where both binding and activity were adversely affected. This is consistent with the notion that although the sequence responsible for transduction lies in the amino-terminal half of glucagon, some residues at that end also contribute to binding affinity. Modifications at position 11 generated high-binding-affinity derivatives that were full or moderate agonists. In contrast, position 16 replacement analogs maintained significant receptor binding affinities while the agonist properties were almost completely lost, thus separating binding and transduction functions. Therefore, Ser 16 is a third critical residue that determines glucagon activity. It is postulated, but not proven, that a serine residue, together with His 1 and Asp 9, may participate in the putative active center of glucagon, which, upon initial recognition and binding to receptor, leads to transduction of the biological signal. A dependence of the glucagon action on a three-residue cooperative mechanism might be analogous to the charge-relay scheme of serine proteases. It is suggested that, after binding to its receptor, glucagon becomes activated and functions like a coenzyme in catalyzing the specific hydrolysis of a peptide bond in the receptor, generating new amino and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> and that one of these exposed chains may contact the GTP-binding protein and activate it for further interaction with adenylate cyclase. This idea was supported by inhibition experiments with 4 -amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), a specific and irreversible inhibitor of serine proteases, which at a concentration of 5 mM completely suppressed cAMP formation by glucagon in liver membranes. cAMP formation was not affected if either glucagon or membranes were separately pretreated with APMSF and then assayed...|$|R
30|$|Since, {{cartilage}} is a tissue, with sparse {{population of}} cells entrapped within a dense extracellular matrix (ECM), therefore, delivery of cells to site of damaged cartilage using a carrier may improve its healing potential (Puppi and Chiellini 2010). Therefore, tissue engineering approaches using scaffold architecture for delivery of cells {{in an organized}} manner {{to the site of}} cartilage defects, offer great promise as repair strategies (Lara-Curzio and Readey 2004). In overall, the tissue engineering scaffolds can be divided into two main types including preformed and injectable (Zilberman 2011; Parka et al. 2013). From clinical perspective, the use of injectable scaffolding materials for in vivo tissue regeneration is attractive because it allows cell implantation through minimally invasive and routine surgical procedures (Bakhshi and Vasheghani-Farahani 2006; Francisco et al. 2013). In fact, this approach is less invasive and less painful compared to opening the joint and implants combination of cells and scaffold in it. Another advantage of using injectable scaffolds is that they can easily fill defects of various sizes and shapes without any need to fabricate scaffolds of complicated shapes (Hu et al. 2008). Injectable, in situ forming materials have been extensively used as career in drug delivery systems (DDS). As it was mentioned in a review published by Mikos et al., due to the advantages of injectable materials for both drug delivery systems and tissue engineering, the experience transfer from injectable carrier in field of DDS in order to reach appropriate in situ forming scaffolds is warranted (Jia and Kiick 2009). The application of injectable implant system comprises a water-insoluble biodegradable polymer, poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) a copolymer with a 50 : 50 molar ratio containing <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> dissolved in a water-miscible and physiologically compatible organic solvent, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) already has been investigated for DDS applications (Bakhshi and Vasheghani-Farahani 2006; Tahereh Darestani Farahani et al. 2005; Astaneh et al. 2009). Considering the necessary characteristics for tissue engineering scaffolds and how current injectable systems which were used as drug carrier could be modified to facilitate their use as injectable scaffolds was the motivation of current study. In fact, in this research, the potential of PLGA/NMP injectable system to act as cell delivery carrier was investigated. Upon injection into an aqueous environment, the organic solvent diffuses into the surrounding environment while water diffuses into the polymer matrix. Then, the polymer precipitates in contact with water and results in a solid polymeric implant and formation of an interconnecting 3 -D porous structure that allowed body fluid to penetrate through it.|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{recycling}} {{represents one}} of the most successful and widespread examples of polymer recycling. This material is fully recyclable and may be used for manufacturing new products in many industrial areas. Nevertheless, the excellent properties of PET needed for its many applications are also responsible for the difficult degradation of PET and an accumulation of polymer waste, which in turn creates serious environmental problems connected to littering and illegal landfilling or incineration. The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of alkali pretreatment on the properties of PET flakes. PET flakes were washed at twotemperatures, 70 °C and 75 °C and in various time intervals of 15, 18, 21, 25, and 30 min. All samples were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and by contact angle measurements. The results showed that during the alkali treatment the partial depolymerization of PET was obtained, which resulted in the formation of various types of oligomers with hydroxyl and <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> which were the result of loss of high molecular structure. Decrease of intensity of characteristic vibrational bands (CO at 1717, COO at 1265 and CH 2 at 722 cm- 1) with extended time was observed (Figs. 1 and 2). Further on, the formation of hydroxyl groups at ṽ = 3428 cm- 1 was also observed as a result of PET depolimerization during the alkali treatment, which behaviour was better visible for samples washed at 75 °C and with extended washing time (Fig 2 b). During the DSC thermal analysis, multiple melting peaks were observed in some studied samples which could be linked to partial melting and re-crystallization of PET or to the occurrence of new polymer fractions of lower molecular mass (Figs. 3 and 4). It is evident that the contact angle of PET samples (Fig. 5) decreases in comparison to the PET 0, which points to the changes on the PET surface during the alkali treatment. Decrease in contact angle (which is measured with water) indicates an increase in surface hydrophilicity and increase in the number of present polar -OH and -COOH groups formed during the partial degradation. Also, the values of total surface energies and their polar and dispersive components indicate that during the alkali treatment the surface characteristics of PET flakes were slightly changed due to depolymerization (Table 3). Generally, it can be concluded that partial depolymerization of PET flakes occurs during the alkali treatment but the material retains its good properties and it is appropriate for the further recycling process...|$|R

40|$|Polymer blends offer a {{means to}} achieve {{property}} combination that is generally not available in any single polymeric material. Most of polymer blend systems are immiscible, often exhibiting poor mechanical properties and unstable phase morphology. The problem of immiscibility can be remedied by compatibilising the blend components. In the present study reactively compatibilisation of blends of PP and PBT has been investigated over a range of composition of PP and PBT using a GMA grafted PP (PP-g-GMA) component as a compatibilising agent. A two-step reactive processing technique has been considered- the PP-g-GMA (gPP) was first prepared by melt functionalisation of PP with GMA in a twin-screw extruder. The PP-g-GMA {{was found to be}} miscible with PP and PBT due to potential reactivity of the epoxy group of GMA and <b>carboxyl</b> and hydroxyl <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of PBT during melt processing. The GMA grafted PP was then melt blended with different grades of PBT varying in their melt volume index and carboxylic <b>end</b> <b>group</b> equivalence. The effect of level of PP-g-GMA and blend composition on the morphology and rheological behaviour of the blends were explored. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy reveal the presence of two-phase morphology and a reduction in the domain size with an increase in the level of compatibiliser in the blend. Compatibilised blends exhibit a higher viscosity at low shear rate range and a narrower particle size distribution wit...|$|R
40|$|The study {{involves}} {{the preparation of}} sodium salts of poly(oxypropylene) -trimellitic amidoacid copolymers (POP-amidoacid), the interface property, self-assembly, morphological changes in molecular self-assembly, and molecular manipulation. 1. 	Sodium salts of poly(oxypropylene) -trimellitic amidoacid copolymers (POP-amidoacid), prepared from the reaction of POP-diamines and trimellitic anhydride, were found to self-assemble into orderly molecular bundles. The POP-amidoacid has a symmetrical structure consisting of a hydrophobic POP middle block (2000 g/mole) and four symmetrical <b>carboxyl</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> By dissolving in water and evaporating on a polyether sulfone film, the POP-amidoacid molecules self-assembled into a unique array with average dimensions of 7 - 13 nm in width, 2 - 5 nm in height, and 20 - 50 nm in length, observed by atomic force microscope. Varied morphologies were also observed when varying the pH, solvents, evaporating rate, concentration, and substrate surface. Unlike the common surfactants of single head-to-tail structure and the naturally occurring phospholipids of one-head and two-tails, the synthesized POP-derivative is a symmetrical structure of four hydrophilic heads and one long hydrophobic block. Through the complementary noncovalent bonding forces, the molecules tend to align into molecular bundles or loops as the primary structure. The formation of different morphologies {{is controlled by the}} intermolecular forces including hydrogen bonding, aromatic π-π stacking, ionic charge, and hydrophobic interaction, in a concerted manner. 2. 	Changes in molecular self-assemblies from poly(oxypropylene) -trimellitic amidoacids or imidoacids have been investigated by using dynamic mode atomic force microscopy (DFM). Imidoacids were prepared from a ring-closure of amidoacids at high temperature. Through DFM continuous scanning, different self-assembled morphologies from amidoacid and imidoacid were observed. Besides the multiplicity of carboxyl functionalities, the backbone variety (oxypropylene vs. oxyethylene) and molecular weight (2000 g/mol vs. 400 g/mol) are important factors affecting the self-assemblies on polyether sulfone surface. These copolymers were found to be amphiphiles demonstrating an ability of lowering interfacial tension at the toluene/water interface. Their surfactancy and self-assembling properties are attributed to the complimentary forces in the structures. 本論文討論有關商業化聚醚胺類 (Jeffamine® poly(oxyalkylene) -amine) 與偏苯三酸酐(Trimellitic anhydride, TMA) 所合成的共聚合物 poly(oxypropylene) -trimellitic amidoacid copolymers (POP-amidoacid) ，並探討此聚合物之界面性質、自排性質並探討分子的型態變化，進一步了解操控分子排列的方法。 1. 	利用偏苯三酸酐和雙胺官能基的聚醚胺類所合成的共聚合物POP-amidoacid，能夠形成有規則的分子束自我組裝特性。POP-amidoacid 擁有對稱性結構的共聚合，結構的中間鏈段是親油性的POP結構而兩邊尾端鏈段含有四個對稱性的羧基結構。先將POP-amidoacid共聚合物溶解在水中後，利用旋轉塗佈的方式將試樣分散在高分子PES基材的表面上後藉由原子力顯微鏡的量測，結果觀察到此共聚合物的一級結構以及規則排列的分子束型態。透過酸鹼度、溶劑、分散速率、濃度以及基材種類的變化會影響分子的排列情形。POP-amidoacid 共聚合物有別於一般界面活性劑的頭對尾結構或是自然界的磷脂物質一個頭對兩個親油性的尾結構，而是一個具有四個親水性連接一段長鏈的親油性區段之對稱性結構。透過互補的非共價鍵作用力，會使分子趨向延伸而堆積成為分子束或是分子自身環繞而形成環路物質。在此形成不同分子型態的機制主要是由聯合的非共價鍵力量所控制，其中這些作用力包括氫鍵、離子鍵、苯環的π-π作用力以及凡得瓦爾力的力量決定。 2. 	POP-amidoacid以及POP-imidoacid分子的自我排列的變化性已藉原子力顯微鏡可明顯觀察而得。POP- 2000 / 2 COOH (POP-imidoacid) 分子是由POP- 2000 / 4 COOH (POP-amidoacid) 分子在高溫下經過閉環的反應而得到的產物。透過原子力顯微鏡不斷掃描，可進一步了解到POP-amidoacid與POP-imidoacid不同分子的排列型態。並探討影響分子的排列因素，其中包括相同結構之官能基變化，不同主鏈鍛分子，以及不同分子量。最後探討形成不同分子排列型態以及具有降低在水/甲苯的界面張力現象，其原因主要是結構上的作用所致。Abstract 		 [...] . 	i 摘要		 [...] . 	iii Acknowledgement		 [...] . 	v Chapter 1 		Introduction……………………………………………………… [...] . 	 1 Chapter 2 		Literature Review………………………………………………. …………	 4 		 2. 1 The Amphiphilic Cpolymers…………………………………… [...] . 	 4 		 2. 2 The Molecular Self-assembly……………………………… [...] 	 5 		 2. 3 The Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly……… [...] . 	 8 		 2. 3. 1 The Substrate Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly [...] . 	 9 		 2. 3. 2 The Concentration Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly [...] . 	 10 		 2. 3. 3 The Ionic Interaction Force Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly…	 12 		 2. 3. 4 The Molecular Weight Factor Affecting Molecular Self-Assembly. 	 14 		 2. 3. 5 Backbone Variety Factor Affecting Molecular Self-assembly……. 	 15 		 2. 3. 6 Temperature Effect Affecting Molecular Self-assembly………… [...] 	 16 		 2. 4 Application for the Molecular Self-Assembly………………………… [...] . 	 18 Chapter 3 		Working Principle	 21 		 3. 1 Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging System	 21 Chapter 4 		Experimental Section………………………………………………………	 25 		 4. 1 Materials…………………………………………………………………	 25 		 4. 2 Experimental Procedures……………………………………………… [...] . 	 26 		 4. 3 Analytical Instruments and Measurement………………………………. 	 28 Chapter 5 		Results and Discussion…………………………………………… [...] ………	 30 		 5. 1 Synthesis of the POP- 2000 /TMA copolymer……………………………	 30 		 5. 2 LCST of the POP- 2000 /TMA Copolymers…………………………… [...] . 	 31 		 5. 3 Self-assembly via a Stretched Molecular Shape to Form Molecular Bundles………………………………………………………………………	 33 		 5. 4 Self-assembly via a Curved POP Loop to Form Large Particles……… [...] 	 36 		 5. 5 A Proposed Mechanism for the Self-assembly………………………… [...] 	 37 		 5. 6 Multiplicity of carboxyl functionalities to Molecular Self-assembling Morphological Change………………………………………………………	 38 Chapter 6 		Conclusion………………………………………………………………… [...] 	 42 References		………………………………………………………………………………. 	 4...|$|R
