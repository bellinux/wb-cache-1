5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> fleas.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{against the}} consumption of <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> meat was given added impetus by {{the formation of the}} Chinese Companion Animal Protection Network (CCAPN). Having expanded to more than 40 member societies, CCAPN began organizing protests against eating dog and cat meat in 2006, starting in Guangzhou and continuing in more than ten other cities following a positive response from the public. Before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, officials ordered dog meat to be taken off the menu at its 112 official Olympic restaurants to avoid offending visitors from various nations where {{the consumption of}} dog meat is taboo.|$|E

25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> food.|$|E

25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{pet food}} recalls {{comprise}} the contamination and wide recall of many brands of <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> foods beginning in March 2007, {{and the ensuing}} developments involving the human food supply. The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of renal failure in pets. Initially, the recalls {{were associated with the}} consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated corn gluten was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply.|$|E

500|$|Knight {{was born}} on 15 January 1999 in Canterbury, Kent. She lived on a farm with many animals, and {{at the age of}} one, she {{contracted}} the disease toxocariasis. When Knight was three, doctors examining her eyes noticed scars on her right retina. A few trips to Great Ormond Street [...] resulted in a diagnosis of toxocariasis, a condition developed when humans, most often young children, inadvertently consume the eggs of Toxocara, a roundworm parasite found in <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> faeces, which can in turn contaminate soil. The parasites, in rare circumstances such as Knight's, migrate into the eyes, leading to vision problems. Her retina was treated with steroids and regular antibiotics. The disease was dormant until she was six, when she lost much of her vision, resulting in her being only partially sighted; in her left eye she has 10-20% peripheral vision, and in her right eye she has 5%.|$|E

500|$|Like the tale's {{companion}} piece {{set in the}} Newlands Valley, The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> {{story is}} set in a real place, Near Sawrey, and is the only Potter tale to refer to Sawrey by name. Tabitha Twitchit disdainfully comments on her cousin's choice of party guest: [...] "A little dog, indeed! Just as if there were no CATS in Sawrey!" [...] The characters in the tale were modelled on real world individuals. Ribby's counterpart lived in Sawrey, and Tabitha Twitchit's counterpart lived at Hill Top, though her fictional shop is located in nearby Hawkshead. Dr. Maggotty was drawn from magpies in the London Zoological Gardens. Potter made notes in her sketchbook about the bird's anatomical structure and the colour of its feathers: [...] "Brown black eye, nose a little hookier than jackdaw, less feathered." [...] The bird's tail was over half its total length she noted, and its feathers were [...] "very blue" [...] and parts were green.|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street without a word to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>dog</b> remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E
