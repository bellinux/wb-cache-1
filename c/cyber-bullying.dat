40|$|Cyberbullying is {{a problem}} that has emerged as a {{byproduct}} of modern day technologies. This novel form of peer aggression occurs when one or more individuals use a technological medium for the purposes of threatening or harming others. Given that cyberbullying is a relatively new problem in Canada, research remains in its preliminary stages. Previous studies conducted in large urban centers in Alberta and Quebec have suggested that cyberbullying frequently occurs among middle years students. However, the characteristics of cyberbullying among rural students and students from other Canadian provinces are yet to be determined. For these reasons, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore cyberbullying amongst students from rural and urban schools in Saskatchewan. More specifically, this study investigated the following questions: 1. To what extent did youth experience cyberbullying? 2. What were the characteristics of cyberbullying? 3. How did students respond to cyberbullying? 4. To what extent did parents and teachers become involved with cyberbullying incidents? Furthermore, how did students think these adults should have responded?To answer these questions, 396 students from a large public school division in central Saskatchewan completed an anonymous paper pencil questionnaire. Among the grades 7 to 9 students sampled, 34. 6 % admitted they <b>cyber-bullied</b> others and 49. 5 % said they were victims of cyberbullying. Further, the majority (69. 4 %) of the students reported that they knew someone who had been <b>cyber-bullied.</b> No significant differences were found between urban and rural students’ experiences with cyberbullying. However, significant gender differences were found as well as significant correlations between cyberbullying involvement and student grade level, frequency of computer use, school size, and school type. Unfortunately, the majority of <b>cyber-bully</b> victims and bystanders chose not to report the incident to adults. Victims of cyberbullying reported a variety of negative outcomes, especially anger and sadness. Students offered many suggestions for the prevention and intervention of cyberbullying. In particular, students thought teachers should educate their class about cyberbullying and parents should talk to their children about the issue...|$|R

Bullying is a phenomenon of great importance, as it seems to affect persons negatively in their everyday functioning. We designed a questionnaire on cyber harassment, which was answered by pupils, at five schools in Tromsø (N= 878). This questionnaire included a section of questions concerning traditional forms of harassment and bullying, as well as a set of quality of life (QoL) questions. The main questions asked here are: 1) What is the prevalence in percentages of classical {{bullying and}} cyberbullying; 2) Are there gender and/or age differences; 3) What percentage of children bullied classically were also cyber-bullied; 4) In what way was the quality of life affected for those that were classically bullied or <b>cyber-bullied?</b> Our main finding is that students who report being cyber-harassed or <b>cyber-bullied,</b> report a significantly lower QoL-score than their non-harassed peers, and thus share the same negative characteristics in relation to quality of life as classical harassment and bullying. Cyberbullying is less common than classical bullying, but it now affects some 3. 5 % of the pupils, and nearly half of the cyberbullying comes in addition to traditional bullying...|$|R

Some software even claims to flag potential predators alongside <b>cyber-bullies.</b> For example, Net Nanny [27] claims to have an “anti-predator phrase list”, perhaps similar to that of ContentBarrier [28] which apparently flags on phrases such as: “are you alone”; “believe me”; “can i see you”; “can we meet”; “come alone”. Of course, such a detection approach will only work if predators use these phrases specifically. Also, not every parent is sufficiently technologically knowledgeable to use the right software to prevent predators from gaining access to their childj and one would have to wonder about responsibility and legal liability in the event that a predator is not detected despite such software being deployed.|$|R

This replicated another 2007 meta-analysis of 148 studies in the journal of Child Development which found greater male aggression in childhood and adolescence. This analysis also conforms with the Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology which reviewed past analysis and found greater male use in verbal and physical aggression with the difference being greater in the physical type.

As Ryan had unintentionally archived these online conversations on his hard drive when he installed DeadAIM, his father was able to read these discussions. Ryan had deliberately saved transcripts of online exchanges in which Ashley, a popular girl whom Halligan had a crush on, pretended to like him. Later at school, she told him that he was a [...] "loser". According to an ABC Primetime report, she had once been his friend and defended him when the bullying first started; when she became more popular in middle school, she left him behind.

Users must trust all information services they use. Otherwise, the consequences for society and each individual can be simply disastrous. Thus, one of the main problems of the development of the information society is to ensure the information security of the individual, society and state. In order to successfully resist the flow of threats and challenges, each member of the information society must have a certain minimum knowledge, culture and appropriate information to be prepared for an active struggle for the purity of the various types of ICT cyber-hawks, cybercriminals, cyber-terrorists and just <b>cyber-bullies.</b> At the same time, as shown by statistics and sociological research, while rapidly increasing the level of the use of global information and communication networks the level of information literacy of users and their information culture is extremely low.

Males and females are being bullied equally, but males are more often the bully (p= 0, 000). Conclusions: In the population bullying is not of low occurrence.

Objetivo: Determinar la frecuencia y formas de presentación de acoso y ciber-acoso en estudiantes de secundaria de instituciones educativas de la ciudad de Manizales, Caldas, Colombia. Materiales y métodos: Estudio de corte transversal realizado en tres instituciones educativas públicas de Manizales. La población de estudiantes fue de 1 769, de los cuales se tomó una muestra de 574. Se tomaron variables demográficas, de acoso escolar empleando el instrumento para medir violencia escolar de la Fundación Paz Ciudadana,  ciber-acoso, funcionalidad familiar, ansiedad, depresión y autoestima según cuestionarios empleados en estudios anteriores. Resultados: 50 % de la población de género femenino, con promedio de edad de 14, 3 años.   El cuestionario empleado arrojó un 5 % en el rango 3 - 5 de acoso, 2, 4 % en el rango 3 - 5 de acosadores, 1, 6 % en el mismo rango de la escala de ciber-acoso, y 0, 9 % en la de ciber-acosadores. Si bien es cierto que estas proporciones son bajas, se debe tener en cuenta que en el rango 2 - 3 de todos los cuestionarios podría haber tanto acoso o acosador  Se encontró que la baja autoestima, los altos niveles de depresión y la disfuncionalidad familiar correlacionan con altos niveles tanto de acoso, como de acosador, y también sus contrapartes virtuales. El género femenino es tan acosado como el masculino pero son más los acosadores de género masculino que de femenino (p= 0, 000). Conclusiones: En esta población el “bullying” es un fenómeno de ocurrencia no despreciable.
