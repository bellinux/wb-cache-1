5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> they were displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of}} the Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely {{had little to do with}} that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was unaware}} that his latest letters had {{galvanised}} the British authorities into action. They had hitherto been content with merely monitoring his communications but the militarily significant content {{of his most}} recent letters caused them to consider him now {{to be a serious}} threat. It did not take them long to catch up with him. His lack of even basic security precautions had left the authorities with a trail of <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> enabled them to track him down in less than a day.|$|E

5|$|On September 2, 2014, {{after weeks}} of leaking <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> a major {{announcement}} was forthcoming, Cedar Point released a statement that Mantis would close on October 19, 2014. According to the park, the roller coaster had given over 22 million rides since its debut. However, Cedar Point revealed on September 18, 2014, that Mantis wouldn't be removed, but instead would be converted into a floorless roller coaster complete with new trains, new colors, and a new theme. It reopened as Rougarou, {{the name of a}} legendary creature in French folklore that draws comparisons to the mythical werewolf, on May 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned that de Grasse was {{planning}} {{to take at least}} part of his fleet north. Although he had some <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> would show {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook {{estimates that the}} overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E

5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Harry and Ron, Hagrid left {{a set of}} {{instructions:}} {{to follow}} the spiders currently fleeing into the Forbidden Forest, which they do, {{only to find the}} monster blamed for the attacks fifty years before, a massive spider named Aragog, who explains to the duo that the real monster is one that spiders fear above all others. Hermione provides the last set of <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> inform them of the monster’s identity: It is a basilisk, (hence Harry’s ability to understand it,) that kills with a stare (although no one is dead because of various devices through which they indirectly saw the monster) and which spiders (such as Aragog and his offspring) fear above all others. Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster into the Chamber, they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a rockfall upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains that he is not only the heir of Slytherin, but also grew up to become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E

5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E
25|$|The batuque is {{probably}} the oldest musical genre in Cape Verde, but there are written records of it only from the 19th century. Presently it is found only in Santiago, notably Tarrafal, however, there are <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> it existed in all the islands of Cape Verde.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reminder}} of the glaciation are glacial erratics which are found all over the Swiss Plateau. These rocks, sometimes of an enormous size, are of alien stones, mostly granite and gneiss from the central crystalline Alps. Taken together, they {{were one of the}} <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> led to the substantiation of the glaciation theory in the 19th century since a transport by water or by volcanism was physically impossible.|$|E

25|$|Israel's {{national}} air carrier, El Al, {{is widely regarded}} as the safest airline in the world, and no flight leaving Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport has ever been hijacked. One exceptional method used in Israeli airport security is that security agents personally converse with each passenger, looking for <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> the person is a terrorist or is being unwittingly used by terrorists. Other measures include reinforced cockpit doors and an air marshal on every flight.|$|E
25|$|With the {{different}} types of wordplay and definition possibilities, the composer of a cryptic puzzle is presented with many different possible ways to clue a given answer. Most desirable are <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> are clean but deceptive, with a smooth surface reading (that is, the resulting clue looks as natural a phrase as possible). The Usenet newsgroup rec.puzzles.crosswords has a number of clueing competitions where contestants all submit clues for the same word and a judge picks the best one.|$|E
25|$|Poirot (and, it is {{reasonable}} to suppose, his creator) becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people. In Hickory Dickory Dock, he investigates the strange goings on in a student hostel, while in Third Girl (1966) he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths. In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the private investigator, Mr. Goby) who provide him with the <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> he can no longer gather for himself.|$|E

25|$|On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) {{released}} its final media release prior to 18 January at 8:50pm. This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> were {{overlooked in the}} assessment of the risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra), signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself.|$|E
25|$|Richard Milner, an American {{historian}} of science, has presented {{a case that}} Doyle {{may have been the}} perpetrator of the Piltdown Man hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit hominid fossil that fooled the scientific world for over 40 years. Milner says that Doyle had a motive—namely, revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics—and that The Lost World contains several encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax. Samuel Rosenberg's 1974 book Naked is the Best Disguise purports to explain how, throughout his writings, Doyle left open <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality.|$|E
25|$|He also {{describes}} how his first chronological victim was actually Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drugs trafficker who anonymously purchased {{the island and}} arranged the invitations on his behalf. Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention {{is that when the}} police arrive they will find ten bodies, with evidence that someone had been alive after each death, but nobody else on the island, and no way to trace the killer through his invitations or preparations. He states that, although there are three <b>clues</b> <b>that</b> could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident they will be unable to do so and that the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is retrieved.|$|E
