50|$|The two {{prevalent}} theories {{as to how}} trehalose works {{within the}} organism {{in the state of}} <b>cryptobiosis</b> are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose, although it is possible that {{a combination of the two}} mechanisms is at work.|$|E

50|$|When tardigrades (water bears) dry out, the glucose {{in their}} bodies changes to {{trehalose}} when they enter a state called <b>cryptobiosis</b> — a state wherein they appear dead. However, when they receive water, they revive and return to their metabolic state. It is also thought that the reason the larvae of sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki) and artemia (sea monkeys, brine shrimp) are able to withstand dehydration is because they store trehalose within their cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} curling and {{uncurling}} is completely reversible {{and can be}} repeated many times. The ability of the plant {{to do this is}} attributed to the presence of trehalose, a disaccharide sugar involved in several mechanisms of <b>cryptobiosis.</b> Although the rehydrated plant sometimes is described as putting out new leaves, flowers, and fruits, this is disputed; instead, the seeds may sometimes germinate and sprout new plants while still seated in the fruit on the dead parent plant.|$|E
50|$|Cryobiosis {{is a form}} of <b>cryptobiosis</b> {{that takes}} place in {{reaction}} to decreased temperature. Cryobiosis initiates when the water surrounding the organism's cells has been frozen, stopping molecule mobility and allowing the organism to endure the freezing temperatures until more hospitable conditions return. Organisms capable of enduring these conditions typically feature molecules that facilitate freezing of water in preferential locations while also prohibiting the growth of large ice crystals that could otherwise damage cells. One such organism is the lobster.|$|E
50|$|Some rare organisms, such as tardigrades, {{usually have}} short lifespans, but {{are able to}} survive for {{thousands}} of years—and, perhaps, indefinitely - if they enter into the state of <b>cryptobiosis,</b> whereby their metabolism is reversibly suspended.

Three specimens of M. tardigradum survived. The M. tardigradum is able to cope with high amounts of environmental stress by initiating <b>cryptobiosis.</b> It is found that during this state, the internal organic clock of the M. tardigradum halts, thus the cryptobiotic state does not contribute to the aging process.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} new villains have also been introduced, which include Nimrod, the deputy {{director}} of a United Kingdom [...] "black ops" [...] military research establishment known as the Forge. Thus far, Nimrod and the Forge have appeared in three Doctor Who audios, namely Project: Twilight, Project: Lazarus, and Project: Destiny, all written by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright.

5000|$|Previously, it was {{believed}} that a multi-cellular organism could only survive in a non-metabolic state of [...] "suspended animation" [...] known as <b>cryptobiosis</b> for a few decades. [...] Cases of bacteria and other single-celled microbes were previously known. No moss had previously been documented to survive more than 20 years frozen, but moss stems frozen under Teardrop Glacier on Ellesmere Island for 400 years had spawned new growth when ground up and placed in petri dishes. [...] Using complex cloning techniques, 31,000-year-old seeds of Silene stenophylla were revived in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Anhydrobiosis is {{the most}} studied form of <b>cryptobiosis</b> and occurs in {{situations}} of extreme desiccation. The term anhydrobiosis derives from the Greek for [...] "life without water" [...] and is most commonly used for the desiccation tolerance observed in certain invertebrate animals such as bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, brine shrimp, nematodes, {{and at least one}} insect, a species of chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki). However, other life forms, including the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum, the majority of plant seeds, and many microorganisms such as bakers' yeast, also exhibit desiccation tolerance. Studies have shown that some anhydrobiotic organisms can survive for decades, even centuries, in the dry state.|$|E
50|$|Bdelloid rotifers are {{aquatic organisms}} and when their habitat dries up, {{they have the}} {{capability}} of going into a dormant state known as <b>cryptobiosis</b> to survive desiccation. They can remain in this state for periods of several years and when circumstances improve, they can revitalise {{in a few hours}} and continue with their normal activities. No male bdelloid rotifers have ever been found and it is believed that all bdelloid rotifers reproduce solely by means of asexual reproduction through the process of parthenogenesis. Molecular studies have shown that all bdelloid rotifers are descended from a common ancestor which lost its ability to reproduce sexually about 80 million years ago. Adineta ricciae has been used in this research.|$|E
50|$|Osmoprotectants or {{compatible}} solutes {{are small}} molecules {{that act as}} osmolytes and help organisms survive extreme osmotic stress. In plants, their accumulation can increase survival during stresses such as drought. Examples of compatible solutes include betaines, amino acids, and the sugar trehalose. These molecules accumulate in cells and balance the osmotic difference between the cell's surroundings and the cytosol. In extreme cases, such as in bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, brine shrimp, and nematodes, these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and let them enter a state of suspended animation called <b>cryptobiosis.</b> In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E
50|$|Some other species, notably Anostraca, fairy {{shrimp and}} their relatives, lay eggs capable of {{entering}} {{a state of}} <b>cryptobiosis.</b> They hatch when rains replenish {{the water of the}} pool, and no stage of the animals' life cycle leaves the pool, except when eggs are accidentally transported by animal phoresis, wind, or rarely, by flood. Such animal populations may be very old indeed, when the conditions for seasonal vernal waters are stable enough. As an extreme example, Branchipodopsis relictus on the main island of the Socotra archipelago, which is exceedingly remote for what it is, a continental fragment of Gondwana, {{is believed to have been}} isolated since the Miocene. Branchipodopsis relictus is correspondingly isolated genetically as well as geographically.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cryptobiosis</b> {{refers to}} the state of an {{organism}} that has no detectable metabolic activity, resulting from extreme and unfavorable environmental conditions; anhydrobiosis {{refers to the}} state of surviving the loss of (almost) all body water. Although this state is commonly observed in invertebrates, only one insect is known to be cryptobiotic (anhydrobiotic), the African chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki. Polypedilum vanderplanki undergoes anhydrobiosis, a cryptobiotic state wherein the body is completely dehydrated. The larvae of P. vanderplanki inhabit rock pools that commonly dry out completely. [...] In response, P. vanderplanki larvae enter an anhydrobiotic state, during which changes in body osmolarity trigger the production of large amounts of trehalose. Due to its capacity for water replacement and vitrification, the accumulation of trehalose prevents the death of the larvae from water loss.|$|E

5000|$|Bdelloids {{are able}} to survive {{environmental}} stresses by entering a state of dormancy known as anhydrobiosis which enables the organism to rapidly dehydrate and thus resist desiccation. While preparing for this dormant state many metabolic processes are adjusted to equate for the change in state; e.g. the production of protective chemicals. The bdelloid can remain in this state, which {{is known as a}} 'tun' until the return of a sufficient amount of water, at which point they will rehydrate and become active within hours. Hatching of the young will only occur when conditions are at their most favourable. These forms of dormancy are also known as <b>cryptobiosis</b> or quiescence. Bdelloids have been known to survive in this state for up to 9 years while waiting for favourable conditions to return. [...] In addition to surviving desiccation through anhydrobiosis, desiccation stress on two bdelloid species actually helped to maintain fitness and even improved their species fecundity. The rotifers that were consistently kept hydrated fared worse than those desiccated and rehydrated.|$|E
