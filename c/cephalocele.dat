50|$|Zeichi-Ceide {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease discovered in 2007. It is named after its discoverer, R.M. Zeichi-Ceide, who observed three siblings born of consanguineous parents with distinctive characteristics, including facial anomalies, large feet, mental deficiency, and occipital atretic <b>cephalocele.</b> The investigators suspected the symptoms were caused by autosomal recessive inheritance.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} an unusual <b>cephalocele</b> {{originating in the}} temporobasal region and protruding through the sphenopetral area into the oral cavity. A rapid and nonaggressive endoscopic procedure was performed. The relationship between this type of <b>cephalocele,</b> spontaneous anteroinferior temporal encephaloceles, and nasopharyngeal brain heterotopia is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Pai {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder characterized by cutaneous polyps of the face, pericallosal lipoma and median cleft lip. We report on a newborn girl with a variant of Pai syndrome presenting with all typical findings except a median cleft. In addition, fetal sonography and MRI showed the unique intrauterine evolution of a <b>cephalocele</b> into an atretic <b>cephalocele...</b>|$|E
40|$|Basal cephaloceles of {{the child}} are rare pathologies which require {{accurate}} preoperative imaging work-up. The CT and MR studies of six children with surgically proven basal <b>cephalocele</b> were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the role of CT and MR in the preoperative work-up of a basal <b>cephalocele</b> {{of the child}}. In five patients, MR allowed to define the nature and topography of the <b>cephalocele,</b> and allowed an accurate depiction of the optic tract, ante- and post-hypophysis and associated agenesis of corpus callosum when present. 3 -D CT allowed in one case a more precise depiction of the basal bony defect. MRI allows in a non invasive and non ionising way the best depiction of herniating meninges, brain or ventricles as well as associated cerebral anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Atretic parietal cephaloceles are an {{extremely}} rare and occult form of congenital herniations that involve the meninges, remnants of glial cells or {{central nervous system}} structures. They are detected as subscalp lesions that are covered by skin. In the literature, atretic parietal cephaloceles {{have been reported in}} children in 59 cases and in two cases in adults. We present here a case of a recurrent atretic parietal <b>cephalocele</b> that we recently observed in an adult. This case indicates that an atretic parietal <b>cephalocele</b> should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of subscalp lesions. Radiologic diagnosis is a lifesaving measure that can be undertaken before an operation. Additionally, regular follow-up magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for each case with remnant lesions due to the slow growth of these masses...|$|E
40|$|Achondrogenesis is a {{very rare}} lethal {{skeletal}} disorder. Here we describe a case of prenatally diagnosed achondrogenesis type Ⅱ in a 28 year-old woman at (17 + 4) wk. She had history of 5 first trimester missed abortions. The couple is consanguineous. Ultrasonography showed extreme micromelia, short neck and trunk, large head and prominent abdomen. Delayed ossification in sacral bones was detected and ossification of pubic rami was poor. There were associated large cystic hygroma, anasarca and also high occipital <b>cephalocele.</b> Posterior fossa was normal. Mild hypothelorism, depressed nasal bridge, low set ear and mild retrognathia were identified too. Amniocentesis result was compatible with a normal female fetus. Post mortem whole body radiography confirmed the diagnosis. To our knowledge, {{this is the second}} case report with association of <b>cephalocele</b> and achondrogenesis type Ⅱ...|$|E
40|$|Atretic {{encephalocele}} {{was reported}} by James and Lass-mann {{for the first time}} in 1972 as meningocele manqué, and it was defined as a degenerative form of encephalocele 1). Subsequently, it was variously designated as atretic, occult, abortive and rudimentary <b>cephalocele,</b> amongst other terms. Its prognosis varies and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the tissues contained within the le-sion, the presence or not of other concomitant anomalies, the site of development, and the presence or not of an em-bryonal straight sinus 2). We treated two patients who were referred to our hospital because a round tumor was detected in the posterior area of their parietal lobes immediately after birth. Different imaging techniques, including various simple imagings of the cephalic area, ultrasound, CT and MRI were used, which somewhat confused the diagnosis of atretic <b>cephalocele.</b> However, i...|$|E
40|$|A 6 year-old girl {{presented}} with a midline parietal scalp swelling that had been gradually enlarging since birth. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed communication of the cyst with the subarachnoid space through a calvarial defect, with concomitant findings of vertically positioned straight venous sinus and subependymal grey matter heterotopia. A diagnosis of atretic <b>cephalocele</b> was thus made based on these classical imaging findings...|$|E
30|$|A <b>cephalocele</b> is {{a generic}} term applied to several {{congenital}} or acquired conditions. Encephalocele is herniation of brain parenchyma through an osseous-dural defect {{of the skull}} base or cranial vault, whereas meningocele is herniation of meninges alone. Meningoencephalocele comprises herniation of brain parenchyma along with meninges, whereas a meningoencephalocystocele includes herniation of ventricle besides the other two [65]. Gliocele implies herniation of gliotic brain parenchyma. Concomitant CSF leak with these conditions is common [66]. The estimated incidence of <b>cephalocele</b> is 0.8 – 4 / 10, 000 live births, with a well-recognised geographical variation between subtypes and female preponderance [67, 68]. Congenital <b>cephalocele</b> is caused by closure defect of the neural tube or by a focal failure of cartilage formation or ossification of the skull base. Common locations are the occipital and parietal bone, frontoethmoidal junction, and sphenoid and temporal bone [69]. Although congenital cephaloceles are present at birth, they may remain clinically occult until adulthood. The clinical presentation depends {{on the amount of}} herniated cerebral tissue, on the topography of the lesion and on the associated cerebral and craniofacial anomalies [70]. It includes CSF rhinorrhoea, facial deformity, pulsating proptosis and exophthalmos, middle ear effusion, conductive hearing loss, headache, epilepsy and ascending infections (osteomyelitis, meningitis, encephalitis and abscesses). Migrational abnormalities, corpus callosum agenesis, cleft lip and palate, coloboma and microphthalmia are common concomitant developmental anomalies [68]. Naso-ethmoidal encephalocele should be differentiated from nasal glioma, which is a congenital non-neoplastic lesion composed of dysplastic glial tissue usually not connected to the brain and without direct communication with the subarachnoid spaces.|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of MRI {{findings}} a large spectrum of severity can be recognised, from negligible to severe. Here we describe the main neuroradiological features: abnormal signal intensity in the white matter and in the basal ganglia, dilatation of periventricular spaces, widening of cortical sulci, brain atrophy and enlargement of extraventricular spaces, and spinal cord compression. Recently, a few cases of closed <b>cephalocele</b> {{have been reported in}} the literature [31].|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported a Vietnamese-American family with isolated autosomal dominant occipital <b>cephalocele.</b> Upon further neuroimaging studies, we have recharacterized this condition as autosomal dominant Dandy-Walker with occipital <b>cephalocele</b> (ADDWOC). A similar ADDWOC family from Brazil was also recently described. To determine the genetic etiology of ADDWOC, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis on {{members of the}} Vietnamese-American and Brazilian pedigrees. Linkage analysis of the Vietnamese-American family identified the ADDWOC causative locus on chromosome 2 q 36. 1 with a multipoint parametric LOD score of 3. 3, while haplotype analysis refined the locus to 1. 1 Mb. Sequencing of the five known genes in this locus did not identify any protein-altering mutations. However, a terminal deletion of chromosome 2 in a patient with an isolated case of Dandy-Walker malformation also encompassed the 2 q 36. 1 chromosomal region. The Brazilian pedigree did not show linkage to this 2 q 36. 1 region. Taken together, these results demonstrate a locus for ADDWOC on 2 q 36. 1 and also suggest locus heterogeneity for ADDWOC...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Intracranial lipomas {{are rare}} lesions. Intracranial lipoma {{associated}} with a subcutaneous lipoma is extremely rare. Various vascular abnormalities have been described in association with intracranial lipoma, including distension, kinking, or narrowing of arteries and veins; arteriovenous malformation; and aneurysm. To our knowledge, association of sagittal sinus fenestration, falcine sinus, and absent straight sinus with intraextracranial lipoma has not been reported before. We report the imaging findings of an infant with interhemispheric and subcutaneous lipoma associated with falcine sinus and sagittal sinus fenestration. Intracranial lipoma is a rare disease that accounts for 0. 06 %– 0. 46 % of all intracranial tumors. 1 It frequently develops in the supratentorial midline region, mostly in the pericallosal cistern. 2 Intracranial lipoma associated with subcutaneous li-poma is extremely rare. Falcine sinus may be encountered in the vein of Galen aneurysm, thrombosis of transverse sinus, atretic <b>cephalocele,</b> Apert syndrome, or osteogenesis imper-fecta. 3, 4 Sagittal sinus fenestration was reported in association with parietal <b>cephalocele.</b> 4, 5 To {{the best of our}} knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Background: Congenital malformations (CMF) have an {{important}} role in infant mortality. Neural tube defects (NTD) have great relevance from both social and public health points of view. The ECLAMC (Collaborative Latin American Study of Congenital Malformations) maintains in Chile an epidemiological surveillance of CMF prevalence rate at birth since 1969. Aim: To assess the effect of wheat flour folic acid fortification on the prevalence of NTD. Patients and Methods: Only Anencephaly, Spina bifida and <b>Cephalocele</b> were considered as NTD. All children born in the maternities incorporated to ECLAMC between 1969 and 1999 were considered as belonging to the pre folic acid fortification period and those who were born from 2001 to 2010 were considered as belonging to the post fortification period. Results: The NTD prevalence rate at birth in the pre fortification period was 17. 03 / 10, 000. In the second period, there were 291, 996 births and among them, 280 newborns were affected by a form of NTD (9. 59 in 10, 000 births). This represents a 44 % decrease (p < 0. 01). Anencephaly rate fell from 7. 16 / 10, 000 to 3. 67 / 10, 000, representing a 49 % lower rate (p < 0. 01). Spina bifida rate decreased from 8. 61 / 10, 000 to 4. 49 / 10, 000, representing a 48 % lower rate (p < 0. 01). <b>Cephalocele</b> had a 20 % non-significant reduction. Conclusions: Wheat flour fortification with folic acid reduced by 44 % the prevalence rate of NTD at birth. This means that NTDs were prevented in 185 Chilean newborns each year...|$|E
40|$|Neural tube defects (NTDs) may be {{associated}} with syndromes, disorders and maternal risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive review of the syndromes, disorders and maternal risk factors associated with NTDs, including DK phocomelia syndrome (von Voss-Cherstvoy syndrome), Siegel-Bartlet syndrome, fetal warfarin syndrome, craniotelencephalic dysplasia, Czeizel-Losonci syndrome, maternal cocaine abuse, Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome, parietal foramina (cranium bifidum), Apert syndrome, craniomicromelic syndrome, XX-agonadism with multiple dysraphic lesions including omphalocele and NTDs, Fryns microphthalmia syndrome, Gershoni-Baruch syndrome, PHAVER syndrome, periconceptional vitamin B 6 deficiency, and autosomal dominant Dandy-Walker malformation with occipital <b>cephalocele.</b> NTDs associated with these syndromes, disorders and maternal risk factors are a rare but important cause of NTDs. The recurrence risk and the preventive effect of maternal folic acid intake in NTDs associated with syndromes, disorders and maternal risk factors may be different from those of nonsyndromic multifactorial NTDs. Perinatal diagnosis of NTDs should alert doctors to the syndromes, disorders and maternal risk factors associated with NTDs, and prompt thorough etiologic investigation and genetic counseling...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} MRI in assessing Ultrasonographically (US) -suspected fetal malformations associated with oligohydramnios. Methods: We performed MRI in 43 oligohydramnios pregnancies referred with US-suspected fetal malformations at a mean of 25. 5  weeks’ gestation. MRI findings were correlated with US data and outcome measures. Results: MRI correctly diagnosed one normal fetus suspected to have posterior <b>cephalocele.</b> In the remaining 42 fetuses who had malformations involving their urinary systems (n =  36), brains (n =  23), bones (n =  4), hearts (n =  3), and hepatobiliary (n =  3), MRI confirmed US diagnosis in 25 fetuses (58. 1 %), and added US-occult findings in 14 (32. 5 %) that were mainly related to the brain, urinary and hepatobiliary system. In 2 fetuses (4. 7 %), MRI added findings but missed data correctly detected by US in another 2 fetuses. MRI missed fetal skeletal and cardiac function abnormalities correctly detected by US. MRI accurately detected multiple body system abnormalities that aided prenatal correct diagnosis of syndromes including Meckel Gruber (n =  15) and Joubert syndrome and related cerebellar disorders (n =  1). Conclusion: MRI is valuable in evaluating suspected fetal malformations especially those related to brain and urinary system when ultrasound is inconclusive owing to oligohydramnios. Fetal MRI can add findings that may modify prenatal diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopy {{is used on}} {{different}} occasions-for instance, to open {{the floor of the}} third ventricule in triventricular hydrocephalus, to open a cyst into the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, for biopsy or for partial resection of some tumors, or to insert a shunt in hydrocephalus or syringohydromyelia. However, the use of endoscopes for evaluating and treating meningoceles remains to be assessed. METHODS: Five different kinds of rare meningoceles are presented. In each, neuroendoscopy was used as the main tool for exploration and treatment. RESULTS: Two sacral meningoceles and one oral <b>cephalocele</b> were cured through a keyhole opening under endoscopic control. One posterior sacral meningocele was explored and no communication with normal subarachnoid spaces was observed, allowing a simple suture of the posterior to the anterior walls. And, last, a complex case with three intrasacral meningoceles was explored and partially treated. CONCLUSIONS: Meningoceles with very small communication within the normal subarachnoid spaces appeared the most suitable to be cured by an endoscopic procedure. In case of a larger communication, the meningocele could be treated, or at least the morphology can be better understood, by using a keyhole procedure under endoscopic control. In all cases the surgery was of short duration (less than 1 hour) and very well tolerated. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: The ECLAMC (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Congénitas) is an {{epidemiological}} surveillance program for congenital defects that operates in Chile since 1969. Aim: To communicate {{the frequency of}} disabling congenital defects in Chile in the period 1982 - 1997. Material and methods: A review of the ECLAMC registry, choosing 12 congenital defects: amelia, limb amputations, limb reductions, arthrogryposis, hip luxation and subluxation, spina bifida, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, <b>cephalocele,</b> talipes equinovarus, Down syndrome and multiple abnormalities. Results: In the study period, 283, 403 births occurred and 7, 917 newborns were malformed (7, 654 born alive and 263 stillbirths). The congenital defects prevalence rates appeared higher in Chile than in other Latin American countries, specially among stillbirths. Among the studied maternity hospitals, the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile, showed the higher prevalence of congenital defects. Rancagua and the Navy Hospital in Valparaiso have a high frequency of Down syndrome. Global rates in Chile and {{in the rest of}} ECLAMC for specific defects, do not have significant differences, except for hip subluxation, that has a lower incidence in Chile. Conclusions: The ECLAMC allows to have a good knowledge of the prevalence of congenital malformations in Latin America (Rev Méd Chile 2001; 129 : 67 - 74) ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{variety of}} {{diseases}} affect the calvaria. They may be identified clinically as palpable masses or incidentally in radiologic examinations. There are many diagnostic possibilities, including congenital, neoplastic, inflammatory and traumatic lesions. The {{purpose of this}} study is to illustrate the main calvarial lesions through MR imaging, their signal intensity and extension to neighboring sites. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 81 cases, from November 1996 to July 2001, was conducted. The examinations were performed on a 1. 5 T equipment and each one of the cases was pathologically proven. RESULTS: The results were: dermoid cysts [4 cases (5 %) ], epidermoid cysts [2 cases (2. 5 %) ], <b>cephalocele</b> [14 cases (17. 5 %) ], sinus pericranii [3 cases (3. 7 %) ], leptomeningeal cysts [4 cases (5 %) ], Langerhans cell histiocytosis [10 cases (12. 5 %) ], lipoma [4 cases (5 %) ], fibrous dysplasia [13 cases (16. 2 %) ], osteoma [8 cases (10 %) ], hemangioma [1 case (1. 2 %) ], meningioma [3 cases (3. 7 %) ], chondrosarcoma [5 cases (6. 2 %) ], hemangiosarcoma [1 case (1. 2 %) ], multiple myeloma [3 cases (3. 7 %) ], sarcomatous transformation of Paget disease [1 case (1. 3 %) ], and metastasis [5 cases (6. 2 %) ]. CONCLUSION: MRI identifies bone marrow abnormalities and invasion of adjacent tissues at an early stage. Therefore, it is an essential method when it commes to properly evaluating calvarial lesions...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variations}} affecting neural {{tube closure}} along the head result in malformations {{of the face}} and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) {{are among the most}} common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3 H 1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior <b>cephalocele.</b> In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet 1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET 1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr 2, Epha 7 and Grhl 2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET 1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl 2 in IMCD- 3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET 1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse...|$|E
