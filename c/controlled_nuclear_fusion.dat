The product (mixing) of the signal of reflectometer and the functions yields the amplitude and phase of the coherent components. when the plasma density gradually increases, the measuring position moves radially outward.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> is {{a process}} in which nuclei, having a total initial mass, combine to produce a single nucleus, having a final mass less than the total initial mass. Below a given atomic number the process is exothermic; that is, since the final mass is less than the {{combined}} initial mass and the mass deficit is converted into energy by the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion.</b> On Earth <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> does not happen spontaneously because electrostatic barriers prevent the phenomenon. To induce <b>controlled,</b> industrial scale, <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion,</b> only a few methods have been discovered that look promising, but net positive energy production is not yet possible because of low overall efficiency of the systems. In this paper we propose that an intense burst of High Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGWs) could be focused or beamed to a target mass composed of appropriate fuel or target material to efficiently rearrange the atomic or nuclear structure of the target material with consequent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion.</b> Provided that efficient generation of HFGW can be technically achieved, the proposed fusion reactor could become a viable solution for the energy needs of mankind and alternatively a process for beaming energy t...|$|R
25|$|In {{magnetic}} confinement reactors, hydrogen gas (usually a 50-50 mixture of two heavier isotopes of ordinary hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium) is heated to very high temperatures (about 150 million degrees Celsius). At these high temperatures electrons separate from hydrogen nuclei {{and the gas}} becomes plasma, which {{is often referred to}} as the fourth state of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. By controlling, or confining, the flow of plasma in test reactors, engineers can cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse – creating for short amounts of time a nuclear fusion reaction that generates heat. One of the unsolved challenges of <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> energy is to sustain a reaction that generates more energy than what goes into just maintaining the operation of the reactor plasma itself.|$|E

Although the beams had low intensity, they could, over many hours of operation, still melt the collectors. A water cooling system was therefore added to the collectors and the tank liner.

500|$|When {{deuterium}} (hydrogen-2) is {{bombarded with}} deuterium, the fusion reaction yields either tritium (hydrogen-3) plus a proton or helium-3 plus a neutron (...) [...] This {{is one of}} the most basic fusion reactions, and the foundation of the thermonuclear weapon and the current research on <b>controlled</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion.</b> At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories Hans Bethe thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch cyclotron operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a beam of accelerated ions, thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super mass spectrometer. As the accelerated helium came from deep gas wells where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable.

40|$|Success {{has been}} {{achieved}} from research and development work conducted since 1986 on a unique concept for creating and <b>controlling</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> reactions, in an inertial-electrodynamic fusion (IEF) device of special, quasi-spherical configuration. Final design insights were proven by experiment in Oct/Nov 2005, from which full-scale designs can be determined. This allows demonstration of full-scale, clean, <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> power systems, based on use of p+B 11 → 3 He 4. This demonstration will require about $ 200 M (USD) over 5 years, with an IEF machine of 2. 5 - 3 m in diameter, operated at over 100 MW. It will {{open the door to}} superformance, practical, economical spaceflight, as well as clean fusion power, and mark the end of dependence on fossil fuels. The main point {{of this paper is to}} present these results of EMC 2 ‘s 20 years of study and research of this approach to clean fusion power. This concept derives from early work (1960 ‘s) of P. T. Farnsworth and R. L. Hirsch (F/H), who used spherical screen grids biased to high potentials to energize and accelerate ions to the center, where fusion occurred. Ion collisions with grids gave unavoidable losses, limiting power gain to less than 0. 001. The EMC 2 device avoids these by using energetic electrons, trapped in a quasi-spherical polyhedral magnetic field, to generate a spherical electric potential well. Ions dropped into this well at its edge will accelerate towards its center increasing in density and kinetic energy, collide at high energy, and make fusion. By this unique design, the power loss problem is shifted from grid collision of ions (F/H) to that of electron transport losses across high B fields to the confining magnets. The two competing phenomena, power loss and fusion generation, are thus decoupled by the basic design approach, and each can be optimized separately. The concept was invented by Dr. R. W. Bussard in 1983, patented in 1989 (and lastly in 2006), and studied by EMC 2 since 1986. Desig...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{confining}} a plasma, with sufficiently high density and temperature, is of crucial importance if <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> {{is to be}} made usable {{as a form of}} power generation. Tokamaks – devices with a toroidal geometry – are among the most popular candidates by which such confinement can be achieved. A tokamak separates a plasma from its surroundings by means of a magnetic field generated by several coils distributed around the plasma. The main topic of Magnetic Control of Tokamak Plasmas is the design of feedback control systems guaranteeing the stability of plasma equilibrium inside a tokamak and the regulation of the plasma position and shape during plasma pulses. Modelling and control details are presented, allowing the non-expert to understand the control problem. Starting from equations of magneto-hydro-dynamics, all the steps needed for the derivation of plasma state-space models are enumerated. The basics of electromagnetics are frequently recalled. The control problem is then described beginning with control of current and position – vertical and radial – and progressing to the more challenging shape control. The solutions proposed vary from simple PIDs to more sophisticated MIMO controllers. Wherever possible, the various topics are rounded out with results obtained through the authors’ contributions to experiments with actual tokamaks. Mathematical details which are outside the normal province of control engineers are presented in an appendix for the interested reader.

40|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) has an {{idiosyncratic}} form of late-acting self-incompatibility {{that operates}} through the non-fusion of incompatible gametes. Here, we used high-resolution confocal microscopy to define fine level {{changes to the}} embryo sac of the strongly selfincompatible cocoa genotype SCA 24 {{in the absence of}} pollination, and following compatible and incompatible pollination. All sperm nuclei had fused with the female nuclei by 48 h following compatible pollinations. However, following incompatible pollinations, we observed divergence in the behaviour of sperm nuclei following release into the embryo sac. Incomplete sperm nucleus migration occurred in approximately half of the embryo sacs, where the sperm nuclei had so far failed to reach the female gamete nuclei. Sperm nuclei reached but did not fuse with the female gamete nuclei in the residual cases. We argue that the cellular mechanisms governing sperm nucleus migration to the egg nucleus and those <b>controlling</b> subsequent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> are likely to differ and should be considered independently.
