40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this paper to propose a new mora-based {{analysis}} of loanword accent in the South Kyungsang dialect of Korean (SKK) {{on the basis of}} data from original fieldwork. This paper first points out some critical errors in previous studies concerning the description of loanword accent <b>in</b> <b>SKK.</b> It will then propose a new, much simpler generalization based on the notion ‘mora’. Specifically, seemingly different accent patterns can be generalized as a rule assigning an accent on the penultimate mora. This rule as well as some other pitch features of SKK is strikingly similar to the loanword accent of (Tokyo) Japanese. These cross-linguistic similarities, too, can be uncovered iff the mora is recognized as a relevant unit of description in Korean just as it is in Japanese...|$|R
40|$|The Great East Japan {{earthquake}} and tsunami caused immense damage {{over a wide}} area of eastern Japan. Hence, many survivors {{are at high risk}} for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial examined the efficacy and safety of the traditional Japanese herbal formula saikokeishikankyoto (<b>SKK)</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of PTSD among survivors of this disaster. Forty-three participants with an Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score ≥ 25 were randomized into SKK (n= 21) and control (n= 22) groups. The primary endpoint was the change in IES-R scores from baseline till after 2 weeks of treatment. Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed. The magnitude of changes in total IES-R scores differed significantly between the two groups (P< 0. 001). Post hoc analysis showed that the total IES-R score improved significantly <b>in</b> the <b>SKK</b> group from 49. 6 ± 11. 9 to 25. 5 ± 17. 0 (P < 0. 001). Subscale scores improved significantly <b>in</b> the <b>SKK</b> group (avoidance, P= 0. 003; hyperarousal, P< 0. 001; intrusion, P< 0. 001). Two-week treatment with SKK significantly improved IES-R scores among PTSD patients. This traditional medicine may be a valid choice for the treatment of psychological and physical symptoms in PTSD patients...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium verticillioides is an agriculturally {{important}} fungus {{because of}} its association with maize and its propensity to contaminate grain with toxic compounds. Some isolates of the fungus harbor a meiotic drive element known as Spore killer (SkK) that causes nearly all surviving meiotic progeny from an SkK × Spore killer-susceptible (SkS) cross to inherit the SkK allele. SkK has been mapped to chromosome V but the genetic element responsible for meiotic drive {{has yet to be}} identified. In this study, we used cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers to genotype individual progeny from an SkK × SkS mapping population. We also sequenced the genomes of three progeny from the mapping population to determine their single nucleotide polymorphisms. These techniques allowed us to refine the location of SkK to a contiguous 102 kb interval of chromosome V, herein referred to as the Sk region. Relative to SkS genotypes, SkK genotypes have one extra gene within this region for a total of 42 genes. The additional gene <b>in</b> <b>SkK</b> genotypes, herein named SKC 1 for Spore Killer Candidate 1, is the most highly expressed gene from the Sk region during early stages of sexual development. The Sk region also has three hyper-variable regions, the longest of which includes SKC 1. The possibility that SKC 1, or another gene from the Sk region, is an essential component of meiotic drive and spore killing is discussed...|$|R

In this paper, the dynamics of space <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> polyethylene subjected to combined ac and dc voltages have been experimentally investigated using the pulsed electroacoustic technique. Results show that combined voltages could significantly enhance the space charge accumulation. The dc component voltage determines the <b>charge</b> accumulation <b>in</b> the bulk of polyethylene while ac component influences the charge density on the electrodes. The amount of <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> the bulk depends on the ratio between ac and dc voltage components. This result is important to understand the electrical performance of high voltage equipment where insulation may experience the combined ac and dc voltages...|$|R
