50|$|The aim of a {{switching}} mixer {{is to achieve}} linear operation over the signal level by means of hard switching driven by the local oscillator. Mathematically the {{switching mixer}} is {{not much different from}} a multiplying mixer, just because instead of the LO sine wave term we would use the signum function. In the frequency domain the switching mixer operation leads to the usual sum and difference frequencies, but also to further terms e.g. ±3fLO, ±5fLO, etc.The advantage of a switching mixer is that it can achieve (with the same effort) a lower noise figure (NF) and larger <b>conversion</b> <b>gain.</b> This is because the switching diodes or transistors act either like a small resistor (switch closed) or large resistor (switch open), and in both cases only a minimal noise is added. From the circuit perspective, many multiplying mixers can be used as switching mixers, just by increasing the LO amplitude. So RF engineers simply talk about mixers and mean switching mixers.|$|E

The device also showed low output shot noise, which is only 10 % of that of conventional 3 -terminal phototransistor at the same bias condition. This is the first experimental proof that the output noise of phototransistors can be significantly reduced through punch-through operation. Lateral Si phototransistors with a punch-through base were fabricated with regular planar technology. A theoretical analysis of the dark I-V characteristics and gain of the devices, which was confirmed experimentally, was given. Ultra-high optical <b>conversion</b> <b>gains</b> were obtained under extremely low illumination level. The gain was higher than 100, 000 when the incident light power is 0. 19 nW. When the illumination level as low as 0. 1 nW observed optical gain exceeded 150, 000, which is the highest one ever reported in silicon material system. The noise characteristics of the devices were also discussed. Very low output noise was obtained. In comparison to either conventional three terminal phototransistors or p-i-n photodiodes, improvement of SNR beyond 40 dB has been achieved. The device also showed a fast transient response.

40|$|In recent years, vision systems {{based on}} CMOS image sensors have {{acquired}} significant ground over those based on charge-coupled devices (CCD). The main advantages of CMOS image sensors are their {{high level of}} integration, random accessibility, and low-voltage, low-power operation. Previously proposed high dynamic range enhancement schemes focused mainly on extending the sensor dynamic range at the high illumination end. Sensor dynamic range extension at the low illumination end has not been addressed. Since most applications require low-noise, high-sensitivity, characteristics for imaging of the dark region as well as dynamic range expansion to the bright region, {{the availability of a}} low-noise, high-sensitivity pixel device is particularly important. In this dissertation, a dual-conversion-gain (DCG) pixel architecture was proposed; this architecture increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the dynamic range of CMOS image sensors at both the low and high illumination ends. The dual <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> pixel improves the dynamic range by changing the <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> based on the illumination level without increasing artifacts or increasing the imaging readout noise floor. A MOSFET is used to modulate the capacitance of the charge sensing node. Under high light illumination conditions, a low <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> is used to achieve higher full well capacity and wider dynamic range. Under low light conditions, a high <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> is enabled to lower the readout noise and achieve excellent low light performance. A sensor prototype using the new pixel architecture with 5. 6 μm pixel pitch was designed and fabricated using Micron Technology’s 130 nm 3 -metal and 2 -poly silicon process. The periphery circuitries were designed to readout the pixel and support the pixel characterization needs. The pixel design, readout timing, and operation voltage were optimized. A detail sensor characterization was performed; a 127 μV/e was achieved for the high <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode and 30. 8 μV/e for the low <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode. Characterization results confirm that a 42 ke linear full well was achieved for the low <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode and 10. 5 ke for the high <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode. An average 2. 1 e readout noise was measured for the high <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode and 8. 6 e for the low <b>conversion</b> <b>gain</b> mode. The total sensor dynamic range was extended to 86 dB by combining the two modes of operation with a 46. 2 dB maximum SNR.
