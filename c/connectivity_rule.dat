40|$|Aim Recent {{efforts to}} apply the {{principles}} of systematic conservation planning to freshwater ecosystems {{have focused on the}} special connected nature of these systems as a way to ensure adequacy (long-term maintenance of biodiversity). Connectivity is important in maintaining biodiversity and key ecological processes in freshwater environments and is of special relevance for conservation planning in these systems. However, freshwater conservation planning has focused on longitudinal connectivity requirements within riverine ecosystems, while other habitats, such as floodplain wetlands or lakes and connections among them, have been overlooked. Here, we address this gap by incorporating a new component of connectivity in addition to the traditional longitudinal measure. Location Northern Australia. Methods We integrate lateral connections between freshwater areas (e. g. lakes and wetlands) that are not directly connected by the river network and the longitudinal upstream-downstream connections. We demonstrate how this can be used to incorporate ecological requirements of some water-dependent taxa that can move across drainage ivides, such as waterbirds. Results When applied together, the different <b>connectivity</b> <b>rules</b> allow the identification of priority areas that contain whole lakes or wetlands, their closest neighbours whenever possible, and the upstream/downstream reaches of rivers that flow into or from them. This would facilitate longitudinal and lateral movements of biota while minimizing the influence of disturbances potentially received from upstream or downstream reaches. Main conclusions This new approach to defining and applying different <b>connectivity</b> <b>rules</b> can help improve the adequacy of freshwater-protected areas by enhancing movements of biodiversity within priority areas. The integration of multiple connectivity needs can also serve as a bridge to integrate freshwater and terrestrial conservation planning.

30|$|Two options {{exist for}} {{imposing}} the connectivity constraint. First {{of these is}} solving analytically using the algebraic <b>connectivity</b> <b>rule,</b> which states that network is connected if the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of L is positive (Fiedler 1973). However, for this solution to be viable, L needs captured in a symmetric and unidirectional form. The second option is the deployment of network search algorithms for each solution found. Examples include Dijkstra, Floyd-Marshall, Kosaraju, or simple depth-first or breadth-first search algorithms. If the network is connected; every node will be accessed within a finite amount of time. However, deploying the search method would be computationally expensive as each iteration of the optimisation algorithm would re-trigger the search. As the network size grows, search algorithms will be increasingly unscalable, especially with heuristic methods that generate multiple solution instances at each iteration. We therefore opt for the analytical option.|$|E

Here, we analyze experimental data observed in layer 5 of rat neocortex and suggest {{a model for}} connectivity from which emerge essential observed non-random features of both wiring and weighting. These features include lognormal distributions of synaptic connection strength, anatomical clustering, and strong correlations between clustering and connection strength. Our model predicts that cortical microcircuits contain large groups of densely connected neurons which we call clusters. We show that such a cluster contains about one fifth of all excitatory neurons of a circuit which are very densely connected with stronger than average synapses. We demonstrate that such clustering {{plays an important role}} in the network dynamics, namely, it creates bistable neural spiking in small cortical circuits. Furthermore, introducing local clustering in large-scale networks leads to the emergence of various patterns of persistent local activity in an ongoing network activity. Thus, our results may bridge a gap between anatomical structure and persistent activity observed during working memory and other cognitive processes...|$|E

We collectively refer to these two models with the concept of "weak" percolation, to distinguish them from the somewhat classical concept of ordinary ("strong") percolation. While the two models coincide in simplex networks, we show that they decouple when considering multiplexes, giving rise to a wealth of critical phenomena. Our bootstrap model constitutes the simplest example of a contagion process on a multiplex network and has potential applications in critical infrastructure recovery and information security. Moreover, we show that our pruning percolation model may provide a way to diagnose missing layers in a multiplex network.

Such a task has been commonly conducted artificially and inevitably inefficient, yet makes data quality control difficult. Considering the intrinsic rules of traffic connectivity formed by the geometrical structures, spatial and semantic relationships between road features in city road networks, an intelligent processing model is set forward in this paper for traffic connectivity automation. It is argued that traffic connectivity automation between road features is fundamentally a production system composed of the spatial and semantic relations between road features, connectivity rules and control system. With the implementation of an extendable <b>connectivity</b> <b>rule</b> set, the traffic connectivity relations between road network features are built automatically based on the spatial and semantic information of road network.
