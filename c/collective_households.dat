40|$|Abstract. Using data on {{individual}} consumption expenditures from {{a sample of}} farm households in the Philippines, we construct a direct test of the risk-sharing implications of the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model. We are able to contrast the efficient outcomes predicted by the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model with the outcomes we might expect in environments in which food consumption delivers not only utils, but also nutrients which affect future productivity. Finally, {{we are able to}} contrast each of these two models with a third, involving a hidden action problem within the household; in this case, the efficient provision of incentives implies that the consumption of each household member depends on their (stochastic) productivity. The efficiency conditions which characterize the within-household allocation of food under the <b>collective</b> <b>household</b> model are violated, as consumption shares respond to earnings shocks. If future productivity depends on current nutrition, then this can explain some but not all of the response, as it appears that the quality of current consumption depends on past earnings. This suggests that actions taken by household members may be private, giving rise to a moral hazard problem within the household. 1...|$|R

The Federal planning bureau estimates the increase of population by one million inhabitants by 2030, which represent 600. 000 additional family requiring accesses to new housing facilities. Population ageing (mainly due to increasing life expectancy) combined with a constant growing rate of individuals living in <b>collective</b> <b>households,</b> leads to a substantial increase of demand of <b>collective</b> <b>households</b> (Vandresse & Bureau, 2013). This highlights a substantial challenge underlined mainly in the need to live in cities, which as consequence will increase the demand for smaller housing with or without integrated services or equipment in common. Furthermore, the stringent European performance environmental regulations for the building sector require that by 2020, all new construction are zero or nearly zero energy, (equivalent to 15 kWh/m 2 /year), with 60 % efficient on-site coverage by renewable energy. The shortage of vacant land and the increasing energy performance requirements is pushing the idea of urban densification and zero energy construction households. During the recent 6 years, {{there has been a}} trend to use timber frame constructions as a sustainable solution facing the economic and environmental crisis in Belgium. However, there is lack of knowledge on the design, construction and operation of zero energy lightweight constructions for urban densification. The goal of this research is to provide an overview and recommendation on urban densification potential in Liège Province. The focused aim is to demonstrate validated design prototypes and products of different zero energy, timber frame construction systems and composite components.

We propose two algorithms for testing the collective consumption model on large data sets.

We assume <b>collective</b> <b>households</b> with consumption technologies that define {{the public and private}} nature of expenditures through Barten scales. Our method recovers the technology by solely exploiting preference information revealed by householdsconsumption behavior. The method imposes non parametric structure on household decision processes, accounts for unobserved preference heterogeneity across individuals in different households, and requires only a single consumption observation per household. Our main identifying assumption is that the observed marital matchings are stable. We apply our method to data drawn from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), for which we assume that similar households (in terms of observed characteristics like age or region of residence) operate on the same marriage market and are characterized by a homogeneous consumption technology. This application shows that our method yields informative results on the nature of scale economies and intrahousehold allocation patterns. In addition, it allows us to define individual compensation schemes required to preserve the same consumption level in case of marriage dissolution or spousal death. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

However, PNAD data cannot be disaggregated at the municipal level. The objective {{of this study was}} to build a statistical model to predict severe food insecurity for Brazilian municipalities based on the PNAD dataset. Exclusion criteria were: incomplete food security data (19. 30 %); informants younger than 18 years old (0. 07 %); <b>collective</b> <b>households</b> (0. 05 %); households headed by indigenous persons (0. 19 %). The modeling was carried out in three stages, beginning with the selection of variables related to food insecurity using univariate logistic regression. The variables chosen to construct the municipal estimates were selected from those included in PNAD as well as the 2000 Census. Multivariate logistic regression was then initiated, removing the non-significant variables with odds ratios adjusted by multiple logistic regression. The Wald Test was applied to check the significance of the coefficients in the logistic equation. The final model included the variables: per capita income; years of schooling; race and gender of the household head; urban or rural residence; access to public water supply; presence of children; total number of household inhabitants and state of residence. The adequacy of the model was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p= 0. 561) and ROC curve (area= 0. 823).
