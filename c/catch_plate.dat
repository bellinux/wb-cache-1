25|$|In another {{variation}} of the rounded bow fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these Leech Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost always very small.|$|E
25|$|In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, {{a series}} of {{variations}} of the bow fibula appeared in the southern Balkans, known variously as Greek, Macedonian, or Thracian bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square <b>catch</b> <b>plate.</b> Some of the large square catch plates were decorated with complex incised geometric or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a flat back indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open moulds.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the {{introduction}} of the so-called Phrygian bow fibulae in Asia Minor. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or round flanges. In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from Cyprus, where it appears to have originated, to Syria, Assyria and Persia. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a triangular shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.|$|E
25|$|The Iron Age saw an {{expansion}} {{in the use of}} fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded geometric designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated {{at the end of the}} arch with a simple <b>catch</b> <b>plate,</b> lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared on some of these variants in the Hallstatt D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era crossbow fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.|$|E

50|$|The Grand Prix offered step-in convenience; to put {{the binding}} on, the skier {{inserted}} their toe under the Nevada II, then stepped down at the heel. The sole of their boot would <b>catch</b> a small <b>plate</b> or rod extending {{from the bottom of}} the binding, rotating it until it flipped up to lie vertically behind the skier's leg. During this motion the roller would catch the sole of the boot and lock it into position. Like the Nevada toe, a strong force rotating the boot, this time forward, would cause the binding to release.|$|R

5000|$|The first attested use of {{the term}} [...] "safety razor" [...] is in a patent {{application}} for [...] "new and useful improvements in Safety-Razors", filed in May 1880 by Fredrik and Otto Kampfe of Brooklyn, New York, and issued the following month. This differed from the Henson design in distancing the blade from the handle by interposing, [...] "a hollow metallic blade-holder having a preferably removable handle and a flat plate in front, to which the blade is attached by clips and a pivoted <b>catch,</b> said <b>plate</b> having bars or teeth at its lower edge, and the lower plate having an opening, for the purpose set forth", which is, to [...] "insure a smooth bearing for the plate upon the skin, while the teeth or bars will yield sufficiently to allow the razor to sever the hair without danger of cutting the skin." [...] The Kampfe Brothers produced razors under their own name following the 1880 patent and improved the design in a series of subsequent patents. These models were manufactured under the [...] "Star Safety Razor" [...] brand.|$|R
50|$|The Murrieta Red-light case: There was {{an effort}} to repeal a law in Murrieta that {{mandated}} that all traffic lights be installed with cameras in order to <b>catch</b> the license <b>plates</b> of people who blew red-lights and the effort to repeal the law {{came in the form of}} a private petition in order to put it on the ballot for the next election. However, a lawsuit was levied against the private petition claiming that “residents don’t have the authority to change traffic laws, and thus remove the cameras.” PJI felt that the suit violated the people’s right “to petition and put measures on the ballot” and decided to represent the petitioners in court.|$|R
40|$|As fragile food commodities, {{microbial}} and organoleptic {{qualities of}} fishery and seafood can quickly deteriorate. In this context, microbial quality and security improvement {{during the whole}} food processing chain (from <b>catch</b> to <b>plate),</b> using hurdle technology, a combination of mild preserving technologies such as biopreservation, modified atmosphere packaging and superchilling, are of great interest. Thirty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) belonging to the species Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Carnobacterium inhibens, Lactococcus piscium, Leuconostoc gelidum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Vagococcus penaei and Aerococcus viridans, known to possess interesting antimicrobial activity, were chosen for their potential application as bioprotective agents {{as a part of}} hurdle technology applied to fishery products. The selection approach was based on 7 criteria including antimicrobial activity, alteration potential, resistance to chitosan coating and superchilling process, cross inhibition, biogenic amines production (histamine, tyramine) and antibiotics resistance. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against 6 common spoiling bacteria in fishery products (Shewanella baltica, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Lactobacillus sakei, Hafnia alvei, Serratia proteamaculans) and 1 pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes) in co-culture inhibitory assays miniaturized in 96 -well microtiter plates. Antimicrobial activity and spoilage evaluation, both performed in cod and salmon juice, highlighted the existence of sensory signatures and inhibition profiles, which seem to be species related. Finally 6 LAB with no unusual antibiotics resistance profile nor histamine production ability were selected as bioprotective agents for further in situ inhibitory assays in cod and salmon based products, alone or in combination with other hurdles (chitosan, modified atmosphere packing and superchilling) ...|$|R

50|$|On 16 October, Gustave, when {{questioned}} by Superintendent Constant, refused {{to admit to}} having been by the camp bed when Olivier passed the scene, as well as denying having seen Elizabeth still alive and struggling. He later said that he made these denials for fear that his parents may have murdered Elizabeth and would lash out at him. He said {{that while he was}} waiting for the police, he had been located {{at the top of a}} small set of steps leading to the Grand’Terre’s southern courtyard, on the lookout in case the Drummonds’ car drove off so that he could <b>catch</b> its number <b>plate.</b> When Officers Romanet and Bouchier arrived on the scene at 7.30 am, they did not see Gustave when they passed these steps, and were surprised that he was not present. It is unknown at what time Gustave realised that Elizabeth was still alive since there is no evidence that he indeed found her shortly after Olivier passed the scene, as Gustave had claimed. Gustave later alternatively provided and retracted other contradictory versions. Therefore, Gustave’s true movements at this time remain unknown to this day.|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{mitigating}} blast {{pressures and}} fragments {{from a large}} steel tank filled with 630 lbs of Otto fuel were investigated experimentally. Methods for mitigating the debris threat caused by the breakup of a reinforced concrete bay that housed the fuel tank were also investigated. The Otto fuel was assumed to have a TNT equivalency of 1. 0. Several mitigation techniques were investigated during a one-fifth scale test series including: sand fill around the Otto fuel tank and concrete bay, a steel <b>plate</b> <b>catch</b> system for fragments and debris, a high strength fiber wrap {{on the walls of}} the bay, and blasting mats around the bay. All the concepts included some amount of sand fill around the tank. Substantial reductions in blast overpressure hazards were measured in all cases, but concrete debris throw distances were not reduced to acceptable distances. A case where the fuel tank was located in a large sand berm outside the bay was modeled in a subsequent one-third scale test series and acceptable reductions in both blast overpressure and fragment hazards were measured. The reduction in the peak pressure and impulse measured during both test series was found to be a function of the scaled radius of the sand placed around the charge and scaled standoff distance.

40|$|A {{model of}} the melting and {{dripping}} behavior of thermoplastic materials in fire is being developed using the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), which is capable of tracking the large changes in shape inherent to this problem in addition to solving the equations of motion and energy. Experiments that approximate two-dimensional flow situations {{provide a basis for}} comparison for the model in its early stages of development. Reasonable agreement with experiment has been noted for the quasi-steady flow rate from an upright rectangular object that is heated on one face. The two-dimensional spread rate of the thermoplastic melt that has dripped onto a surface beneath the object has been measured experimentally for both horizontal and slightly tilted catch plates. The model agrees within 10 % to experimental results when further degradation of the melt along the <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> is taken into account...|$|E
