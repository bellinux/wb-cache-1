A total of 60 animals with <b>carcass</b> weight ranging between 4 and 8 kg were used. <b>Carcass</b> conformation, commercial joints, tissues measurements and proportions, <b>carcass</b> pH, meat colour and meat texture were evaluated. Sex had a significant effect on <b>carcass</b> composition and males had higher bone and less intermuscular fat and kidney knob and channel fat proportion than females. Males showed better <b>carcass</b> compactness {{as a result of a}} higher hot <b>carcass</b> weight (HCW) /carcass length (K) ratio. <b>Carcass</b> weight significantly affected <b>carcass</b> joint proportion.

40|$|End of Project ReportSummary The main {{objective}} of the beef breed evaluation programme carried out at Grange Beef Research Centre was to compare the productive characteristics of different beef breed crosses out of Holstein-Friesian cows. In {{the course of this}} work much additional information was acquired, particularly on growth patterns of body organs and tissues, and how these affect kill-out proportion and <b>carcass</b> composition. The data were also used to examine relationships between <b>carcass</b> classification variables and <b>carcass</b> composition. Cattle used for beef production in Ireland can be classified into three main biological types: (i) early maturing, (ii) dairy, and (iii) late maturing. Results from an experiment that compared Friesians (dairy), Hereford × Friesians (early maturing) and Charolais × Friesians (late maturing) are used to represent these biological types. The material is organized under the following headings: (i) non <b>carcass</b> parts and kill-out proportion, (ii) <b>carcass</b> composition, (iii) <b>carcass</b> tissue distribution, (iv) muscle chemical composition, (v) gender, (vi) dairy breeds, and (vii) <b>carcass</b> classification and composition. Kill-out proportion increased by about 10 g/kg from Friesians to Hereford × Friesians to Charolais × Friesians. It also increased by about 10 g/kg per 100 kg increase in slaughter weight. Friesians had higher proportions of gastrointestinal tract plus contents than the two beef crosses and also had higher proportions of metabolic organs. Hereford crosses had a higher proportion of hide and offal fats than Charolais crosses. At any <b>carcass</b> weight, early maturing animals had more fat and less bone and muscle than late maturing animals. As <b>carcass</b> weight increased, the proportions of bone and muscle in the <b>carcass</b> decreased, and the proportion of fat increased, but the rates of these changes differed with biological type. <b>Carcass</b> muscle distribution also differed with biological type. Late maturing cattle had a higher proportion of hind quarter and higher value muscle than Friesians and early maturing animals, while Friesians had higher proportions than early maturing animals. Muscle lipid content (marbling) differed with biological type (early maturing > dairy > late maturing) and with <b>carcass</b> joint (highest for flank and ribs, lowest for m. longissimus). Early maturing steers and heifers had similar <b>carcass</b> fat proportions when the heifers were about 60 kg <b>carcass</b> lighter than the steers. Despite having poorer <b>carcass</b> conformation, heifers had a slightly higher proportion of muscle and a considerably higher proportion of higher value muscle than steers. <b>Carcass</b> classification grade was not a reliable indicator of <b>carcass</b> muscle proportion. <b>Carcass</b> fat class was related to both <b>carcass</b> fat and muscle proportions but accounted for less than half the variance in these. <b>Carcass</b> conformation class was not related to <b>carcass</b> fat proportion, <b>carcass</b> muscle proportion or higher value muscle proportion, but it was negatively related to <b>carcass</b> bone proportion...|$|R

Ultrasound has been investigated as a cheaper means of collecting <b>carcass</b> information. The literature indicates that <b>carcass</b> traits measured via ultrasound on yearling seedstock will respond to selection. Although the literature is variable on the subject, there are reported genetic correlation (r g) estimates between live animal ultrasound and actual <b>carcass</b> attributes that are greater than. 70 for all ultrasonically measured <b>carcass</b> traits. When r g between seedstock ultrasound and slaughter cattle <b>carcass</b> measures are > 0. 70, similar or greater genetic progress in finished cattle <b>carcass</b> merit could be achieved by using ultrasound information entirely compared to using typical <b>carcass</b> progeny information; however, the maximum accuracy of prediction using ultrasound information in lieu of finished cattle <b>carcass</b> information would be r g. Therefore both actual and live animal, ultrasonically measured <b>carcass</b> traits should be included in genetic evaluation programs, which will allow for an increase in the accuracy of prediction of <b>carcass</b> genetic values on young seedstock animals due to the inclusion of ultrasound information, and will also allow for the possible production of high accuracy sires based on finished cattle progeny <b>carcass</b> information.
