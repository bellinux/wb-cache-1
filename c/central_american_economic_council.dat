The vision of regional economic planning accordingly [...] "rests on an assumption that political dialogue is the means to resolve both internal and regional conflicts" [...] (Envio 1989). Historical factions related to integration are detailed, including the central challenges to rebuilding the Free Trade Zone under the [...] "conditionality" [...] of World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Agency for International Development structural adjustment programs. The commission suggests that while there are favorable conditions for regional investment and cooperation, the intra-regional debt also remains a major obstacle.|$|R

40|$|In {{tracing the}} {{evolution}} of black consciousness, class and identity in Belize, this thesis examines key episodes {{in the history of}} Afro-Belizean resistance to the colonial state. Given Belize’s unique multiracial, multiethnic character and its connection to Caribbean and <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>economic</b> and political histories, expressions of black identity and resistance have not always been apparent. In analyzing the slave economy, labor riots and the emergence of Garveyism in Belize, I argue that these moments are also representative of black Belizean men and women’s navigation of colonial repression and persistent struggle for equality.

The {{conclusion of the}} working group, presented to {{and approved by the}} President, was threefold: encourage free market reforms; contribute $8 billion in economic assistance; and encourage continued security in the region. The actual Reagan National Security Study Directive (NSSD) describing these initiatives can be viewed on reagan.utexas.edu. The policy also called upon all US Cabinet officers to assist Central America in its quest for economic development (i.e. agriculture, energy, commerce and transportation). The theme of the presentation was that security assistance in Central America would be enhanced through economic growth and prosperity. Without economic progress, the security situation would continue to unravel.
