5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers {{resigned}} Gail Goodrich, who <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix Suns {{after playing}} for L.A. until 1968. At age 32, West averaged 27.9points, 4.6rebounds and 9.5assists, {{and helped the}} Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured his knee and was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks. The Milwaukee Bucks featured freshly crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, the handicapped Lakers {{were seen as}} underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were {{looking forward to the}} matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and the Bucks won 106–85. In Game 2, the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E

However, with Aksu backing emerging stars such as Sertab and Tarkan in the early 1990s, Turkish pop <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brink. In particular, Tarkan's song Şımarık, which was both written and composed by Aksu, was a hit in Europe and Latin America in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1912, Maurer {{was elected}} as President of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor, a post which he held until 1930.

25|$|After the {{departure}} of the Matthews family, the wealthy Love family was introduced. They were made up of siblings Peter (John Hutton), Donna (Anna Stuart), Nicole (Kim Morgan Greene), and Marley (Ellen Wheeler), who was actually Donna's daughter. Their tyrannical father, Reginald (John Considine), <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead to cause trouble for his children.

25|$|The biggest manifestation was when, Jaworski <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby Medical City {{with seven}} {{stitches}} in his lip {{to lead the}} Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon {{the sight of the}} Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.|$|E
25|$|Durham <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Twenty20 Cup {{to play a}} Championship {{match against}} Lancashire and fell to their first defeat of the season - which was also the highest margin of defeat thus far in the County Championship, beating Durham's innings-and-216-run win over Leicestershire three months earlier. Meanwhile, they lost their National League lead without playing a game, as Sussex Sharks beat Kent Spitfires to go top - and six days later, when Durham {{had the chance to}} go past Sussex again, they lost to Warwickshire in a game {{featuring}} less than 300 runs in total. Durham rounded off the month with three matches without loss, however, as they beat Derbyshire in the League and Somerset in the Championship to have a 24.5-point lead {{at the end of the}} month. In the League, however, Warwickshire overtook them as they fell to third place.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, Gardner again {{joined a}} local {{volunteer}} militia, the Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Although between 1914 and 1918 World War I was raging in Europe, its effects were little felt in Malaya, {{apart from the}} 1915 Singapore Mutiny. Gardner was keen to do more towards the war effort and in 1916 once again returned to Britain. He attempted to join the British Navy, but was turned down due to ill health. Unable to fight on the front lines, he began working as an orderly in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) in the First Western General Hospital, Fazakerley, located {{on the outskirts of}} Liverpool. He was working in the VAD when casualties <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Somme and he was engaged in looking after patients and assisting in changing wound dressings. He soon had to give this up when his malaria returned, and so decided to return to Malaya in October 1916 because of the warmer climate.|$|E
25|$|During 2009-10, {{director}} Vijaya Prasad who {{was well}} known for his famous directorial venture Silli Lalli put Srujan Lokesh in the lead and started a satire comedy show called Maja with Sruja which was aired on Asianet Suvarna Though Vijaya Prasad appeared in few episodes, his identity was never revealed in the show. Srujan Lokesh hosted the show and veterans like Mimicry Dayanand, Arun Sagar and Antony Kamal {{were a part of}} the comedy focused talk show. Celebrities were being invited for casual talk as well as film promotions. The show ended in 2011 despite being highly appreciated by the viewers. Srujan Lokesh hinted about a new season in the finale episode of Maja with Sruja but this did not happen. Srujan Lokesh then became busy with his home production Lokesh Productions and produced different shows including Kaasige Toss and Chota Champion. He also hosted and judged a cookery reality show Kitchen Kiladigalu with Sihi Kahi Chandru in 2012. Later in 2013, Arun Sagar was roped in as a contestant for Season 1 of Bigg Boss Kannada by ETV Kannada where he stood out as the runner-up of the season. Vijaya Prasad started another sketch comedy show on ETV Kannada titled Comedy Circle with Arun Sagar, after he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bigg Boss house, Though this show appeared to be reincarnation of Maja with Sruja with all the recurring characters, it missed Srujan Lokesh on the show. The casting was expanded for the show, which included Arun Sagar, Shalini Sathyanarayan, Mimicry Dayanand, Antony Kamal, Mimicry Gopi, Mithra, and Girija Lokesh (Srujan Lokesh's mother) in the main cast. For unknown reasons, Arun Sagar was present only for first few episodes. Later, Shalini took up the hosting for Comedy Circle and the show successfully completed around 40 episodes. It is notable that, during the telecast of Comedy Circle, Srujan Lokesh was inside the Bigg Boss house as a contestant for the Season 2 of Bigg Boss Kannada which was aired on Asianet Suvarna. Srujan also ended up as the runner-up of the season.|$|E

[...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held.

500|$|Following the assassinations, Serbian Ambassador to France Milenko Vesnić and Serbian Ambassador to Russia Spalaiković put out {{statements}} {{claiming that}} Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary {{of the impending}} assassination. Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot. [...] Prime Minister Pašić himself made these denials to Az Est on 7 July and to the Paris Edition of the New York Herald on 20 July. Other voices eventually spoke out on the “warning”. As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović wrote in Krv Sloventsva, in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pašić reviewed {{the plot of the}} impending assassination with members of his cabinet. On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanović, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia. On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanović met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. [...] According to Serbian Military Attaché to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanović, spoke to Bilinski and [...] "...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia. [...] Some serious personal misadventure might befall him. His journey might give rise to incidents and demonstrations that Serbia would deprecate but that would have fatal repercussions on Austro-Serbian relations." [...] Jovanović <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that [...] "...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him: [...] 'Let us hope nothing does happen.'" [...] The Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister took no action based on Jovanović's remarks.|$|E
