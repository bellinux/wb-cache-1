In 1586 the botanist Jaques Dalechamps gave the plant the name of Herba nicotiana, which was also adopted by Linné. It was considered a decorative plant at first, then a panacea, before it became a <b>common</b> snuff and <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> arrived in Africa {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century.

40|$|In <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> the net uptake of {{sulphate}} and its {{transport to}} the shoot were determined after cultivation with low, normal, and high sulphate supply. The relative {{amount of the}} sulphate taken up that was transported to the shoot {{was used as a}} measure of xylem loading. Net uptake of sulphate and its transport to the shoot were low in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with low sulphate, and high in plants cultivated with high sulphate. Xylem loading, however, was relatively low in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with high sulphate and relatively high in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with low sulphate supply. Pre-culture in low sulphate containing nutrient solution also resulted in a high proportion of the absorbed sulphate being transported into the xylem if normal sulphate concentration was supplied afterwards. Fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 reduced net uptake of sulphate in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal, but not with high sulphate supply. Sulphate transport to the shoots was diminished by H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal and high sulphate supply. Also the relative amount of the sulphate taken up that was transported to the shoot was lowered by fumigation with H 2 S or SO 2 in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> grown with normal sulphate supply. Apparently, the diminished sulphate transport to the shoot upon H 2 S or SO 2 fumigation can only partially be explained by a smaller sulphate uptake. Sulphur nutrition of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> also seems to be controlled by xylem loading of sulphate. The possible role of glutathione as a signal regulating sulphur nutrition of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants</b> upon fumigation with H 2 S and SO 2 is discussed...|$|R

40|$|I 5 N-labeled {{nicotine}} was degraded in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> {{when it was}} {{injected into}} leaf at the vegetative stage. Topping of inflorescence depressed the degradation, and no degradation was found when nico-tine was injected 10 days after the topping. These results may partly explain the known fact that the content of nicotine in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> is low in their younger stages and increases after the topping. ] 5 N-labeled nicotine supplied to leaf was transported {{to other parts of}} the plant without degradation. It was a common belief that nicotine in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> is accumulated without degradation, since the content of nicotine in each organ of the plant increases with advancement of the growth. However, by the use of tracer technique, it was recently found that nicotine can be metabolized in the <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> (1, 2). On the other hand, nicotine in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> is known to increase appreciably in quantity after the topping. The mechanism of increase in nicotine content of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> has not yet been made clear, and attention must be paid to the process of degradation as well as of synthesis of nicotine. In the present paper, relations between the over-all increase in nicotine content of a <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> and the degradation of 15 N-labeled nicotine injected into leaves were studied. The translocation of 15 N-labeled nicotine from leaves was also inves-tigated.

40|$|After {{wounding}} of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants,</b> roots synthesize a {{large amount}} of nicotine to be transported to the shoot. Jasmonic acid (JA) acts as a long-distance signal between the wounding stimulus and response in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants.</b> In addition, another phloem-mobile signal (auxin) plays a role in the transmission of the message triggered by wounding. Auxin can serve as a negative signal to regulate nicotine synthesis in roots of <b>tobacco</b> <b>plants,</b> even when plants are not wounded. Furthermore, removing the shoot apex after girdling the stem base still stimulates nicotine synthesis in roots. Since girdling prevented the involvement of signals transported in the phloem, this wound likely induced a response of nicotine synthesis in roots regulated by a signal transported via an alternative pathway. The results suggest that there are multiple signals in <b>tobacco</b> <b>plant</b> to regulate nicotine synthesis, depending on the treatment...|$|R

Depletion of perchlorate in the hydroponics nutrient solution and accumulation of perchlorate in plant tissues were determined at two-day intervals using ion chromatography.
