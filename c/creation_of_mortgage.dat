As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.|$|E

50|$|The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>{{mortgage}}</b> {{is invalid}} if either the mortgage contract or the application for <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>mortgage</b> by operation <b>of</b> law or the deed pursuant {{to which it}} is filed does not specify the identity of the creditor or the owner or the debtor, or does not specify the identity of the property or the secured claim or the amount of the sum the mortgage is created for. A creditor whose claim is secured by a mortgage is entitled to be satisfied preferentially from the mortgaged property's price, whoever its owner might be. The right to a preferential satisfaction also applies to the income from the property from the date on which the owner must give account of such income under forcible execution pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure.|$|R

In 1954 a National Housing Act amendment led to the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> government-insured <b>mortgage</b> institutions, which sought to make loans more accessible for low income and rural households.

First, the consent must be prior to the transaction. This requirement has been interpreted liberally. In Bank of Ireland v Hanrahan it was held that a <b>mortgage</b> by deposit <b>of</b> title deeds was not created when the deeds were left overnight in the bank but rather the next morning when the defendant consented to the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mortgage.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{population}} decrease {{resulted in a}} labor shortage in the agriculture, which again resulted in increased use of machinery and thus capital. The government stimulated the process through the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Mortgage</b> Bank in 1851 and the State Agricultural College eight years later. The 19th century saw a large increase of road construction and steamship services commenced along the coast. The first railway, the Trunk Line between Christiania and Eidsvoll opened in 1854, followed a year later by the first telegraph line. Export industry commenced with steam-powered sawmills in the 1860s, followed by canned herring, wood pulp and cellulose. From 1850 to 1880 the Norwegian shipping industry enjoyed a large boom, stimulated by the abolishing of the British Navigation Acts. By 1880 there were 60,000 Norwegian seamen and the country had the world's third-largest merchant marine. As the first coast-to-coast railway, the Røros Line connected the capital to Trondheim in 1877. Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union in 1875 and introduced the Norwegian krone with a gold standard, along with the metric system being introduced.|$|R
5000|$|A boom in land {{speculation}} and a haphazard grant system {{resulted in the}} loss of over 75% of the 40,000 land grants issued in the colony (now state) of South Australia in the early 1800s. To resolve the deficiencies of the common law and deeds registration system, Robert Torrens, a member of the colony's House of Assembly, proposed a new title system in 1858, and it was quickly adopted. The Torrens title system was based on a central registry of all the land in the jurisdiction of South Australia, embodied in the Real Property Act 1886 (SA). All transfers of land are recorded in the register. Most importantly, the owner of the land is established by virtue of his name being recorded in the government's register. The Torrens title also records easements and the <b>creation</b> and discharge <b>of</b> <b>mortgages.</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{government}} has greatly extended its reach into the mortgage markets {{with the goals of}} (1) mitigating the deadweight losses associated with mortgage foreclosures, (2) promoting affordable homeownership, and (3) providing low cost mortgage financing. In this paper, we identify three innovations-one in each of these areas-that could be made to the American mortgage market that would help obtain {{the government}}'s objectives while enhancing financial market stability-particularly if all are done together. These three innovations are: (1) buy your own mortgage" options, (2) variable maturity <b>mortgages,</b> and (3) <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a government <b>mortgage</b> bond insurer, with an emphasis on insuring covered bonds as well as GSE debt. The first innovation would allow homebuyers to repurchase their mortgage at the market value" of their homes when they move, thereby helping society avoid some of the deadweight losses associated with unnecessary foreclosures. The second innovation would provide a mortgage that could promote affordable housing without unduly raising the default risks of low- and moderate-income families. The third innovation would help create a variety of financing options for mortgages in the United States. Moreover, it could be integrated into the current system <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> financing, which would include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), in a manner that would help the government manage the systemic risks associated with the quasi-government backing <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> credit and mortgage insurance. In particular, we propose that the government explicitly insure pre-designated financial instruments used to fund mortgage credit (such as covered bonds and GSE debt) by creating a government-backed insurance fund similar to that currently used for deposits. ...|$|R

40|$|Early {{federal housing}} finance policy {{appears to have}} been largely {{directed}} at making mortgages more marketable. The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> FHA, FNMA and FHLMC were designed to homogenize the mortgage instrument and to develop a secondary market for it. Apparently {{because of a lack of}} demand for marketability by investors, extensive trading <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> has not developed. Nonetheless, the fantastic growth in mortgage pools (as well as the unanticipated growth in FNMA holdings) has increased competition in the supplying of some intermediation functions (mortgage bankers have greatly expanded originations and servicing), has improved interregional flows <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> funds, and has given mortgage borrowers a greater access to capital markets generally. The principal result has been a decline in the mortgage rate relative to other market rates, although the inflation-triggered explosion in the demand for mortgage funds in recent years appears to be offsetting the impact of the growth in federal credit broadly defined.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the {{possibility}} that the mortgage boom and bust crisis of 2007 – 2009 might have been caused by financial innovation. We suggest that the astounding rise in subprime and Alt A leverage from 2000 to 2006, together with the remarkable growth in securitization and tranching throughout the 1990 s and early 2000 s, raised the prices of the underlying assets such as houses and mortgage bonds. We further raise {{the possibility that}} the introduction of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), in 2005 and 2006 brought those prices crashing down with just the tiniest spark. Securitization and tranching did not happen over night. The securitization <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> by the government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began in earnest in the 1970 s, when the first pools <b>of</b> <b>mortgages</b> were assembled and shares were sold to investors. In 1986, Salomon and First Boston created the first tranches, buying Fannie and Freddie pools and cutting them into four pieces. This was no simple task because it involved not only special tax treatment by the govern-ment but also the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> special legal entities and trusts which would collect the homeowner payments and then divide them up among the bondholders. By the middle 1990 s, the greatest mortgage powerhouse was the investment bank Kidder Peabody, cutting {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} worth <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> pools into over 90 types of tranches called CMOs (collateralized mortgage obligations).
