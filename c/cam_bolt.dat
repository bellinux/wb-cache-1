5000|$|.....I {{had in mind}} to {{have both}} an {{internal}} and an external brake on both wheels - hence the sixth hole just above the <b>cam</b> <b>bolt</b> hole. After giving the external brakes a good trial, I found the internal ones did all the work I required them to do; so I just cut out the external ones altogether, and connected the foot brake pedal {{to one side and}} the side brake lever to the other side, which means you only brake on one wheel. But this does not matter at all as owing to the axle being solid and both wheels and brake drums being keyed solid to it you get no skidding effect whatever.|$|E

5000|$|After a six-stage zinc {{phosphate}} rustproofing process and two minutes submerged in a [...] electrophoretic painting vat (Fisher Body Division’s [...] "Elpo" [...] electrophoretic deposition of polymers process) to prime and further {{protect them from}} rust, assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with acrylic lacquer and baked in a [...] degree oven. Fisher's rustproofing was faulty. Failure to penetrate a gap between front fenders and cowl allowed moist debris and salt to rust the untreated steel, and trapped air prevented coating inside {{the tops of the}} front fenders, which on early Vegas had no protective liners. The finance department had rejected liners as they would have added a $2.28 unit cost. After GM spent millions replacing thousands of corroded fenders under warranty, Chevrolet installed stopgap plastic deflectors in late 1973 and full plastic liners in 1974. Rust also damaged the rocker panels and door bottoms, the area beneath the windshield, and the body above the rockers. It sometimes seized the front suspension <b>cam</b> <b>bolts,</b> preventing alignment work, necessitating removal with a cutting torch and replacement by all-new parts.|$|R

50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} <b>cam</b> chain tensioner <b>bolt</b> and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle feeds {{cartridges}} {{into the}} chamber from a detachable rotary magazine via a push-feed mechanism employing dual cocking <b>cams</b> on its <b>bolt,</b> which has three locking lugs allowing for a smaller 70° throw angle of the bolt handle. The trademarked [...] "Ruger Marksman Adjustable™" [...] trigger is a functionally two-stage trigger similar in design to the Savage AccuTrigger, which allows the user to adjust the weight of pull between 3 - 5 lb {{by means of a}} set screw on the trigger housing. [...] The rifle comes with a tang-mounted safety.|$|R
50|$|Connected to the {{midpoint}} of the rotating lever is a long metal arm. The motion of the lever causes this arm to be forced rearward, pushing the entire breech mechanism with it. The rear end of this mechanism presses on the <b>cam,</b> forcing the <b>bolt</b> upward and unlocking it. Continued motion slides the bolt rearward against the spring, while also operating the mechanism that feeds the ammunition belt and readies the next round. When it reaches the end of its motion the spring pushes everything forward again, carrying the new bullet with it and seating it in the barrel before locking again.|$|R
50|$|The Weatherby Mark V action uses an {{interrupted}} screw breech as used on many artillery pieces. The nine lugs {{are actually}} sections of a screw thread. The <b>bolt</b> <b>cams</b> forward slightly as the bolt is closed following the pitch {{angle of the}} screw thread.Weatherby designed the action type with nine locking lugs arranged in three rows. It was determined early on that these lugs would not protrude outside the bolt but would be of the same diameter as the bolt body itself. Such a design would be conducive to a smooth fluid movement of the bolt through its feeding and extraction cycles.|$|R
50|$|The M1895 used a tilting bolt to lock into {{position}} when firing, {{the first example}} of such in a machine gun design. The bolt slid forward and rearward within a slot in the receiver area, held forward by a spring inside the tube that also held the operator's grip handle. As it moved forward the bolt eventually met the barrel. At that point a <b>cam</b> below the <b>bolt</b> dropped into a hole which allowed {{the rear of the}} bolt to tilt downward, seating it against the rear of the breech and locking it in position. The bolt remained locked when the round was fired.|$|R
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the <b>bolt</b> <b>cam</b> pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
50|$|The FNC is a {{selective}} fire weapon {{that uses a}} gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating bolt locking mechanism equipped with two locking lugs that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by {{the interaction of the}} <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> pin with a camming guide contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles that of Kalashnikov rifles, but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. The rear part of the cocking handle slot, cut in the upper receiver for the cocking handle, is covered by a spring-loaded cover which automatically opens by the handle when it goes back and automatically closes the opening when the cocking handle returns forward.|$|R

50|$|The FR F1 is a {{precision}} rifle used by French sharpshooters. It was manufactured by MAS (an abbreviation of Manufacture d'Armes St. Etienne - {{one of several}} government-owned arms factories in France). It has been upgraded to FR F2 standard, and is still in service with all branches of French armed forces in this version. It was first designed around the 7.5×54mm MAS cartridge before being converted to 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition when it was upgraded to FR F2 standard. It was equipped with a telescopic sight, French army standard issue being an APX L806. Its practical range is 600 to 800 meters. It is a very accurate sniper rifle, due to its quality, rear locking helical lugs that <b>cam</b> the <b>bolt</b> forward during closure to obtain optimal cartridge seating, free-floating barrel and efficient combined muzzle brake/stabilizer that dampens the barrel vibrations. The FR F1 utilizes the same basic bolt design as the older MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy-inhibiting flex. The FR-F1 was fitted with a bipod with fully adjustable legs, mid-way {{along the length of}} the rifle.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the <b>bolt</b> <b>cam</b> pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
50|$|The Minimi uses a gas-actuated {{long-stroke}} piston system. The barrel {{is locked}} with a rotary bolt, equipped with two massive locking lugs, forced into battery by a helical camming guide in the bolt carrier. Upon firing, the piston {{is forced to}} the rear by expanding propellant gases bled through a port in the barrel near the muzzle end. The piston rod acts against the bolt carrier, which begins its rearward motion guided on two rails welded to the receiver walls, while the bolt itself remains locked. This sequence provides a slight delay that ensures chamber pressure has dropped to a safe level {{by the time a}} <b>cam</b> in the <b>bolt</b> carrier rotates and unlocks the bolt, increasing extraction reliability as the empty cartridge casing has had the time to cool down and contract, exerting less friction against the chamber walls.|$|R
50|$|Although {{formally}} classed as {{a delayed}} blowback, the delay is minimal and certainly had little practical effect {{as seen by}} {{the high rate of}} fire. The mechanism is the usual one of bolt and return spring, but the bolt is controlled by a track in the receiver body that causes the bolt to rotate 45 degrees as it closes. The striker carries a lug bearing on the receiver track that also bears on a cam face on the bolt, so that the firing pin, driven by the return spring, cannot go forward to fire the cartridge until the bolt has rotated. When the gun is fired, recoil of the cartridge case moves the bolt back, causing it to rotate to the unlocked position, during which movement the pin is withdrawn by the action of the <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> surface. Once unlocked the bolt is free to recoil and complete the firing cycle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of direct impingement {{is that the}} breech of the firearm's firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly due to being exposed to the propellants of the cartridge. This is caused by solids from the high-temperature gas condensing on the bolt face and primary operating mechanism. The combustion gases contain vaporized metals, carbon, and impurities in a gaseous state until they contact cooler operating parts. The deposits increase friction on the <b>bolt's</b> <b>camming</b> system leading to malfunctions, so that thorough and frequent cleaning is required to ensure reliability. The amount of fouling depends upon the rifle's design {{as well as the}} type of propellant powder used. For example, the French MAS 44 and MAS 49 series of rifles was known to have been successfully operated for years with corrosive-primed ammunition using ordinary field cleaning expedients such as gasoline (as solvent) and straight-grade motor oil (as lubricant)..|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully <b>cammed</b> into the <b>bolt</b> head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The Twin Cam {{initially}} {{was not used}} in the Softail model family before the year 2000. This {{was due to the}} chassis design and vibration transfer to the Softail frame {{as a result of the}} direct (hard) mounting of the engine. Dyna models are [...] "rubber mounted", damping the majority of vibration transfer to the frame and rider. Another reason was that the engine and transmission on a Twin <b>Cam</b> are directly <b>bolted</b> (but are still separate units) to each other, with the chassis seat post on a Softail getting in the way of a Twin Cam transmission case. As the company determined that a rubber-mounted Softail would affect the line's visual styling, Harley solved the issue by designing an engine variant known as Twin Cam 88B. It is basically the same engine as the original (now called [...] "Twin Cam 88A"), but with a modified engine block design that incorporates twin chain-driven balance shafts. The Twin Cam 96B engine was released at the same time as the Twin Cam 96A model, for the 2007 model year, and was equipped on all Softail models until it was replaced by the 103 ci version.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved cam track that guides the <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
25|$|The Single Action Army {{action is}} a {{refinement}} of the earlier Colt percussion revolvers and the Colt 1871 cartridge revolver. The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more torsional force to the cylinder. Three notches {{on the face of}} the hammer engage the sear portion of the trigger, affording four basic hammer positions. The hammer when fully lowered rests within the frame. Drawn slightly to the rear, the hammer engages the safety notch of the sear and holds the firing pin out of direct contact with a chambered cartridge. Like the earlier percussion revolvers, the Single Action Army was designed to allow loading of all of the chambers. The safety notch replaced pins on the rear of the percussion revolver cylinders, which served the same purpose as the safety position, by preventing hammer contact with the primer/percussion cap. However, many users adopted the practice of leaving one empty chamber under the hammer, because a sharp blow could damage the mechanism and allow a fully loaded revolver to fire. This practice is now universally recommended. Drawn back about half way, the hammer engages the second notch. This <b>cams</b> the cylinder <b>bolt</b> out of engagement and allows the cylinder to rotate for loading. Fully cocked, the revolver is ready to fire. Cartridge ejection is via the spring-loaded rod housed in a tube on the right side of the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed <b>cams,</b> unlocking the <b>bolt</b> head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
