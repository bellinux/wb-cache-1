40|$|BACKGROUND: : Time {{perception}} may be {{an important}} factor influencing distress of <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> However, no comparative studies have been performed for <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> without evidence of disease and advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> in the palliative, end-of-life-care setting. OBJECTIVE: : The objectives of the study were to assess time perception in disease-free and advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and examine the relation of time perception with patients' distress. METHODS: : A descriptive research design was used. Ninety-six disease-free and 63 advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> filled out Cottle's Circle Test to assess time coherence and time dominance, Cottle's Line Test to assess temporal extension and Bayes' question on speed of time, the European Organisation for Research-and-Treatment of Cancer QOL-Questionnaire version 2. 0, Beck's Depression Inventory for primary care, and Beck's Hopelessness-Scale. RESULTS: : In patients without evidence of disease, future dominance was most often observed, whereas in advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> the present was the dominant time segment. In both groups, a focus on the past was associated with distress. In contrast with patients without evidence of disease, advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> perceived time as moving slowly, and this was correlated with distress. CONCLUSIONS: : The time perception of <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> without evidence of disease and advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> is significantly different and is related to distress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: : The observed relation between a focus on the past and distress gives room for interventions of nurses and other healthcare professionals. Specific attention is needed for differences between <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> without evidence of disease and advanced <b>cancer</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{glycerol}} and {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) kinetics in normal volunteers (VOL), non-weight-losing (NWL) gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> weight-losing (WL) gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> and in severely septic patients, using constant infusions of d-glycerol and 1 - 13 C palmitic acid; were determined. Rates of FFA oxidation have also been quantitated. Measurements {{were made in the}} basal state, during glucose infusion (4 mg/kg/min), and during total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Rates of glycerol and FFA appearance (Ra) in volunteers and NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> were similar, and in both groups there was a significant suppression after glucose infusion. The basal Ra values for glycerol and FFA were 2. 4 +/- 0. 2 and 6. 5 +/- 0. 8 mumol/kg/min, respectively, in the volunteers, and in the NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> the corresponding values were 2. 7 +/- 0. 4 and 7. 1 +/- 1. 1 mumol/kg/min (not significantly different). Compared with the volunteers, the rates of glycerol and FFA turnover were significantly elevated in both septic <b>patients</b> and WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> The values for glycerol and FFA Ra were 6. 3 +/- 1. 1 and 13. 1 +/- 3. 0 mumol/kg/min, respectively, in the septic patients. The corresponding values were 4. 1 +/- 0. 4 and 11. 7 +/- 1. 6 mumol/kg/min in the WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> In contrast to the response seen in the volunteers and NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> glucose infusion did not suppress lipolysis in either the septic or WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> In all groups studied, glucose infusion resulted in an increase in FFA recycling. Despite the fact that the WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> had an increased FFA availability, they were significantly less able to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid when compared with NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> (the basal % of FFA uptake oxidized in WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> was 10 +/- 2 % vs. 18 +/- 3 % in NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients).</b> In contrast, the septic patients had an enhanced capacity to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid (the basal % of FFA uptake oxidized was 40 +/- 8 %, and during TPN this increased in 65 +/- 10 %). From these studies the following was concluded: in terms of lipid kinetics, NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> are not significantly different from volunteers; WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and septic patients have elevated rates of lipolysis, and in contrast to what was seen in NWL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and in volunteers, glucose infusion in WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and in septic patients does not result in a significant inhibition of lipolysis; and WL <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> have an impaired capacity to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid.

5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E

Although her dramas of the late 1990s received a mixed reception overall, she was praised {{for her role as}} a <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> in One True Thing (1998). She had acclaimed roles in the 2002 films Adaptation and The Hours, and won a second Emmy Award for the television miniseries Angels in America a year later, though she failed to replicate her earlier success. This changed in 2006, with an Academy Award-nominated role as a ruthless fashion magazine editor in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada. This late-period success led to starring roles in several high-profile films, including the US$609 million-grossing romantic comedy Mamma Mia! (2008), her highest-grossing release, and the comedy-drama Julie & Julia (2009), in which she played Julia Child. These roles re-established Streep's stardom in Hollywood. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady (2011) earned her another Academy Award for Best Actress. The starring role of Florence Foster Jenkins in the 2016 comedy-drama film of the same name garnered Streep her 20th Oscar nomination, more than any actor or actress in history.|$|E

At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> drafted by the NFL.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Internationally, the Distress Thermometer and {{associated}} Problem List are increasingly used in oncology as screening tools for psychological distress. Cancer-related fatigue is common but often overlooked in clinical practice. We examined if severe fatigue in <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> {{can be identified}} with the fatigue item of the Problem List. METHODS: Newly diagnosed breast (N = 334) and colorectal (N = 179) <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> were screened for severe fatigue, which was defined as having a positive score on the fatigue item of the Problem List. The Fatigue Severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength was used as gold standard measure for severe fatigue. RESULTS: In total, 78 % of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 81 % of colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> were correctly identified with the fatigue item. The sensitivity was 89 % in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 91 % in colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> The specificity was 75 % in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 77 % in colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> The positive predictive value was 53 % in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 64 % in colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> whereas the negative predictive value was 95 % in both tumor types.

40|$|Background: As {{the number}} of cancer {{survivors}} increases and these patients often experience longlasting consequences of cancer and its treatment, more insight into primary health care use of cancer survivors is needed. Research question: How often and for which reasons do adult <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> contact their Primary Care Physician (PCP) 2 - 5 years after diagnosis. Methods: Using data from the Netherlands Information Network of Primary Care (LINH), we determined the volume and diagnoses made during primary health care contacts in 1, 056 adult breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> 419 prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 400 colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> {{two to five years}} after diagnosis and compared this to age and sex matched controls from the same practice. Results: The number of contacts with the GP was significantly higher in cancer patients: 24 % in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> 33 % in prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 15 % in <b>patients</b> with colorectal <b>cancer.</b> This difference was most prominent in younger patients without a chronic disease. The mean number of contacts specifically related to cancer was 0. 4 (SD 1. 7) per year for breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> 0. 7 (SD 2. 2) per year for prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> and 0. 6 (SD 4. 3) per year for <b>patients</b> with colorectal <b>cancer.</b> When looking at the diagnoses made during contacts with the PCP, patients contacted their PCP more often for acute symptoms, such as cough and abdominal pain, and for infections, such as cystitis and respiratory infections.
