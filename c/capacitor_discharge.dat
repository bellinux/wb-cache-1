500|$|The early Super Cubs used a 6 volt {{ignition}} magneto {{mounted on the}} flywheel, with a battery to help maintain power to the lights, while later ones were upgraded to <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> ignition (CDI) systems. The lubrication system did not use an oil pump or oil filter, but was a primitive splash-fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox, with a non-consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil. Both {{the front and rear}} brakes were drums. On both the front and rear wheels were 2.25" [...] × 17" [...] wire spoke wheels, with full-width hubs.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} for BEAM-based neurons is a capacitor that has one lead as an input, {{and the other}} going into the input line of an inverter. That inverter's output is {{the output of the}} neuron. The capacitor lead that is inputting into the inverter is pulled to ground with a resistor. The neuron functions because when an input is received (positive power on the input line), it charges the capacitor. Once the input is lost (negative power on the input line), the <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharges</b> into the inverter, causing the inverter to produce an output that is passed to the next neuron. The rate that the <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharges</b> is tied to the resistor that is pulling the input to the inverter to the negative. The larger the resistor, the longer it will take for the <b>capacitor</b> to fully <b>discharge,</b> and the longer it will take for that neuron to completely fire.|$|R

30|$|In {{the circuit}} shown as Fig.  2 b, {{freewheeling}} diodes D 2 will still bear a large fault current {{even if all}} IGBTs have been turned off. In this stage, the cell capacitors in the SMs are bypassed by the fault current, and thus would cease discharging. In other words, the cell <b>capacitors</b> <b>discharge</b> through and only {{in the first stage}} discussed in Section  2.1.|$|R
5000|$|Small neon bulbs will {{typically}} oscillate with {{values of}} R between 500kΩ and 20MΩ. [...] If C is not small, {{it may be}} necessary to add a resistor in series with the neon bulb, to limit current through it to prevent damage when the <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharges.</b> [...] This will increase the discharge time and decrease the frequency slightly, but its effect will be negligible at low frequencies.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century digital {{electronic}} ignition modules became available for small engines on such applications as chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers. This was made possible by low cost, high speed, and small footprint microcontrollers. [...] Digital electronic ignition modules can be designed as either <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> ignition (CDI) or inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems. Capacitive discharge digital ignitions store charged energy for the spark in a capacitor within the module that can be released to the spark plug at virtually any time throughout the engine cycle via a control signal from the microprocessor. This allows for greater timing flexibility, and engine performance; especially when designed hand-in-hand with the engine carburetor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> {{avalanche}} pulser: {{a trigger}} signal {{applied to the}} base lead of the avalanche transistor cause the avalanche breakdown between the collector and emitter lead. The capacitor [...] starts to be discharged by a current flowing through the resistors [...] and : the voltages across those resistors are the output voltages. The current waveform {{is not a simple}} RC discharge current but has a complex behavior which depends on the avalanche mechanism: however it has a very fast rise time, of the order of fractions of a nanosecond. Peak current depends {{on the size of the}} capacitor : when its value is raised over a few hundred picofarads, transistor goes into second breakdown avalanche mode, and peak currents reach values of several amperes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model was}} the {{successor}} to the ageing twin cylinder CB360 and the highly regarded, but expensive for the 400cc class, four-cylinder CB400F. The CB400T has two fewer cylinders than its CB400F predecessor and although the press was initially skeptical of it, reviews stated {{that it was a}} worthwhile successor and more than capable of competing with contemporary rivals. Its overhead camshaft [...] air-cooled parallel-twin had been completely redesigned, with a chain drive that operated three valves per cylinder, two for inlet and one for exhaust. It differs from rival manufacturers 400cc twin-cylinder models because it has a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins instead of the more common 180° crank layout. Counter-rotating balance-shafts help to reduce unwanted vibrations caused by the 360° crank layout. Honda fitted these models with <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharge</b> ignition instead of the points system found on its predecessors, that required frequent maintenance. It uses a five-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling is provided by twin Keihin [...] carburettors. A steel diamond cradle type frame uses the engine as a stressed member to reduce mass and increase ground clearance.|$|E

30|$|Dragoon {{supports}} {{modeling of}} both dynamic and static systems. A system is dynamic if it {{changes over time}} and static if it does not. For instance, a circuit with a battery and a light bulb is a static system because the voltage and current do not change. Conversely, a circuit with a resistor and a charged capacitor in series is a dynamic system because the current starts high and gradually decreases as the <b>capacitor</b> <b>discharges</b> through the resistor.|$|R

30|$|To start with, the {{resolution}} of the inverter chain is dependent on the CMOS process, thereby limiting the maximum achievable resolution of inverter-based buffer to approximately tens of picoseconds. The delay resolution of the CSI is not as fine as that of the SCI because of the delay-controlling transistors placed at the discharging and/or charging paths that limit the amount of the load <b>capacitor’s</b> (<b>dis)charging</b> current. Accordingly, the delay range of the CSI is shorter than that of the SCI (Zhang and Kaneko 2015).|$|R

Doubling the output voltage quadruples the electrostatic energy stored in a given top terminal capacitance.
