5000|$|<b>Journal</b> <b>entries</b> are an {{important}} part of accountancy.A <b>journal</b> <b>entry,</b> in accounting, is the logging of a transaction into accounting journal items. The <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> can consist of several recordings, each of which is either a debit or a credit. The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits or the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> is said to be [...] "unbalanced". <b>Journal</b> <b>entries</b> can record unique items or recurring items such as depreciation or bond amortization. In accounting software, <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> are usually entered using a separate module from accounts payable, which typically has its own subledger that indirectly affects the general ledger. As a result, <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> directly change the account balances on the general ledger.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the auditing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> can detect and prevent financial statement fraud. Financial statement fraud occurs when an intentional act causes financial statements to be materially misstated. Although {{it is not}} a new phenomenon, financial statement fraud has attracted much publicity in the wake of numerous cases of financial malfeasance (e. g. ENRON, WorldCom). Existing literature has provided limited empirical evidence on the link between auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> and financial statement fraud. The lack of evidence contrasts sharply with the responsibility of auditors to test the appropriateness of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> recorded in a general ledger. It becomes more pronounced when considering that <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> pose a high risk of financial statement fraud, as the case of WorldCom has demonstrated. It is further exacerbated given that fraud results in considerable costs to a number of parties, for example: auditors may be exposed to litigation; investors may experience negative stock returns; and, capital markets may suffer from reduced liquidity. Motivated by these considerations, the thesis adopts the tenets of design-science research in order to develop three quantitative models for auditing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> It first employs self-organizing map and extreme value theory to design the models as constructs. Subsequently, it codes the constructs in MATLAB to build functioning instantiations; and finally, it evaluates the instantiations by conducting a series of experiments on an accounting dataset containing <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The contribution of the thesis lies in the proposed models and their potential applications in accounting. The first model can assist management to monitor the processing of <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> as well as to assess the accuracy of financial statements. The second model can detect novel <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that differ from legitimate <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> {{to such an extent that}} they could be ‘suspicious’. The third model can identify those <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> that have both a very low probability of occurring and a monetary amount large enough to materially misstate financial statements. The thesis has a novelty value in that it investigates financial statement fraud from the unexplored perspective of <b>journal</b> <b>entries.</b> The thesis can lead to concrete practical applications in accounting, as the models can be implemented as a Computerised Assisted Audit Technique. This potentiality can be the focal point of additional research...|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> {{has its own}} web page, which {{includes}} the comments left by other users. In addition, each user has a journal page, which shows all {{of his or her}} most recent <b>journal</b> <b>entries,</b> along with links to the comment pages.|$|R
50|$|Folio Number: Every page of {{a journal}} is numbered. This number {{is known as a}} folio number. The folio number is used as a cross {{reference}} between the journal and the ledger accounts. The use of folio numbers makes it easy to refer back from the ledger account to the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> or forward from the <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> to the ledger account. In addition, folio numbers are a check that all <b>journal</b> <b>entries</b> have been recorded in the ledger system.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report is a narrative on my encounter with sport psychology. I used the metaphors of “touring” and “journal” {{to guide the}} construction of this narrative. Before embarking on my tour with sport psychology, I introduced myself as researcher (chapter 2, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> I) and stated the research problem, question and goal(s) (chapter 3, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> II). I then went on a tour with sport psychology. I visited a sport psychology museum {{to learn more about}} the history of sport psychology (chapter 4, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> III) and a sport psychology library {{to learn more about the}} field of sport psychology (chapter 5, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> IV). I also attended a sport psychology conference to become better acquainted with postgraduate sport psychology training in Psychology Departments (chapter 6, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> V). I also visited a sport psychology department at a university in Australia, to witness the delivery of a postgraduate training programme in sport psychology (chapter 7, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VI), as well as a sport centre in South Africa and a sport institute in Australia, to see how and the extent to which sport psychology was practised (chapter 8, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VII). After my tour with sport psychology I took what I had learnt and adapted the MA (Counselling Psychology) programme at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. This led to the programme having three core modules and two elective modules. The core modules are fundamental psychology, counselling psychology and career psychology. The elective modules are: community psychology and sport psychology. The sport psychology module consists of the following courses: sport psychology, sport management, sport sociology and exercise psychology. The Professional Board of Psychology at the Health Professions Council of South Africa approved this module at the end of 2003 (chapter 9, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> VIII). Finally, I also looked at the influence of my experience with sport psychology on my identity as a psychologist (chapter 10, <b>journal</b> <b>entry</b> IX).
