While the crew waited in soft dock - the docking system probe was latched onto the Salyut docking drogue, but the probe had failed to retract and bring the craft together - the ground crew studied the problem.|$|R

50|$|On 20 December 1991, Roufus {{defended his}} ISKA Full <b>Contact</b> <b>Light</b> World Light Heavyweight title against Dutchman Rob Kaman. Roufus was {{initially}} declared the winner by decision but the match was later declared a no-contest after Kaman's corner protested that only 1 minute had been {{fought in the}} 4th round - a round {{that could have been}} critical to Kaman as he had hurt his opponent. A second bout between the pair came to fruition in February 1994 in Paris, France. The fight was sold out - 20,000 people - weeks in advance. Roufus won the rematch by KO in the second round.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is played}} on a board of {{lacquered}} plywood, normally 28 inches square (71 cm). The edges of the playing surface are bounded by raised wooden sides. The object {{of the game is}} to strike a wooden disc such that it <b>contacts</b> <b>lighter</b> discs and propels them into one of four corner pockets. These pockets are usually larger than those on Indian carrom boards. The playing pieces come in two colours denoting the two players (or teams, in doubles play). An additional piece is coloured red (or other unique colour) and called the [...] "queen" [...] or [...] "king".|$|R

5000|$|The Bay Lights was {{conceived}} in September 2010 by Ben Davis of Words Pictures Ideas, {{a public relations}} company that has {{a contract with the}} California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for publicizing the construction of the new eastern span replacement of the Bay Bridge between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland. Davis characterized the Bay Bridge as being overshadowed by the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a popular tourist destination for visitors to San Francisco, and he hoped this art project would give the Bay Bridge more recognition. [...] Davis <b>contacted</b> <b>light</b> artist Leo Villareal, who had an exhibition on display at the San Jose Museum of Art in late 2010. [...] Davis later founded Illuminate the Arts, a non-profit organization, to organize the sculpture's design, engineering, and fundraising.|$|R

3000|$|To {{verify the}} {{concepts}} of neuro-symbolic recognition, it was applied to a building automation environment. In concrete, the test environment was the office kitchen of the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) at the Vienna University of Technology [33, 34]. The kitchen comprises a table with eight chairs and a kitchen cabinet including a stove, a sink, a dishwasher, and a coffee machine. For testing the recognition model, the kitchen was equipped with sensors of different types: tactile floor sensors, motion detectors, door contact sensors, window <b>contacts,</b> <b>light</b> barriers, temperature sensors, a humidity sensor, brightness sensors, a microphone, and a camera. From these sensor data, different scenarios had to be perceived following the information processing principles proposed in Section 4.1. As by these measures, the kitchen became an [...] "intelligent" [...] system capable of autonomously perceiving {{what is going on}} in it, it got the name Smart Kitchen.|$|R
5000|$|Irwin then {{announced}} that the <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> had illuminated, indicating one of the landing probes on the LM's feet had contacted the ground. Immediately Scott cut the engine. With the extended engine bell there was a fear that it could touch the ground and cause exhaust to travel back into the engine. It is estimated that they were travelling 6.8 ft/s (2 m/s) when they hit, {{twice as fast as}} previous missions. A few seconds later, Scott informed the ground that [...] "Okay, Houston. The Falcon is on the Plain at Hadley." [...] Falcon was tilted nearly 10 degrees to its back left, just 5° below the maximum acceptable angle. It set down on the rim of a crater such that its engine bell was damaged, and with one of the legs in the crater. They were about 600 meters north and about 175 meters west of the targeted landing site. This was of little concern though thanks to the capabilities of the rover.|$|R

40|$|Restricted area heterojunctions, {{an array}} of lead sulfide {{colloidal}} quantum dots (PbS-CQDs) and crystalline silicon, are studied with a non-destructive remote <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> beam induced current (RC-LBIC) technique. As well as getting good quality active area images we observed an anomalous unipolar signal response for the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices and a conventionally expected bipolar signal profile for the PbS-CQD/p-Si devices. Interestingly, our simulation results consistently yielded a unipolar and bipolar nature in the signals related to the PbSCQD/n-Si and PbS-CQD/p-Si heterostructures, respectively. In order to explain the physical mechanism involved in the unipolar signal response of the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices, we propose a model based on the band alignment in the heterojunctions, {{in addition to the}} distribution of photo-induced excess majority carriers across the junction. Given that the RC-LBIC technique is well suited to this context, the presence of these two distinct mechanisms (the bipolar and unipolar nature of the signals) needs to be considered {{in order to have a}} better interpretation of the data in the characterization of {{an array of}} homo/heterojunctions...|$|R
5000|$|Many schools {{feel it is}} {{important}} that karateka [...] "pull their punches". Karate training is designed to give its practitioners the ability to deliver devastating power through techniques like punches and kicks. Often the aim of training is that each single strike should be enough to subdue the opponent. However, this clearly would make it difficult to train due to the possibility of injury. Many beginners, while sparring, will be instructed to develop control and accuracy first, then speed and power later. In doing this, it may seem like the student is pulling his punches, when actually, he is developing technique first. For injury purposes, certain targets are discouraged, like strikes to the knee and face contact for low ranks. Many schools prohibit strikes to the groin, while others allow it completely. Some schools might limit <b>contact</b> to <b>light</b> <b>contact</b> all around, while others may employ power usage based on rank.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of fully flexible micromorph tandem solar cells directly on low cost substrates like PET and PEN. The cells are deposited in nip/nip configuration on the plastic substrate coated with a highly reflecting Ag-ZnO back <b>contact.</b> <b>Light</b> trapping is achieved by combining a periodically textured substrate and a diffusing ZnO front contact. Single junction microcrocystalline cell with a stable efficiency of 8. 6 % and 8. 4 % are achieved with i-layer thickness of 1. 8 and 1. 2 µm respectively. In tandem devices we obtain an efficiency of 10. 9 % (initial) with an open circuit voltage of 1. 35 V and a FF of 71. 5 %. These cells are slightly top limited with 11. 26 and 11. 46 mA/cm 2 in the amorphous (270 nm thick) and the microcrystalline sub-cells (1. 2 µm thick), respectively. We introduce an intermediate reflector between the bottom and the top cell because it allows increasing the top cell current without compromising stability by a thicker absorber. We present results on ex-situ ZnO and a new material, a low refractive index P-doped silicon-oxygen compound deposited in-situ by plasma process, in the same reactor as the micromorph cell...|$|R
