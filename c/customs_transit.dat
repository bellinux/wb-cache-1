The transit formality requires exporters to preform custom declaration in the local custom and to do a <b>custom</b> <b>transit</b> in the port of departure.

Although <b>custom</b> <b>transit</b> indeed safeguards the goods on the way, it actually complicates the custom clearance formalities and increases the transaction cost of the international trade.

The {{first part of the}} thesis provides the basic characteristic of individual customs procedures and it is focused on the area of customs operations. The following sections concentrate on the issue of "transit" customs procedure. The scope of the thesis is a general approach of the realisation of international transport in transit. It demonstrates the most important changes which were caused by the membership of the Czech Republic in the EU. The thesis emhasizes Community transit, Common transit betweeen the Community and the EFTA countries and the carriage of goods based on the customs documents TIR a ATA. Due to its importance for facilitating international trade a special attention is given to the TIR <b>customs</b> <b>transit</b> system...|$|E

5000|$|In 1988, {{when the}} two {{treaties}} were up for renewal, Nepal refused to accommodate India's wishes for a single trade and transit treaty stating that 'it violates the principle of freedom to trade'. Thereafter, both India and Nepal took a hard-line position {{that led to a}} serious crisis in India-Nepal relations. Nepalese leaders asserted the position that as per the UN charter, transit privileges were [...] "a fundamental and a permanent right of a land-locked country" [...] and thus India's demand for a single treaty was unacceptable. So, after two extensions, the two treaties expired on 23 March 1989, resulting in a virtual Indian economic blockade of Nepal that lasted until late April 1990. As time passed Indian economic sanctions over Nepal steadily widened. For example, preferential <b>customs</b> and <b>transit</b> duties on Nepalese goods entering or passing through India (whether imports or exports) were discontinued. Thereafter India let agreements relating to oil processing and warehouse space in Calcutta for goods destined to Nepal expire. Aside from these sanctions, India cancelled all trade credits it had previously extended to Nepal on a routine basis.|$|R
25|$|The {{reasons behind}} the {{construction}} of the Augustów Canal were both political and economic. In 1821 Prussia introduced repressively high <b>customs</b> duties for <b>transit</b> of Polish and Lithuanian goods through its territory, which practically blocked the access of Polish traders to the Baltic Sea through the Vistula River. In 1822 the Kingdom of Poland was granted commercial autonomy from Russian Empire's customs area. In the years 1823–1839 a waterway was constructed, bypassing the Prussian territory, intended eventually to link, via the Windawski Canal, the center of the Kingdom of Poland with the Baltic seaport of Ventspils. This goal was relinquished due to unrest caused by the 1830–1831 November Uprising against Russia and revised trade agreements with Prussia.|$|R

The conversion used a Dana 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three <b>custom</b> propshafts. The <b>Transit</b> rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305 mm diameter front brake discs.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we use the metaphors {{associated}} with travelling, i. e. going through <b>customs,</b> being in <b>transit,</b> luggage and baggage, to interrogate the micro-processes through which doctoral study makes a difference to professional life. For the professional, original doctoral knowledge arises through reflexively combining understandings from practice with academic practices of writing a thesis. The article builds upon critical examination of the trajectories of Lorri, Karen and Marcia {{at different stages of}} their doctoral studies, with the data comprising personal narratives of their professional activities in relation to their research studies. As doctoral study is a process and not an event, these relations change in emphasis over time. This approach yields discussion of critical and sometimes painful transitions such as adapting into research 'communities of practice'; distinctions between academic and professional writing; developing 'theoretical perspectives'; methodological and ethical considerations changing ways of seeing; and relations with supervisors. In pointing to these issues, the article raises the question of how doctoral pedagogy might take account of personal stories of transformation, as the doctoral candidate moves to become a producer of knowledge...|$|R
50|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the seaborne trade route was of less {{significance}} to the Persians than was the traditional Silk Route. Lack of investment in ship building and the navy provided the Europeans {{with the opportunity to}} monopolize this trading route. The land-borne trade would thus continue to provide the bulk of revenues to the Persian state. Much of the cash revenue came not so much from what could be sold abroad, as from the <b>custom</b> charges and <b>transit</b> dues levied on goods passing through the country. Shah Abbas was determined to greatly expand this trade, but faced the problem of having to deal with the Ottomans, who controlled the two most vital routes: the route across Arabia to the Mediterranean ports, and the route through Anatolia and Istanbul. A third route was therefore devised which circumvented Ottoman territory. By travelling across the Caspian sea to the north, they would reach Russia. And {{with the assistance of the}} Muscovy Company they could cross over to Moscow, reaching Europe via Poland. This trading route proved to be of vital importance, especially during times of war with the Ottomans.|$|R
40|$|Great Lavra of Saint Athanasius {{is one of}} the Mount Athos monasteries richly {{donated by}} Serbian rulers and noblemen with {{properties}} and material goods. The monastery was acquiring its properties by completing requests from abbot and monks, but also on the initiative of the founder himself. Depending on the situation, which was dictated by the current situation in the country, the estates were privileged to a certain extent. They were abolished in moments when the danger from the Ottomans was at a high level. The population of the monastery villages primarily had to participate in military service both materially and physically. In such circumstances they were exempt from those work obligations directly related to the ruler’s palace. House of Lazarević had issued a total of five charters in the period from 1394 / 1395 to 1427. Great Lavra received several villages: Kurilovo, Vrankovo, Šaludovac, Buljane, Izvor, Brnica and Kvasičevica, then had its property in Trg in Paraćinov Brod. It had revenue of <b>transit</b> <b>customs</b> in the village of Izvor and from customs office in Novo Brdo.

5000|$|The Sync Services for File Systems {{provider}} {{is used to}} synchronize two {{file system}} locations, which can either be local folders or network shares. In addition to mirroring new files, changes to existing files are also synchronized. Changes to files are detected by using timestamps, or optionally, by hashing the file contents. Conflicting changes to the same file are detected and can be set to be automatically resolved. For conflicting updates to a same file, the newer edit will be kept. If a file is deleted in one replica but updated in another, the update will take precedence over the delete. If two files with different content are created with the same name across two replicas, during the sync operation, the one created later will be persisted. If a rename operation caused the files {{to get the same}} name, both are retained by renaming one of them. Any deletes can be configured to move the file to the Recycle Bin, {{so that it can be}} recovered if necessary. The Sync Services for File Systems provider also provides a preview mode which enumerates the actions that will be taken for a sync operation, without actually performing the operations, with a view to letting the users review the changes that will be made. The synchronization is performed in a peer-to-peer manner. Neither Sync Framework or the Sync Services for File Systems provider perform any authentication before accessing the files; so any authentication is the job of the application using the Sync Framework API. The files are transferred without encryption. To use encryption in <b>transit,</b> <b>custom</b> providers that uses an encrypted TCP connection needs to be used. The Sync Services for File Systems provider also supports static filters to exclude files based on wildcards or attributes. In the first [...] release, however, the Sync Services for File Systems provider does not sync either NTFS security descriptors or Alternate Data Streams.|$|R
40|$|Since 1991 CTA {{has been}} {{implementing}} a programme to supply agricultural reference books to documentation centres within agricultural educational institutions in ACP countries. Technical and educational reference publications are supplied {{in accordance with}} the needs expressed by the users. The programme is intended to improve the performance of the documentation centres in particular and, more generally, the institution itself. In practice, each benefiting centre chooses for itself the books which it judges will be of greatest value to its users. Between 1991 and 1994, 71 national centres of agricultural documentation and information were {{able to take advantage of}} the service and increase their stock of publications. (See also Spore 40, p 9) Following an evaluation of the DORA programme and a meeting of representatives from the benefiting centres, DORA has, since 1995, focused on agricultural educational institutions and now targets students, teachers, scientists and senior technicians in the agricultural sector. In the francophone ACP countries, 22 institutions have benefited from the service during 1995 - 96 (see box) and 44 centres in anglophone ACP countries will benefit from the programme between 1996 and 1998. Each site receives on average 300 reference books. Single copies will be provided of 70 % of the titles requested and up to a maximum of four copies each can be provided for the remaining 30 %. Postage, <b>customs</b> duty or <b>transit</b> costs are the responsibility of the beneficiary. The books can be of any type provided that they relate to agriculture, the only exclusions being encyclopaedias and subscriptions to, or photocopied extracts of, periodicals. Documentation officers in charge of the DORA sites receive a short training course and/or self-teaching materials and they have the opportunity to participate in meetings at which they can share their experiences with others in the programme. They also receive a number of supporting documents, in particular a handbook, details of how to make requests, a questionnaire for evaluating the service and promotional material (posters and brochures) for bringing the DORA service to the attention of users.
