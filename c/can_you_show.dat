500|$|Since [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was not a}} {{song that}} McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's {{appropriation}} of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me where you are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E
2500|$|Howe {{made his}} NHL debut on October 16, 1946, playing right wing for the Detroit Red Wings, scoring {{in his first}} game at the age of 18. [...] He wore #17 as a rookie. However, when Roy Conacher moved on to the Chicago Black Hawks after the 1946–47 season, Howe was offered Conacher's #9, which he would wear {{for the rest of his}} career; {{although}} he had not requested the change, Howe accepted it when he was informed that [...] "9" [...] would entitle him to a lower Pullman berth on road trips. He quickly established himself as a great goalscorer and a gifted playmaker with a willingness to fight. Howe fought so often in his rookie season that coach Jack Adams told him, [...] "I know you can fight. Now <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me you can play hockey?" [...] The term [...] "Gordie Howe hat trick" [...] (consisting of a goal, an assist, and a fight) was coined in reference to his penchant for fighting; however, Howe himself only recorded two such hat tricks in his career, on October 10, 1953 and March 21, 1954. [...] Using his great physical strength, he was able to dominate the opposition in a career that spanned six decades (including one game with the Detroit Vipers of the IHL in 1997). In a feat unsurpassed by any hockey player, he finished in the top five in scoring for 20 straight seasons. Howe also scored 20 or more goals in 22 consecutive seasons between 1949 and 1971, an NHL record.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
