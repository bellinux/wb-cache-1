25|$|Many of {{the routes}} for <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry</b> are very dangerous. There were 72 {{documented}} deaths that {{are thought to}} have occurred while entering UK between 1993 and 2002. The most common cause of death while entering the UK (61 of the deaths recorded) was suffocation in a lorry while being smuggled into the UK by ferry; Others drowned in the English Channel, froze to death as stowaways on an aeroplane and were crushed by trains in the Channel Tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the system}} is that it provides a single point of failure for security. If the key to a district's Knox-Box is stolen or copied, a thief can enter any building that has a Knox-Box. Sometimes a building manager wires the building's Knox-Box into a burglar alarm system so that opening the box trips the alarm, negating its use in facilitating <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry.</b> All Knox commercial boxes have a standard tamper switch for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Political boss Thomas J. Pendergast {{purchased}} the Monroe Hotel in 1924, and he hired Sanneman {{to design a}} two-story building adjacent to {{the south side of}} the hotel that would serve as the headquarters for his Jackson County Democratic Club. Pendergast operated out of the two-story building at 1908 Main until the late 1930s. Pendergast had a doorway installed between his second floor office and the hotel, giving him a <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry</b> point and access to the hotel's elevator. After Pendergast's release from prison for income tax evasion, a Federal Court ordered the doorway to be sealed and barred Pendergast from any further political activity. The hotel closed its doors in 1971.|$|E

50|$|On February 19, 1975, four {{captured}} MIR commanders went {{on national}} television to urge their guerrillas {{to lay down their}} arms. According to them, the MIR leadership was in ruins: of the 52 commanders of the MIR, nine had been killed, 24 were prisoners, ten were in exile, one had been expelled from the group, and eight were still at large. On 18 November 1975, MIR guerrillas killed a 19-year-old army conscript (Private Hernán Patricio Salinas Calderón). On 24 February 1976, MIR guerrillas in a gunbattle with Chilean secret police, shot and killed a 41-year-old carabinero sergeant (Tulio Pereira Pereira). The Chilean secret police on this occasion were met with a hail of automatic weapons fire, killing a carabinero and a girl. On 28 April 1976, MIR guerrillas shot and killed a 29-year-old carabineros corporal (Bernardo Arturo Alcayaga Cerda) while he was walking home in the Santiago suburb of Pudahuel. On 16 October 1977, MIR guerrillas exploded 10 bombs in Santiago. In 1978 the MIR sought to reestablish a guerrilla front in southern Chile and launched Operation Return which involved <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry,</b> recruitment, bombings and bank robberies in Santiago that briefly shook the military regime. In February 1979 MIR guerrillas bombed the US-Chile Cultural Institute in Santiago, causing considerable damage. In 1979, about 40 bombings were blamed on MIR guerrillas. Several police, military and civilians caught in the crossfire and bomb blasts were killed in the renewed MIR attacks in the Chilean capital and at least 70 soldiers and policemen were wounded battling the marxist guerrillas.|$|E

Her experi-ence and those of many other Tlacotepenses offer a corrective to the con-ventional wisdom that potential migrants underestimate the dif!culty of unauthorized crossings and will give up and go home after one or two failed entry attempts. Potential migrants do not make their decision to cross the border unsystematically. They weigh the bene!ts of migrating to the United States against the potential costs of a <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry</b> and present conditions in Mexico. Like Briseida, many migrants will persist in border-crossing attempts until they are successful. Although previous research suggests that U.

40|$|Irregular {{migration}} {{is a global}} topic which currently occupies a central position especially in Europe. Illegal migration as a concept covers a number of rather different issues. We can find different terms as <b>clandestine</b> migration, illegal <b>entry,</b> irregular migrant, undocumented migrant irregular migration etc., to name the phenomenon of illegal entry, illegal stay or overstaying a visa-free travel period. In the context of legal instruments and recommendations of the United Nations and European Union, this article tries to present the multitude of terms and definitions concerning the phenomenon of migration that is unusual to rules and regulations, and its authors who neither recognise nor follow legal migration procedure. The article also endeavours to present the terms which are mostly used in legal discourse and examples of particular acts and contexts {{in which they are}} used...|$|R
40|$|The Conservative {{government}} applied restrictive {{immigration policies}} on people from the Indian sub-continent (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) {{on a large scale}} during the 1980 s for reasons which have been depicted as economic, political, and nationalistic. The Conservative party under Thatcher made immigration control one of its main themes in the 1979 Conservative Manifesto. This thesis looks at the repercussions of Thatcher's immigration policy for people from the Indian sub-continent living in Glasgow. Drawing on a wealth of primary sources, the thesis will argue that Thatcher's immigration policy amounted to discrimination as Indian sub-continent nationals, especially males, suffered unfairly when the policy was implemented. Evidence of this unfairness was implicit in: the various rules and laws which contained elements of discrimination; and evidence from the organisation network in Glasgow which revealed that they had to deal with extra work and with more contentious cases during the 1980 s. The impact on individuals was most strongly exemplified by a survey and by individual case studies which revealed problems such as provocative questioning, application of stringent criteria to satisfy the authorities, and the break-up and separation of families who were prevented from being reunited, in some cases even temporarily, by the actions of the authorities. The fact is that no account was taken of the clinical characteristics of the Indian sub-continent which clashed in particular with the primary purpose rule which the authorities applied rigorously. While it is acknowledged that other groups of blacks and coloured immigrants also suffered from the Conservative immigration regime, it will be noted that the impact was most severe on immigrants from the Indian sub-continent. The tough policy on immigration only served to encourage more <b>clandestine</b> means of <b>entry</b> into the United Kingdom, and this gave the government a further pretext to impose more controls on immigration from the Indian sub continent. It has to be emphasised that the extent of the restrictive immigration control regime will be measured not simply in terms of numbers allowed entry but also the procedures used such as the type of questions asked, interviewing techniques and manners, and various provisions made in legislative acts which served against potential immigrants from the Indian sub-continent...|$|R
40|$|As {{smuggling}} costs {{across the}} U. S. -Mexico border have increased, a shift {{has occurred in}} the types of migrants able to afford the costs. Potential unauthorized migrants often face a liquidity constraint such that they cannot borrow against their future earnings to pay the cost for <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry.</b> In this paper I model the decision to migrate with this liquidity constraint and the ability for U. S. social networks to alleviate these constraints. The model predicts (i) an increase in smuggling fees intensifies intermediate self-selection of migrants, (ii) an increase in US wages increases migration among higher ability types, and (iii) social networks enable lower ability types to migrate. The predictions of the model are tested by estimating migration behavior in low-cost and highcost migration periods. In the high-cost period relative to the low-cost period, I find evidence of an intensification of intermediate self-selection. Moreover, social networks increase migration among low-income earners in the high-cost period. In the model calibrated using U. S. -Mexico data, I find the smuggling fees are an important component of who migrates...|$|E
40|$|In {{a simple}} model that {{includes}} the prerequisite that migrants ac-quire capital for <b>clandestine</b> <b>entry</b> into the United States, {{the impact of the}} tripling of smuggling costs on low-income potential migrants is considered. This paper finds the migration rate in a given year is sig-nificantly reduced by an increase in coyote fees and the migration rate is not altered when the job-finding rate is held constant over the busi-ness cycle. Moreover, the escalation of the coyote fees resulted in an increase in inequality in sending villages. The findings of the model are tested by estimating the migration behavior in low-cost and high-cost migration periods controlling for the reduction in migration costs that results from more dense social networks in the United States. Commu-nities without dense social networks observed a reduction in migration among low-income potential migrants in the high-cost period. In con-trast, communities with dense social networks in the United States experienced similar rates of migration among different income groups in the low-cost and the high-cost periods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Just {{like other}} {{countries}} in Southern Europe, Italy has, {{in the course of}} less than two decades rapidly and unexpectedly changed from a country of emigration into one of immigration. Italy has witnessed a steady {{increase in the number of}} foreign nationals during the period between 1986 and 2002. On 1 January 2004, there were an estimated 2. 6 million foreigners present in Italy, who account for approximately 4. 2 % of the total resident population. Most of these immigrants are young people (aged between 20 and 40 years) who emigrated mainly for economic reasons. Already in 2001, more than half (about 59 %) of the immigrant population had lived in Italy for more than five years. Acquisition of Italian citizenship, given the difficulties posed by the law currently in force, is still infrequent, with a high rejection rate. Immigration towards Italy did not begin in a period of reconstruction and economic development, as it did in North-Western European nations, but rather during time of a severe economic crisis, characterized, among others, by growing unemployment. Italy has developed a piecemeal approach to immigration, lacking until recently of a comprehensive and consistent policy framework. Several regularisation programmes were enacted since the late 1980 s (five times in sixteen years: 1986, 1990, 1996, 1998 and 2002), allowing the legalisation of more than 2 million immigrants. Nevertheless, these ‘amnesties’ did not solve the problem of undocumented migration. The 2002 regularisation brought to the fore a large number (700, 000 approx) of undocumented migrants working as care providers, domestic helpers and manufacture workers. The first comprehensive law on migration was law 40 / 1998 (the Single text - Testo Unico) which regulated not only immigration control but also immigrant integration. This law was more recently modified by law 189 / 2002 (the so-called Bossi-Fini Law) which introduced small changes in relation to asylum, as well as modified the work/stay permit system in use. Italy, because of her geographical position, is highly exposed to penetration by illegal immigrants from the South and from the East. Moreover, Italy as other southern EU countries, has a widespread informal economy that appears to be a prime determinant for illegal migration. Combating undocumented immigration and the trafficking of human beings is a priority both in terms of security and foreign policy, a priority to which public opinion is also sensitive. During the last two decades, the Italian mass media have promoted a negative and highly stereotyped image of immigrants. The main criticism against the media is the tendency to transmit alarmist information on immigration. News reports have been linking immigration and undocumented (<b>clandestine)</b> <b>entry</b> to Italy, transforming all immigrants into ‘illegal’ ‘criminals’ ‘threats’ in the ‘common imaginary’. Several NGOS, trade unions and charitable organisations have been active since the 1980 s providing assistance to undocumented immigrants who wished to obtain legal status. To facilitate contacts, these organisations encouraged the civic participation of immigrants and their involvement in representative bodies. Furthermore, these organisations provided support to immigrant associations. Immigrant participation in trade unions, voluntary organisations and immigrants associations ensures their access to what is called ‘intermediate political rights’. From an institutional perspective, civic and political participation remains mostly the realm of Italian citizens and naturalised immigrants. This paper gives an overview on the arguments relevant for immigrant civic participation. The paper is divided in two parts. The first part concerns the conditions for immigrant civic participation in Italy: (1) key events and demographic developments in the migration history of country; (2) public discourse on migration (i. e., the current public discussion on migration related issues and the major topics that receive media attention); (3) institutional setting framing immigrant participation (the current major legal and institutional conditions that are important for immigrants civic participation, trying to differentiate between restrictive and encouraging conditions). The second part of the paper concerns an overview of the literature on active civic participation of third country immigrants in Italy. In the annex we provide for a mapping of the research competencies on immigrant civic participation and immigration in general...|$|E
