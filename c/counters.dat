5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, <b>counters</b> 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these <b>counters</b> in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, {{they would have to}} go to an airline representative at the <b>counters.</b>|$|E
5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch <b>counters.</b> At the time, African Americans were allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch <b>counters</b> were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, six {{downtown}} stores {{opened their}} lunch <b>counters</b> to black customers {{for the first}} time. The customers arrived in groups {{of two or three}} during the afternoon and were served without incident. At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old boycott of the downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the lunch <b>counters</b> were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the South to begin desegregating its public facilities.|$|E

5|$|The French TOURNESOL {{instrument}} {{consisted of}} four proportional <b>counters</b> and two optical detectors. The proportional <b>counters</b> detected photons between 2keV and 20MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors {{had a field}} of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events.|$|E
5|$|A rumor {{started by}} the devoted Norton caricaturist Ed Jump claims he had two dogs, Bummer and Lazarus, which were also San Francisco celebrities. Though he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch <b>counters</b> where he shared his meals with the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan <b>counters,</b> breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes {{the form of the}} serpent Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha <b>counters</b> this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours the serpent army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch <b>counters.</b> In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch <b>counters</b> resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch <b>counters.</b> Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch <b>counters</b> and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch <b>counters,</b> the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. Sit-in participants, who consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch <b>counters</b> when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch <b>counters</b> in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached {{during the first week of}} May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch <b>counters</b> for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch <b>counters</b> were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the <b>counters,</b> crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|A 1927 {{chemistry}} {{graduate of}} the University of California at Berkeley, from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger <b>counters</b> to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity.

40|$|Description The ICM 7226 is a fully {{integrated}} Universal <b>Counter</b> and LED display driver. It combines a high frequency oscillator, a decade timebase <b>counter,</b> an 8 -decade data <b>counter</b> and latches, a 7 -segment decoder, digit multiplexer and segment and digit drivers which can directly drive large LED displays. The <b>counter</b> inputs accept a maximum frequency of 10 MHz in frequency and unit <b>counter</b> modes and 2 MHz {{in the other}} modes. Both inputs are digital inputs. In many applications, amplification and level shifting {{will be required to}} obtain proper digital signals for these inputs. The ICM 7226 can function as a frequency <b>counter,</b> period <b>counter,</b> frequency ratio (f A /f B) <b>counter,</b> time interval <b>counter</b> or as a totalizing <b>counter.</b> The devices require either a 10 MHz or 1 MHz quartz crystal timebase, or if desired a...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, {{the airport}} {{introduced}} Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE), {{becoming the first}} airport {{in the country to}} do so.
