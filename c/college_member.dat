2500|$|Hawking {{began his}} {{university}} education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 {{at the age}} of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonelyhe [...] found the academic work [...] "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, [...] "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it." [...] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort [...] "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty <b>college</b> <b>member,</b> interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.|$|E
