However, pregnant women and new mothers might have specific concerns about animal-associated health outcomes because of their altered immune function and posture as well as their newborn babies. The study was conducted to collect baseline data for developing an evidence-based intervention for pregnant women and new mothers to help them adopt certain behaviors to prevent adverse animal-associated health outcomes. A survey, using the Health Belief Model as the theoretical framework, was developed and administered to 326 women attending the Women, Infants, and Children programs in Illinois and Indiana in 2015. Prevalence of dog and cat ownership was estimated to be 39 % (95 % CI 33 %– 45 %) and 26 % (95 % CI 21 %– 31 %), respectively. Regardless of pet ownership, 74 % of the respondents reported having some type of animal contact in the past month. Pregnancy or the birth of a child altered some animal contact practices among the study participants; particularly a discontinuation or decrease in cleaning cat litter boxes. Reports of diseases contracted from animals were low (4 %) in this study. By contrast, animal-associated injuries were prevalent (42 %), and the majority were caused by animals the respondents owned (56 %). Overall, respondents indicated that they appreciated the benefits of a program addressing animal-associated health outcomes and did not indicate strong resistance to adopting certain behaviors. The majority recognized human health-care providers as a source of information about animal <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> health outcomes but less frequently identified veterinarians as a source for such information. In addition, although most of the respondents felt that health-care providers and veterinarians should initiate discussions about preventing animal-associated illness and injuries, only 41 % among those who had visited doctors or prenatal care services reported that their health-care providers discussed these issues with them. The results indicate the importance of an intervention concerning animal <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> health outcomes for the target population and provide insights to the potential implications of program implementation...|$|R

It results in a mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> stress distribution, which may be an initiation point for failure modes such as fatigue, fretting or wear. In this study the reflection of ultrasound is used to investigate how real engineering components contact. It is a non-intrusive technique preserving the mechanics of the contact. The concept is simple; an acoustic wave bounces back from an incomplete interface. The higher the contact load, the more conformal will be the <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> hence more of the wave will be transmitted. A spring model is used to determine maps of contact stiffness from contact ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure is then used to determine the pressure. The technique has been used to study two railway engineering applications. The first was a wheel/rail contact. Measurements were taken using specimens cut from sections of wheel and rail.

This paper describes an investigation into multilingual language practices in four changing UK cities, using Linguistic Ethnography. The study’s own approach to ethical practice is first evaluated. I then ask how increased study of multilingualism can contribute to interpreters’ and translators’ work and how this work fits with contemporary patterns of language use, drawing on Brecher’s (2010) distinction between the ethical and moral.

40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} (periodic surface irregularities at distinct wavelengths) is {{a problem}} experienced by many railway networks worldwide. Corrugation induces a pronounced dynamic wheel‒rail contact loading that leads to increased generation of noise and in severe cases even damage to vehicle and track components. The large magnitude creep forces and sliding between wheel and rail make corrugation especially prone to develop on curved track. The current work summarizes the results from a Master Thesis project performed in collaboration between Chalmers, ÅF Industry, Bombardier Transportation and Stockholm Public Transport. A time-domain model for the prediction of long-term growth of rail roughness has been developed, see Figure 1. Dynamic vehicle‒track interaction in a broad frequency range (at least up to 300 Hz) is simulated using the commercial software SIMPACK.

40|$|Background: Micro-organisms {{transmitted}} from vertebrate animals - including livestock - to humans account {{for an estimated}} 60 % of human pathogens. Micro-organisms can be transmitted through inhalation, ingestion, via conjunctiva or physical contact. Close contact with animals is crucial for transmission. The role of intensity <b>and</b> type of <b>contact</b> patterns between livestock and humans for disease transmission is poorly understood. In this systematic review we aimed to summarise current knowledge regarding patterns of human-livestock <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> their role in micro-organism transmission. Methods: We included peer-reviewed publications published between 1996 and 2014 in our systematic review if they reported on human-livestock contacts, human cases of livestock-related zoonotic diseases or serological epidemiology of zoonotic diseases in human samples. We extracted any information pertaining the type and intensity of human-livestock <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> zoonoses. Results: 1522 papers were identified, 75 were included: 7 reported on incidental zoonoses after brief animal-human contacts (e. g. farm visits), 10 on environmental exposures and 15 on zoonoses in developing countries where backyard livestock keeping is still customary. 43 studies reported zoonotic risks in different occupations. Occupations at risk included veterinarians, culling personnel, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. For culling personnel, more hours exposed to livestock resulted in more frequent occurrence of transmission. Slaughterhouse workers in contact with live animals were more often positive for zoonotic micro-organisms compared to co-workers only exposed to carcasses. Overall, little information was available about the actual mode of micro-organism transmission. Conclusions: Little {{is known about the}} intensity <b>and</b> type of <b>contact</b> patterns between livestock and humans that result in micro-organism transmission. Studies performed in occupational settings provide some, but limited evidence of exposure response-like relationships for livestock-human <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> micro-organism transmission.

Our DBCs consisted of global positioning system collars with attached motion-activated trail cameras. We obtained 21, 474 video clips from 17 functional DBCs over a period of 14 days. Individual-based data are invaluable in disease and population modeling; therefore, we confirmed the identify of 37 individual deer in field of view of DBCs based on ear tags, collar numbers, and antler characteristics (e. g., point counts, relative mass, tine length).

METHOD: data from a recent population survey of women birthing in Queensland, Australia were used {{to describe}} the nature of the first hold <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> demographic characteristics. Initial comparisons, with subsequent adjustment for type of birthing facility and mode of childbirth, were used to assess associations between timing, type and duration of initial <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. Further analyses were conducted to investigate a dose-response relationship between duration of first <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> outcomes. FINDINGS: women who had an unassisted vaginal birth held their infant sooner, and for longer than women who had an assisted vaginal birth or caesarean and were more satisfied with their early contact. Multivariate models showed a number of demographic and clinical interventions contributing to timing, duration and type of first contact with type of birthing facility (public/private), area of residence, and assisted birth as prominent factors. For women who had a vaginal birth; early, skin-to-skin, and longer duration of initial contact were associated with high rates of breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding at discharge, but not breastfeeding at 13 weeks. Some aspects of early contact were associated with improved maternal well being. However, these associations were not found for women who had a caesarean birth. With longer durations of first contact, a dose-response effect was found for breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: results of the study provide a description of current practice in Queensland, Australia and factors impacting on early contact. For vaginal births, findings add to the evidence in support of early skin-to-skin contact for an extended period. It is suggested that all research in this area should consider the effects of early contact separately for women having vaginal and caesarean births. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: care providers should consider extending the period of early contact in routine care following vaginal birth and explore the way in which women having a caesarean birth might be better supported in benefitting from early contact with their infant...|$|R

The present study aims at investigating how the anticipatory neural processes of active romantic caress are modulated by {{the intensity of the}} desire for affective contact as reflected by passionate feelings for the other. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning was performed in romantically involved partners using a paradigm that allowed to isolate the specific anticipatory representations of active romantic caress, compared with control caress, while testing for the relationship between neural activity and measures of feelings of passionate love for the other. The results demonstrated that right posterior insula activity in anticipation of romantic caress significantly co-varied with the intensity of desire for union with the other. This effect was independent of the sensory-affective properties of the performed touch, like its pleasantness. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis showed that the same posterior insula cluster interacted with brain regions related to sensory-motor functions {{as well as to the}} processing and anticipation of reward. The findings provide insight on the neural substrate mediating between the desire for and the performance of romantic caress.
