25|$|Jean Bodin (1530–1596) was a French Catholic jurist and {{political}} philosopher. His Latin work Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis ("The Colloqium of the Seven") portrays a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. All agree {{to live in}} mutual respect and tolerance.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} of breastfeeding during early prenatal care can positively effect a woman's likelihood to breastfeed her child. During regular checkups, a woman's physician, midwife or other healthcare provider can initiate a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> benefits of breastfeeding, which can influence {{a woman to}} breastfeed her child {{for a longer period}} of time than she might have otherwise. In addition, the involvement of lactation consultants in the prenatal visits of low-income women increases the likelihood that they will breastfeed.|$|E

Also, mothers' <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future {{is more complex}} than their <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past. <b>Conversations</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future, which use more hypothetical language and conventional time markers (e.g., [...] "tomorrow", [...] "next week", [...] "next year"), tend to relate to general knowledge about events, compared to specific events <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past. In addition, mothers' future talk actively involves children in their future and planning, which also gives children opportunities to learn time-related concepts and gain knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|R

25|$|In the film, the {{evolution}} of the human race is traced from prehistory (mankind as blob forms), through today (mankind as teeming crowds of selfish, fighting, or lost individuals), to hundreds of millions of years into the future as our species evolves into countless new forms; all of them still behaving the same way. The film concludes in the extreme future, with two creatures (apparently an adult and child subspecies of future human), having a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> meaning of life on a colorful shore.|$|E

Major subsequent developments include forbidding the death penalty for rape (Coker v. Georgia), restricting the death penalty in cases of felony murder (Enmund v. Florida), exempting the mentally handicapped (Atkins v. Virginia) and juvenile murderers (Roper v. Simmons) from the death penalty, removing virtually all limitations on the presentation of mitigating evidence (Lockett v. Ohio, Holmes v. South Carolina), requiring precision in the definition of aggravating factors (Godfrey v. Georgia, Walton v. Arizona), and requiring the jury to decide whether aggravating factors have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt (Ring v. Arizona).|$|E
25|$|Harrisburg's {{movement}} of beautification and improvement {{was one of}} the earliest and most successful urban reform movements in the country. It began when local minded residents became convinced that their city was unattractive, unhealthy, and filthy, and lacked the appearance and facilities appropriate to its status as Pennsylvania's state capital. The causes of the city's defects were well known: industrialization in the previous half century had left the city poorly planned with unpaved streets and undeveloped water management systems. Residents of Harrisburg suffered disease and illnesses caused by the lack of good filtration systems that could filter the sewage dumped by populations further up the Susquehanna River. A disastrous fire that consumed the state capitol in 1897 had spawned new <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> suitability of Harrisburg as a state capital.|$|E

Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very hands-off sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E

Hilliard was made responsible for the concept and design of the project. Lansing Manufacturing was tapped to develop the drive units while Hilliard worked to improve the electronic components. What came out of this collaboration was a well-received industry standard loudspeaker system, [...] "The Shearer Horn System for Theatres" [...] (1937), that garnered a technical award [...] "Oscar" [...] for sound from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} several cultural references. Murray {{is wearing}} a New Zealand All Blacks rugby shirt when the band is in Dave's pawn shop obtaining a camera. In the same scene, Murray and Bret have a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> band Fleetwood Mac and their album [...] "Rumours". Rhys Darby, who played Murray, later asked Mick Fleetwood, the drummer for the band, if he heard the joke {{and whether or not}} he enjoyed it. Fleetwood admitted that he [...] "appreciate" [...] the joke. During the filming of the video for [...] "Robots", Jemaine tells Murray that he wanted robot costumes [...] "like Daft Punk" [...] rather than the amateur versions hand-crafted by Murray. Murray replies with a characteristic lack of musical knowledge: [...] "I don't know who he is." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} an elaborate gatefold mural featuring a fantasy landscape of mushrooms (referencing the psychedelic drug) and fairies, drawn by Powell and J. F. Holmes. [...] "It {{told a story}} of happy, mystical brotherhood that was receding ever further into fantasy as the band grappled with the tragedy of Duane's death," [...] according to biographer Alan Paul. There was very little planning involved in the piece, which was created when the duo were in Vero Beach, Florida. When one would be drawing or painting the image, another would be swimming in the ocean. [...] "We swapped off this way with virtually no <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> drawing, just fluid trade-offs," [...] said Powell. The art was created on a large illustration board, [...] "on a one-to-one scale—it {{was the size of}} the actual spread," [...] according to Powell. Holmes' work is featured largely on the left, with Powell's on the right. Both were [...] "profoundly influenced" [...] by Early Netherlandish painter Hieronymous Bosch on the piece.|$|E

500|$|The Act of Killing was {{screened}} only in underground venues in Indonesia, but {{its success}} led to media coverage there, generating controversy and opening a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past. In Oppenheimer's BAFTAs acceptance speech, {{he reported that}} the subject is receiving more attention, and that the film [...] "is helping to catalyse a change in how Indonesia talks about its past". Oppenheimer also used the platform afforded by the awards {{to call attention to}} the [...] "collective responsibility" [...] of the United States and United Kingdom for [...] "participating and ignoring" [...] the crimes of 1965–66. When it was nominated for an Academy Award, the Indonesian government responded with a full-page statement about the killings and the film in the Jakarta Globe. The response marks the first time the government has admitted wrongdoing. The nomination also stoked controversy in China, where it had not been well-known that Chinese people were the target of a significant amount of the violence.|$|E
500|$|Whedon's {{rejection}} of the [...] "very special episode" [...] format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within [...] "The Body". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the [...] "lesbian kiss episode" [...] in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it {{the primary focus of}} the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was [...] "not negotiable". According to Whedon, the <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was [...] "true to character" [...] and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.|$|E
500|$|According to the Wachowskis, {{the origins}} of Sense8 date back several years before the {{announcement}} of the show to [...] "a late-night <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ways technology simultaneously unites and divides us". Straczynski recalls that when the Wachowskis decided to create their first series, because of Straczynski's extensive experience working with the format, Lana chose to invite him to her house in San Francisco to brainstorm ideas together. Both the Wachowskis and Straczynski agreed that if they were to do a television series, they wanted to attempt something that [...] "nobody had done before", and change the [...] "vocabulary for television production" [...] the same way The Matrix became a major influence for action movies. After several days of discussion they decided on creating a show that would explore the relationship between empathy and evolution in the human race, and whose story would be told in a global scale, necessitating filming on location in several countries over the world, in contrast to the standard production model for television which attempts to limit or fake that as much as possible. A source of inspiration for Straczynski was his own experience concerning friends of his who live {{in different parts of the}} world but coordinate to watch a movie at the same time and comment to each other online about it.|$|E
