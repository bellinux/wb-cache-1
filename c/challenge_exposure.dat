40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the threshold duration of exposure needed to elicit an asthmatic reaction during specific inhalation challenges (SIC) with various occupational agents and to determine the duration of exposure that should be completed before the test can be considered negative. MethodsThis retrospective study analysed the cumulative duration of <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> that was required to elicit a ≥ 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second in 335 consecutive subjects with a positive SIC. ResultsThe threshold duration of <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> required to induce an asthmatic reaction was ≤ 60  min in 179 (53 %) subjects, between 61 and 120  min in 74 (22 %) subjects, and longer than 120  min in 82 (25 %) subjects. The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that a longer duration of exposure was associated with exposure to low-molecular-weight agents (p <  0. 001), a higher level of baseline non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine (p =  0. 015), increasing age (p =  0. 011), and a shorter duration of asthma symptoms at work (p =  0. 060). ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the sensitivity of SICs for diagnosing OA is highly dependent upon the duration of the <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure.</b> These data may provide useful guidance for improving the reliability of SICs performed with realistic methods of exposure...|$|E

40|$|Malignant gliomas {{account for}} 35 - 45 % of primary brain tumors; among these {{glioblastoma}} multiforme (GBM) {{is the most}} common adult brain tumor constituting approximately 85 %. Its incidence is quite less in the pediatric population and treatment of these patients is particularly <b>challenging.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to ionizing radiation is the only environmental factor found to have any significant association with GBM. Several genetic alterations associated with GBM in adults have been well documented such as epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, overexpression of mouse double minute 2 homolog also known as E 3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, Phosphatase and tensin homolog gene mutation, loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10 p and isocitrate dehydrogenase- 1 mutation. However, data on genetic mutations in pediatric GBM is still lacking. Exophytic brain stem gliomas are rare tumors and are usually associated with a poor prognosis. The most effective treatment in achieving long-term survival in such patients, is surgical excision of the tumor and then chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy by temozolomide.

Studies examining related roles indicate protective psychological factors may help maintain staff well-being.

Participants (N = 99) were recruited from six organisations providing autism-specific adult services within Scotland. A series of binary logistic regressions demonstrated weekly <b>challenging</b> behaviour <b>exposure</b> (compared to monthly or daily) significantly increased the likelihood of anxiety caseness.

40|$|In {{plants and}} animals, induced {{resistance}} (IR) to biotic and abiotic stress {{is associated with}} priming of cells for faster and stronger activation of defense responses. It has been hypothesized that cell priming involves accumulation of latent signaling components that are not used until <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> to stress. However, the identity of such signaling components has remained elusive. Here, we show that during development of chemically induced resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, priming is associated with accumulation of mRNA and inactive proteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK 3 and MPK 6. Upon <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> to biotic or abiotic stress, these two enzymes were more strongly activated in primed plants than in nonprimed plants.

Of six macaques exposed to the less-pathogenic virus SIVMNE, four resisted viral infection. Analysis of the susceptibility of the PBMC of these four animals before SIVMNE challenge indicated {{that all of them}} were resistant to infection by the SIVBK 28 isolate and, in three of them, this resistance was dependent on CD 8 + T cells.

It has been hypothesized that cell priming involves accumulation of latent signaling components that are inactive until <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> to stress. However, the identity of such signaling components has remained elusive. Here I show using various chemical compounds or inoculation with avirulent bacterial pathogens, that induction of the primed state of Arabidopsis thaliana, requires accumulation of mRNA and inactive protein of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPK) 3 and MPK 6. Only upon <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> to biotic or abiotic stress, MPK 3 /MPK 6 enzymes were strongly activated in primed plants, resulting in enhanced defense gene expression and manifestation of acquired immunity.

The microbeam irradiation sys-tem (Single-Particle Irradiation System to Cell, acronym as SPICE) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Japan, was employed to control and accurately quantify the number of protons at very low doses, viz., about 100 μGy. The embryos were dechorionated at 4 h post fertilization (hpf) and irradi-ated at 5 hpf by microbeam protons. For each embryo, ten irradiation points were arbitrarily chosen with-out overlapping with one another. To each irradiation point, 5, 10 or 20 protons each with an energy of 3. 4 MeV were delivered.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between environmental stress exposure and ageing {{is likely to}} vary with stressor severity, life-history stage and the time scale over which effects are measured. Such factors could influence whether stress exposure accelerates or slows the ageing process, but their interactions have not previously been experimentally investigated. We found that experimental exposure of zebra finches to mildly challenging environmental circumstances from young to old adulthood, which increased exposure to stress hormones, reduced breeding performance during early adulthood, but had positive effects when individuals were bred in old adulthood. This difference was not due to selective mortality, because the effects were evident within individuals, and no evidence of habituation in {{the response to the}} stressor was found. The more stressful environment had no effects on survival during young or old adulthood, but substantially improved survival during middle age. Changes in the effects at different ages could be due to the duration and nature of the <b>challenging</b> <b>exposure,</b> or to variation in coping capacity or strategy with age. These results show that living under challenging environmental circumstances can influence ageing trajectories in terms of both reproductive performance and longevity. Our results provide experimental support for the emerging idea that stress exposure needs to be optimized rather than minimized to obtain the best health outcomes.

Depletion of CD 4 + cells was performed in the immunized macaques at the peak of SIV-specific CD 4 + T-cell responses following the DNA prime dose. A group of naïve macaques was also treated with the anti-CD 4 depleting antibody as a control, and an additional group of macaques immunized under normal conditions was depleted of CD 8 + T cells prior to <b>challenge</b> <b>exposure</b> to SIVmac 251.
