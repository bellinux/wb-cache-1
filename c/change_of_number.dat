5000|$|During 2014, in September and October, {{filming of}} the Top Gear special in Argentina {{was being done}} by the presenters, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, {{alongside}} a crew of 29 people, with the group using three cars for a road trip {{across the country and}} its neighbour of Chile. However, controversy arose when an incident occurred during filming, which received extensive coverage by the media in both Britain and Argentina. Whilst the crew and presenters were travelling south to Ushuaia, comments emerged on Twitter which alleged that the number plate [...] "H982 FKL" [...] on the Porsche 928 GT being driven by Clarkson, was a direct reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Upon the comments being seen by one of the film crew, the number plate was substituted with one that read [...] "H1 VAE". However, when the group arrived in Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego on 2 October, in which they had planned to film in the city for three more days before continuing to Chile, a large protest had formed, consisting of Argentinian veterans of the Falklands War who claimed the group were deliberately referencing the war, despite the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>number</b> plate, forcing the crew and presenters to stay at a hotel while discussions commenced between the producers and representatives of the protesters to calm the tension down. Andy Wilman, executive producer for the show, said on 2 October that [...] "Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue." [...] On the same day, Clarkson tweeted [...] "For once, we did nothing wrong." [...] "H982 FKL" [...] has been registered to the Porsche since its manufacture in May 1991. Clarkson later wrote for The Sunday Times that he [...] "had to hide under a bed" [...] due to [...] "a mob howling for his blood".|$|E

Introducing the second derivative into Lotka-Volterra equation gave the square <b>of</b> <b>change</b> rate <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> predators and that of prey. Since the square <b>of</b> <b>change</b> rate gave positive value, the following two inequalities were given.
