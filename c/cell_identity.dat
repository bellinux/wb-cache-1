25|$|The gene {{expression}} patterns that define <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> are inherited through cell division. This process is called epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is reliably inherited through {{the action of}} maintenance methylases that modify the nascent DNA strand generated by replication. In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is the primary marker of transcriptionally silenced regions. Specialized proteins can recognize the marker and recruit histone deacetylases and methylases to re-establish the silencing. Nucleosome histone modifications could also be inherited during cell division, however, {{it is not clear}} whether it can work independently without the direction by DNA methylation.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of gene expression in eukaryotes is achieved through {{the interaction of}} several levels of control that acts both locally to turn on or off individual genes {{in response to a}} specific cellular need and globally to maintain a chromatin-wide gene expression pattern that shapes <b>cell</b> <b>identity.</b> Because eukaryotic genome is wrapped around histones to form nucelosomes and higher-order chromatin structures, the substrates for transcriptional machinery are in general partially concealed. Without regulatory proteins, many genes are expressed at low level or not expressed at all. Transcription requires displacement of the positioned nucleosomes to enable the transcriptional machinery to gain access of the DNA.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} marks, are genomic {{regions with}} specific methylation pattern {{in a specific}} biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks {{are associated with the}} cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.|$|E

Transcriptional profiling identified Growth-arrest-specific 1 (Gas 1) as a general negative target of Shh signaling. Data presented here define Gas 1 as a novel positive component of the Shh signaling cascade. Removal of Gas 1 results in a Shh dose-dependent loss of <b>cell</b> <b>identities</b> in the ventral neural tube and facial and skeletal defects, also consistent with reduced Shh signaling. In contrast, ectopic Gas 1 expression results in Shh-dependent cell-autonomous promotion of ventral <b>cell</b> <b>identities.</b> These properties mirror those of Cdo, an unrelated, cell surface Shh-binding protein. We show that Gas 1 and Cdo cooperate to promote Shh signaling during neural tube patterning, craniofacial, and vertebral development.

40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} our {{conceptual}} {{view of how}} differential gene expression is used to define different <b>cell</b> <b>identities,</b> {{we still do not}} understand how different <b>cell</b> <b>identities</b> are translated into actual cell properties. The example discussed here is that of the fly wing, which is composed of two main cell types: vein and intervein cells. These two cell types differ in many features, including their adhesive properties. One of the major differences is that intervein cells express integrins, which are required for the attachment of the two wing layers to each other, whereas vein cells are devoid of integrin expression. The major signaling pathways that divide the wing to vein and intervein domains have been characterized. However, the genetic programs that execute these two alternative differentiation programs are still very roughly drawn. Here we identify the bHLH protein Delilah (Dei) as a mediator between signaling pathways that specify intervein cell-fate {{and one of the most}} significant realizators of this fate, βPS integrin. Dei's expression is restricted to intervein territories where it acts as a potent activator of βPS integrin expression. In the absence of normal Dei activity the level of βPS integrin is reduced, leading to a failure of adhesion between the dorsal and ventral wing layers and a consequent formation of wing blisters. The effect of Dei on βPS expression is not restricted to the wing, suggesting that Dei functions as a general genetic switch, which is turned on wherever a sticky cell-identity is determined and integrin-based adhesion is required...|$|R

Since the DNA sequence is identical in all cells, a "cellular memory" of expression profiles is achieved by what are defined as epigenetic mechanisms. Two major molecular principles—networks of transcription factors and maintenance of cis-chromatin modifications—have been implicated in maintaining cellular memory. Here we describe recent studies demonstrating that short noncoding RNAs can also provide molecular signals that define epigenetic states of cells. Small RNAs can act independently or cooperate with chromatin modifications to achieve long-lasting effects necessary for cellular memory and transgenerational inheritance...|$|R
50|$|As {{currently}} defined, {{the term}} “super-enhancer” {{was introduced by}} Young’s lab to describe regions identified in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

Xenopus embryos depleted of Lim 1 lack anterior head structures {{and fail to}} form a proper axis {{as a result of}} a failure of gastrulation movements, even though mesodermal <b>cell</b> <b>identities</b> are specified. Similar disruption of cell movements in the mesoderm is also observed in Lim 1 −/− mice. Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) expression is lost in the nascent mesoderm of Lim 1 −/− mouse embryos and in the organizer of Lim 1 -depleted Xenopus embryos; the latter can be rescued to a considerable extent by supplying PAPC exogenously. We conclude that a primary function of Lim 1 in the early embryo is to enable proper cell movements during gastrulation...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, nuclear {{organization}} {{can play a}} role in establishing <b>cell</b> <b>identity.</b> Cells within an organism have near identical nucleic acid sequences, but often exhibit different phenotypes. One way in which this individuality occurs is through changes in genome architecture, which can alter the expression of different sets of genes. These alterations can have a downstream effect on cellular functions such as cell cycle facilitation, DNA replication, nuclear transport, and alteration of nuclear structure. Controlled changes in nuclear organization are essential for proper cellular function.|$|E
