40|$|The National Strategy for the Reform of the Judiciary (2013 - 2018) {{is adopted}} in the National Assembly in June 2013.

Among defined goals, which should be realized by 2018, he considers particularly disputable the prediction of the Judical Academy as a mandatory <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> the first <b>election</b> of judges and prosecutors. Without denying the importance of the Judicial Academy and the necessity of its reform, the author believes that the Academy should not be a constitutional category, just as the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>election</b> of judges and prosecutors are not a constitutional matter. On the other hand, the author advocates a return of the basis for the termination of judicial and prosecutorial functions, as well as the reasons for their dismissal, into the Constitution which are currently in the law...|$|R

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish {{cardinals}} Solis and de la Cerda on April 27 strengthened the anti-Jesuit party. They also {{violated the law}} of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with Spanish ambassador Azpuru. The Spaniards had fewer scruples than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal Malvezzi, took the matter into their own hands. They paid attention to the only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, O.F.M.Conv. The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the pontificate of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>election.</b> Ganganelli answered that [...] "he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors.|$|R

Its interpretation has been difficult. There is the preliminary awkwardness that the Constitution itself does not require a member of the Parliament to be an Australian Citizen, although Constitution s 42 does require members to swear an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the monarch; however, Australian citizenship has been made a statutory <b>condition</b> of eligibility <b>for</b> <b>election.</b>|$|R

The papal order not to appoint Henry administrator arrived in Osnabrück only days after his investiture, so that Henry celebrated his festive entering in the prince-bishopric in June 1574. In late 1574, the nuncio to Cologne, Kaspar Gropper, also professor at Cologne University, presented a protocol which evaluated the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> Henry's <b>election</b> in Münster and Osnabrück according to Canon Law.

His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|R

Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> his <b>election.</b> Casimir Jagiellon was the third and youngest son of King Władysław II Jagiełło and his fourth wife, Sophia of Halshany. His father was already 65 at the time of Casimir’s birth, and his brother Władysław III, three years his senior, was expected to become king before his majority. Strangely, little was done for his education; he was never taught Latin, nor was he trained for the responsibilities of office, despite the fact he was the only brother of the rightful sovereign.5 He often relied on his instinct and feelings and had little political knowledge, but shared a great interest in the diplomacy and economic affairs of the country. Throughout Casimir's youth, Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki was his mentor and tutor, however, the cleric felt a strong reluctance towards him, believing that he would be an unsuccessful monarch following Władysław's death.|$|R

Several Adjaran officials also did so. Local opposition resumed series of protests in Batumi, being broken up severely on April 30.|$|R
