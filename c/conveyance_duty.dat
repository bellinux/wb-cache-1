The right was never a formal right, but rather a consequence of the ‘conveyance duty’ which was imposed on farmers. <b>Conveyance</b> <b>duty</b> (Norwegian: skyssplikt) is known since the 12th century and functioned as indirect taxation. In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which conveyance farmers had was abolished at the same time.|$|E

This paper analyses the impact of this policy on demand in the Perth housing market. Results confirm an immediate and significant impact on demand in both price segments that were the target of policy {{and to a lesser extent}} also within price segments that were not the target of policy. Results also confirm some important information diffusion or ‘news ’ effects. The release of information two months prior to enactment of the policy lead to a pronounced decline in demand for cheaper housing and also in other price segments prior to enactment of the policy...|$|E
40|$|Affordable {{housing is}} an {{increasing}} issue in Tasmania, this is especially so concerning affordable rental properties. The neoliberal discourse is currently focused on individual households achieving first homeownership. This is attained through constantly subsidizing low-income households to purchase unaffordable homes. The hypothesis is that a onetime subsidy of perpetual affordable housing for low-income household could facilitate homeownership without the need of constantly subsidizing individual households. The thesis researches if Community Land Trusts can be established as a transitional phase before implementing Land Value Tax. The findings demonstrate that Community Land Trusts {{can be part of}} a transitional phase before Land Value Tax is implemented in Tasmania. Land Value Tax could replace other State taxes, like <b>conveyance</b> <b>duty</b> and payroll tax, and effectively make Tasmania the most competitive taxed state in Australia. This is researched with social constructionism and standpoint theory as theoretical frame, which allows for a critical analyses on the prevalent neoliberal discourse while applying a mixed methodology of qualitative and quantitative analysis...|$|E
40|$|The revenue, efficiency, {{equity and}} {{operating}} costs properties of alternative tax bases or taxable sums are compared and contrasted. Initially the assessment {{is made for}} generic, comprehensive tax bases on income and consumption flows, wealth stocks, and on transactions. On the criteria of efficiency and equity, there are unresolved conceptual and empirical arguments in choosing between income, consumption and wealth tax bases, but general revenue raising transaction taxes are inferior. In practice, including in current Australia, the different tax bases are far from comprehensive because of the many exemptions and deductions. On all good tax design criteria, the case is made to broaden the tax bases for income, the GST, payroll and land taxes; special purpose transaction taxes to counter market failures should be redesigned; and <b>conveyance</b> <b>duties</b> and other stamp duties should be removed. ...|$|R

I should be much disposed to abolish the tea licences as greatly restrictive of the consumption of a dutiable and useful commodity. I modified them; but {{am not sure that}} this was enough. The B.I.R. could throw light on this subject. 3. The probate duty calls, I fear, loudly for change; but I wanted either time or courage to take it in hand. 4. The remaining <b>conveyance</b> <b>duties,</b> apart from railways, I always considered as marked for extinction. On this subject Mr. Ayrton has rather decided antecedents. 5. The fire insurance duty is sure to be further assailed. Though not as bad (relatively to other taxes) as is supposed, it is bad enough to be very hard to defend in an adverse House; {{and this is one of}} the questions on which it is not likely that the opposition will help to see fair play. The promises that liberal reduction will lead to recovery of anything like the old or previous revenue have always been confidently pressed by irresponsible men, and are in my opinion illusory. The tax is a tax on property: and, as we have too few of these rather than too many, what would seem desirable is to commute it; leaving no more than a penny stamp on the policy. This might perhaps be done, if it were made part of a large budget. 6. The income-tax at 6d., I suppose, presents a forward claim. 7. The commutation of malt duty for beer duty must always, I presume, be spoken of with respect; but the working objections to it have thus far been found too hard to deal with.|$|R

40|$|This report {{argues that}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s housing {{market is not}} {{meeting the needs of}} all Australians, which is {{reflected}} in declining home ownership rates, and recommends extensive reforms. Executive summary In this report, the committee underscores the importance of affordable, secure and suitable housing as a vital determinant of wellbeing. But, based on the evidence, the committee finds that a significant number of Australians are not enjoying the security and comfort of affordable and appropriate housing—that currently Australia 2 ̆ 7 s housing market is not meeting the needs of all Australians. Sustained growth in median housing costs above the rate of median household income growth in recent decades has made it increasingly difficult for a growing proportion of Australians to afford housing that is safe, secure and appropriate to their needs. Added to the general decline in housing affordability, and indeed compounding the trend, the stock of affordable housing—that is, housing appropriate to the needs of low- to moderate-income households—has failed to keep pace with demand in recent decades. The committee does not believe the issue of housing affordability in Australia is rightly categorised as either a 2 ̆ 7 supply-side problem 2 ̆ 7 or a 2 ̆ 7 demand-side problem 2 ̆ 7. With this in mind, it is clearly evident that supply is currently not keeping pace with demand in the housing market. In this context, policy interventions that add to demand without addressing or at least accounting for supply-side constraints risk inflating house prices and exacerbating affordability problems. Worsening housing affordability is reflected in declining home ownership rates. This decline is troubling for a number of reasons, not least because home ownership can be an important means for people to achieve financial and social wellbeing. Moreover, high rates of home ownership also provide broader economic and social benefits to the community. As such, while the committee believes governments should work to improve affordability outcomes for all types of housing tenure, it considers it appropriate for governments to promote home ownership. The committee makes a range of recommendations directed primarily toward improving home purchase affordability. They include state governments phasing out <b>conveyancing</b> stamp <b>duties,</b> to be achieved through a transition to more efficient taxes, potentially including land taxation levied on a broader base than is currently the case. Other recommendations are directed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of infrastructure funding arrangements, which can have a strong influence on the cost of new housing. Similarly, a number of recommendations are made with the intention of ensuring land supply, urban planning and zoning processes {{have a positive effect on}} housing affordability...|$|R
40|$|Real estate conveyances are {{accomplished}} {{differently and}} by different players across Europe. The European Union houses four basic regimes, {{related to the}} classical “legal families”: 1) The Latin-German notary regime, where the public notary plays the central role, 2) the partly deregulated Dutch notary regime, 3) the lawyer/solicitor regime, prevalent on the British Isles, where conveyances are traditionally accomplished by solicitors, and 4) the Nordic regulated real estate broker regime. The comparative {{studies that have been}} conducted with respect to these regimes have focused on the economic impact—with particular regard to transaction costs—of regulation, particularly that concerning the Latin-German notary profession. The studies, while having great merit, are incomplete insofar as they fail to properly take into account, inter alia, the legal framework of the respective regimes and the functions performed by the key players. The present dissertation examines, compares, and analyzes the nature and scope of the non-litigious legal counsel that buyers and sellers of real estate can expect to receive—without hiring lawyers to represent them—under the Latin-German regime and the Swedish regime. To that end, the Swedish real estate broker and the Latin notary are examined and compared with respect to the role they play in real estate <b>conveyances</b> and their <b>duty</b> to give counsel to the contracting parties. The study is conducted in two steps: first a general overview of the professions’ duties and roles, followed by a more detailed juxtaposition of their duty to counsel. The first part comprises Sweden and nine notary regime countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexico, Portugal Puerto Rico, and Spain. The second part focuses on Sweden and France. The two professions share two main traits: a duty of impartiality and a duty to counsel. The duty to counsel of the Swedish broker and the French notary are strikingly similar and consists in four sub-duties: 1) to conduct verifications to ascertain facts, 2) to disclose relevant information, 3) to give adequate advice, and 4) to draw up all necessary deeds {{in a manner that is}} tailored to the instant transaction. The duty of impartiality and the duty to counsel amount to a specific function in real estate conveyances, common to both professions—namely that of impartial counsel. The desirability of the different regimes can be assessed and discussed from several perspectives, including but not limited to the economic perspective. In general terms, a regime can be said to be desirable if the produced utility exceeds the costs. The question is how to properly measure utility and costs. In limiting studies to such factors as can be readily measured, mainly pecuniary costs, one obtains an incomplete picture since there may be utility and costs that remain unaccounted for. For instance, the extent to which the state should interfere in the marketplace is not merely an economical issue but also an ideological issue. How does one account for ideologically conditioned utility and costs? One way to obtain more solid information is to study the regimes’ institutional robustness; that is, their ability to produce the desired results. For instance, harmful incentives for key players such as brokers and notaries may have an adverse effect on the performance of their assigned functions. Future research should focus on these issues.
