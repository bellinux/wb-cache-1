40|$|Details {{are given}} for the design and {{application}} of a (one atmosphere) redox-control system. This system differs from that given in NASA Technical Memorandum 58234 in that it uses a single solid-electrolytic cell in a remote location to measure the oxygen fugacities of multiple CO/CO 2 controlled-atmosphere furnaces. This remote measurement extends the range of sample-furnace conditions that can be measured using a solid-electrolytic cell, and cuts costs by extending {{the life of the}} sensors and by minimizing the number of sensors in use. The system consists of a reference furnace and an exhaust-gas manifold. The reference furnace is designed according to the redox control system of NASA Technical Memorandum 58234, and any number of CO/CO 2 controlled-atmosphere furnaces can be attached to the exhaust-gas manifold. Using the manifold, the exhaust gas from individual CO/CO 2 <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnaces</b> can be diverted through the reference furnace, where a solid-electrolyte cell is used to read the ambient oxygen fugacity. The oxygen fugacity measured in the reference furnace can then be used to calculate the oxygen fugacity in the individual CO/CO 2 controlled-atmosphere furnace. A BASIC computer program was developed to expedite this calculation...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} space weathering processes were recently reported. Submicroscopic iron blebs were produced in lunar simulant glass and natural terrestrial minerals by high-temperature reduction in <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnaces.</b> These experiments altered the samples' optical properties and microtextures so that they resembled those of extremely mature lunar soil. The results contributed to a revised model for natural reduction in the regolith. Subsequently, supporting results were obtained by reduction of lunar samples. Research to date has focused on reduction of three lunar surface components: basalt, pyroclastic glass, and mare soil. An extensive set of H reduction experiments with simulants has led to a detailed understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics. Reduction experiments using lunar basalt were recently conducted by Carbotek. Reduced samples from these test were analyzed. Reduction experiments on lunar glass 74220 were run at temperatures of 900 - 1100 C. Reduction efficiency of volcanic glass proved to be a function of the sample's FeO abundance and reaction temperature. We also reduced mare soil 75061 at temperatures of 900 - 1050 C. Partial reduction of FeO in olivine and pyroxene occurred, but was slower and less complete than reduction of ilmenite. Our experiments on simulants and lunar samples have indicated that the most readily reduced phases in the regolith are ilmenite and glass. Based on initial tests with simulants we proposed refinements to the accepted model for space weathering of the regolith. The impact of a micrometeoroid flash heats and melts and ejects from the impact point a small volume of soil that contains trapped solar wind H and C. Reduction occurs rapidly, while the melt volume is still in motion. When a droplet encounters unmelted soil, it envelopes cold mineral grains. The melt is chilled rapidly. Our analyses of experimentally reduced lunar basalt, glass, and mare soil support the proposed model for space weathering...|$|E

However, no such facility exists on the North American continent. We propose the establishment of an open user facility for COMPRES members and the entire research community, with the unique capability of a 5000 ton (or more) press, supported by a host of extant co-located experimental and analytical laboratories and research staff. We offer wide range of complementary and/or preparatory experimental options. Any required synthesis of materials or follow up experiments can be carried out <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnaces,</b> piston cylinders, multi-anvil, or experimental impact apparatus. Additionally, our division houses two machine shops that would facilitate any modification or custom work necessary for development of CETUS, one for general fabrication and one located specifically within our experimental facilities. We also have a general sample preparation laboratory, specifically for experimental samples, that allows users to quickly and easily prepare samples for ebeam analyses and more. A service we can offer to COMPRES community members in general, and CETUS visiting users specifically, is a multitude of analytical instrumentation literally steps away from the experimental laboratories. This year we will be pursuing site funding of our laboratories through NASA's Planetary Science Directorate, which should result in substantial cost savings to all visiting users, and supports our mission of interagency cooperation for the enhancement of science for all (see companion PSAMS abstract). The PI is in a unique position as an employee of Jacobs Technology to draw funding from multiple sources, including those from industry and commerce. We submitted a Planetary Major Equipment proposal to the NASA Emerging Worlds solicitation for the full cost of a press, with competitive bids submitted from Sumitomo, Rockland Research, and Voggenreiter. Additional funding is currently being sought from industry sources through the Strategic Partnerships Office at NASA JSC, External Pursuits Program Office on the JETS contract, and Jacobs corporate in the United States. Internal funding is available for JETS contract personnel to travel to large press locations worldwide to study set-up and operations. We also anticipate a fortuitous cost savings in installation of the large press because plans are already underway for major renovations to the entire experimental petrology suite within the next 2 years in order to accommodate our growing user base. Our focus as contract staff is on serving the scientific needs of our users and collaborators. We are seeking community expert input on multiple aspects of this proposed facility, such as the press type and design, access management, immediate projects, and future innovation initiatives...|$|E

MIM {{consists of four}} main processing steps: mixing, injection molding, debinding and sintering. In the mixing step, the powder titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) medical grade is mixed with a binder system based on palm stearin to form a homogeneous feedstock. The rheological studies of the feedstock have been determined properly in order to success during injection into injection molding machine. After molding, the binder holds the particles in place. The binder systems then have to be removed completely through debinding step. Any contamination of the binder systems will affect the final properties of the parts.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 106 - 110). The increased {{usage of}} titanium and its alloys in {{the aerospace industry}} and for biomedical applications {{has been attributed to}} its good strength to weight ratio, exceptional corrosion resistance and high melting point. In this research the titanium alloy that was focused on is the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (by weight) alloy. With these good properties the alloys are also susceptible to poor tribological property behaviour. Surface engineering processes help improve these poor properties and one such process is known as Oxygen Boost Diffusion Hardening (OBDH). The OBDH process is a two-step process. The first step involves oxidation of the samples in air at elevated temperatures and the second step is carried out in order to diffusion treat the pre-oxidised specimens in a vacuum or argon environment. This was done using different oxygen and diffusion step temperatures and times. A comparison of the different fatigue lives after the treatments was made using the untreated specimen as the yardstick. The specimens were heat treated, in an oxidation furnace for the first stage and a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace</b> for the second stage.

40|$|Oxidation is a {{significant}} source of material loss in the production of primary aluminium, with estimates ranging up to ~ 1 % of metal loss due to oxidation. An understanding of the fundamental oxidation mechanisms is necessary to develop a kinetic model of oxidation behaviour. Studies of aluminium oxidation have traditionally been thermogravimetric and carried out in a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace.</b> However, it is known that this technique is sensitive to the initial condition of the oxide present on the feedstock. This has led to significant variations in data reported in the literature, making modelling problematic. An experimental technique has been developed to address this limitation, based on earlier work by Freti et al, in which the oxide is 'skimmed' off of the surface of an open melt to give an effectively pure aluminium surface. The melt surface was skimmed at regular intervals and the skimmed material was processed in a molten salt flux at 750 degrees Celsius to separate the metal from the oxide. The recovered aluminium metal was weighed and the amount of oxide was then calculated by difference. Experiments were carried out on a melt of commercial purity aluminium exposed to ambient air. The melt surface area was ~ 0. 05 m^ 2 (approximately the size of an A 4 piece of paper). Oxide samples were taken at melt temperatures of 750, 850, and 900 degrees Celsius after holding times ranging from 30 seconds to 8 hours. The amount of oxide formed increased with both time and temperature, and the oxidation rate at 850 degrees Celsius was greater than at 750 degrees Celsius. The data at 750 and 850 degrees Celsius can be described reasonably well by a power law relationship, within experimental error, indicating a continuous reduction in oxidation rate over time, although the 900 degrees Celsius data is currently too limited to make a similar observation. Overall, very little oxide formed on the aluminium melt, significantly less than what forms in an industrial setting. This suggests that there are other factors more significant than time and temperature that influence the oxidation behaviour under such conditions...|$|R
40|$|Soft glass {{optical fibers}} are of great {{interest}} for the scientific community, since {{they can be used}} for compact short pulsed optical fiber lasers operating in the near infrared wavelength region. Indeed soft glasses such as phosphate and tellurite can incorporate large amounts of rare earth ions while keeping a high absorption and emission cross sections, without clustering effects. This research work aimed at developing rare earth doped phosphate glass optical fibers doped with Yb 3 + and Er 3 + ions suitable for short pulsed fiber lasers. The phosphate glasses were prepared by melt quenching technique in a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace</b> at temperature above 1300 °C and then cast on brass molds. The glasses were thermally characterized by differential scanning calorimetry in order to measure the characteristic temperatures. Optical characterization was carried out to measure the refractive index of the prepared glasses. The characteristic temperatures (glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature) and the refractive index of the fabricated glasses are reported in Table I. The core glass was doped with Er 3 + and Yb 3 + ions (2. 5 x 1026 ions/m 3) of and the calculated numerical aperture (NA) between core and 1 st cladding was 0. 11, while between 1 st and 2 nd cladding was equal to 0. 36. An optical fiber could then be fabricated by the prepared glasses by preform drawing. The preforms were fabricated by rod-in-tube technique with the tubes manufactured using the rotational casting technique. Drawing was carried out using an in-house custom optical fiber drawing tower. In-line measurement of fiber diameter and tension allowed obtaining a stable and reproducible optical fiber suitable for the demonstration of amplification and laser action. The optical gain of the so-obtained optical fiber was measured by cladding pumping a 9 cm-long fiber using a 976 nm pump diode. A net gain of 16 dB at 1535 nm was measured.

Although these dyes {{are an important part}} of textile industry but their discharge in water bodies is very complicated as these are highly toxic and have carcinogenic effects on human health [1, 2]. Till now, many methods (chemical, physical, biological) have been developed to overcome this problem. These methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. To overcome the disadvantages of these methods, development of a cost effective method is required which can effectively degrade the dyes without forming any sludge or other toxic substances. Semiconductor assisted photocatalytic degradation of dyes, which is an advanced oxidation process has emerged as an important destructive technology that offers complete mineralization of most of the organic pollutants and thus there is no further requirement for secondary disposal methods [3]. Some spinel-type oxides such as BaCr 2 O 4 [4], NiFe 2 O 4 [5], CaBi 2 O 4 [6], ZnGa 2 O 4 [7], CuGa 2 O 4 [8], ZnFe 2 O 4 [9] and CuAl 2 O 4 [10] used as semiconductor Photocatalyst materials. Magnesium aluminate has been synthesized by various methods such as gel precursors [11], spray pyrolysis [12], co-precipitation [13], and freeze-drying [14]. Very limited literature is available on photocatalyst magnesium aluminate spinel by solid state reaction method. Therefore, in the present research work, magnesium aluminate spinel nanoparticles with different concentration of alumina(x =  0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.54) have been synthesized by solid state reaction. It involves mixing of element or alloy powders with additives and lubricants, and the mixture is annealed in a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace</b> (at 900  °C) so as to bond the particles metallurgically [15].

The photocatalytic degradation of the methylene blue dye on the magnesium aluminate spinel particles is studies under UV light of 200  W. The mechanisms governing the photocatalytic properties of nanoparticles are elucidated in the present work.|$|R

In fact, they can be doped with large amounts of rare earth (RE) ions (up to 1021 ions/cm 3) without clustering, therefore enabling the realization of compact active devices with high gain per unit length. Moreover, phosphate glasses possess a large glass forming range, good thermo-mechanical and chemical properties, low nonlinear refractive index and no evidence of photodarkening even at high population inversion. The aim {{of this research was}} the realization of different configurations of Nd 3 +-doped phosphate glass waveguides, in particular a double cladding (DC) optical fibre and circular and D-shaped cladding rods, to be used in lasers and optical amplifiers, in a CW or pulsed regime. Three different phosphate glass compositions (for the core, inner cladding and outer cladding) were designed in order to obtain an adequate numerical aperture between different elements while maintaining similar thermo-mechanical properties in view of the drawing process. The glasses were prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique in a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace</b> at 1400 °C and then cast on pre-heated brass molds. Physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of the manufactured glasses were measured. The waveguides realized for this research were manufactured by preform drawing with the preforms being obtained by rod-in-tube technique. The fabrication of each preform required one rod of core glass fabricated by melt quenching and one or two tubes shaped by rotational casting, using an in-house built equipment. Fiber drawing was then carried out using a drawing tower developed in-house. The preform and fibre fabrication parameters were set to generate a DC fibre with the following diameters: 8 μm, 35 μm and 105 μm for the core, inner and outer cladding, respectively. Concerning the rods, two distinct sets of samples with different core/cladding dimensions, were manufactured: 310 / 850 μm and 260 / 700 μm respectively. Fig 1 shows the cross section of the manufactured waveguides. Laser action at 1. 054 μm was demonstrated by cladding pumping 9 cm of the fabricated optical fibre using a semiconductor pigtailed laser diode emitting at 793 nm.

Economic factors, such as the cost of the materials must be considered. Materials influence the service lifetime in the required operational environment. Solid fuels like coal and biomass produce different combustion environments containing a range of contaminants that, when they reach their melting points, may cause accelerated corrosion, affecting directly the service life time of the gas turbine constructional materials. This accelerated corrosion is known as Hot Corrosion. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop, an understanding of the influence of these environmental factors on rate of hot corrosion of modem turbine materials, i. e. the single crystal alloys CMSX 4 the SC 2, both uncoated and PtAl coated that are needed for a gas turbine blade and vanes operating in a range of hot corrosion environments expected in an lGCC plant. To achieve this aim, a series of laboratory corrosion tests was planned to simulate the same corrosion environment as in industrial high temperature gas turbine operation. Following established procedures for corrosion testing, samples were exposed in a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace</b> to a mix of gases (air/SO 241 CI) with a cyclic exposure time of 50 and/or 100 h duration. Each cycle, samples were removed to be recoated with an alkali salt mixture to a total exposure time of 500 h and or 1000 h. Cross sections were examined by SEM/EDX to identify the mode of hot corrosion attack. To quantify the rate of corrosion, samples were measured pre-exposure and post-exposure, and this corrosion data was statistically assessed. Finally, from this quantitative data, life prediction models were developed to describe/predict the onset of hot corrosion and the corrosion rates observed under different gas compositions, and various deposition fluxes, both at typical type I and type II hot corrosion temperatures in terms of incubation and propagation periods. Separate models have been developed for the two single crystals superalloys: CMSX 4 and SC 2, in both the uncoated and platinum aluminide coated condition. The goodness of fit as defined by the regression coefficient varies from 0. 88 to 0. 99 for the propagation models at 700 and 900 °C.

40|$|The {{economic}} and ecological {{challenges of the}} automotive industry coupled to safety considerations involve lightweight design based {{on the development of}} new ultra high strength materials. The hot stamping process of Al-Si coated steels ensures these strength levels and, moreover, allows an easy forming of the material without the necessity of a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> At high temperatures, the coating is hydrogen-permeable, while at low temperatures (below 120 °C), it becomes tight to hydrogen. In this context, the aim of this work is to understand how hydrogen enters in the material during the hot stamping process with respect to different atmospheric sources. An important aspect of the problem is the continuous evolution of the material during the hot stamping process. At ambient temperature, the coating is indeed a solid Al-Si alloy, which has weakly reacted with iron during deposition. As temperature increases, this coating first melts and then forms ternary intermetallic compounds Al-Fe-Si. As a first step {{in the study of the}} different sub-systems, bare steel has been considered. The influence of the different hydrogen sources has been studied: water vapour, which is probably the active source in the industrial process and dihydrogen, a more fundamental study case. Heavy water vapour (D 2 O) is also used to ensure a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the <b>furnace,</b> while it allows to avoid misinterpretation that could arise with the dissociation of water into hydrogen. In the case of water and heavy water vapours, another important parameter to characterize the humidity of the atmosphere is the dew point, which has been varied between two temperatures, - 10 °C and + 15 °C. Thermal desorption analyses (TDA) have permitted to quantify the diffusive hydrogen present in the material with respect to those different atmospheres. Metallographic observations of the surfaces of the samples and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) analyses have also been correlated with the atmosphere parameters to understand how the equilibrium between atmospheric and diffusive hydrogen can be established...|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Vacuum brazing is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Due {{to the absence of}} flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|R
50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt furnace is a furnace uses a conveyor or belt to carry process parts or material through the primary heating chamber for rapid thermal processing. It is designed for fast drying and curing of products and is nowadays widely used in the firing process of thick film and metallization process of solar cell manufacturing. Other names for {{conveyor belt}} furnace include metallization <b>furnace,</b> belt <b>furnace,</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>furnace,</b> infrared furnace and fast fire furnace, to just list a few.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} influences of brazing parameters (temperature and time) on microstructures and the mechanical properties of commercially pure (CP) titanium sheet when it is brazed with CBS 34 (Ag- 20 Cu- 22 Zn- 24 Cd) braze filler foil. Brazing was performed in a conventional <b>atmosphere</b> <b>control</b> <b>furnace.</b> The brazing temperatures and holding times employed {{in this study were}} 800 - 870 °C and 10 - 20 min, respectively. The qualities of the brazed joints were evaluated by ultrasonic test and the microstructure and phase constitution of the bonded joints were analyzed by means of metallography, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties of brazed joints were evaluated by microhardness and shear tests. The diffusion between Ti, Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd from substrate and braze alloy, developed a strong reaction between each other. A number of intermetallic phases, such as TiCu and Ti 2 Cu in the Ag-Zn solid solution matrix have been identified especially at 870 °C - 20 min. Both the brazing temperature and the holding time are critical factors for controlling the microstructure and hence the mechanical properties of the brazed joints. The optimum brazing parameters was achieved at 870 °C - 20 min. Based on the shear test result, all cracks propagate along the brittle intermetallic compounds like Ti 2 Cu in the reaction layer which typically are composed of quasi-cleavage (Ag-Zn matrix) and brittle appearance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Analyses of total sugars, starch, reducing sugars, total organic acids, free amino acids, soluble proteins, pH, titratable acidity, and total carotenes were made on the fifteenth, thirtieth, forty-fifth, sixtieth, and seventy-fifth days of storage at 35 F. There {{were no significant differences in}} total organic acids and free amino acids between the conventional refrigeration (35 F) and other treatments during the early stage of storage. They were, however, higher after 45 days of storage with phaltan treatments, although still not changed in <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in combination with packaging. The soluble proteins and the reducing sugars were lower in the <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> lettuce than in the conventional refrigeration lettuce. The lettuce treated with phaltan or phaltan in combination with polyethylene packaging had higher amounts of soluble proteins. Although pH of the lettuce heads was not changed throughout 75 days of storage, the titratable acidity was higher in all treatments during the storage...|$|R
