40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that large wood has a {{prominent}} role in habitat quality, however there is little research on the role of wood on pool characteristics and other habitat components in low gradient streams (channel slopes less than one percent). Longitudinal profiles are used to analyze general residual pool characteristics of three approximately 1000 meter stream reaches with similar stream and watershed characteristics and vastly different large wood loadings (759 vs. 329 vs. 39 m 3 /ha). This study devises a new classification methodology to subdivide long pools, due to different formation mechanisms and physical barriers within pools. Shallow long runs at the start or end of pools are also removed because the do not represent pool habitat. Higher large wood loading is associated with decreased individual pool lengths, maximum depths, and longitudinal residual pool areas. Greater wood loads however increase reach percent channel in pools and pool frequency. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>reach</b> longitudinal residual pool area per 100 meters and mean thalweg depths did not vary between the study reaches.

40|$|Abstract: The {{property}} of Heavy axial forgings {{can be modified}} by the reasonable drawing process with the advantage of dynamic recrystallization. In view of formation, heat transfer, heating generation, dynamic recrystallization a macro-micro coupled process was modeled, and the drawing process of Ï 300 mmÃ 4000 mm axial forging is simulated. It is found that when the <b>cumulative</b> reduction ratio <b>reaches</b> 9 % in the second round, the dynamic recrystallization occurred in the material as it reached a critical strain condition. With the reduction ratio increases, the volume fraction of dynamic recrystallization increases. When the <b>cumulative</b> reduction ratio <b>reaches</b> 60 %, about 67 % of the inner region of the axial forging is modified fully. After the drawing process, the dynamic recrystallization grain size in 60 % of the cross-section area is less than 100 Âµm, and the grains get refined...|$|R
