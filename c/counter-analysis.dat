50|$|In 2004, Vasseur {{was arrested}} in {{suspicion}} of doping offences along with several other Cofidis riders, notably including then individual time trial champion David Millar. A <b>counter-analysis</b> later proved negative and Vasseur's name was then cleared. Vasseur also claimed {{some of the evidence}} in his witness statement had been forged. However, Vasseur was barred from riding in the 2004 Tour de France since the investigation had not concluded by the time that the race had started.|$|E
50|$|On 18 September 2009, it was {{announced}} that three cyclists, Héctor Guerra, Isidro Nozal and Nuno Ribeiro had tested positive for CERA at the 2009 Volta a Portugal. On 21 October, the UCI announced that the <b>counter-analysis</b> confirmed the positive control for all cyclists. This doping case led Liberty Seguros to withdraw the sponsorship of the team, which led to its extinction as a professional team. The team did continue as an elite level domestic team for a further three seasons before folding in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2013, it was {{announced}} that Berasategui had tested positive for doping during the Bilbao Triathlon held on 18 May 2013, an event in which Berasategui won the half distance race. One of six anti-doping controls carried out after the Bilbao race had tested positive to which Berasategui asked for a <b>counter-analysis</b> on. However, almost two weeks later, Berasategui confessed to the doping charges. In a statement she said that she would not appeal because she knew that she was guilty and expressed the desire to be open and honest. She apologized and stated that she made [...] "the worst mistake in which an athlete can fall." ...|$|E
50|$|On 8 November 1973, it was {{announced}} that Merckx had tested positive for norephedrine after winning the Giro di Lombardia a month earlier. Upon learning of the first test being positive in later October, he had a <b>counter-analysis</b> performed which also turned up positive. The drug was present in a cough medicine that the Molteni doctor, Dr. Cavalli, prescribed to him. Merckx was disqualified from the race and the victory was awarded to second-place finisher Gimondi. In addition, Merckx was given a month suspension and fined 150,000 lira. Merckx admitted his fault in taking the medicine but said that the name norephedrine was not on the bottle of cough syrup he used.|$|E
50|$|Software that Fancy Bear {{has used}} {{includes}} ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT, and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises {{a number of}} implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers. Based on compile times, FireEye concluded that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007. To avert detection, Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and control channels, and modifies its persistent methods. The threat group implements <b>counter-analysis</b> techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings, making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm. Fancy Bear takes measures to prevent forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically clearing the event logs.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 July 2009, it was {{announced}} that Di Luca had tested positive for CERA on 20 and 28 May 2009, during the Giro d'Italia. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the UCI. He had been targeted for testing using information from his biological passport's blood profile, previous test results and his race schedule. On 8 August, his positive tests were confirmed. On 1 February 2010, the Italian Olympic committee (CONI) suspended him for two years (effective as of 22 July 2009) for the Giro doping incident. Di Luca must also pay a [...] fine, as well as the costs incurred in both the analysis and <b>counter-analysis</b> of his Giro samples: Di Luca indicated his intention to contest the decision.|$|E
5000|$|Worse, {{as far as}} {{many economists}} were concerned, was that the Phillips curve {{had little or no}} {{theoretical}} basis. Critics of this analysis (such as Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps) argued that the Phillips curve could not be a fundamental characteristic of economic general equilibrium because it showed a correlation between a real economic variable (the unemployment rate) and a nominal economic variable (the inflation rate). Their <b>counter-analysis</b> was that government macroeconomic policy (primarily monetary policy) was being driven by a low unemployment target and that this caused expectations of inflation to change, so that steadily accelerating inflation rather than reduced unemployment was the result. The resulting prescription was that government economic policy (or at least monetary policy) should not be influenced by any level of unemployment below a critical level - the [...] "natural rate" [...] or NAIRU.|$|E
50|$|The first {{editions of}} the 2000s were marked by the {{dominance}} of Roberto Heras, who achieved victory on three occasions, and in 2005 did it for the fourth time. However, as happened with Ángel Arroyo in 1982, was disqualified days {{after the end of}} the competition after testing positive in a doping test, this time for use of EPO. This positive development was later ratified by the <b>counter-analysis</b> and Heras was stripped of his title, benefiting the Russian cyclist Denis Menchov until 2012, where the Spanish Courts overturned the positive test and re-awarded the win to Heras. In 2006 Alexander Vinokourov won after a struggle with the then leader of the UCI Pro Tour, Alejandro Valverde. In the 2007 edition Denis Menchov again clinched the overall victory by more than three minutes over the Spanish cyclists Carlos Sastre and Samuel Sánchez. In June 2008, French company Amaury Sport Organisation, who organize the Tour de France, announced it had bought 49% of Unipublic.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{sets out to}} project an in-depth study of the advertising discourse by applying methodological approaches of Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis to the chosen “advertisements”. It aims at examining the ‘power relations and struggles ’ among product-producers and product-consumers, to gauge the level of psychological dominance exercised through the advertising discourse. The study, fundamentally, presents a <b>counter-analysis</b> of ‘advertising strategies’, as to how far they influence the consumers ’ attitudes {{and to what extent}} the consumers direct their ‘discourse’. In other words, this research attempts to answer the question: ‘who turns out to be more powerful by controlling the other’s mind, in advertiser-consumer relationship?’, whether it is the consumer who shapes the discourse of advertisements through their demands, or the advertiser who affects the consumers ’ beliefs through their ‘discourse’! Thus, the current paper presents a comprehensive review of the relevant literature leading towards a theoretical framework of preferred DA and CDA approaches to be further applied on the discourse of advertisements. And towards the end, it states the final remarks concluding the entire discussion and reflecting upon the effectiveness of Critical Discourse Analysis in its application on the advertising phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Partiendo del análisis de la obra cinematográfica 300, se plantea el papel del cine en la creación de un determinado discurso histórico. Se pretende mostrar que quizás lo que más trascendencia tenga de este tipo de filme no es precisamente lo que nos diga del pasado, sino la ideología o forma de ver el mundo que de ellos puede extraerse sobre el presente. Para ello no se utilizará un enfoque en el que la película pueda ofrecernos información que desborda su contenido más evidente aportándonos un contraanálisis de la sociedad, sino más bien el discurso explícito del filme, {{es decir}} por lo que éste nos dice precisamente {{en el momento}} de su contemplación. ____________________ ABSTRACT: Starting with the {{analysis}} of the film ‘ 300 ’, we study the role of cinema {{in the creation of a}} certain historical discourse. We focus on the idea that what it is important is not what this kind of films say about the past, but the ideology or the way that the world is seen in the present. For this, we do not focus on the way in which the movie presents the information, which goes far beyond it most obvious content, offering a <b>counter-analysis</b> of the society, but rather on the most explicit discourse: what the film is really saying, exactly at the moment in which weare watching it. </p...|$|E
40|$|The past 15 {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the rise of post-development theory {{as a means of}} understanding the development discourse since the 1940 s. Post-development argues that intentional development (as distinct from immanent development - what people are doing anyway) is a construct of Western hegemony. Sustainable development, they argue, is no different and indeed is perhaps worse, given that most of the global environmental degradation has been driven by consumerism and industrialization in the West. Critics of post-development counter by stating that it only provides destruction by tearing apart what is currently practiced in 'development' without providing an alternative. When post-developmentalists do offer an alternative it typically amouints to little more than a call for more grassroots involvement in development and disengagement from a Western agenda. Post-sustainable development analysis and <b>counter-analysis</b> has received remarkably little attention within the sustainable development literature, yet this paper argues that it can make a positive contributrion by calling for an analysis of discourse rather than a hiding of power differentials and an assumption that consensus must exist within a community. A case is made for a post-sustainable development that acknowledges that diversity will exist and consensus may not be achievable, {{but at the same time}} participation can help with learning. The role of the expert within sustainable development is also discussed. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} eighty years I have started {{each day in}} the same manner. It is not a {{mechanical}} routine but something essential to my daily life. I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues by Bach&# 133; It {{is a sort of}} benediction on the house&# 133; It is a rediscovery of the wonder of which I have the joy of being a part. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being. The music is never the same for me, never. Each day it is something new, fantastic, and unbelievable. That is Bach&# 133; a miracle! A whole radiance of space and poetry pours forth from them! They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music. (Casals: 1974 : 17 & 47). Such comments, common among musicians, are usually ignored by the disciplines that study music. This thesis, however, {{is the result of a}} decision to take these comments seriously. This thesis addresses the issues of creativity, order and discipline, through the perspective of a sociology and phenomenology of everyday life. The main issues of this thesis are first introduced through Bachelard&# 146;s phenomenological study of poetry and Heidegger&# 146;s approach to art. Embodied modes of knowing are introduced through Buber&# 146;s dialogic I-Thou concept. This is followed by Winnicott&# 146;s discussion of creativity and Bohm and Peat&# 146;s discussion of order. Discipline is introduced through a <b>counter-analysis</b> of some central sociological theorists on authority and power: Lukes, Foucault and Durkheim. Among other writers influential for the thesis are Eliade on origins, sacred temporality and &# 145;eternal return&# 146;, Simmel and Douglas on space, Levinas, Merton, Herrigel and Stendl-Rast on ethics and discipline. Hegel and Sartre on identity-logic and Serres on relational modes of knowing. The main issues are drawn from experiences with music and particularly with the music of J. S. Bach. These experiences raise ontological, cosmological and epistemological questions that are examined in this thesis. The material used in the analysis is drawn from musicians&# 146; experiences and from a variety of sources non-academic and academic...|$|E
40|$|Case rounds are {{a common}} feature of the seminar {{component}} of clinical programs. This article describes using in the case rounds setting multiple design elements, including role plays and formalized interviews, to enhance student learning and engagement. In the rounds described here, a student presenter is asked to adopt the role of her opponent in her clinic case and to explain succinctly the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s case, followed by an informational session in which the student presenter is allowed only to give short answers {{in response to questions}} from her clinic peers; and after the question-and-answer session, students and their professors debrief the role play. The role play aspect - where the clinic student adopts the role of an opponent in her clinic case - compels clinic students to better anticipate the other side 2 ̆ 7 s legal strategy and arguments and to delve into facts that they might overlook without having assumed the other side 2 ̆ 7 s role. Adopting the other side 2 ̆ 7 s position also allows students to explore legal and policy issues deeply. In addition to providing these benefits, the question-and-answer format of the rounds allows students to develop presentation and interrogatory fundamentals. Having the opportunity to practice questioning the 2 ̆ 2 opponent 2 ̆ 2 also provides students with the prospect of learning how best to obtain information through experimenting with different modes of inquiry. For example, students can learn that hyperbole common to stereotyped exchanges between opponents may not be appropriate for gathering facts and exploring nuances in facts and areas of uncertainty. At the same time that students are learning these skills, preserving the essential elements of rounds (involving real cases, with real practice issues, and exchanges between students) means that students have the opportunity to learn to think like lawyers as they do in traditional rounds that do not use role plays or formalized question-and-answer structures. Students, for example, gain insights about professional reasoning, judgment, and values and engage in self reflection in preparing for and participating in the role play. Combining the elements of traditional case rounds - that are so critical in teaching clinic students how to think like lawyers - with opportunities to practice the essential lawyering skills of storytelling, <b>counter-analysis,</b> and interrogatory basics has many benefits worth exploring...|$|E
