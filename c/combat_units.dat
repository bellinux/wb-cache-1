5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, most of the {{surviving}} aircraft had been withdrawn from <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b> After the war, some were modified as transports for important officials, and a few others were used in various Soviet testing programs. Some supported the Soviet Arctic operations until the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b> In practice, almost all <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> in the pre-war period were white.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} option, the North Vietnamese had to destroy all the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese defences {{and then move}} on to Ban Me Thuot. The Central Highlands Front, under General Hoang Minh Thao's command, ordered all <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> to follow the second option and destroy the defences around Ban Me Thuot, but to be ready to switch to the first option when the opportunity presented itself.|$|E

5|$|Troop {{numbers for}} each side have been {{difficult}} to estimate. The North Korean army had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength. It likely had less than 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front, due to extensive losses so far in the war. MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> and 45,000 in South Korean <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b> Thus the UN ground combat force outnumbered the North Koreans 92,000 to 70,000. UN forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight as well, and US Air Force and US Navy elements provided support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed.|$|E
5|$|With {{medical and}} other non <b>combat</b> <b>units,</b> the force totalled around 2,000 men. Intelligence {{gathered}} supported {{the theory that}} Dinar was going to invade Sudan, so in March 1916 Wingate ordered Kelly {{to cross the border}} and occupy Jebel el Hella and Um Shanga. The two villages offered the only permanent water supplies that were on the road to El Fasher, Dinar's capital.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to {{maintain}} pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing {{in an effort to}} draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae. In this they were completely successful; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of Japanese troops, including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area throughout the campaign. Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 Japanese soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn. After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division, {{and with them}} reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day. After two weeks of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, {{and the need for}} more <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Britain ordered 100 M2A4s {{in early}} 1941. After 36 {{of them were}} delivered, the order was {{canceled}} {{in favor of an}} improved M3 Stuart. The fate of these vehicles is unclear. There is evidence that indicates those 36 M2A4s were shipped off from North Africa as part of the British Army's 7th Hussars and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, fighting in the India and Burma campaigns against the Japanese 14th Tank Regiment. However, according to historian Mike Green, the tanks were never issued to <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1944 the Red Army {{had begun}} to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the Einsatzgruppen retreated {{alongside}} the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most Einsatzgruppen personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in June 1950, Loring was attached to Air University and was not immediately sent to Korea for combat duty. On February 3, 1952, Loring was reassigned to the 2353rd Personnel Processing Squadron at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. This unit was quickly moved to South Korea, where it was assigned to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, with the assignment of supervising training for replacement pilots before they were moved into <b>combat</b> <b>units.</b> During this time he flew with the 36th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, while assisting the new pilots.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building <b>combat</b> <b>units,</b> while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
50|$|The Volunteer Combatant's Medal 1914-1918 {{was awarded}} for {{voluntary}} enlistment and service in a <b>combat</b> <b>unit</b> in a danger zone for {{not less than}} 6 months during the First World War. Later, the eligibility criteria were extended to include volunteers, older than 40 years of age who had served for 3 months in a <b>combat</b> <b>unit</b> in a danger zone, who were older than 50 years of age who had served for 1 month in a <b>combat</b> <b>unit</b> in a danger zone, and medical personnel who had served for 2 years in non-occupied Belgium.

5|$|In early 1943 the Army {{developed}} a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations {{to meet the}} conditions in the South-West Pacific. The Army's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year. A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra, Queensland, in November 1942, and all reinforcements for <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit. Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre, an Independent Company training centre, and a tactical school. With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1976 the {{military}} command structure was simple and direct. Major General Samantar {{was not only}} commander of the National Army – and therefore commander of the organizationally subordinated navy and air force- but also {{secretary of state for}} defence and a vice president of SRC and thus a member of the major decision-making body of the government. Holding the two highest.. posts, he stood alone in the command structure between the army and President Siad, the head of state. When in July 1976 the SRC relinquished its power to the newly appointed SSRP, Samantar retained the portfolio of the Ministry of Defense. The country's real power appeared to be in the SSRP's Politburo, of which Samantar became a vice president. Before {{the military}} coup, command channels ran directly from the commander of the National Army to army sector commanders who exercised authority over military forces.. in the field, and by 1986 <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> had been reorganized along Soviet lines. There is no indication that either the chain of command to lower echelons or the organisation of <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> has changed significantly since the coup.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery became Commander Fleet Air, West Coast, {{with his}} {{headquarters}} at the Naval Air Station, San Diego, in January 1945. He {{tried to bring}} his experiences in combat to bear in his new role, which involved supplying the <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> with men and equipment. For his services in this job, he was awarded a second Legion of Merit. In July 1945 he became commander of Pacific Fleet Air Forces, with the rank of vice admiral.|$|E

5|$|On 3 January 1942, Japanese forces {{captured}} Labuan unopposed {{during the}} Battle of Borneo. The Japanese developed two airfields (Labuan and Timbalai) on the island, which were built by labourers {{who had been}} conscripted from the Lawas and Terusan regions of mainland Borneo. The island population was also subjected to harsh occupation policies. After Japanese forces suppressed a revolt at the town of Jesselton in late 1943, which was led by Chinese-ethnic civilians, 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan. Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944. Until mid-1944, few Japanese <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> were stationed in Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1941–42 the Soviets {{transferred}} all of the remaining MiG-3s to the Navy and PVO so that on 1 May 1942 none were left on strength with the VVS. By 1 May 1942, Naval Aviation had 37 MiGs on strength, while the PVO had 323 on hand on 10 May. By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, {{and all of those}} were gone by 1 January 1945. Undoubtedly more remained in training units and the like, but none were assigned to <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> by then.|$|E
5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Germany in May 1945 {{was followed}} by a rapid rundown of Coastal Command with the immediate disbandment of <b>combat</b> <b>units</b> and the transfer of aircraft to the RAF Transport Command. Commonwealth personnel were also sent home and the powerful Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito wings were reduced. The Command still maintained strong air-sea-rescue ASR and reconnaissance forces but its ASW was lopsided. With a few exceptions, only a handful of squadrons with ASW aircraft remained by January 1946.|$|E
