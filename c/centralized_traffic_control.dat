5|$|Installation of <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> is {{scheduled}} to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European Train Control System, which {{is scheduled}} to be completed within 2023. Capacity and efficiency on the line require more passing capacity, especially for longer freight trains. Thus the passing loop at Gudå Station has been proposed lengthened. To allow trains to run from the Meråker Line directly northward on the Nordland Line, a triangular line has been proposed at Hell Station. All regular freight trains on the line come from the north.|$|E
5|$|Lysaker Station {{received}} <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> on 3 December 1992 {{and after}} that it has only been manned for ticket sales. The Airport Express Train stated calling at Lysaker Station on 8 October 1998, {{the same day that}} Oslo Airport, Fornebu was closed. The Lysaker/Fornebu name was in use until 9 January 2000. By then the amount of traffic to Lysaker was so substantial, even without the airport, that NSB continues to stop its express trains at Lysaker.|$|E
5|$|The line {{received}} <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> in four phases: from Trondheim to Stjørdal on 11 January 1976, to Levanger on 9 January 1977, to Steinkjer on 6 December 1977 and to Snåsa on 23 November 1984. Bergsgrav Station {{was opened}} on 6 December 1977. In 1981, Di4-locomotives were introduced. The spur to Øyanmoen {{was taken out}} of use and removed in October 1982. NSB introduced Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1985, cutting travel time on local services between Steinkjer and Trondheim by 25 minutes. In 1989, the station building at Sunnan was demolished. In 1989 and 1990, five stations were closed, consisting on Sandferhus, Vold, Vollan, Vist and Sunnan.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} units were introduced from the 1930s. Passenger services were reduced in 1963 and were finally abolished in 1994. The line received upgrades to its permanent way in 1964 and 1993, and three lumber terminals were opened in 1987. Since 2012 the line {{has seen a}} dramatic increase in lumber traffic. There are proposals to electrify and <b>centralize</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> along the line.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} Free-Flight, {{introduced}} in the 90 s, opened a debate on the efficiency of letting aircraft deal with conflicts without any centralized control. Many models have been proposed for autonomous aircraft solvers but their efficiency is not well-known. In this paper, we experiment powerful algorithm derived from robotics which is {{able to deal with}} thousands of robots in very small spaces, and show how its performance plummets when speeds are constrained. We also compare this autonomous algorithm with a centralized approach using evolutionary computation on a complex example to point out their relative performance in a speed constrained environment.

5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of produce to Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase the axle load. During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> by 2023.|$|E
5|$|The Jæren Line opened as {{a narrow}} gauge railway between Stavanger and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was {{extended}} from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the Flekkefjord Line. On 21 December 1924, the Jæren Line's only branch opened, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård. On 1 March 1944, the Jæren Line {{became part of}} the Sørland Line, when the line opened between Sira and Kristiansand and the Jæren Line was converted to standard gauge. The Sørland Line from Egersund to Stavanger was opened as electric on 3 June 1956. This resulted in Class 65 and Class 67 electric multiple units being used on local trains on the line. In 1960, the services were replaced by Class 68 units. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes became {{the first part of the}} Norwegian railway network, after the Ofoten Line, to centrally controlled. The <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> opened from Stavanger to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July.

40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{disclosed}} for position locating, deriving <b>centralized</b> air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> data, and communicating via voice and digital signals between {{a multiplicity of}} remote aircraft, including supersonic transports, and a central station. Such communication takes place through a synchronous satellite relay station. Side tone ranging patterns, {{as well as the}} digital and voice signals, are modulated on a carrier transmitted from the central station and received on all of the supersonic transports. Each aircraft communicates with the ground stations via a different frequency multiplexed spectrum. Supersonic transport position is derived from a computer at the central station and supplied to a local air traffic controller. Position is determined in response to variable phase information imposed on the side tones at the aircrafts. Common to all of the side tone techniques is Doppler compensation for the supersonic transport velocity...|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Congress {{authorized}} {{an overhaul}} of the system between Washington and Boston. Called the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (NECIP), it included safety improvements, modernization of the signaling system by General Railway Signal, and new <b>Centralized</b> Electrification and <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (CETC) control centers by Chrysler at Philadelphia, New York and Boston. It allowed more trains to run faster and closer together, and set the stage for later high-speed operation. NECIP also introduced the AEM-7 locomotive, which lowered travel times between cities and became the most successful engine on the Corridor. The NECIP set travel time goals of 2 hours and 40 minutes between Washington and New York, and 3 hours and 40 minutes between Boston and New York. These goals were not met because of the low level of funding provided by the Reagan Administration and Congress in the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{conflict}} detection and resolution is currently attracting {{the interest of}} many air transportation service providers and {{is concerned with the}} following question: Given a set of airborne aircraft and their intended trajectories, what control strategy should be followed by the pilots and the air traffic service provider to prevent the aircraft from coming too close to each other? This paper addresses this problem by presenting a distributed air-ground architecture, whereby each aircraft proposes its desired heading while a <b>centralized</b> air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> architecture resolves any conflict arising between the aircraft involved in the conflict, while minimizing the deviation between desired and conflict-free heading for each aircraft. The resolution architecture relies on a combination of convex programming and randomized searches: It is shown that a version of the planar, multi-aircraft conflict resolution problem that accounts for all possible crossing patterns among aircraft might be recast as a nonconvex, quadratically constrained quadratic program. For this type of problem, there exist efficient numerical relaxations, based on semidefinite programming, that provide lower bounds on the best achievable objective. These relaxations also lead to a random search technique to compute feasible, locally optimal and conflict-free strategies. This approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this survey}} paper, we present {{some of the}} issues in {{designing}} algorithms for the control of distributed, multi-agent systems. The control of such systems is becoming an increasing issue in many areas owing to technological advances which make it possible to take "legacy" systems to new levels of functioning and efficiency. Of specific interest to us in this paper is advanced air traffic management (ATM) to increase the efficiency and safety of air travel while accommodating the growing demand for air traffic. ATM systems will replace the completely <b>centralized,</b> ground-based air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> procedures. Within ATM, the concept of free flight allows each aircraft to plan four dimensional trajectories in real time, thus replacing the rigid and inefficient discrete airspace structure. These changes are feasible due to technological innovations such as advanced flight management systems with GPS. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ATM architecture, in which some of the curren [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of IP within the 3 G Radio Access Network (RAN) {{to facilitate the}} enormous increase in mobile data and reduce the operational costs of operating such networks has been highly effective. According to Infonetics Research [1], the ratio of Mobile Broadband (MBB) subscribers to total mobile subscribers {{is expected to grow}} from 15 % in 2011 to nearly 40 % in 2016. However it is well-known that further evolution and development is needed, to deliver the myriad of technical requirements to support MBB across 4 G and LTE networks. These technical requirements for MBB include: greater virtualization, effective management of large AS internal topologies, reduce internal AS convergence times, supporting large numbers of VPNs with point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint service connectivity, and carrier grade reliability. In addition, the ability to deploy and manage services using a <b>centralized</b> <b>traffic</b> engineering <b>control</b> system within the 4 G and LTE IP RAN for MBB services would be highly advantageous. Most of these requirements are addressed in the technologies to be presented. The technologies highlighted within this presentation include the Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) [2] which may be deployed for network virtualization, resolving internal AS scalability and convergence, Multi-topology MPLS [3] procedures and protocol extensions to support separation of traffic across low latency (for mobile voice) and high capacity (for mobile data) links, {{and the use of the}} SDN Application-based Network Operations (ABNO) [4] architecture to provide underlying transport (Ethernet and optical) path protection. ABNO provides the mechanisms to request and setup transport protection services, using well-defined standards based path computation, provisioning and reservation protocols and procedures. This presentation will demonstrate how the combination of existing and new standards-based interoperable technologies will provide an architecture and key features to dramatically change the way IP RANs will be designed, deployed and operated for 4 G and LTE environments.
