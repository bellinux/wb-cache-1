40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo better {{understand}} the clinical characteristics of soft tissue infections caused by Shewanella in humans. MethodsWe report a case of Shewanella soft tissue infection and review the English literature from a search of PubMed. ResultsA total of 27 adults (mean age 61. 1 ± 16. 0 years) with soft tissue infections caused by Shewanella were included for analysis. Limb involvement was found in 22 (81. 5 %) patients, while scalp, face, perineum, lacrimal sac, and abdominal wall involvement were each found in one patient. Chronic ulcer over the leg (14 cases (51. 9 %)), steroid use (four cases (14. 8 %)), and liver cirrhosis (three cases (11. 1 %)) were the major underlying conditions. Shewanella bacteremia was found in 14 out of 22 patients with soft tissue infections involving the limbs. Two patients died of septicemia, giving a mortality rate of 7. 4 %. ConclusionsShewanella soft tissue infections usually develop in immunocompromised patients with a preexisting <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcer</b> (particularly over the legs) after marine environment or seawater exposure. In view of the possible catastrophic consequences, education on the prevention of Shewanella soft tissue infections in at-risk people (e. g., the immunocompromised or elderly with a <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcer)</b> relating the need to avoid exposure to the marine environment or seawater may be of importance...|$|E

Complications such as pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis are rare in healthy children but more common in adolescents, adults, and immunocompromised patients [1]. Additionally, in immunocompromised patients, varicella may present the atypical form of disseminated ulcerative or necrotic skin lesions [2]. Also, the duration of replication and virus shedding can be extended and result in protracted disease [3].

Isoenzyme typing of three isolates revealed that they were identical to the L. donovani MON- 82 reference strain, and the gp 63 PCR-RFLP profile showed similar patterns to a reference strain of MON- 82. CL is endemic in most regions of Sudan and has been reported previously as being caused by L. major MON- 74.

40|$|Background. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an ANCA {{associated}} {{small vessel}} vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving {{the upper and}} the lower respiratory tract and the kidneys. The disease has a broad clinical spectrum that ranges from limited/localized involvement of a single organ system to a generalized systemic vasculitis that affects several organs with evidence of end organ damage. Atypical forms of the disease have been recognized with or without respiratory tract involvement with a long protracted course before manifesting as generalized disease. Case Presentation. We describe a 57 -year-old woman who presented with recurrent fever and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcers</b> on her legs who was diagnosed to have granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) after an extensive evaluation which excluded infectious, other vasculitides, connective tissue disease and malignant etiologies. Conclusion. In the absence of typical manifestations, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is indeed a diagnostic challenge to the physician.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the prevalence, characteristics, and outcome of cutaneous ischemia, {{and whether it}} can occur in systemic necrotizing vasculitides (SNVs), i. e., polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} and microscopic polyangiitis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with SNV who were included in the French Vasculitis Study Group cohort database between March 1963 and September 2007. We compared characteristics and outcomes for patients with and without cutaneous ischemia (digital necrosis and/or isolated necrotic <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcers).</b> RESULTS: Among the 1304 patients with a diagnosis of SNVs, 40 (3. 1 %) had digital necrosis and 25 (1. 9 %) had isolated necrotic <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcers,</b> with an equal distribution among SNVs. Presence of cutaneous ischemia was associated with past and/or current smoking [odds ratio (OR), 1. 73; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1. 02 - 2. 95] and history of coronary artery disease (2. 40; 1. 01 - 6. 00), as well as with other cutaneous manifestations (6. 54; 3. 21 - 8. 67), gastrointestinal tract perforations (4. 29; 1. 41 - 13. 07), and arthralgias (1. 84; 1. 10 - 3. 07) during diagnosis. Ten patients with digital necrosis underwent extremity amputation, but no patient with isolated necrotic <b>cutaneous</b> <b>ulcers</b> (p = 0. 007) underwent it. Smoking was the main risk factor of amputation (OR, 9. 1; 1. 7 - 48. 9). At a mean follow-up of 10 years, cutaneous ischemia was identified as an independent predictor of vasculitis relapse (hazard ratio, 1. 47; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 05) and all-cause death (1. 66; 1. 01 - 2. 74). CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous ischemia is a rare manifestation of SNVs but is associated with an increased risk of relapse and mortality. Tobacco use is associated with amputation, which emphasizes the importance of managing conventional cardiovascular risk factors in SNV patients...|$|R
