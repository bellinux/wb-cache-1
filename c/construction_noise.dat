25|$|The Flamingo {{opened on}} December 26, 1946, {{at which time}} only the casino, lounge, theater, and {{restaurant}} were finished. Although locals attended the opening, few celebrities materialized. A handful drove in from Los Angeles despite bad weather. Some celebrities present were Raft, June Haver, Vivian Blaine, Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, and Charles Coburn. They were welcomed by <b>construction</b> <b>noise</b> and a lobby draped with drop cloths. The desert's first air conditioning collapsed regularly. While gambling tables were operating, the luxury rooms that would have served as the lure for people to stay and gamble were not ready. As word of the losses {{made their way to}} Siegel during the evening, he began to become irate and verbally abusive, throwing out at least one family. After two weeks, the Flamingo's gaming tables were $275,000 in the red and the entire operation shut down in late January 1947.|$|E

40|$|<b>Construction</b> traffic <b>noise</b> {{continues}} to grow and it is accompanied by {{an increasing number of}} complaints from people exposed to the noise. The historical dimension of noise pollution in urbanized society identified ‘noise’ as being unwanted or undesirable sound created by construction vehicles that are considered harmful to human health and quality of life. The most important issue is sleep disturbance. However, the assessment of <b>construction</b> traffic <b>noise</b> is highly complex. Objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of <b>noise</b> induced by <b>construction</b> traffic and normal traffic. Sound levels were measured by using Sound level meter (SVAN 971) and four channel seismograph at different locations near roads where heavy construction vehicles such as ABC truck, empty truck, roller and motor grader passing through. In order to compare with ambient condition, noise induced by normal vehicles (i. e., car, three-wheeler, van, bus.) was also measured. Most of the <b>construction</b> vehicles induced <b>noise,</b> which are higher than the noise induced by the normal vehicles. Among the normal traffic, three-wheelers produce noise greater than other normal vehicles. It was found that <b>construction</b> traffic induced <b>noise</b> as high as 109 dB (L(A) max), 79. 2 dB (L(A) eq). <b>Construction</b> traffic produces <b>noise</b> at relatively low frequencies with high amplitude. Low frequency noise can be easily transmitted through structures and it can cause windows and other elements to rattle. The noise with tonal or impulsive characteristics is likely to be more annoying than noise without such characteristics...|$|R

Some manufacturers offer permanent and semi-permanent noise monitoring stations for this purpose. Such monitoring stations are typically based on a sound level meter at the heart and some added capabilities such as remote communication, GPS, and weather stations. These can often also be powered using solar power. Applications for such monitoring stations include airport noise, <b>construction</b> <b>noise,</b> mining noise, traffic noise, rail noise, community noise, wind farm noise, industrial noise, etc.|$|E

Strategies such as adjusting the volume according to the ambient noise and changing the tone to include sounds above 1600 Hz and below 800 Hz for improved localization would improve the alarm, but improvements are not cost-effective for the manufacturer and, if implemented by the equipment owner, introduce liability for the owner.|$|E

5000|$|After {{a day of}} {{stunting}} with <b>construction</b> <b>noises,</b> Big City {{flipped the}} quadrocast to Spanish contemporary hits under the branding [...] "Rumba 107.1". The format did horribly. A major reason for this, and many of Big City Radio's other Spanish conversions, was that the signal combinations worked together to serve metropolitan areas, but failed to hit the urban areas which typically have Hispanic populations. Regardless of programming, while suburban residents (and rural farmers {{in the case of}} WWYY) were able to pick up the 107.1 signals, urban-dwelling Hispanics were unable to pick up the signals. In not only New York but also Chicago, former-Big City Radio stations adopted English-language formats once they were resold.|$|R
