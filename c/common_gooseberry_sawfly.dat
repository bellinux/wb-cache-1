50|$|Nematus ribesii is {{a species}} of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae. English names include <b>common</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> and {{imported}} currantworm. This insect {{is best known as}} a pest of gooseberries. The larvae feed on the foliage of the plant, often defoliating it completely.|$|E
50|$|Nematus leucotrochus is {{a species}} of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae, known as the pale-spotted {{gooseberry}} sawfly. Widespread throughout central and northern Europe, this insect {{is best known as}} a pest of gooseberries. The larvae feed on the foliage of the plant, defoliating it. Unlike Nematus ribesii, the <b>common</b> <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> the species has a single brood. Adults appear in early May and larvae in May and June.|$|E

50|$|Other {{potential}} {{threats are}} V-moth (Macaria wauaria) and <b>Gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Nematus ribesii). Nematus ribesii grubs will bury {{themselves in the}} ground to pupate; on hatching into adult form, they lay their eggs, which soon hatch into larvae, {{on the underside of}} gooseberry leaves. Insecticides used in the 19th-century against these included tar water, weak solutions of carbolic acid, and powdered hellebore, which worked against magpie moths and V-moths as well as <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawflies.</b> (Foxglove and tobacco infusions were also sometimes used.) A 2008 study concluded that a solution of magnesium sulfate applied to a bush's leaves has a good residual action on the eggs and larvae of <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> and also appears to deter egg-laying female sawflies. Careful removal of fallen leaves and tilling of the ground around the plant will also destroy most eggs and chrysalises of these insects.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a hymenopteran, {{not a true}} fly. This insect can produce three generations per year, with larvae {{emerging}} between April and September. It differs in this respect from Nematus leucotrochus, the pale-spotted <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> which has a single generation. The female sawfly lays eggs on the undersides of the leaves and the larvae work their way upwards, stripping the plant of foliage. The larva of this species of sawfly is up to 2 centimeters long and green in color with a black head and black spots along the body. The adult is yellowish with black markings, the females slightly larger than the males.|$|R
60|$|As Gartner {{found that}} there was {{sometimes}} an innate difference in different INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting. The <b>common</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.|$|R

6000|$|On {{the eighth}} and ninth of December, {{he made his}} will, by which he bequeathed the chief of his {{property}} to Francis Barber, his negro servant. The value of this legacy is estimated by Sir John Hawkins, at near £1500. From this time he languished on till the twelfth. That night his bodily uneasiness increased; his attendants assisted him every hour to raise himself in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; each time he prayed fervently; the only support he took was cyder and water. He said he was prepared, but the time to his dissolution seemed long. At {{six in the morning}} he inquired the hour; and, being told, observed that all went on regularly, and that he had but a few hours to live. In two hours after, he ordered his servant to bring him a drawer, out of which he chose one lancet, from amongst some others, and pierced his legs; and then seizing a pair of scissars that lay near him, plunged them into both his calves, no doubt with the hopes of easing them of the water; for he had often reproached his medical attendants with want of courage in not scarifying them more deeply. At ten he dismissed Mr. Windham's servant, who {{was one of those who}} had sat up with him, thanking him, and desiring him to bear his remembrance to his master. Afterwards a Miss Morris, the daughter of one of his friends, came into the room to beg his blessing; of which, being informed by his servant Francis, he turned round in his bed, and said to her, [...] "God bless you, my dear." [...] About seven in the evening he expired so quietly, that those about him did not perceive his departure. His body being opened, two of the valves of the aorta were found to be ossified; the air cells of the lungs unusually distended; one of the kidneys consumed, and the liver schirrous. A stone, as large as a <b>common</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> was in the gall-bladder.|$|R

6000|$|Thursday was {{the early}} closing day at Lammam, {{and next to}} Sunday the busiest part of the week at the Potwell Inn. Sometimes {{as many as six}} boats all at once would be moored against the ferry punt and hiring rowboats. People could either have a {{complete}} tea, a complete tea with jam, cake and eggs, a kettle of boiling water and find the rest, or refreshments á la carte, as they chose. They sat about, but usually the boiling water-ers had a delicacy about using the tables and grouped themselves humbly on the ground. The complete tea-ers with jam and eggs got the best tablecloth on the table nearest the steps that led up to the glass-panelled door. The groups about the lawn were very satisfying to Mr. Polly's sense of amenity. To the right were the complete tea-ers with everything heart could desire, then a small group of three young men in remarkable green and violet and pale-blue shirts, and two girls in mauve and yellow blouses with <b>common</b> teas and <b>gooseberry</b> jam at the green clothless table, then on the grass down by the pollard willow a small family of hot water-ers with a hamper, a little troubled by wasps in their jam from the nest in the tree and all in mourning, but happy otherwise, and on the lawn to the right a ginger beer lot of 'prentices without their collars and very jocular and happy. The young people in the rainbow shirts and blouses formed the centre of interest; they were under the leadership of a gold-spectacled senior with a fluting voice and an air of mystery; he ordered everything, and showed a peculiar knowledge of the qualities of the Potwell jams, preferring gooseberry with much insistence. Mr. Polly watched him, christened him the [...] "benifluous influence," [...] glanced at the 'prentices and went inside and down into the cellar in order to replenish the stock of stone ginger beer which the plump woman had allowed to run low during the preoccupations of the campaign. It was in the cellar that he first became aware of the return of Uncle Jim. He became aware of him as a voice, a voice not only hoarse, but thick, as voices thicken under the influence of alcohol.|$|R
