500|$|The mansion {{house has}} four gables {{to the front}} and a two-gabled wing to the {{left-hand}} side; its plan resembles the nearby Dorfold Hall. The roof is tiled, with two prominent brick chimney stacks. There are two storeys with an attic, with both the first and second floors overhanging the floor beneath to form jetties, a typical feature of timber-framed town houses of this date. The protruding floor joists are concealed by plaster <b>coving</b> built up over shaped brackets and laths, in a fashion described by Pevsner as a [...] "speciality of Cheshire".|$|E
500|$|The Ritz's {{most widely}} known {{facility}} is the Palm Court, an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting. It {{is decorated with}} lavish furnishings, including gilded Louis XVI armchairs with oval backs, which the architects had designed based on research into French neo-classical furniture design of the 1760s and 1770s, which were made by Waring and Gillow. The room, with its, [...] "panelled mirrors of bevelled glass in gilt bronze frames" [...] and [...] "high <b>coving</b> ornamented with gilded trellis-work", according to [...] Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin [...] "epitomizes the elegantly frivolous comfort of Edwardian high life".|$|E
500|$|At its peak, {{the farm}} {{delivered}} milk to areas from Albany to New York City. After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building, {{where it was}} poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced—with compressed air at [...] per minute—through sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled. The bottles were sealed with parchment circles with the supervising commission's certification and the date, and then put in boxes with ice. The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with live steam. The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with <b>coving</b> (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning. Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization.|$|E

500|$|The house {{stands on}} an island {{surrounded}} by a 33-foot (10 m) wide moat, which was probably dug in the 13th or 14th century to enclose an earlier building on the site. There {{is no evidence that}} the moat served any defensive purpose, and as with many other moated sites it was probably intended as a status symbol. A sandstone bridge leads to a gatehouse in the three-storey south range, which has each of its two upper floors jettied out over the floor beneath. As is typical of Cheshire's timber-framed buildings the overhanging jetties are hidden by <b>coving,</b> which has a recurring quatrefoil decoration. The Gatehouse leads to a rectangular courtyard, with the Great Hall at the northern end. The two-storey tower to the left of the Gatehouse contains garderobes, which empty directly into the moat. [...] Architectural historian Lydia Greeves has described the interior of Little Moreton Hall as a [...] "corridor-less warren, with one room leading into another, and four staircases linking different levels". Some of the grander rooms have fine chimneypieces and wood panelling, but others are [...] "little more than cupboards". The original purpose of some of the rooms in the house is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the ground}} floor, {{the main room}} is the former {{entrance}} hall to the west porch, which was adapted into a narrow dining room after the main entrance {{was moved to the}} east side. Its interior features date from the early 19th century. The room is crossed by two screens, each flanked with clustered columns whose [...] "delicate" [...] capitals are decorated with lilies and leaves, described as acanthus or lotus. Similar columns also flank the room's marble chimneypiece. The leaf design is repeated on the <b>coving</b> of the modern entrance hall and internal passage. The passage also has clustered columns rising to cast-iron arches in the Perpendicular Gothic style, which de Figueiredo and Treuherz liken to those in the early-19th-century version of Eaton Hall by William Porden.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the Great Hall, {{the library}} {{on the first}} floor remains the {{principal}} reception room of the house. It is separated from the landing at the south end by a [...] "magnificent" [...] carved wooden screen, which probably dates from the early 17th century. The [...] "handsome and boldly-carved design" [...] includes pilasters with lions on the bases flanking paired double doors with arched heads and satyrs in the spandrels, and also incorporates carved cherubs and grotesques, and painted panels to the external (landing) face; it is surmounted by a central emblem. The carved wooden panelling above the stone fireplace incorporates four painted portraits, including Henry VIII and Sir George Cotton, and dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. The remaining panelling in the library is not original. The hammerbeam roof is concealed by a decorated plasterwork ceiling, probably dating from the 17th century.

2500|$|... 46 High Street {{is located}} at , {{on the corner of}} High Street and Castle Street, {{immediately}} south west of the town square. It is a timber-framed building of two storeys with attics. It has two gables to the front face on High Street and three gables to the side on Castle Street. The High Street face abuts the adjacent house (42–44 High Street), which was built at the same time. The first and attic floors on the High Street face are not horizontal; the noticeable dip in the centre is caused by subsidence, and was already evident in a photograph dated around 1890. The external timbers are painted black, with white-painted plaster panels, giving a black-and-white appearance. There are large jetties to the first floor and attic storey, not only on the front face but also on the Castle Street side; usually only the main street face was jettied. The jetties all feature plaster <b>coving</b> underneath. The corbels (brackets) all bear carvings featuring human and animal subjects against a decorative background. These include two carved busts on the first floor jetties of the Castle Street face, which are probably portraits of Thomas and Anne Churche, and {{are similar to those of}} Richard and Margerye Churche at Churche's Mansion. Other carvings include a nude caryatid (female figure supporting a structure) on the corner, a Renaissance device, as well as a sheep, a bear and a half-length portrait of a clothed woman.|$|E
