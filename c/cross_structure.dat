Here, we set out the need for and standards of using an experimental approach to road mitigation, {{in order to improve}} knowledge of the influence of mitigation measures on wildlife populations. We point out two key areas that need to be considered when conducting mitigation experiments. First, researchers need to get involved at the earliest stage of the road or mitigation project to ensure the necessary planning and funds are available for conducting a high quality experiment. Second, experimentation will generate new knowledge about the parameters that influence mitigation effectiveness, which ultimately allows better prediction for future road mitigation projects. We identify seven key questions about mitigation structures (i. e., wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> and fencing) that remain largely or entirely unanswered at the population-level: (1) Does a given <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> work? What type and size of <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> should we use? (2) How many <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> should we build? (3) Is it more effective to install a small number of large-sized <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> or a large number of small-sized <b>crossing</b> <b>structures?</b> (4) How much barrier fencing is needed for a given length of road? (5) Do we need funnel fencing to lead animals to <b>crossing</b> <b>structures,</b> and how long does such fencing have to be? (6) How should we manage/manipulate the environment in the area around the <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> and fencing? (7) Where should we place <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> and barrier fencing?

40|$|The {{barrier effect}} imposed by roads and {{railways}} on vertebrate populations has aroused both scientific and social concern and {{has led to the}} construction of <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> for such fauna in new infrastructures. Good practice demands that investment in such mitigation measures should be followed by systematic monitoring of their effectiveness, in order to improve the design of further works. These monitoring schemes need standardized protocols in order to deliver scientifically sound results at an affordable cost. In this context, the present contribution analyzes the suitability of monitoring schemes aimed at determining which vertebrate species use <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> in relation to the number of days spent monitoring each <b>crossing</b> <b>structure.</b> The analysis considers data on vertebrates using 22 <b>structures</b> <b>crossing</b> a motorway in northwest Spain, which were monitored for 15 - 26 consecutive days. Species accumulation curves were fitted by non-linear estimation procedures to the species accumulation pattern detected at each <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> in order to estimate the asymptotic number of species using each one of them. Modelling was carried out using 11 functions applied in ecological studies to analyze species accumulation curves in relation to sampling intensity. The results show that species accumulation curves for <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> have a rapid increase phase followed by a long tail of slow accumulation. Thus, 25 or more monitoring days may be needed to detect over 80 percent of the species using a <b>crossing</b> <b>structure,</b> but 60 percent of them are detected by day 10, and 70 percent, by day 16. The statistical fit obtained for different function types allows the Clench model to be recommended for evaluating the results obtained in monitoring programs intended to determine the number of species using each <b>crossing</b> <b>structure.</b> This model yielded the highest mean explanatory power (mean r 2 = 0. 905) using only two parameters; it provided neither a systematic overestimate nor an underestimate of richness, and offered a low degree of uncertainty (2. 3 % non-significant parameters). In short, 10 to 15 days of monitoring may be enough to provide a basic knowledge of the animal species using <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> at a particular time, although the monitoring period could be somewhat shorter or longer according to the requirements of particular cases...|$|R

In the aperture treatment, the choices of painted turtles, snapping turtles, and leopard frogs indicate that pipe diameter exerts a significant influence on choice.

40|$|Roads {{fragment}} {{habitat and}} pose {{a variety of}} threats to wildlife by restricting their physical movements or causing direct mortality. Wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> can mitigate some of these effects by simultaneously connecting fragmented habitat and reducing collisions between animals and traffic. This research develops two classes of spatial models for optimally locating <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> in situations where {{the goal is to}} connect discrete habitat patches that are fragmented by roads. The first group of models uses variations of minimum spanning forest (MSF) problems to select <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> locations in scenarios where the goal is to connect all habitat patches in the landscape.

40|$|Maintaining {{landscape}} connectivity where habitat linkages {{or animal}} migrations intersect roads requires {{some form of}} mitigation to increase permeability. Wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> are now being designed and incorporated into numerous road construction projects to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. For them to be functional they must promote immigration and population viability. There has been {{a limited amount of}} research and information on what constitutes effective structural designs. One reason for the lack of information is because few mitigation programs implemented monitoring programs with sufficient experimental design into pre- and post-construction. Thus, results obtained from most studies remain observational at best. Furthermore, studies that did collect data in more robust manners generally failed to address the need for wildlife habituation to such large-scale landscape change. Such habituation periods can take several years depending on the species as they experience, learn and adjust their own behaviours to the wildlife structures. Also, the brief monitoring periods frequently incorporated are simply insufficient to draw on reliable conclusions. Earlier studies focused primarily on single-species <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> relationships, paying limited attention to ecosystem-level phenomena. The results of single species monitoring programs may fail to recognize the barrier effects imposed on other non-target species. Thus, systems can be severely compromised if land managers and transportation planners rely on simple extrapolation species. In a previous analysis of wildlife underpasses in Banff National Park (BNP), Canada, we found human influence consistently ranked high as a significant factor affecting species passage. Our results suggest that the physical dimensions of the underpasses had little effect on passage because animals may have adapted to the 12 -year old underpasses. As a sequel to the above study, we examined a completely new set of recently constructed underpasses and overpasses which animals had little time to become familiar with. We investigated the importance of temporal and spatial variability using data obtained from systematic, year-round monitoring of 13 newly-constructed wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> 34 months post-construction. Our results suggest that structural attributes best correlated to performance indices for both large predator and prey species, while landscape and human-related factors were of secondary importance. These findings underscore the importance of integrating temporal and spatial variability as a priori when addressing wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> efficacy, and the fact that species respond differently to <b>crossing</b> <b>structure</b> features. Thus mitigation planning in a multiple-species ecosystem {{is likely to be a}} challenging process. The results from this work suggest that mitigation strategies need to be proactive at the site and landscape level to ensure that <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> remain functional over time, including human use management.

40|$|Roads are prominent, {{contiguous}} features covering approximately 1 % of the United States {{land mass}} {{and have been}} built for decades with little consideration for ecological effects. Increasingly, the impacts of roads are being recognized and the science of road ecology is emerging as an important area of study for conservation biologists. For wildlife, the impacts of roads are disproportionate {{to the area of}} land they occupy. Direct impacts on wildlife include mortality via vehicle collision and restriction or alteration of movement. Road kill exceeds hunting as the leading direct human cause of vertebrate mortality, with approximately one million vertebrates a day killed on roads in the United States. Roadways also affect wildlife through habitat loss and fragmentation, isolation of wildlife populations, disruption of gene flow and metapopulation dynamics. A variety of strategies have been used with mixed success to mitigate the impacts of roads on wildlife. Commonly, underpasses are used to facilitate movement of wildlife across roadways in Europe, Australia, Canada and the U. S [...] However, the effectiveness of these underpasses to facilitate wildlife movement depends on a number of variables, including: size, proximity to natural wildlife corridors, noise levels, substrate, vegetative cover, moisture, temperature, light, and human disturbance. Further, different species typically have different requirements. Thus if <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> are designed for use by a singles species, they may constitute an absolute barrier for other species that have different requirements. Most attempts to evaluate wildlife <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> focus exclusively on documenting wildlife use of structures. While tracking beds, cameras, and counters document the species using structures, they provide little information on those species or individuals that fail to use a structure. In contrast, telemetry, trapping and tracking studies are more useful for determining the extent to which roadways inhibit wildlife movements {{and the degree to which}} <b>crossing</b> <b>structures</b> mitigate these effects. Thus, to fully assess the effectiveness of wildlife passageways, a combination of monitoring techniques across a variety of taxa is needed to evaluate structure use impacts of transportation systems on animal movements.
