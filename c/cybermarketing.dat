Many global businesses have already found the Internet to be an extremely costeffective way of reaching customers and obtaining information regarding products, markets and competitors. South African marketers should also consider using <b>cybermarketing</b> to obtain useful information, and to reach, communicate and sell to current and potential customers. <b>Cybermarketing</b> {{is seen as a}} new style of marketing because of the multiple differences between <b>cybermarketing</b> and traditional marketing. Businesses will find that mastering the communications culture on the Internet is a valuable step in designing an innovative marketing strategy. The Internet is not just another promotional tool, but also a valuable source of information for the entire marketing process of an organisation. The key to <b>cybermarketing</b> success is therefore to integrate the new on-line activities with the existing traditional marketing efforts. In this study {{the focus is on the}} Internet as a new marketing tool and it's potential influence on the main elements of an organisation's traditional marketing strategy. The main goal of the study is to determine the role the Internet can play in the marketing strategy of an organisation. To support the main goal, the following specific objectives are pursued: • To gain a marketing perspective about the Internet as a "Superhighway" and its strategic value. • To investigate the nature of the information the Internet can provide for various sections of a business' marketing plan. The role of <b>Cybermarketing</b> in the marketing process of an organisation XI • To investigate the role of the Internet in a business' integrated marketing communication mix. • To identify the critical success factors when designing a <b>cybermarketing</b> communication strategy. • To investigate the extent of the current <b>cybermarketing</b> participation in the South African business environment. This study starts with a literature overview, analysing the traditional marketing and communication strategy of a business, and the characteristics, marketing functions and commercial use of the Internet. The primary data for this study was collected according to a descriptive research design. The most relevant method for obtaining primary data for this study was surveys. A questionnaire was used to provide an orderly and structured approach to data gathering. The target population for this study included all South African organisations that were conducting business in South Africa in 1999. The respondents were the marketing manager or the information technology manager of each organisation. The data for this study were analysed and reported in terms of frequencies and cross-tabulations. Final conclusions and recommendations were derived from this analysis. It was found that South African organisations mainly use the Internet in the internal environment and have not yet explored the opportunities of the Internet as a macro-environmental scanning tool. South African organisations also mainly use the Internet for information purposes. This objective results in their <b>cybermarketing</b> strategies being information-based and does not create opportunities for expanding their market to global borders by selling their product and service offerings to the international market...|$|E

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), especially Internet, now {{play a major}} role in retailing. With the stagnation of the hypermarket format in France, developing ICT could be a way for grocery retail companies to grow again.

Which associations and perceived usages can be imagined by the consumer between ICT on the one hand, and his/her favorite store on the other hand? To what extent could consumers integrate ICT in their current or in future grocery shopping behaviours? Within this context, this paper focuses on the “consumer-store” relationships. The research aims at exploring consumers' perceptions of hypermarket and <b>cybermarket</b> formats for grocery shopping. The methodology is qualitative and based on 18 semi-structured interviews and on three focus groups of French consumers.

The internet, together with <b>Cybermarketing,</b> gained its multimedia face, which {{is no longer a}} means of communication only, but has also become a tool with new and powerful applications. This research, descriptive in character, sought through the answers of 368 internet users in nine Brazilian states, to identify the behavioral variables determinant for the decision to shop through virtual retail among three groups of users: those who use; those who gave up using {{and those who do not}} use E-Commerce. A non-probabilistic methodology was used, by means of which data were collected through a questionnaire developed in HTML and hosted in the site www. pesquisams. hpg. com. br, over the period October 8 th to November 28 th 2001. The main variable determinants for the three groups were found to be: convenience – the main influence in favor of virtual shopping; preference for the real shop and the fact of not being fond of shopping without seeing and feeling the product – the main influence for giving up virtual shopping; and, for those who do not use this form of shopping, the disliking the idea of shopping without seeing and feeling the product. e-commerce, consumer behavior, internet,...|$|E
40|$|Trata da revolução em curso nos canais de distribuição dos grandes bancos varejistas em função dos impactos provocados pela tecnologia, pela globalização, pelas parcerias e pela formação de um novo ambiente de distribuição eletrônico, remoto e virtual denominado como marketspace. Esse novo ambiente, até o ano de 2007, deverá canalizar 2 / 3 dos negócios bancários que envolvam efetiva intermediação financeira. A revolução é tão importante que pode significar o início de um novo ciclo no negócio dos grandes bancos varejistas. Os impactos sobre {{marketing}} são igualmente poderosos, exigindo dos bancos uma completa revisão de sua estratégia mercadológica. Evidências foram colhidas de extensiva revisão bibliográfica, através de entrevistas em profundidade e de pesquisa amostrai com clientes bancários. Cursos de ação são sugeridos. The {{business of}} banking, specially that of large retail banks, {{is undergoing a}} radical change within the coming ten years. Technology, globalization, partnerships and the marketspace {{are some of the}} most important drivers of that change. Probably the marketspace is itself the major force behind that deep transformation. We dare to estimate that 2 / 3 of ali banking businesses (involving financiai intermediation) will be done through one or other of the marketspace devices, such as ATMs, EFTPOS, smart cards, digital TVs, PCs, pagers or the Internet. Traditional bank distribution, the large branches network, will diminish, while businesses done through the marketspace will be dominant. The winners will adopt the AAA concept: anytime, anywhere, anyway banks. Customers are changing their shopping and banking habits and the banks have a great opportunity to take advantage of that change. We see large retail banks in the future acting as leaders and controUersof business crossroads in the virtual space. Large networks of partner companies, within or outside of the financiai markets, will be providers of specialized products and services, while the large retail banks will act mainly as sellers or retailers of that specialized products and services. Brand, reliability, large customer base and strong knowledge of that customer base will be major competitive advantages for large retail banks. Following that is marketing strategy. Marketing and communication will adopt new concepts, known as <b>cybermarketing,</b> which is the world of interactive one-to-one marketing using electronic remote devices. The banks will have to leam completely new ways of attracting and retaining customers and businesses in the coming future. This thesis discusses ali those points by extensively reviewing bibliography, a plenty of recent events, the development of bank's distribution channels in Brazil and in the world, the effect of emerging technology and the impact that it has on large retail banks, specially under the point of view of marketing. We have raised ten major assumptions in this thesis: 1. People will increasingly utilize the marketspace to do their day-to-day shopping and banking transactions in the coming years. 2. The proportion of business will be carried in a proportion of 1 / 3 through regular marketplace channels and 2 / 3 through marketspace channels. 3. Banking business is, in fact, undergoing a major change that means, probably, the beginning of a new business cycle. 4. Large retail banks will be positioned in the center of major trade crossroads by being true leaders of large networks of partner companies within and outside the financiai sector. 5. Large retail banks will assume the role of leaders of distribution channels through which will flow a significant share of world trade and financiai transactions. It is from this flow that will arise the major opportunities for revenues for banks. 6. Bank marketing will increasingly be more direct and communication with customers will be increasingly interactive in arder to improve customization of products and services sold. 7. Consumers will look for multiple options of goods and services through the marketspace but, for safety, will search for the reliability provided by strong banks. 8. Consumers will utilize the marketspace for convenience, easiness and price, essentially for day-to-day shopping and financiai transactions. 9. Despite the social differences and technological underdevelopment, Brazil will closely follow first world nations in the arisal of the marketspace 10. Brazilian bankable people will have access to the marketspace in no more than ten years. Some experts of the industry were deeply interviewed as well 129 bank's customers were interviewed through a random sampling questionnaire. Both bibliography, the interviews and the answers to the questionnaires have brought strong support to ali of our assumptions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHome {{delivery}} is a service proposed by supermarkets either via online shopping or after shopping {{in the store}} and consists in transporting the goods purchased to the customer's home. It is currently difficult to estimate the turnover generated by such services but it is supposedly very low. One reason is that, nationwide, online shopping in <b>cybermarkets</b> is not a widespread practice. Turnover for the AuchanDirect <b>cybermarket,</b> for example, {{is reported to be}} just 45 % of that of any single one of the company's hypermarkets. varies across geographical space. Whereas the urban population of city centres has a diversified supply within walking distance, periurban and rural populations have to drive several kilometres to their nearest supermarket (Motte-Baumvol 2008). While this is no problem {{for the vast majority of}} the periurban population, it is more difficult for some, such as household without cars, the elderly, or families with young children. For these families home delivery, especially through online sales, may improve access to an assortment of food products by eliminating travel-related difficulties. In this context home {{delivery is}} a form of distribution that can transform the framework of analysis of the population's access to shops, especially in the outer suburbs...|$|R

However, studies about Chinese eCustomers seem to be very limited. This paper aims to identify the determinants of booking travel on-line in China.

40|$|International audienceThe grocery sector {{specificities}} do {{not allow}} us to generalize previous findings on Internet research to the electronic grocery shopping. Therefore, understanding consumer's shopping behaviour in the <b>cybermarkets</b> is of academic concern, but it could also give cues to managers as today, retailers face many difficulties with this channel. This paper presents an exploratory research based on observations in both physical and virtual channels. The specificity of our study is our collaborative work with two ethologist students who offer us very precise pre-coded grids of physical behaviours. A questionnaire also underlines disparities between “what the consumer says” and “what the consumer does” which suggest us that we will need to triangulate different methods in order to have the best understanding of consumer's shopping behaviour in electronic grocery shoppin...|$|R
40|$|Professor Lawrence Lessig {{makes the}} (rather dire) {{prediction}} in Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace that the Internet will be transformed from an unregulated medium into a highly regulated one. Lessig posits that the Net will largely be regulated {{not by the}} government but by commercial entities - in particular, by the software (or code) written by entities such as AOL and IBM. While the government 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory power {{is limited by the}} Constitution, regulation by commercial entities is not. For example, Internet service providers can censor 2 ̆ 2 indecent 2 ̆ 2 speech on the Net largely free of constitutional constraints. The 2 ̆ 2 Net libertarians 2 ̆ 2 applaud such nongovernmental regulation and contend that market forces will suffice to impose any necessary limitations on such commercial Internet regulation. For example, if AOL does not sufficiently respect our free speech rights, we can 2 ̆ 2 vote 2 ̆ 2 with our mouse clicks and choose another Internet service provider that does. Lessig is skeptical of this Net libertarian model, and contends that although such a model might reflect and incorporate individual values, it will be incapable of adequately protecting our important 2 ̆ 2 collective 2 ̆ 2 values. In this essay, I first describe Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s ideas about Net regulation and then explain the Net libertarian response to these claims, focusing on whether a libertarian market-based model would adequately protect freedom of expression. I then analyze the mechanisms of exit and voice, examining the role of exit in both Robert Nozick 2 ̆ 7 s libertarian utopian framework and in the Net libertarian model. I consider the potential dangers that an exit-based model poses to protecting unpopular speech, and observe that the sufficiency of such protection under the exit model {{is a function of the}} particular marketplace. I conclude that Lessig has not shown that marketplace regulation endangers our important collective values. I argue further that Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s favored mechanism of voice, wherein individual market members reshape a market 2 ̆ 7 s values from within, may not serve to incorporate our important collective values. Lessig contends that voice could afford such protection if somehow the meta-value of 2 ̆ 2 deliberation 2 ̆ 2 were incorporated into the expression of voice - i. e., by providing individuals with information on a subject before they were asked to make value-based decisions. However, I contend that Lessig has not shown that the introduction of deliberation into the expression of voice is warranted. I conclude that while government intervention may eventually be necessary if the market 2 ̆ 7 s potential to disregard collective values does materialize, we have not yet reached that point. Next, I consider a market-based model of cyberspace and examine Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s claim that the government will be powerless to intervene if the <b>cybermarket</b> were no longer conducive to reflecting our important values. I argue that, contrary to Lessig 2 ̆ 7 s claims, the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s state action doctrine does not prohibit court intervention where private regulation threatens important collective values such as freedom of expression. In interpreting the state action doctrine in situations where private parties have threatened free speech rights, courts have balanced the competing rights and interests at stake, examined the markets involved, and considered whether meaningful alternative avenues of expression were available. Furthermore, the government has used other mechanisms to intervene where markets have failed to protect speech adequately. I conclude that Lessig has not shown that a cyberspace governed by market forces will fail to incorporate important collective values or that courts and policymakers will be powerless to protect such values if the marketplace indeed fails to do so...|$|R
