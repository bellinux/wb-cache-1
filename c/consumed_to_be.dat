60|$|For a day's journey {{before we}} came to this lake, and all the three days we were passing by it, and. for six or seven days' march after it, the ground was {{scattered}} with elephants' teeth in such a number as is incredible; and as {{some of them have}} lain there for some hundreds of years, so, seeing the substance of them scarce ever decays, they may lie there, for aught I know, to the end of time. The size of some of them is, it seems, to those to whom I have reported it, as incredible as the number; and I can assure you there were several so heavy as the strongest man among us could not lift. As to number, I question not but there are enough to load a thousand sail of the biggest ships in the world, by which I may be understood to mean that the quantity is not to be conceived of; seeing that as they lasted in view for above eighty miles' travelling, so they might continue as far to the right hand, and to the left as far, and many times as far, for aught we knew; for it seems the number of elephants hereabouts is prodigiously great. In one place in particular we saw the head of an elephant, with several teeth in it, but one of the biggest that ever I saw; the flesh was <b>consumed,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure, many hundred years before, and all the other bones; but three of our strongest men could not lift this skull and teeth; the great tooth, I believe, weighed at least three hundredweight; and this was particularly remarkable to me, that I observed the whole skull was as good ivory as the teeth, and, I believe, altogether weighed at least six hundredweight; and though I do not know but, by the same rule, all the bones of the elephant may be ivory, yet I think there is this just objection against it from the example before me, that then all the other bones of this elephant would have been there as well as the head.|$|E

50|$|In economics, the {{marginal}} propensity <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> (MPC) <b>is</b> a metric that quantifies induced consumption, {{the concept that}} the increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers).

For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and {{the marginal}} propensity <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> <b>is</b> 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Obviously, the household cannot spend more than the extra dollar (without borrowing).|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} based on {{analysis}} of dive depth data {{was developed to}} help estimate prey consumption in ten free-ranging Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) that were brooding chicks. By simultaneously analysing the undulations in the dive depth profile (measured by time-depth recorders, TDRs) and beak opening (obtained from the recently developed intra-mandibular angle sensors, IMASEN), {{it was possible to}} determine the proportions of the undulations in the dive profile that resulted (or not) in prey capture. This methodology allowed the number of prey <b>consumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated with a mean error of 10 ± 6 % using TDR data alone. If the mean mass of prey is known, then the overall mass of prey consumed per unit time can be determined. Additionally, the method allows estimation of the depth at which prey is taken and thus indicates how penguins exploit the water column. Due to its simplicity, the proposed methodology has applications for other Spheniscus penguin species and should be considered for other marine endotherm divers that show undulations in the dive depth profile...|$|E

30|$|As the {{reaction}} continues, {{the total amount}} of total organic matter, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter somewhat decreases. The reason is that they are converted into organic matter with a low MW when as a carbon source of the system in {{the reaction}} and are <b>consumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biochemically reacted with the original soluble organic matter. In the A 2 /O process, the nitrification stage takes autotrophic nitrobacteria as the dominant species. The autotrophic nitrobacteria utilize ammonia in wastewater as energy and CO 2 as a sole carbon source to convert ammonia into NO 2 − and NO 3 −, and obtain energy for their growth needs simultaneously, thus enabling CO 2 to synthesize cellular organic matter. With no organic matter as the carbon source, there are no constraints from the low organic matter concentration in the course of nitrification. C/N mainly effects denitrification. Denitrification bacteria use oxygen of nitrate as electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment and organic matter in wastewater as the carbon source and the electron donor to supply energy and stabilize oxidation. When wastewater lacks organic matter, microorganisms consume their own protoplasm for endogenous denitrification, which reduces cellular matter and generates NH 3. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the carbon source is of great importance in denitrification. If the C/N ratio is too low, then denitrification lacks a carbon source, which leads to incomplete denitrification and a failure to remove nitrogen.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of increased water temperature characteristic of clearcut watersheds of Pacific coastal streams upon the growth rate of juvenile coho salmon. The natural temperature fluctuations of the stream were used in the study of growth of underyearling fish held in aquariums and fed at various consumption levels. Juvenile coho experiencing the cooler temperatures of the control stream demonstrated generally better growth rates than did those that experienced the warmer temperatures of the clearcut stream. The reduced maintenance requirements in the control experiment indicated a reduced basal metabolic demand, which allowed for a greater portion of the food <b>consumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> utilized for growth. This was particularly true at low levels of consumption. Growth rates of juvenile coho salmon in the wild state were found to be higher in the logged stream as compared to the unlogged stream. This difference from the experimental results is thought to be due to a change in availability and abundance of food. There was a marked decrease in the cutthroat trout population in the clearcut stream, which may have reduced competition for the coho salmon. Increased exposure of the stream to solar radiation also may have permitted en increase in primary production essential for small organisms upon which the juvenile coho feed. There was no apparent influence of infestation by salmon poisoning fluke on the condition of the juvenile coho...|$|E

The European Union’s CO 2 emission regulation for new cars, has come {{as a response to}} set emission performance limits for new passenger cars with the goal of establishing a road map change for automotive sector. Furthermore, the EU has set challenging targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % in 2030 (relative to emissions in 1990) and for energy <b>consumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generated at least with 27 % from renewable sources in 2030. As regards energy efficiency, the 2030 framework also indicated that the cost-effective delivery of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030 would require increased energy savings of the order of 27 %. The renewable energy directive particularly identified: technological innovation, energy efficiency and contribution of renewable energy sources in transport sector {{as one of the most}} effective tools in reaching the expected targets in terms of sustainability and security of the supply. In such context it is obvious that reaching these challenges will be certainly depending on the rollout of Electric Vehicles (EV) as a mean of sustainable transport, higher penetration of distributed renewable energy sources. One consequential challenge will consist in accommodating such paradigm in the most cost-efficient fashion through active involvement of customer and better flexibility of the demand. This report highlights the current trends and expected evolution in the EU in term of electromobility, Photovoltaic (PV) systems and smart grids, with the aim of identifying mutual synergies aiming at enabling: energy efficiency, sustainable transport and higher share of renewable energy sources in the final energy mix. A technical conceptual architecture for integration of EV facilities and distributed generation sources in the context of smart grid is proposed to identify the predictable penetration limits of PV systems and EV users.
