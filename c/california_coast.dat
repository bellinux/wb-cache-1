5|$|The United Nations {{designated}} Redwood National and State Parks a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980. The {{evaluation committee}} noted 50 prehistoric archaeological sites, spanning 4,500years. It also cited ongoing {{research in the}} park by Humboldt State University researchers, among others. The park {{is part of a}} much larger region designated the <b>California</b> <b>Coast</b> Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983. The <b>California</b> <b>Coast</b> Ranges biosphere is overseen by the University of California Natural Reserve System.|$|E

5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment {{to the floor of}} the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the <b>California</b> <b>Coast</b> Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of the RNSP preserves {{a number}} of threatened animal species such as the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion. In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the United Nations designated them a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980 {{and part of the}} <b>California</b> <b>Coast</b> Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Massachusetts sailed for Puget Sound and {{overhaul}} 1 September. She {{left there}} 28 January 1946 for operations off the <b>California</b> <b>coast,</b> until leaving San Francisco, California, for Hampton Roads, arriving 22 April. She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 {{to enter the}} Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1962. After being stricken, approximately 5,000 tons of equipment were stripped from Massachusetts for use on other naval vessels, including both of the explosively driven catapults used to launch float planes.|$|E

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the <b>California</b> <b>coast</b> during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E

The museum {{opened to the public}} on 7 July, under the direction and control of Pacific Battleship Center.|$|E
5|$|Mahan {{was built}} by United Dry Docks (successor to the Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company) in Staten Island, New York. Her keel was laid down on 12 June 1934 and she was {{launched}} on 15 October 1935, sponsored by Kathleen H. Mahan (the admiral's great-granddaughter). The ship was commissioned on 18 September 1936, with Commander J. B. Waller in command. The ship departed for Caribbean and South American ports within two months of her commission, combining her initial training and shakedown cruise with a goodwill tour. She remained in the Atlantic until July 1937, then headed to the Southern <b>California</b> <b>coast</b> for fleet training before steaming to her new station at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
50|$|Patrick's Point State Park is 25 mi {{north of}} Eureka, California {{in the heart}} of <b>California's</b> <b>coast</b> redwood country. The State Park was named for Patrick Beegan, an Irish {{immigrant}} who originally called it Patrick's Ranch.|$|R

5|$|USS Mahan was {{commissioned}} {{on the east}} coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern <b>California</b> <b>coast</b> for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor. At sea when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Mahan participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force. The ship joined Task Force 17 in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Late in March, she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, Mahan was back operating out of Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the <b>California</b> <b>coast.</b> This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and {{operated}} from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food {{as well as for}} conducting trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the <b>California</b> <b>coast.</b> By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E

5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the <b>California</b> <b>coast,</b> {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E
5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the <b>California</b> <b>coast</b> at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring {{in less than}} two weeks, each with mild to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred off the coast of Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern <b>California</b> <b>coast</b> occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern San Andreas Fault system that has been designated a seismic gap, and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August, Wyoming {{moved to}} San Pedro, {{where she was}} based for the next month. She went to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an {{overhaul}} that lasted until 19 April 1920. On 4 May, {{she was back in}} San Pedro and resumed her normal routine of fleet maneuvers off the <b>California</b> <b>coast.</b> On 30 August, Wyoming left California for Hawaii, where she participated in more training exercises through September. She then returned to San Diego on 8 October for more maneuvers off the west coast. The ship left San Francisco on 5 January 1921 for a cruise to Central and South American waters; the trip culminated in Valparaíso, Chile, where she was reviewed by the President of Chile Arturo Alessandri Palma on 8 February. Wyoming then returned north, arriving in Puget Sound for repairs on 18 March.|$|E
5|$|Several other West Coast and {{interior}} drainage basins border on {{that of the}} Klamath River. On the northwest are the Rogue River and Umpqua River in Oregon and the Smith River in California. On the east there is the closed Harney Basin and {{a small portion of}} the Great Basin. The south side of the Klamath River watershed is bounded by the Sacramento River and its upper tributaries, including the Pit River, and on the southwest side are the Mad River and Redwood Creek. The western boundary of the upper Klamath Basin is formed by the High Cascades and the Klamath Mountains, one of the southernmost extents of the Cascade Range, and the <b>California</b> <b>Coast</b> Ranges cover the southwestern watershed. The Klamath is one of only three rivers that begins east of the Cascades and flows into the Pacific Ocean; the other two are the Columbia and the Fraser.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the <b>California</b> <b>coast,</b> which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E
