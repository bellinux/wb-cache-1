The main challenge for neonatology in addition maintaining a low infant mortality in particular the reduction of serious morbidity and improve long-term prognosis. Nutrition extremely preterm infants is one of the most importantfactors affecting their growth. Recent clinical studies show that quantitativecontent some nutrients, particularly protein nutrition in extremely prematureinfants, has significant effect on psychomotor development and long-termprognosis of these children.

The aim <b>of</b> nursing <b>care</b> is to help premature child {{to cope with the}} premature delivery. To adjust the environment and the way <b>of</b> <b>care</b> so it suits the individual needs of every child. The support of the parental role and the efforts to involve parents in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> a newborn infant as early as possible are stressed. The following objectives were defined in the diploma thesis. To process experience with introducing new forms <b>of</b> the developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> excessively or extremely <b>premature</b> newborn <b>infants</b> {{from the point of view}} of nursing. To characterize current provision <b>of</b> individualized developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> newborn infants born before week 32 of gestation. To map the role of the nurse in delivering individualized developmental care and to find out how parents perceive the developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> excessively and extremely <b>premature</b> newborn <b>infants.</b> 4 research questions were raised on the basis of the objectives of the thesis. Which forms of the individualized developmental care are used in <b>care</b> <b>of</b> a newborn infant born before week 32 of gestation most? Which problems do nurses have to cope when employing individualized developmental care in the day-to-day <b>care</b> <b>of</b> newborn infants born before week 32 of gestation with and which roles of nurses are applied most when providing care? How do parents of newborn infants born before week 32 of gestation perceive the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> their child included in the individualized developmental care? The theoretical part of the thesis deals with the issue of excessively and extremely premature newborn babies, characteristics of the individualized developmental care and the nursing strategies, the role of a nurse and the role of parents. The practical part is focused on the qualitative research.

40|$|Mothers’ {{involvement}} {{in caring for}} their premature infants: an historical overview Background. Advances in technology have resulted in increasing survival rates even for extremely <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> While sophisticated medical management is vital to infant survival, {{research has found that}} social factors and care giving processes are important predictors of infants’ later outcome. Consequently, evidence is accumulating to demonstrate the fundamental role of mothers and families to the optimal developmental outcome <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Aim. The aim of the work reported here was to undertake an historical overview <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> <b>care</b> practices to increase neonatal nurse’s knowledge of the crucial role of mothers and families in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> their <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Understanding past practice and current trends can provide neonatal nurses with critical insight which will assist in formulating current and future care. Method. Research and historical articles focusing on maternal {{involvement in}} preterm infant care from the development of the incubator to the present time were examined. A search of the literature between 1960 and 2002 was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL and PSYCLIT databases. The search terms were <b>premature</b> <b>infant,</b> neonatal intensive care, history, and maternal care. Findings. Three major themes were identified which reflect the development <b>of</b> neonatal <b>care.</b> Firstly, over the last century advances in medical and public health practice saw a decline in mortality rates for mothers and infants. Secondly, the application of this new knowledge resulted in the institutionalization and professionalization of obstetric and neonatal care which, in turn, resulted in the isolation of infants from their mothers. Finally, concurrent advances in infant research emphasized the importance of mother–infant relationships to infants’ developmental outcome, resulting in greater flexibility in hospital practices regarding parental contact with their infants. Conclusion. As biomedical advances in technology continue to help smaller, sicker <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> to survive, neonatal nurses are strategically placed to promote positive outcomes for infants and their families through the integration of social science and behavioural research into nursing practice...|$|R

A pediatric ophthalmologist applied the 2006 guidelines to screen for ROP and to treat with laser photocoagulation in each case. We retrieved all records <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> referred for ROP screening at the hospital during 2004 to 2008. Univariate logistic regression analysis was applied firstly to identify factors correlating with stage 3 ROP or with laser treatment, and then those significant (p < 0. 05) risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. In the 138 male and 118 female <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> in this study, mean gestation age was 30. 8 ± 2. 8 weeks, and mean birth weight was 1464. 7 ± 434. 2 g. The percentage of infants with ROP in at least one eye was 38. 7 %. Thirty two (12. 5 %) had ROP stage 3 or higher in at least one eye. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the best predictors of type 1 pre-threshold ROP (requiring laser treatment) were young gestational age, low birth weight and male gender. As medical <b>care</b> <b>of</b> extremely <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> improves, timely identification and treatment of conditions such as ROP are essential. Although the incidence of ROP in this institute was comparable to that in developing countries and higher than that in developed countries, the 2006 guidelines originally developed for a United States population were still applicable.

5000|$|According to the New England Journal of Medicine, [...] "in {{the past}} two decades, the infant {{mortality}} rate (deaths under one year of age per thousand live births) in the United States has declined sharply." [...] Low birth weights from African American mothers remain {{twice as high as}} that of white women. LBW may be the leading cause of infant deaths, and it is greatly preventable. Although it is preventable, the solutions may not be the easiest but effective programs to help prevent LBW are a combination <b>of</b> health <b>care,</b> education, environment, mental modification and public policy, influencing a culture supporting lifestyle.

Reasons for this include teenage pregnancy, increase in pregnant mothers over the age of thirty-five, increase in the use of in-vitro fertilization which increases the risk of multiple births, obesity and diabetes. Also, women who do not have access to health care are less likely to visit a doctor, therefore increasing their risk of delivering prematurely.|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{practice}} inquiry was to propose the development and evaluation of Information for Parents <b>of</b> <b>Premature</b> <b>Infants</b> (IPPI). The IPPI is an educational handout that increases parent knowledge by discussing the growth and developmental expectations <b>of</b> a <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> at a particular adjusted age. The IPPI includes: growth patterns; motor development; nutritional requirements; provider contact information; and useful informational resources. Specifically, this tool encourages the PCP to appropriately assess the <b>premature</b> <b>infant's</b> development based on adjusted age, preventing misdiagnosis or needless referrals. The development of the IPPI was guided by the four principles of Levine's model of conservation, and a plan for implementation and evaluation of the IPPI has been drafted utilizing the five components of the RE-AIM framework. Introduction: Each year one-in-nine babies are born prematurely in the United States. Over the last 25 years the rate <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> birth has increased by 36 %. Compared to parenting a term <b>infant,</b> parents <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> face {{a significant number of}} challenges and stress. The cause of such stress is {{due to a lack of}} knowledge regarding the unique physical and developmental <b>care</b> needs <b>of</b> a <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> and the lack of available educational resources that are designed to address this deficit. Rationale: The increased incidence <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> births has placed an enormous burden on primary care providers (PCP) to meet the exceptional health and developmental needs of this vulnerable population. The neurodevelopmental expectations for <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> vary significantly when compared to those of full-term infants and in addition to the risk for neurodevelopment disabilities there is a significant amount of stress faced by parents. In order to manage the care and physical needs of a preterm infant and have the confidence to bond with their fragile infants, parents need a great deal of support and education regarding the unique physical and developmental needs <b>of</b> their <b>premature</b> <b>infant.</b> Furthermore, parents must rely on the baby's PCP to have the ability to recognize the sequelae that is associated with premature birth and provide appropriate education, anticipatory guidance, resources, and reassurance...|$|R

Using data from one NICU as the reference, a multivariable linear regression model of change in weight Z score from birth to discharge was developed. Employing this model, a benchmark value of change in weight Z score was calculated for each baby. The difference between this calculated benchmark value and the baby’s observed change in weight Z score was defined as the performance gap for that infant.

Study Design: A prospective, randomized experimental design. Methods: Once consent was obtained the infants were randomized to one of the three treatment groups by drawing an envelope. An oral buccal swab was obtained prior to initiation <b>of</b> oral <b>care</b> in the first 24 hours of life. Cultures are repeated at 7 and 14 days of life. Results: 29 infants were enrolled between the ages of 27 and 32 6 / 7 weeks gestation. Eleven were randomized to colostrum/human milk, 10 to sterile water and 8 to saline. Two infants were dropped due to mother's inability to produce breastmilk. Of the 27 infants remaining 15 were female and 12 males; 12 Caucasian, 5 African American, 5 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 4 other. Birthweight ranged from 590 to 2530 grams (mean 1294. 827). Three of the second cultures and 4 of the third cultures were not reported due to either lost specimens or being cancelled by laboratory personnel. Of the remaining cultures all but 2 of the initial cultures were ne. gative; dfthe second cultures 4 of 24 cultures were negative and for the third set of cultures all were positive for bacterial growth.

The Wee Care Neuroprotective NICU program (Wee Care; Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA), a comprehensive developmental care training program (Philips Healthcare) is an evidence-based total change management program designed to optimize the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment and caregiving practices. The Wee Care Neuroprotective NICU program {{is based on a}} recently developed Neonatal Integrative Developmental Care Model (© Koninklijke Philips N. V., 2014.

The seven core measures are depicted on petals of a lotus as the Healing Environment, Partnering with Families, Positioning and Handling, Safeguarding Sleep, Minimizing Stress and Pain, Protecting Skin, and Optimizing Nutrition. The overlapping petals of the Neonatal Integrative Developmental Care (IDC) model IDC model demonstrate the integrative nature <b>of</b> neuroprotective <b>care</b> (Fig.   1). Items {{on the inside of the}} lotus flower represent core measure 1, the Healing Environment; which highlight the significance of the developing sensory system, as well as the physical environment in which the neonate now lives. The aim of this quality improvement project was to determine the effect of the comprehensive Wee Care Neuroprotective NICU program (Wee Care) on seven neuroprotective core measures for neuroprotective family-centered neuroprotective developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> neonates. The sample consisted of 81 hospital NICU sites from 27 US states as well as Belgium and the Netherlands which had implemented the Wee Care comprehensive neuroprotective care training program and had completed pre- and post-site surveys. A secondary data analysis of the extant Wee <b>Care</b> database <b>of</b> pre and post-testing surveys was done to evaluate the training program. The results demonstrated that the Wee Care Neuroprotective NICU training program was effective in improving seven neuroprotective core measures for family-centered developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> neonates. Each core measure as well as the overall composite core measures score (core measures 1 – 7) showed statistically significant improvement post training (p <. 001).

METHODS: A review of all stillbirths and early newborn deaths reported in the WHO calcium supplementation trial for the prevention of pre-eclampsia conducted at seven WHO collaborating centres in Argentina, Egypt, India, Peru, South Africa and Viet Nam. We used the Baird-Pattinson system to assign primary obstetric causes of death and classified causes of early neonatal death using the International classification of diseases and related health problems, Tenth revision (ICD- 10). FINDINGS: Stillbirth rate was 12. 5 per 1000 births and early neonatal mortality rate was 9. 0 per 1000 live births. Spontaneous preterm delivery and hypertensive disorders were the most common obstetric events leading to perinatal deaths (28. 7 % and 23. 6 %, respectively). Prematurity was the main cause of early neonatal deaths (62 %).

40|$|Support of {{long-term}} breast feeding is a pressing issue of neonatology. It {{is known that}} the unique composition of breast milk ensures proper physical and neuropsychic development of infants, as it contains all the necessary nutrients in the sufficient amount and optimal proportion. The authors gave specific attention to provision of premature infants, especially with very low and extremely low birth weight, with breast milk. However, {{it is very difficult}} to launch and maintain breast feeding in this very category of patients. There are many reasons impeding adequate provision of premature infants with breast milk. The main problem on the part of the mother is hypogalactia, which may be caused by preterm labor stress, lack of confidence in successful lactation, temporary medical contraindications and, therefore, deviant formation of the lactation dominant, motivation towards prolonged breast feeding etc. On the part of the child: severe condition, no or weak sucking reflex, often — prolonged parenteral and tube feeding, need in supplementary feeding. The article presents published data on various methods of maintaining breast feeding at the stage of hospital developmental <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> and experience of breast feeding support accumulated at the Scientific Center of Children’s Health, which proves that simultaneous support and follow-up of the child’s mother and her family in whole by several specialists (neonatologist/pediatrician, psychologist, breast physician, dietician and recreation therapist) not only at the stages of labor and development care, but also after discharge from hospital are required to ensure rational and prolonged breast feeding of premature infants and normal growth and development thereof.  </p...|$|E

An analysis of the direct care revealed approximately 32 per cent of the total time spent in general body care and over $ 0 per cent spent in feeding. Mean times determined for the separate categories revealed no apparent relationship between time spent and weight of infant. Each category seemed to be influenced by the uncontrolled variables of age and condition of infants. When used alone, the weights of infants appeared not to be a good index for determining direct nursing care needs. As the weights of infants increased, there was no general pattern of increase or decrease in the mean number of nursing activities performed, the mean times for total direct care and individual categories of care, or the percentage of total time utilized in each category. The weight groups which had high mean times for total direct care also had high mean times for the category of feeding. Recommendations were made that when determining direct nursing care needs, the age, condition, and weight of infants be considered jointly and that further studies be done controlling all three factors.

Methods The study was qualitative and used focus group interviews with 24 women who had had preterm deliveries in a public maternity hospital located in Northeast Brazil during June and October 2005. The mothers returned to the hospital facility at least 30 days after the newborn were discharged to share their experiences in caring for a premature infant at home. Results Interview data was analysed for content, four thematic nuclei being identified: hospital discharge, preparing the family for discharge, caring for a premature baby at home and life changes arising from the premature birth. The greatest difficulties reported by the mothers in caring for their premature children at home were related to feeding and feelings of insecurity and fear were expressed which showed the need for a support network for the families following discharge. Conclusions The mothers’ <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> at home represented changes for parents in everyday family life, work and social life, thus showing the need for a support network for them during the transition from hospital to home when considering premature children...|$|E

40|$|The study explores mothers’ <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> {{experience}} <b>of</b> how {{health centers}} especially adapted {{for families with}} <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> can help them to cope with everyday life after discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit. Background: Premature children are at higher risk for {{physical and mental health}} problems, which makes parenting demanding. The transition between hospital and home is a challenging period where parents may need extra support to cope with everyday life. Method: Nine mothers <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving follow-up <b>care</b> at a health center especially adapted for families with <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> were interviewed. Data were analyzed by Kvale and Brinkmann’s guidelines for text analysis. Findings: The study revealed that mothers <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> need to adapt to a daily life with both challenges and joys. Mothers’ sense of coping in everyday life is affected by the public health nurse’s knowledge of and experience with <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Conclusion: Mothers <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> experience a challenging daily life after discharge from neonatal intensive care unit. A health center especially adapted for families with <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> can help mothers cope with everyday life after discharge through availability, flexibility, expertise, facilitating a social network and focusing on mothers’ own experience of their daily life...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Este trabalho apresenta uma revisão da {{literatura}} sobre os indicadores epidemiológicos e a estrutura organizacional da assistência perinatal no sistema de saúde brasileiro, enfatizando os aspectos ligados aos neonatos com peso ao nascer OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of}} this article is to review and discuss the medical literature on epidemiological indicators and organizational structure of the Brazilian perinatal health system concerning the care of very low birth weight premature infants (< 1, 500 g). DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of the MEDLINE, Lilacs and SciELO databases from 1990 to 2004, with a selection made of the most relevant articles. Documents and reports from the Ministry of Health (Mortality Information System - SIM and Live Births Information System - SINASC). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The decrease in infant mortality rates and the high incidence of maternal deaths, observed since 1990, prompted de Brazilian government to focus its strategies on the organization and delivery of care to pregnant women and their newborn infants. However, a critical analysis of the actions aimed at the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> reveals that the coverage and utilization of these services are not uniform and that the records on birth and death rates are not reliable. The availability of neonatal beds is very limited and does not meet the demand, especially for those requiring high levels of complexity. Important challenges must be overcome to adequately deal with the incorporation of inappropriate technology, the limited number of qualified health professionals and utilization of evidence-based best practices to improve perinatal care. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the rates of morbidity and mortality of premature infants requires more effective planning and intervention in the prenatal care system. To meet the demand, increases in the number of neonatal intensive care beds should be implemented through specialized perinatal centers rather than isolated beds within hospitals of with low resolution rates. These centers should be interconnected and their practices constantly monitored and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One {{area where}} the use of {{information}} and communication technology (ICT), or eHealth, could be developed is the home health <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> The aim of this randomized controlled {{study was to investigate}} whether the use of video conferencing or a web application improves parents’ satisfaction in taking care of a premature infant at home and decreases the need of home visits. In addition, nurses’ attitudes regarding the use of these tools were examined. Method Thirty-four families were randomized to one of three groups before their premature infant was discharged from the hospital to home health care: a control group receiving standard home health care (13 families); a web group receiving home health care supplemented {{with the use of a}} web application (12 families); a video group with home health care supplemented with video conferencing using Skype (9 families). Families and nursing staff answered questionnaires about the usefulness of ICT. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 families. Results All the parents in the web group found the web application easy to use. 83 % of the families thought it was good to have access to their child’s data through the application. All the families in the video group found Skype easy to use and were satisfied with the video calls. 88 % of the families thought that video calls were better than ordinary phone calls. 33 % of the families in the web group and 75 % of those in the video group thought the need for home visits was decreased by the web application or Skype. 50 % of the families in the web group and 100 % of those in the video group thought the web application or the video calls had helped them feel more confident in caring for their child. Most of the nurses were motivated to use ICT but some were reluctant and avoided using the web application and video conferencing. Conclusion The families were satisfied with both the web application and video conferencing. The families readily embraced the use of ICT, whereas motivating some of the nurses to accept and use ICT was a major challenge. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite major {{advances}} in <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>infants,</b> survivors exhibit mild cognitive deficits in around 40 %. Beside severe intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) and cystic periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), more subtle patterns such as grade I and II IVH, punctuate WM lesions and diffuse PVL might {{be linked to}} the cognitive deficits. Grey matter disease is also recognized to contribute to long-term cognitive impairment. ¦OBJECTIVE: We intend to use novel MR techniques to study more precisely the different injury patterns. In particular MP 2 RAGE (magnetization prepared dual rapid echo gradient) produces high-resolution quantitative T 1 relaxation maps. This contrast is known to reflect tissue anomalies such as white matter injury in general and dysmyelination in particular. We also used diffusion tensor imaging, a quantitative technique known to reflect white matter maturation and disease. ¦DESIGN/METHODS: All preterm infants born under 30 weeks of GA were included. Serial 3 T MR-imaging using a neonatal head-coil at DOL 3, 10 and at term equivalent age (TEA), using DTI and MP 2 RAGE sequences was performed. MP 2 RAGE generates a T 1 map and allows calculating the relaxation time T 1. Multiple measurements were performed for each exam in 12 defined white and grey matter ROIs. ¦RESULTS: 16 patients were recruited: mean GA 27 2 / 7 w (191, 2 d SD± 10, 8), mean BW 999 g (SD± 265). 39 MRIs were realized (12 early: mean 4, 83 d± 1, 75, 13 late: mean 18, 77 d± 8, 05 and 14 at TEA: 88, 91 d± 8, 96). Measures of relaxation time T 1 show a gradual and significant decrease over time (for ROI PLIC mean±SD in ms: 2100. 53 ± 102, 75, 2116, 5 ± 41, 55 and 1726, 42 ± 51, 31 and for ROI central WM: 2302, 25 ± 79, 02, 2315, 02 ± 115, 02 and 1992, 7 ± 96, 37 for early, late and TEA MR respectively). These trends are also observed in grey matter area, especially in thalamus. Measurements of ADC values show similar monotonous decrease over time. ¦CONCLUSIONS: From these preliminary results, we conclude that quantitative MR imaging in very preterm infants is feasible. On the successive MP 2 RAGE and DTI sequences, we observe a gradual decrease over time in the described ROIs, representing the progressive maturation of the WM micro-structure and interestingly the same evolution is observed in the grey matter. We speculate that our study will provide normative values for T 1 map and ADC and might be a predictive factor for favourable or less favourable outcome...|$|E
