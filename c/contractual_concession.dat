40|$|Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) {{have been}} used {{globally}} as a method to procure infrastructure projects, such as expressways, bridges, water plants, and power plants. The risks involved in such PPP projects are unique {{because of the large}} amount of investment and long <b>contractual</b> <b>concession</b> period. This paper proposed a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as risk assessment technique to simulate the vagueness of human judgement and to improve the assessment accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the proposed fuzzy AHP and straight-AHP in this paper. The fuzzy AHP process was illustrated by using an actual PPP expressway project from China. The results showed that planning deficiency, low project residual value (after 30 years of operation), lack of qualified bidders, design deficiency, and long project approval time were assessed as the top five risks for the project, and the feedback from the experts showed that these results reflected the actual project risk situation...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a global}} trend for local governments to engage in public‐private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) to provide infrastructures and public services. Light rails, water systems, waste management, schools, sport centres, social housing, {{are just a few}} examples of sectors where the private sector is becoming more actively involved with local authorities. Most of these engagements are done through mixed companies and <b>contractual</b> <b>concessions.</b> Both suffer from a major shortcoming – renegotiations. Contracts are often renegotiated within few years after signature, and some evidence show that the results might not protect the public interest. This paper tries to understand how and why renegotiations of local concessions happen by looking at the specific characteristics of contracts (endogenous determinants). To illustrate the discussion, a case study from a light rail system is analysed, exemplifying the effect of a contractual renegotiation. The authors argue that contractual renegotiation can be useful in decreasing contract incompleteness, but a poor design of these clauses can allow for opportunistic behaviour by concessionaires...|$|R

Information Technology (IT) service contracts imply {{a transfer of}} risk between parties. There has been little research conducted on how firms can apply quantitative analysis of risk factors in IT service delivery and contract negotiation. This dissertation applies risk management theory and methods from financial economics to inform negotiation of contractual parameters in IT Services agreements. The research offers contributions to the development and application of risk management and investment under uncertainty models to the problem space of information technology services investment. I develop a new model for managing risk in IT services contracts. In addition, I develop new analytic models to provide both valuation and strategic direction for benchmarking IT services under opaque conditions of market opaqueness and price volatility. Essay 1 develops the optimal trade-offs of risk and return in contract negotiation and introduces a new method IT Services Profit-at-Risk for evaluating <b>contractual</b> <b>concessions.</b> Essay 2 provides a model of valuing price benchmark provisions in IT services contracts and gives guidance on how to value and when to execute these provisions. Essay 3 examines the role of visibility of the market prices of IT services and provides a model for valuing market price information {{in the context of}} IT services price benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the early stages}} of the highway {{construction}} program in Poland. We argue that the whole investment process could be accelerated if much attention was paid to establishing a better legal framework. Investigating the bids for the A 2 highway and the implementation of the concession agreement, we highlight the excessive red tape and poor monitoring system which led to a serious slowdown in the construction process. We also stress the necessity of choosing the best adapted financing method for infrastructure investments, as the use of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme has partially failed because of its financial weakness.

2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It {{was the first}} time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role she would be associated with {{for the rest of her}} career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a [...] "delight to work with and know" [...] Arthur. By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) and If You Could Only Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in Public Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If You Could Only Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several <b>contractual</b> <b>concessions</b> from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how risk {{is reflected in}} infrastructure regulatory contracts, using examples from water utilities to illustrate key points. Partnerships {{between public and private}} sectors in capital intensive network services require risks to be assigned to the contractual party that is better able to mitigate them or to bear them. After identifying risks that must be addressed in infrastructure contracts, their classification, allocation, and impact are presented along with the measures to minimize risks. We analyze two contracts in the water sector in Portugal. One arrangement corresponds to a public-private partnership (PPP) of purely <b>contractual</b> type (<b>concession</b> arrangement) and the other to an institutionalized PPP (mixed company). We conclude that risk is a key issue in contracts with the private sector: an appropriate allocation of risks is a necessary condition for successful contracts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} regulation by {{contract in}} public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure services. Although {{the benefits of}} competition for the market and subsequent regulatory contracts are recognised, the literature also identifies contract design failures. When considering these limitations, {{it is useful to}} distinguish between contracts associated with purely <b>contractual</b> PPPs (<b>concessions)</b> and contracts for institutionalised PPPs (mixed company). Two cases from the Portuguese water sector are used to illustrate problems arising in the preparation of public tender documents: the "best " bidder is often not the winner. Often, risks are not allocated correctly nor is effective monitoring ensured. Comparisons between the two types of contracts show how external regulation can be useful in mitigating contractual problems. This examination of bidding procedures and contract design yields several implications for policy-makers; in addition, the study presents recommendations for improving regulatory contracts...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} causes behind {{the drop in}} natural gas {{production}} in Argentina since 2004, starting from a basic supply model that depends on economic incentives, and adding control variables related to different potential explanations such as firm specific (or area specific) behavior {{and the absence of}} <b>contractual</b> renegotiation of <b>concessions</b> extensions. Results from a panel of the change in natural gas production in all areas between 2004 and 2009 show that once a basic supply-past production (or reserve) relationship is modeled, other often mentioned effects become non-significant. Chiefly among them are firm specific effects and the role of renegotiations of concessions extensions. We find preliminary evidence that post 2007 renegotiations –which are associated with better price prospects- may have had an impact in correcting production decline in one leader firm. Other significant effects come from a negative impact of a change in the seasonality of production that in turn can be related to demand rationing and to price controls. Overall, the evidence suggests that the observed downcycle conforms to the prediction of a simple model of depressed economic incentives acting upon mature conventional natural gas fields and hindering investment in reserve additions or new technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{restraints}} {{are defined}} as contractual provisions binding companies of the distribution chain: suppliers and distributors, or wholesalers and retailers. Concern over these vertical restraints is justified because of their significance in the present-day configuration of industrial relations where networks {{play a major role}} and where the methods of distribution are undergoing some particularly far-reaching changes. Contracts econometrics is an interesting way to study these agreements. It is useful to highlight the situations where the constraints can be justified by market failures, more precisely by a range of externalities within the producers-retailers relationships, as explained by the theory of incentives and the principal-agent paradigm. The paper reviews this theoretical framework and provides empirical evidence from French data. To assess the agency theory empirical relevance in analyzing vertical restraints, we focus here on the intra brand competition, thus on externalities that generate a potential free-riding problem between the retailers of the same network. The central goal for the producer confronting this problem is to homogenize his network of retailers. The theory shows that vertical constraints can be a reaction from this agency problem. The data for the current study were collected in the ?yearbook of independent retailers networks? published by the headquarters of the French ?Chambres de Commerce et d?Industrie?. The information included in the 2001 yearbook comes directly from the networks in a broad range of trade and service industries. Our sample consists of 439 networks sharing a brand name. Four standard <b>contractual</b> forms (licence, <b>concession,</b> franchise, commission-affiliation) correspond to this criterion. Each of these contracts is characterized by a particular set of vertical restraints, and there is a hierarchy among the four types of contracts in accordance with the degree of constraint imposed on the retailer. The general testable qualitative prediction from the theoretical framework is that the level of externalities between the retailers of the same network determines the organisational structure of the vertical relationship. More precisely, we assume here that the level of the potential horizontal externality determines the degree of coercion of the contract between the upstream unit (the producer) and the downstream units (the retailers) within a network sharing a brand name. Considering the impossibility of measuring this externality directly, we use three proxy variables. The results of the test ? using an ordered probit model ? are partly consistent with the agency argument. vertical restraints, contract econometrics, advertising externality, ordered probit...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} exploration of cracked trials at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. Cracked trials are cases which are listed for trial {{but on the}} day they are due to be tried are disposed of in some other way. The thesis presents quantitative and qualitative data extracted from prosecution case files, as well as interviews with legal professionals, to examine the reasons for cracked trials, focusing on those trials which crack {{as a result of}} a late guilty plea. The data are analysed in order to explore the features of cracked trials, and the defence lawyer’s role in late guilty pleas (identified as significant by previous studies) is also examined. The existing literature has identified plea bargaining as a significant cause of late guilty pleas; the extent to which this was a feature within the sampled cases is assessed, and the nature of the plea bargains which were present in the data is explored. It is argued that the data demonstrate that plea bargaining played a key role in those cases which cracked {{as a result of a}} late guilty plea and that several types of plea bargain were prevalent within the sample. In light of these findings, the thesis analyses the reasons for the criminal justice system’s reluctance to acknowledge the role of plea bargaining in cracked trials (despite some recent formalisation of plea bargaining itself), and examines the extent to which grounds for policy and academic objections to plea bargaining and cracked trials were evidenced in the data collected. The thesis then considers whether either policy objections (that cracked trials represent defendants ‘playing the system’) or academic objections, (that plea bargains create pressure on defendants to plead guilty, and cracked trials are a manifestation of that pressure) are necessarily true, and whether plea bargaining could alternatively be viewed as a legitimate consensual or <b>contractual</b> exchange of <b>concessions.</b> The thesis concludes with the argument that a contradictory and hypocritical approach to plea bargaining has created a situation whereby the significance of plea bargaining is often ignored by a criminal justice system which has come to rely upon it. It is argued that the policies pursued in an attempt to reduce cracked trials are therefore flawed in their failure to acknowledge that cracked trials are inextricably bound together with plea bargaining...|$|R
