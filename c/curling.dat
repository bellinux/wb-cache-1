5|$|During his career, Martin {{has also}} served as a major {{influence}} {{in the development of the}} sport of <b>curling,</b> establishing the competitive tier in the sport and setting the groundwork for the management of <b>curling</b> teams and the creation of high-level competitive <b>curling</b> events. He is also known for contributing to the growth of <b>curling,</b> long known as a recreational and participant-based sport, as a spectator sport. Martin retired from competitive <b>curling</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of <b>curling</b> into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of <b>Curling.</b> In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of <b>curling,</b> represented largely by the World <b>Curling</b> Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian <b>Curling</b> Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World <b>Curling</b> Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of <b>curling</b> to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of <b>curling</b> games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not part}} of the {{official}} programme, <b>curling</b> was contested as a demonstration sport in 1932, 1988 and 1992. <b>Curling</b> was re-added as a demonstration event in 1988 because the Olympics were being held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where the sport has a strong following. In November 1992, the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include <b>curling</b> in the official programme of the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.

5|$|Following {{a failed}} bid {{to win the}} 2001 Alberta championship, the team then boycotted the Brier, as {{prominent}} <b>curling</b> teams of the day wanted {{to focus more on}} the World <b>Curling</b> Tour, while the Canadian <b>Curling</b> Association scheduled events conflicting with major WCT events. In the meantime, however, Martin still had his sights set on an Olympic championship. The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic <b>Curling</b> Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7–2 win-loss record. That gave the team a bye to the finals, which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8–7.|$|E
5|$|Martin began <b>curling</b> {{when he was}} {{six years}} old. He took up the sport because his father was the vice {{president}} of his local <b>curling</b> club.

The rink (a group of players) finished the round robin in second place, with a win-loss record of 7–4, behind Prince Edward Island's Kent Scales. This forced them into a semifinal against the third place Quebec rink, skipped by Steve Gagnon.

A men's tournament {{was held at the}} 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the {{official}} programme until the 1998 Games.
