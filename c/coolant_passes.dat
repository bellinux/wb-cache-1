50|$|To {{cool down}} the engine, a coolant is {{passed through the}} engine block, where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the {{radiator}} (located either {{on the top of}} the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the <b>coolant</b> <b>passes</b> through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each row of tubes. The fins then release the heat to the ambient air. Fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled coolant is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats. Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.|$|E

40|$|Safety {{investigations}} {{were performed}} on 600 - and 1426 -MW(thermal) liquid-metal-cooled reactors with the heat exchangers (HXs) located in the risers of simple flow-path pool designs. This includes both critical reactors and accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) using liquid metal coolants. For the 600 -MW(thermal) ADS, the safety implications were examined for vessel sizes of two heights (11 and 15 m) and two diameters (6 and 10 m). Then, the reference design of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter was compared with a similar design, but with the HXs located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were total-loss of-power (TLOP), unprotected-loss-of-flow (ULOF), protected-loss-of-flow, and unprotected loss-of-heat-sink accidents. The 600 -MW(thermal) ADS of 11 -m height and 6 -m diameter peaks at 1041 K after 29 h during a TLOP accident. If the diameter is increased to 10 m, it will peak after 55 h at a 178 K lower temperature thanks to its larger thermal inertia. The difference between locating the HXs in the risers and the downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. With the HXs in the risers, the temperature peaks at 1045 K after 28 h. During a ULOF accident in an ADS at full power, the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above the nominal outlet temperature. When the vessel height is increased to 15 m, the natural convection is improved, and the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 911 K. A Pb-cooled 1426 -MW(thermal) reactor of 11 -m height and 12 -m diameter is also shown to be sufficiently coolable during a TLOP accident; i. e., it peaks at 1093 K after 49 h. In a pool-type design with a simple flow path, the use of HXs in the risers and flaps at their inlets that prevent a flow reversal will have significant safety advantages in case of HX tube failures. Steam or gas bubbles exiting from the secondary circuit cannot be dragged into the core region by the liquid-metal coolant. Instead, they would rise with the coolant and exit through the free surface. Another important effect from placing the HXs in the risers {{is the fact that}} the reactor vessel wall will be cooler during normal operation and during all accidents in which the HXs still operate. This is because the <b>coolant</b> <b>passes</b> through the HXs before it reaches the vessel wall.

50|$|Existing {{photographs}} of the engine bay of the final pre-production version of this system clearly show the liquid coolant from both separators was piped along the bottom {{left side of the}} engine compartment and into the right wing. The header tanks were located in the outer wing panels ahead of the main spar and immediately outboard of the main landing gear bays. The tanks extended over the same portion of the outer panel's span as the outer flaps. Coolant from the right wing header tank was pumped by a separate, electrical pump to the left wing header tank. Along the way from the right to left wing, the <b>coolant</b> <b>passed</b> through a conventional radiator mounted {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. That radiator was retractable and intended for use only during ground-running or low-speed flight.

In the retracted position, the radiator offered little cooling, but some heat was exchanged into the aft fuselage. Finally, a return tube connected the left wing's header tank to that on the right. This allowed the coolant to equalize between the two header tanks and circulate through the retractable radiator. The engine drew coolant directly from both header tanks through two separate pipes that ran through the main landing gear bays, up the firewall at the back of the engine compartment, and into the usual coolant intakes located at the top rear of the engine.|$|R

40|$|Heat {{management}} {{is an essential}} part of combustor design, as operating temperatures within the combustor generally exceed safe working temperatures of the materials employed in its construction. Two principal methods used to manage this heat are impingement and film cooling. Impingement heat transfer refers to jets of impinging fluid delivered by orifices integrated into internal structures in order to remove undesired heat. This mode of heat transfer has a relatively high effectiveness, making it an attractive method of heat management. As such, a considerable number of studies have been done on the subject providing a substantial body of useful knowledge. However, there are innovative cooling configurations being used in gas turbines which generate compressibility and temperature ratio effects on heat transfer which are currently unexplored. Presented here are data showing that these effects have a significant impact on heat transfer and new correlations are presented to account for temperature ratio and Mach number effects for a range of conditions. These findings are significant and can be applied to impinging flows in other areas of a gas turbine engine such as turbine blades and vanes. Film cooling refers to the injection of coolant onto a surface through an array of sharply angled holes. This is done in a manner that allows the coolant to remain close to the surface where it provides an insulating layer between the hot gas freestream and the cooler surface. In order to improve turbine efficiency, research efforts in film cooling are directed at reducing film cooling flow without decreasing turbine inlet temperatures. Both impingement cooling and film cooling are heavily utilized in combustor liners. Frequently, cooling air first impinges against the back side of the liner, then the spent impingement fluid passes through film cooling holes. This arrangement combines the convective heat transfer of the impinging jets convection as the <b>coolant</b> <b>passes</b> through the film cooling holes and the benefits that come from having a thin film of cool air between the combustor wall and the combustion products. In order to improve the understanding of internal cooling in gas turbine engines, the influence of previously unexplored physical parameters such as compressible flow effects and temperature ratio in impingement flows and variable blowing ratio in a film cooling array must be examined. Prior to this work, there existed in the available literature only an extremely limited exploration of compressibility effects in impingement heat transfer and the results of separately examining the effects of Mach number and Reynolds number. The film cooling literature provides no information for a full array of film cooling holes along a contraction at high blowing ratios. Exploring these effects and conditions adds to the body of available data and allows the validation of numerical predictions. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art gas {{turbines}} {{are designed to}} operate at turbine inlet temperatures in excess of 1850 K. Such temperature levels are sustainable only {{by means of an}} aggressive and efficient cooling of the components exposed to the hot gas path. Not only the maximum metal temperature needs to be kept below the safety limits, but the thermal field must be reasonably uniform, in order to limit the thermal stresses. This requires from the designer the most accurate knowledge of the local heat transfer rate. The need for such detailed information is in conflict with some common practices in the cooling system design: numerical simulations are often compared against area-averaged experimental data; the link between coolant flow field and heat transfer rates is scarcely analyzed; moreover, the coupling between convection and conduction is hardly taken into account. The present thesis aims at the aero-thermal characterization of a trailing edge cooling channel geometry. Cooling the trailing edge, one of the life-limiting parts of the airfoil, represents an especially challenging task since the aerodynamic requirement of high slenderness is conflicting with the need of integrating internal passages. The focus of the study is on three main aspects of the internal cooling technology: (i) the details of the coolant flow field; (ii) the contribution of the obstacles’ surface to the heat transfer; and (iii) the effect of the conduction through the cooling channel walls. The investigated cooling channel geometry is characterized by a trapezoidal cross-section. It has one rib-roughened wall and slots along two opposite walls. The <b>coolant</b> <b>passes</b> through a smooth inlet channel upstream of the investigated cavity; it crosses the divider wall through a first row of inclined slots, producing crossing-jets; the latter impinge on the rib-roughened wall, and the jet-rib interaction results in a complex flow pattern, rebounding the coolant towards the opposite smooth wall; finally the air exits through a second row of slots along the trailing edge. Such a scheme represents a combination of internal forced convection cooling and impingement cooling. An engine-representative Reynolds number equal to 67500 is defined at the entrance of the inlet channel. A comprehensive experimental investigation is carried out on a magnified model of the channel, at a scale of 25 : 1 with respect to engine size (applied to both the cavity volume and the walls thickness). The main flow structures are identified and characterized by means of particle image velocimetry, allowing to deduce a model of the highly three-dimensional mean flow. Each jet is shown to impinge on the three ribs in front of the slot, and the jet-rib interaction produces two upward deflections in each inter-rib domain. Distributions of heat transfer coefficient are obtained by means of liquid crystals thermography on the rib-roughened surface {{as well as on the}} opposite smooth wall in a purely convective regime, with a uniform heat flux imposed at the solid-fluid interface. The thermal patterns on the channel walls show the footprints of the flow features detected by the velocity measurements. Globally, the top side of the rib shows the highest Nusselt number among the investigated surfaces. The presence of the ribs enhances the global heat transfer level (averaged on all surfaces) by 14 %. The aero-thermal results suggest a definite margin for improvement of the heat transfer performance by varying one or more geometrical parameters. In this perspective, the ribs have been tapered and shifted with respect to the slots position. Both expedients have proven to be useful in reducing the extent and intensity of the aforementioned hot spots in the vicinity of the ribs: an enhancement of about 20 % in area-averaged heat transfer rate is achieved with respect to the standard configuration. The thermal behavior of the ribbed wall has also been investigated in conjugate heat transfer regime, in order to study the effect of the wall conduction on the thermal levels. By matching the solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratio found in an engine, the correct thermal boundary conditions for the convective problem are attained, which guarantees full similarity between laboratory model and engine reality. Infra-red thermography coupled to a finite element analysis is used to retrieve the whole thermal pattern through the considered rib-roughened wall. Nusselt number levels in conjugate regime differ by up to 30 % locally and 25 % globally with respect to the purely convective results. Neglecting wall conduction when evaluating the heat transfer coefficient leads to underestimating the maximum surface temperature by 26 to 33 K at engine conditions. Decreasing the wall thermal conductivity increases the overall heat transfer coefficient on the ribbed surface. However lower conductivities amplify local temperature gradients and hot spots. Heutige Gasturbinen sind darauf ausgelegt, bei Turbineneintrittstemperaturen über 1850 K betrieben zu werden. Solch hohe Temperaturniveaus sind nur mittels gezielter und effizienter Kühlung der thermisch hochbeanspruchten Bauteile realisierbar. Hierbei ist es zum einen notwendig, die Maximaltemperatur des Metalls unterhalb der Schmelztemperatur zu halten. Zum anderen ist auf eine gleichmäßige Temperaturverteilung zu achten, um thermisch bedingte Spannungen zu minimieren. Für die Auslegung von Gasturbinenschaufeln kommt daher einer möglichst genauen Bestimmung der lokalen Wärmeübergangszahl eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die aero-thermodynamische Charakterisierung des Kühlkanals in der Hinterkante einer Gasturbinenschaufel. Die Kühlung der Hinterkante stellt eine besondere Herausforderung dar, da an dieser Stelle der Einbau eines internen Kühlkanals durch die geometrischen Vorgaben stark begrenzt ist. Die Schwerpunkte dieser Arbeit liegen auf drei wichtigen Aspekten interner Kühltechnologie: (i) die genaue Beschreibung des Strömungsfeldes des Kühlmediums; (ii) der Beitrag der Rippenfläche zum Wärmeübergang; (iii) den Einfluss der Wärmeleitung durch die Wände des Kühlkanals. Der untersuchte Kühlkanal hat einen trapezförmigen Querschnitt. Auf einer Wand befinden sich Rippen während die zwei gegenüberliegenden Wände mit Schlitzen versehen sind. Das Kühlmedium gelangt stromauf durch einen glatten Einlaufkanal in die Testkammer. Dabei durchquert es eine Trennwand mit einer Reihe schräg angeordneter Schlitze, wodurch sogenannte „crossing-jets“ entstehen, die anschließend auf die berippte Wand prallen. Durch die Wechselwirkung zwischen Strahl und Rippen entstehen komplexe Strömungsmuster, welche das Kühlmittel zur glatten gegenüberliegenden Wand zurückprallen lassen. Schließlich strömt die Luft durch eine zweite Reihe von Schlitzen an der Hinterkante aus. Solch ein System repräsentiert eine Kombination aus berippter interner Kühlung und Prallkühlung. Am Einlauf des Kühlkanals wird eine Reynolds-Zahl von Re= 67500 eingestellt, welche die Bedingungen in einer realen Gasturbine wiedergeben soll. Es wird eine umfassende experimentelle Untersuchung an einem vergrößerten Modell (Maßstab 25 : 1) durchgeführt. Die Hauptströmungsstrukturen werden mittels PIV visualisiert. Dadurch ist es möglich, auf ein dreidimensionales Modell der Hauptströmungsrichtung zu schließen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass jeder „jet“ auf den drei Rippen vor dem Schlitz auftrifft und dass durch diese Interaktion in jedem Rippenzwischenraum zwei Ablenkungen stromauf erzeugt werden. Die Verteilungen des Wärmeübergangskoeffizienten an der berippten sowie an der gegenüberliegenden glatten Wand wurden mit Hilfe von Flüssigkristallen bestimmt. Diese Daten wurden in einem System mit gleichmäßigem Wärmestrom gemessen, welcher an der Grenzfläche Feststoff-Flüssigkeit erzeugt wurde. Die Wärmeübergangsmuster an der Kanalwand zeigen die Spuren der Strömungseigenschaften aus den Geschwindigkeitsmessungen. Ganzheitlich betrachtet zeigt die Oberseite der Rippen die höchste Nusselt-Zahl unter allen betrachteten Oberflächen. Die Rippen erhöhen den globalen Wärmeübergang um 14 %. Die aerothermischen Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass eine bestimmte Grenze zur Verbesserung des Wärmeübergangs bei Änderungen einer oder mehrerer geometrischer Parameter existiert. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden die Rippen schräg angeordnet und relativ zu den Schlitzen versetzt. Beide Maßnahmen haben bewiesen, dass sie zur Verringerung von Ausdehnung und Intensität der oben genannten Hotspots beitragen: ein Anstieg um etwa 20 % in der gemittelten Wärmeübergangszahl bezogen auf die Standardkonfiguration ist zu verzeichnen. Das thermische Verhalten der berippten Wand wurde auch im Bereich des konjugierten Wärmeübergangs untersucht, um den Einfluss der Wärmeleitung der Wand auf den Wärmeübergang zu untersuchen. Durch Einhaltung eines für Gasturbinen realistischen Verhältnisses der thermischen Leitfähigkeit (fest-flüssig), wurden korrekte thermische Randbedingungen für das Problem erlangt. Diese garantieren die Gleichheit zwischen den Bedingungen im Labor und den realen Bedingungen im Triebwerk. Um alle thermischen Muster auf der betrachteten Wand mit Rippen zu bestimmen, wurde die Infrarotthermographie gemeinsam mit der Finite-Elemente-Analyse eingesetzt. Die Nusselt-Zahl in einem konjugierten System weicht lokal um 30 % und global um 25 % von den Ergebnissen des rein konvektiven Wärmeübergangs ab. Dies bedeutet, dass die maximale Oberflächentemperatur unter Realbedingungen um 26 bis 33 K von den Ergebnissen mit einem konstanten Wandwärmestrom als Randbedingung abweicht. Eine Verringerung der Wärmeleitfähigkeit der Wand führt zu einer Erhöhung des gesamten Wärmeübergangs an der berippten Oberfläche. Andererseits verstärken niedrigere Wärmeleitfähigkeiten lokale Temperaturgradienten und Maximalwerte...|$|E

The thermal behavior of the E&PR with PCM was determined at idle operating conditions and the effects of using the E&PR surrounded with PCM on exhaust emissions (HC, CO) were examined. It was observed from the study that the E&PR with PCM can solve the cold start problem of the LPG powered engines.

40|$|Fission {{products}} {{deposited in}} the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed HTRs, particularly in design basis accidents (DBA). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed HTR concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the AVR, an experimental pebble bed HTR, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per <b>coolant</b> <b>pass</b> was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in AVR. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in AVR was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5 [*]kg/y. Additional dust sources in AVR were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress. Dust has a size of about 1 [*]m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2 [*]hours.

Yet, when flight velocities increase over Mach 5, vehicle thermal protection becomes very critical, as the incoming air cannot be used to cool down the engine. Consequently, scramjet engines cooling must be obtained by using the fuel as a coolant. In this sense, regenerative cooling {{is one of the}} most widely applied cooling technique; the fuel acts both as propellant and <b>coolant,</b> <b>passing</b> through cooling channels located between the inner and the outer wall of the engine, before being injected in the combustion chamber. In this context, a regeneratively cooled combustor allowing the experimental study of a regeneratively cooled scramjet has been designed. Tests are realized under both stationary and transient conditions using ethylene as fuel and air as oxidizer. The effect on combustor dynamics of two operating parameter, i. e. fuel mass flow rate (which is varied between 0. 010 and 0. 040 g. s- 1) and equivalence ratio (which is varied between 1. 0 and 1. 5), has been investigated. It was observed that an increase in fuel mass flow rate between 16 and 20 % results in a raise of the heat flux density passing from the burned gases to the combustor wall between 2 and 28 %, due to a general increase in burned gases temperatures (about 5 to 20 %). It was seen that, when equivalence ratio passes from 1. 0 to 1. 5, the average ratio between the heat flux density lost with the exhaust gases and the total heat flux density generated by fuel combustion passes from 0. 24 to 0. 15, depending on the operating conditions.

A third drain tank connected to the fuel salt loop was provided for a batch of flush salt.

This approach to cooling is not as effective as possible because heat must flow from the rotor and stator through the housing to the cooling media. Because the housing must contain the coolant, it is also larger, heavier, and more expensive than necessary. This project develops a motor that uses a direct lamination cooling (DLC) system, <b>passing</b> <b>coolant</b> directly through the stator and eliminating the need for bulky housing, thereby improving heat transfer. Motor size could be reduced by up to 30 - 40 %, mass by up to 20 - 30 %, and cost by up to 30 %.

The addition of the selected sealants adds only slightly to the thermal resistance and pressure drop compared with unsealed counterparts. Phase II builds electric motors and inductors using the DLC method, obtain comparative performance data on the effectiveness of the method, and then obtain operational use data on these components through long term testing in a representative environment.

Thermal efficiency {{and the power}} output of a gas turbine increases with increase in turbine rotor inlet temperature (RIT). The current RIT level in many advanced gas turbines is far above the melting point of the used blade material. Therefore, along with development in high temperature material, a more sophisticated cooling scheme must be developed for continuing the safe operation of gas turbines with high performances.

40|$|Turbulent {{flows and}} {{coherent}} structures emerging within turbulent flow fields have been extensively studied {{for the past}} few decades and a wide variety of experimental and numerical techniques have been developed for measurement and analysis of turbulent flows. The complex nature of turbulence requires methods that can accurately estimate its highly chaotic spatial and temporal behavior. Some of the classical cases of turbulent flows with simpler geometries have been well characterized by means of the existing experimental techniques and numerical models. Nevertheless, since most turbulent fields are of complex geometries; there is an increasing interest in the study of turbulent flows through models with more complicated geometries. In this dissertation, characteristics of turbulent flows through two different facilities with complex geometries are studied applying two different experimental methods. The first study involves the investigation of turbulent impinging jets through a staggered array of rods with or without crossflow. Such flows are crucial in various engineering disciplines. This experiment aimed at modeling the coolant flow behavior and mixing phenomena within the lower plenum of a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). Dynamic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) techniques were applied to acquire the turbulent velocity fields within the model. Some key flow features that may significantly enhance the flow mixing within the test section or actively affect some of the structural components were identified in the velocity fields. The evolution of coherent structures within the flow field is further investigated using a Snapshot Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique. Furthermore, a comparative POD method is proposed and successfully implemented for identification of the smaller but highly influential coherent structures which may not be captured in the full-field POD analysis. The second experimental study portrays the coolant flow through the core of an annular pebble bed VHTR. The complex geometry of the core and the highly turbulent nature of the <b>coolant</b> flow <b>passing</b> through the gaps of fuel pebbles make this case quite challenging. In this experiment, a high frequency Hot Wire Anemometry (HWA) system is applied for velocity measurements and investigation of the bypass flow phenomena within the near wall gaps of the core. The velocity profiles within the gaps verify the presence of an area of increased velocity close to the outer reflector wall; however, the characteristics of the coolant flow profile is highly dependent on the gap geometry and to a less extent on the Reynolds number of the flow. The time histories of the velocity are further analyzed using a Power Spectra Density (PSD) technique to acquire information about the energy content and energy transfer between eddies of different sizes at each point within the gaps...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a double pulsed, {{injection}} seeded, 2 -micrometer compact coherent Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) transmitter for CO 2 sensing is presented. This system is hardened for ground and airborne applications. The design architecture includes three continuous wave lasers which provide controlled on and off line seeding, injection seeded power oscillator and a single amplifier operating in double pass configuration. As the derivative a coherent Doppler wind lidar, this instrument has {{the added benefit of}} providing wind information. The active laser material used for this application is a Ho: Tm:YLF crystal operates at the eye-safe wavelength. The 3 -meter long folded ring resonator produces energy of 130 -mJ (90 / 40) with a temporal pulse length around 220 nanoseconds and 530 nanosecond pulses for on and off lines respectively. The separation between the two pulses is on the order of 200 microseconds. The line width is in the order of 2. 5 MHz and the beam quality has an M(sup 2) of 1. 1 times diffraction limited beam. A final output energy for a pair of both on and off pulses as high as 315 mJ (190 / 125) at a repetition rate of 10 Hz is achieved. The operating temperature is set around 20 C for the pump diode lasers and 10 C for the rod. Since the laser design has to meet high-energy as well as high beam quality requirements, close attention is paid to the laser head design to avoid thermal distortion in the rod. A side-pumped configuration is used and heat is removed uniformly by <b>passing</b> <b>coolant</b> through a tube slightly larger than the rod to reduce thermal gradient. This paper also discusses the advantage of using a long upper laser level life time laser crystal for DIAL application. In addition issues related to injection seeding with two different frequencies to achieve a transform limited line width will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{electrical}} machine technology allows {{increasing the}} wind turbine output power by {{an order of}} magnitude from the technology that existed only ten years ago. However, it is sometimes argued that high-power direct-drive wind turbine generators will prove to be of limited practical importance because of their relatively large size and weight. The limited space for the generator in a wind turbine application together with the growing use of wind energy pose a challenge for the design engineers who are trying to increase torque without making the generator larger. When it comes to high torque density, the limiting factor in every electrical machine is heat, and if the electrical machine parts exceed their maximum allowable continuous operating temperature, even for a short time, they can suffer permanent damage. Therefore, highly efficient thermal design or cooling methods is needed. One of the promising solutions to enhance heat transfer performances of high-power, low-speed electrical machines is the direct cooling of the windings. This doctoral dissertation proposes a rotor-surface-magnet synchronous generator with a fractional slot nonoverlapping stator winding made of hollow conductors, through which liquid <b>coolant</b> can be <b>passed</b> directly during the application of current in order to increase the convective heat transfer capabilities and reduce the generator mass. This doctoral dissertation focuses on the electromagnetic design of a liquid-cooled direct-drive permanent-magnet synchronous generator (LC DD-PMSG) for a directdrive wind turbine application. The analytical calculation of the magnetic field distribution is carried out with the ambition of fast and accurate predicting of the main dimensions of the machine and especially the thickness of the permanent magnets; the generator electromagnetic parameters as well as the design optimization. The focus is on the generator design with a fractional slot non-overlapping winding placed into open stator slots. This is an a priori selection to guarantee easy manufacturing of the LC winding. A thermal analysis of the LC DD-PMSG based on a lumped parameter thermal model takes place with the ambition of evaluating the generator thermal performance. The thermal model was adapted {{to take into account the}} uneven copper loss distribution resulting from the skin effect as well as the effect of temperature on the copper winding resistance and the thermophysical properties of the coolant. The developed lumpedparameter thermal model and the analytical calculation of the magnetic field distribution can both be integrated with the presented algorithm to optimize an LC DD-PMSG design. Based on an instrumented small prototype with liquid-cooled tooth-coils, the following targets have been achieved: experimental determination of the performance of the direct liquid cooling of the stator winding and validating the temperatures predicted by an analytical thermal model; proving the feasibility of manufacturing the liquid-cooled tooth-coil winding; moreover, demonstration of the objectives of the project to potential customers...|$|R
