5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House <b>Cullet</b> & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E
25|$|Furnaces, {{compressors}} {{and forming}} machine generate quantities of waste heat {{which is generally}} cooled by water. Hot glass which is not used in the forming machine is diverted and this diverted glass (called <b>cullet)</b> is generally cooled by water, and sometimes even processed and crushed in a water bath arrangement. Often cooling requirements are shared over banks of cooling towers arranged to allow for backup during maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The raw {{materials}} for glass-making are all dusty material and are delivered either as a powder or as a fine-grained material. Systems for controlling dusty materials tend {{to be difficult to}} maintain, and given the large amounts of material moved each day, only a small amount has to escape for there to be a dust problem. <b>Cullet</b> is also moved about in a glass factory and tends to produce fine glass particles when shovelled or broken.|$|E
40|$|Glass {{fragments}} (<b>cullets)</b> to {{be recycled}} present different market values {{according to their}} colour. Glass recycling plants perform <b>cullets</b> sorting mainly discriminating coloured glasses from white and half white glasses. <b>Cullets</b> which are collected without distinctions of colour, can be used primarily {{for the production of}} green glass and only in part for the production of yellow glass. The production of white glass requires that only <b>cullets</b> of that colour be employed. At present, machines for the separation of <b>cullets</b> according to colour are not capable of producing an efficient classification of all the different types. In this paper are analysed the possibility that could be offered by the adoption of a colour imaging based approach to realise <b>cullets</b> sorting, analysing the textural attributes. This study was addressed on the effects that <b>cullets</b> surface status and characteristics produce on the detected colour-textural characteristics and they can influence the further classification...|$|R
40|$|The waste {{management}} is transforming {{in a more}} and more complex effort, with environmental and economic relief. The urban solid wastes are mainly produced in {{the final phase of}} the consumption, particularly by the food packaging increasing. As concerns materials recovery and recycling, a key condition for the development of selective wastes collection is the capability of recycling plants. The limitation {{in the use of the}} secondary raw materials, in fact, is due to their quality, however lower than the primary raw materials one. In the case of <b>cullets,</b> it is necessary to assure a high quality level. The technological characteristics of the glass produced by using recycled materials are deeply influenced by the chemical composition of <b>cullets</b> and the presence of extraneous items in the recycled mixture. The recognition of <b>cullets</b> produced by crushing is important in order to recycle the glass for the industrial uses. The aim of this work is to evaluate the correspondence between the characteristics of <b>cullets</b> and the characteristics of the corresponding original bottles, in order to identify in <b>cullets</b> the physical and mechanical properties of glass that constitutes the bottles. A feasible analytical procedure able to associate the <b>cullets</b> characteristics to the original bottles, independently from the effect produced during the crushing, has been pointed out...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the drying}} {{shrinkage}} of mortars reduces significantly {{by increasing the}} glass <b>cullets</b> dosage. When 100 % calcareous gravel is replaced by waste glass, the shrinkage of the corresponding mortar becomes less than one-third of that of the reference mortar (0 %). This {{is due to the}} higher modulus of elasticity of glass <b>cullets</b> compared to that of calcareous gravel. Again, the silane addition does not change significantly the behaviour of mortars.|$|R
25|$|Another common glass {{ingredient}} is crushed alkali {{glass or}} 'cullet' ready for recycled glass. The recycled glass saves on {{raw materials and}} energy. Impurities in the <b>cullet</b> can lead to product and equipment failure. Fining agents such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, or antimony oxide may be added {{to reduce the number}} of air bubbles in the glass mixture. Glass batch calculation is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is determined to achieve the desired glass composition.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the University and his Verona, Wisconsin studio Littleton began melting small batches of glass in his {{ceramics}} kiln, using hand-thrown stoneware bowls as crucibles. [...] He built his first glass furnace in the summer of 1959. [...] As a result of these ongoing experiments, the ACC asked him to chair a panel on glass at its Third National Conference, at Lake George, New York, in 1958. The panelists were glass artists and designers Michael and Frances Higgins and Earl McCutchen, who worked in laminated glass at the University of Georgia. Paul Perrot, director of the Corning Museum of Glass, was the fifth panelist. At this conference, Littleton suggested that glass should be a medium for the individual artist. By the time the ACC convened its fourth conference in 1961, Littleton not only presented a paper on his own work in glass but also exhibited a sculpture made of three faceted pieces of <b>cullet</b> that he had melted, formed and carved in the previous year. By this time, Littleton was applying for grants to get his vision of a hot glass studio program at the University off the ground.|$|E
500|$|Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as {{fused quartz}} {{into a glass}} with no true melting point, {{can be used as}} a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the {{drawback}} that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as [...] "fluxing agents" [...] (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" [...] for [...] "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called <b>cullet</b> glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" [...] because of initial electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" [...] for [...] "Strength") is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass ("R" [...] for [...] "reinforcement") in Europe. C-glass ("C" [...] for [...] "chemical resistance") and T-glass ("T" [...] is for [...] "thermal insulator" [...] – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.|$|E
30|$|As expected, due to {{the lower}} {{porosity}} of glass <b>cullets,</b> increasing the replacing of gravel gives a slight reduction in water loss with time, regardless {{of the presence of}} silane.|$|R
40|$|Combining {{the use of}} photocatalysts with {{cementitious}} {{materials is}} an important development {{in the field of}} photocatalytic air pollution mitigation. This paper presents the results of a systematic study on assessing the effectiveness of pollutant degradation by concrete surface layers that incorporate a photocatalytic material - Titanium Dioxide. The photocatalytic activity of the concrete samples was determined by photocatalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) in the laboratory. Recycled glass <b>cullets,</b> derived from crushed waste beverage bottles, were used to replace sand in preparing the concrete surface layers. Factors, which may affect the pollutant removal performance of the concrete layers including glass color, aggregate size and curing age, were investigated. The results show a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity due to the use of glass <b>cullets</b> as aggregates in the concrete layers. The samples fabricated with clear glass <b>cullets</b> exhibited threefold NO removal efficiency compared to the samples fabricated with river sand. The light transmittance property of glass was postulated to account for the efficiency improvement, which was confirmed by a separate simulation study. But the influence of the size of glass <b>cullets</b> was not evident. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of concrete surface layers decreased with curing age, showing a loss of 20 % photocatalytic activity after 56 -day curing.

30|$|Moreover, due to {{the lower}} density of glass <b>cullets</b> (2.5  g/cm 3) {{compared}} to calcareous gravel (2.65  g/cm 3), the replacing in volume gives a slight decrease of density in the hardened compound (Table  2).|$|R
2500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between glassmaking from raw materials and glass working, which is the production of finished articles by melting pieces of raw glass or <b>cullet</b> {{which may have been}} made elsewhere or by recycling old glass.|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are wholly recyclable and {{the glass}} industries in many countries retain a policy, sometimes required by government regulations, to maintain a high price on <b>cullet</b> to ensure high return rates. Return rates of 95% are not uncommon in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland). [...] Return rates of less than 50% are usual in other countries.|$|E
2500|$|The main type {{of glass}} {{found in the}} Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, {{continuing}} the Roman tradition of producing glass. There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain. It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was <b>cullet,</b> recycled broken or crushed glass. Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period, and large deposits of broken glass at Winchester and Hamwic suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period. It is possible that by recycling glass in this way {{it was possible to}} keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional <b>cullet</b> may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites. In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew. At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced. This possibly led to [...] glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of wood ash glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Glass {{recycling}} in South Africa {{is actively}} employed to promote environment sustainability. However, considerable quantities of waste are generated during this recycling process, which is disposed-off to landfills. The {{present study was}} conducted to investigate potential use of glass waste <b>cullets</b> in concrete.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of a low-impact {{chemical}} treatment based on a nitrilotriacetic acid chelating agent on the reactivity of funnel glass derived from discarded cathode ray tubes. Treated and untreated glass has been recycled either as a supplementary cementing material or as a fine aggregate in cementitious mortars. The effect of the treatment on the chemical and morphological properties of <b>cullets,</b> {{as well as on the}} solubility in an alkaline environment has been evaluated. Data so far collected underline a change in glass <b>cullets</b> characteristics that consequently affects their behaviour in cementitious mortars, reducing the pozzolanic activity as supplementary cementing material, but strongly decreasing the tendency towards alkali silica reactions when added as a fine aggregate. The leaching behaviour of lead on treated and untreated glass and on derived composites has been determined to verify the sustainability of the prepared materials...|$|R
30|$|The {{possibility}} of recycling mixed colour waste glass {{as it is}} for manufacturing decorative architectural mortars, has been investigated. In mortars, the 0 – 33 – 66 – 100 % of calcareous gravel volume has been replaced with recycled glass <b>cullets,</b> with no other inorganic addition. To mitigate the possible alkali–silica reaction, mixes with a hydrophobic admixture were also compared. The obtained results show that the replacement of calcareous gravel with glass <b>cullets</b> of similar grain size distribution permits to reduce the dosage of the superplasticizer admixture to obtain the same workability of fresh mortar; it does not affect significantly the mechanical performances, the water vapour permeability and the capillary water absorption but it reduces significantly the drying shrinkage deformation. The used recycled glass is classified as no reactive in terms of alkali–silica reaction neither in water nor in NaOH solution following the parameters of the current normative, {{even in the absence of}} the hydrophobic admixture. The hydrophobic admixture further delays the expansion trigger but not the speed of its propagation.|$|R

[...] The batch enters the furnace at the 'dog house' or 'batch charger'.
