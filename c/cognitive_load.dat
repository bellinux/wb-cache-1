5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous <b>cognitive</b> <b>load.</b> However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>load</b> {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> results in an {{increased}} possibility of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain a heavy load of information before going to sleep, there is a high chance of that information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high <b>cognitive</b> <b>load,</b> ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To assess {{standing}} {{balance in}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients {{with and without}} freezing of gait (FOG) during <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading.</b> Method: A balance assessment with <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading,</b> reading (RE) and counting backward (CB), was performed by the Nintendo Wii Fit in 60 PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 - 3) at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand. The participants were grouped into FOG and non-FOG according to the Freezing of Gait–Questionnaire (FOG-Q) scores. The center of pressure (CoP) in terms of path length (PL), sway area (SA), root mean square (RMS), medio-lateral (ML), and antero-posterior (AP) were analyzed. Results: Significant increases of PL were observed in both groups of PD patients during <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> (p <. 001). Meanwhile, the increased differences of PL during <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> in PD-FOG were larger than in PD-non-FOG. The ML displacement during counting backward was significantly increased in PD-FOG (p =. 012). Conclusion: <b>Cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> influenced standing balance and postural sway of PD patients. The effects were more prominent in PD-FOG. These findings represent the interactions between cognitive function, postural control, and FOG in PD...|$|R
40|$|Acting in our {{environment}} and experiencing ourselves as conscious agents are fundamental {{aspects of human}} selfhood. While large advances have been made with respect to understanding human sensorimotor control from an engineering approach, knowledge about its interaction with cognition and the conscious experience of movement (agency) is still sparse, especially for locomotion. We investigated these relationships by using life-size visual feedback of participants' ongoing locomotion, thereby extending agency research previously limited to goal-directed upper limb movements to continuous movements of the entire body. By introducing temporal delays and <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> {{we were able to}} demonstrate distinct effects of bottom-up visuomotor conflicts as well as top-down <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> on the conscious experience of locomotion (gait agency) and gait movements. While gait agency depended on the spatial and temporal congruency of the avatar feedback, gait movements were solely driven by its temporal characteristics as participants nonconsciously attempted to synchronize their gait with their avatar's gait. Furthermore, gait synchronization was suppressed by <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> across all tested delays, whereas gait agency was only affected for selective temporal delays that depended on the participant's step cycle. Extending data from upper limb agency and auditory gait agency, our results are compatible with effector-independent and supramodal control of agency; they show that both mechanisms are dissociated from automated sensorimotor control and that <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> further enhances this dissociation...|$|R

The influences of <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> were investigated and some clear differences in behaviour were discovered.

25|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>load</b> is an {{important}} predictor of formulaic language. More disfluency is found in longer utterances and when the topic is unfamiliar.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess the student products created by digital storytelling, and to determine the awareness towards learning the topic and the <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads</b> of students during the process. Research was performed with a total of 52 teacher candidates attending 2 nd class at “Classroom Teacher” department of Mersin University Faculty of Education in 2012 - 2013 education years. General scanning model was used to determine the <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads</b> and awareness of student products, created by teacher candidates through digital storytelling, for learning the topic. As a result of the Research, we reached the conclusion that the awareness related to basic concepts and program created by digital storytelling increased, and there was not a cognitive overload. Also, students’ opinions were taken on the process and according to acquired data, it was concluded that the students were pleased with the process, their awareness increased, and they made plans to improve what they learned and use them in the future. In line with acquired findings, it was suggested that experimental studies should be made on this topic. ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{direction}} in social perception research is developed. The present research explored {{the impact of}} familiarity and time on social perception processes based on cognitive neuroscience models, social categorization models, and memory consolidation constructs. Familiarity was manipulated within an exposure task and time was manipulated by testing participants both 2 - 6 hr and 48 hr after the exposure task. Experiment 1 investigated the influence of familiarity and time on the argument of the automaticity of social categorization and associated stereotypes by testing the argument with two separate tasks. Experiment 1 a tested the influence of familiarity and time on associated stereotypes and found that, with familiarity and time, participants responded to individualizing information faster than to stereotypic information. Experiment 1 b tested the influence of familiarity and time on social categorization and found further support for the automaticity of social categorization. Experiment 2 further investigated the influence of familiarity and time on social perception by embedding <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads</b> within a categorization task. Experiment 2 found little support for the influence of familiarity and time on social categorization and <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads.</b> The current research is discussed for its relevance to models of social perception. ...|$|R

They cannot distinguish similar-sounding newly learned words such as ‘bih’ and ‘dih’, however. So, while children at this age {{are able to}} distinguish monosyllabic minimal pairs at a purely phonological level, if the discrimination task is paired with word meaning, the additional <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> required by learning the word meanings leaves them unable to spend the extra effort on distinguishing the similar phonology.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with <b>cognitive</b> <b>load.</b> Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, {{perhaps because it}} admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> theory to explain how people learn from multimedia presentations.|$|E

The operators of these robots are affected by high cognitive load; this hinders effective robot usage. This paper presents a <b>cognitive</b> task <b>load</b> model for real-time monitoring and, subsequently, balancing of workload on three factors that affect operator performance and cognitive load: time occupied, level of information processing and number of task switches. To test an implementation of the model, five participants drove a shape-shifting USAR robot, accumulating over 16 hours of driving time in the course of 485 USAR missions with varying objectives and difficulty. An accuracy of 69 % was obtained for discrimination between low and high cognitive load; higher accuracy was measured for discrimination between extreme <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads.</b> This demonstrates that such a model can contribute, in a non-invasive manner, to estimating an operator’s cognitive state. Several ways to further improve accuracy are discussed, based on additional experimental results...|$|R

Differences in schema structure and problem solving behavior for different ability levels will be analyzed. In this study I will also introduce some instructional design strategies based on the findings. There are three parts in this paper: The pre-test, the instructional design and the post-test. In the pre-test there are two groups of higher secondary school students – high achievers group and low achievers group – participating in a test with different kinds of geometric problem about properties of circle. Questions are designed to test language ability, <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads,</b> problem solving style and generative ability in problem solving. An open-ended question is set to investigate the schema difference for high and low achievers through an analysis by solution path diagram. Results show that high achievers organize their knowledge with structured schema and demonstrate a higher generative ability. In the instructional design part I will present some strategies such as diagram- text integrated teaching to help students overcoming limits of <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads.</b> In the post-test part, low achievers show significant improvements in solving geometric problems after attending the class that is carefully designed with strategies mentioned in the previous part.

The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both {{a direct and}} an indirect circuit. The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.

25|$|When an {{individual}} tries to suppress thoughts under a high <b>cognitive</b> <b>load,</b> {{the frequency of}} those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their thoughts from being translated into behavior when self-monitoring is high; this {{does not apply to}} automatic behaviors though, and may result in latent, unconscious actions. This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has, although the experiments in this area can be criticized for using impersonal concurrent tasks, {{which may or may not}} properly reflect natural processes or individual differences. Ironic process theory is one cognitive model that can explain the paradoxical effect seen above. However, given the mixed evidence and commensurate with the latest research, it is suggested that such a model needs to account for individual differences. It should also note possible neurological dynamics (see, for instance, obsessive–compulsive disorder), to be considered robust.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} systems engineering based methodology for quantifying effects of <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading,</b> and for modeling the human brain response in systems engineering terms. The visual-cortical response was selected as the input-output channel around which the methodology was developed. A steady-state input (a continuous sum of 10 sine waves) and a transient input (a train of pulses) were used for system stimulation. The human occipital EEG (surface electrodes at Oz and mastoids) was used as the cortical output. Analysis of input stimuli and output EEG potentials produced human visual-cortical describing functions (gain and phase) and remnant spectra (background EEG). ^ A stimulus parametric investigation indicated that sensitivity to stimulus modulation depth is unequal across frequencies, and that relatively low stimulus intensity and depth of modulation are desirable to reduce response saturation. ^ Comparisons between transient and steady-state stimulation revealed that both forms produced functionally related responses, suggesting that the visual-cortical response contains a measurable linear portion. Time domain amplitude changes corresponded to transient and steady-state gain changes. ^ Consistent trends observed among subjects indicated that it is advisable to group subjects into two classes: alpha responders, and non-alpha responders. Classification would be based upon alpha band (8 to 12 Hz) responses in both remnant and gain curves. ^ To investigate <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading</b> effects three tasks were utilized: manual tracking, grammatical reasoning, and supervisory control. Changes in visual-cortical response measures related to task loading were observed. With increased <b>cognitive</b> <b>loading,</b> alpha responders generally showed reductions in alpha band gain and remnant, and increases in beta band gain. Non-alpha responders showed increases in beta band gain only. Performance of supervisory control caused a reduction in phase lag for all subjects tested. Results revealed that individual differences must be accounted for. ^ Some success in matching data with the model forms considered was achieved. Multipath modeling provided a promising approach for handling observed dropout points in the data. Model parameter values were found to relate to task performance scores. A model form based upon alpha and non-alpha classification should be individually applied. ...|$|R
30|$|Motivation is a {{combination}} of elements such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction, which can increase germane <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads.</b> Chang, (2010) examine the effects of motivation in an instructional simulation game, called SIMPLE. According to the post-game evaluation, student motivation comes from peer learning and user cooperation. Moreover, when instructors teach strategy, this enhances student motivation and engagement, encouraging acceptance of the game, and leading to stronger interest in course-directed learning. Thus, teachers should create a flexible learning environment, giving due consideration to peer interaction, learning motivation, pedagogical support and encouragement to help students develop their autonomy and retain an interest in learning.|$|R

The main aim is to facilitate cognitive-emotional experiences in cultural heritage environments by effectively communicating cultural values to non-captives audiences. A 3 -component Roving Museum (RM) is operated in seven countries (GR, BG, HR, HU, IT, RO). The RM adapts to visitor needs in a constantly changing knowledge ecosystem implementing new ways of recreational learning and visitor satisfaction. It includes a QRC-driven portable exhibition with 110 cultural heritage narratives, accessible via QRCs in the territory, an app for iOS and Android, and a social media driven participatory space, to support contextual co-creation and participatory learning. A cognitive driven communication pattern has been developed and adapted to the conditions regulating the recreational learning environment. The pattern employs interrelated content segments in order to free the working memory (WM) from irrelevant <b>cognitive</b> <b>loads,</b> enabling new <b>cognitive</b> content to relate to prior knowledge. The design presupposes a limited WM capacity to deal with visual, auditory and verbal material, and an almost unlimited long-term memory (LTM), able to hold mental representations that vary in their degree of automation.

2500|$|When the <b>cognitive</b> <b>load</b> is increased, thought {{suppression}} typically {{becomes less}} effective. For example, {{in the white}} bear experiment, many general distractions in the environment (for instance a lamp, a light bulb, a desk etc.) might later serve as reminders of the object being suppressed (these are {{also referred to as}} [...] "free distraction"). Some studies, however, are unable to find this effect for emotional thoughts in hypnotized individuals when one focused distraction is provided. In an attempt to account for these findings, a number of theorists have produced cognitive models of thought suppression. Wegner suggests that individuals distract themselves using environmental items. Later, these items become retrieval cues for the thought attempting to be suppressed (i.e. [...] "environmental cueing theory"). This iterative process leaves the individual surrounded by retrieval cues, ultimately causing the rebound effect. Wegner hypothesizes that multiple retrieval cues not being forged explains, in part, the effectiveness of focused distraction (i.e., a reduction of mental load). This is because there may be an ideal balance between the two processes; if the cognitive demand that isn't too heavy, then the monitoring processes won't supersede it.|$|E
