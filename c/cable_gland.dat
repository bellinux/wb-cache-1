50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>gland</b> (in the U.S. {{more often}} {{known as a}} cable {{connector}} or fitting) is a device designed to attach and secure {{the end of an}} electrical cable to the equipment. A <b>cable</b> <b>gland</b> provides strain-relief and connects by a means suitable for the type and description of cable for which it is designed—including provision for making electrical connection to the armour or braid and lead or aluminium sheath of the cable, if any. Cable glands may also be used for sealing cables passing through bulkheads or gland plates.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} sealed {{connections}} without moving parts are also sometimes called glands; for example, a <b>cable</b> <b>gland</b> or fitting that connects a flexible electrical conduit to an enclosure, machine or bulkhead facilitates assembly and prevents liquid or gas ingress.|$|E
50|$|For routing pre-terminated cables (cables with connectors), split <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> can be used. These <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> {{consist of}} three parts (two gland halves and a split sealing grommet) which are screwed with a {{hexagonal}} locknut (like normal <b>cable</b> <b>glands).</b> Thus, pre-assembled <b>cables</b> can be routed without removing the plugs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>glands</b> are {{mechanical}} <b>cable</b> entry devices. They {{are used}} throughout {{a number of}} industries in conjunction with cable and wiring used in electrical instrumentation and automation systems. <b>Cable</b> <b>glands</b> may be used on all types of electrical power, control, instrumentation, data and telecommunications cables. They are used as a sealing and termination device {{to ensure that the}} characteristics of the enclosure which the cable enters can be maintained adequately. <b>Cable</b> <b>glands</b> are made of various plastics, steel, brass or aluminum. Glands intended to resist dripping water or water pressure will include synthetic rubber or other types of elastomer seals. Certain types of <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> may also serve to prevent entry of flammable gas into equipment enclosures, for electrical equipment in hazardous areas.|$|R

50|$|The {{miniature}} camera was waterproofed by sliding {{it into a}} square-section 25 mm wide aluminium tube (only slightly bigger than the camera), with a glass window glued in one end, and a <b>cable</b> <b>gland</b> at the other. The waterproof container sold for this camera was too large and heavy for the MineCam, but the aluminium tube is not as watertight. It has an IP rating of between 66 and 67.|$|E

40|$|Keywords:Cable gland, {{interference}} leakproof, elastic leakproof ring. Abstract. The leakproofness of {{the submarine}} <b>cable</b> <b>gland</b> is {{of very high}} requirement, the traditional leakproof method can hardly meet the requirement more or less. In this paper, by researching the interference leakproof structure, we creatively applied the elastic leakproof ring into the submarine <b>cable</b> <b>gland.</b> Through theoretical model analysis and test, {{it can be concluded}} that the leakproof device is able to work under 3. 5 MPa water pressure. 1...|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> {{are often}} called [...] "connectors", a {{technical}} distinction {{can be made}} in the terminology, which differentiates them from quick-disconnect, conducting electrical connectors.|$|R
50|$|Even today, Panzergewinde <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> {{are still}} often found on {{chemical}} reactors and bioreactors (for example, PG13.5 thread for screwing in sensors) {{and various other}} equipment, enclosures, junction boxes, and connectors.|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{number of}} standards provide various transfer impedance requirements and test methods for individual cables, {{but just a}} few are related to connectors. Only two stand-ards describe how to test cable-gland-connector-receptacle as-semblies. The cable-gland-connector receptacle assembly has significant effects on the total considered impedance chain. In general the supplier for <b>cable,</b> <b>gland</b> and connector is different. For the introduction of commercial off the shelf connectors tests were performed on connectors and cable-connector sets, and inconsistent results were observed, showing extremely high trans-fer impedance, thus poor screening effectiveness. It is shown that the transfer impedance of such glands is greatly dependent on its shape, and how glands are mounted...|$|E
40|$|Where {{machines}} and equipment are constructed {{for use in}} hygienic manufacturing environments, {{they have to be}} designed with features that enable ease of cleaning. Several standards and guidelines state the main criteria and design recommendations for this. Media supply interfaces (electricity, compressed air, vacuum) at the transition point between cables/hoses and housings is the most common weak point as far as the ability to comprehensively clean such systems is concerned. Meanwhile, several solution recommendations for <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> are now commercially available. In the following article, the cleanability of selected <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> is investigated and assessed. A riboflavin test is utilized as a recognized and well-established method for visualizing and evaluating areas that are not reached by cleaning processes...|$|R
50|$|In computing, an {{electrical}} connector {{can also be}} known as a physical interface (compare physical layer in OSI model of networking). <b>Cable</b> <b>glands,</b> known as <b>cable</b> connectors in the US, connect wires to devices mechanically rather th{{an electrical}}ly and are distinct from quick-disconnects performing the latter.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 2000, the VDE {{standard}} for <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> (VDE 0619) was formally replaced by EN 50262. After a transitional {{period of several}} years during which it could still be used, it was replaced in 2003 by a final metric fine thread with 1.5 mm pitch. Similarly, conduit threads were replaced by EN 60423.|$|R
50|$|From the 50s on, {{machines}} and switch cabinets were {{more and more}} wired by using heavy-duty industrial connectors but the increasing cost pressure forced engineers to look for more cost-effective solutions and to decrease the risk of miswiring. In the 90s cable entry systems have been developed {{as an alternative to}} heavy-duty industrial connectors and <b>cable</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Flat TPS is more common, and is {{used for}} fixed wiring of {{domestic}} and industrial lighting, power outlets and, also, for [...] "hard-wired" [...] appliances and {{heating and air conditioning}} units. Round TPS is less common, and is generally used only where <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> are required. It may be more difficult to strip the outer sheathing from round TPS than from flat TPS.|$|R
5000|$|The Stahlpanzerrohrgewinde {{standard}} for screw threads, more often {{called by the}} shorter name Panzergewinde (pronunciation), is a technical standard created in Germany and subsequently used in various countries, such as the German-speaking world (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) and neighboring European countries. The German name [...] "Stahlpanzerrohrgewinde" [...] translates to English as 'steel (pipe armoured) conduit thread'. The thread is used to join pieces of electrical conduit and <b>cable</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{the walls}} of the conduit are usually {{relatively}} thin, the thread depth should not be very large. Thus a thread angle of 80° is used. The Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (VDE) (which began as a trade association for standardization in electrical engineering) originally standardized (and named) the thread for use with conduit and <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> that were made of steel, although today the thread is used with both steel (typically plated with combinations of nickel, zinc, or tin to resist rusting) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).|$|R
50|$|For routing of {{standard}} cables and other electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic lines through machine, panel or enclosure walls, <b>cable</b> <b>glands,</b> self-sealing grommets or cable entry plates {{can be used}} to seal the cut-outs required for passing the cables through. This protects the inside of an enclosure or machine from dirt, dust or liquids.Cable glands and self-sealing grommets are usually designed for entering single or just a few cables. By utilising a cable entry plate, many cables with different diameters can be routed. Depending on the type, very high packing densities or ingress protection classes up to IP 67/68 (according to IEC 60529) can be achieved.|$|R
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> (connectors/fittings).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays typical motor {{junction}} boxes do not incorporate <b>cable</b> <b>glands,</b> which would provide good electrical performance interms of electromagnetic compatibility. In this paper, a manufacturability and assembly {{analysis for the}} new construction of a rigid body feeder cable junction of an electric motor is presented especially for converter drives (practical tests were carried out at LUT during 2007). Although the cable junction should also clamp the cable to provide enough tensile strength, the phase conductors should not get squashed by the groundingconnection. In order to ensure good performance in an electrical mean especially in converter drives, the grounding of the cable should be connected 360 degrees around the cable. In this paper, following manufacturing technologies are discussed: traditional turning, precision and centrifugal casting, and rotation moulding. DFM(A) -aspects are presented in detail...|$|R
30|$|An MI- 150 {{fiber optic}} {{illuminator}} (Edmund Optics Inc., Barrington, NJ, USA) with a 150 -W EKE halogen light bulb produced a high intensity bundle of light (450 to 800 nm), covering our wavelength range {{of interest for}} fluorescence imaging. Light from the illuminator was guided to an excitation filter box ② using a 0.25 inch glass fiber bundle guide. In the filter box, the spectrum of the excitation light can be tailored to a particular dye using a 12.5 -mm diameter filter. After the filter, the light was split into two fiber bundles that enter the dark box next to the camera. The light from the fibers was reflected by two small mirrors above the bed to illuminate the mouse from two directions. Light leakage at the fiber bundle entrance points was prevented by applying <b>cable</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Clearpath Robotics Kingfisher M 200 robot is an {{unmanned}} {{water surface}} vehicle with payload autonomy capability. This {{allows users to}} develop autonomy control on an offboard computer until it is ready for use on the autonomous vehicle. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Battelle Autonomy Laboratory plans to utilize this feature in both teaching and research applications so that users can develop autonomous missions on off-board single-board computers and then easily integrate their missions with the vehicles when ready. Although the M 200 's payload bay includes a waterproof data connection port, there is no provided environmental protection for the payload computer itself. This paper documents the design and production of a waterproof payload computer module that allows for {{the operation of the}} single-board computer, data interface with the M 200 's on-board computer and for the attachment of additional USB components. The Raspberry Pi was selected as the most appropriate single-board computer and the Otterbox Drybox 3000 was selected as the most appropriate enclosure. Electrical circuitry was designed to allow for power to the computer, data communication with the M 200 and USB connections for additional components, and combination of <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> and panel-mounted connectors were used to allow these connections to be accessible from the outside of the enclosure while retaining a NEMA 4 waterproof enclosure rating. In order to create a robust and user-friendly module, a system of strain relief and component orientation was designed. Continuous testing and adapting of prototypes resulted in a compact, operational payload module that can easily be interfaced with the Kingfisher M 200 to provide payload autonomy as well as offer two additional USB ports for the connection of additional components. This design aims to be easily reproducible by other Kingfisher M 200 users, as well as adaptable to other payload autonomy applications. by Emily L. Dunne. Thesis: S.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{required}} to house electrical apparatus in pressure vessels capable of with-standing considerable pressure, either external or internal, {{and to make}} connection with such apparatus. For this purpose, electrical cables containing one or more insulated conductors must be passed through {{the walls of the}} vessel. This paper deals with glands forming the entry of such cables into the vessel. I t states the fundamental requirements of <b>cable</b> entry <b>glands</b> and gives a summary of the principles of construction employed. Experimental work is described which {{led to the development of}} two designs of gland. The first of these was developed specifically for the entry of submarine telecommunication cables into submerged repeaters containing electronic amplifying equipment, in particular the submerged repeaters used on the British section of the first transatlantic telephone cable system. Both manufacture and testing of these glands are reviewed. The second design dealt with is a simplification of the first, based on the experience gained. Some special operating conditions encountered are mentioned and the means of meeting the resulting additional requirements are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} practices {{are listed in}} the manufacturers' instruction books. In general, equipment that requires frequent and extensive preventive maintenance is generally the most costly. The manpower spent on these frequent trips to remote areas is such that it is usually better to invest in a more costly system which requires little preventive maintenance. The best preventive maintenance for the system is a good installation. 7. 2 Preventive Maintenance and Inspections With any system, periodic inspection is required because of the corrosive atmosphere and adverse conditions that exist in underground mines. These inspections can spot potential trouble in the system. Repair or replacement at that time averts the possibility of losing effectiveness of {{all or part of the}} system. 7. 2. 1 Cables Approximately once per month all cables in the communications system should be inspected for kinking, chafing, cracking, wear, stretching, or other signs of physical abuse. Particular attention should be paid to <b>cable</b> <b>glands</b> at the entry or exit points to the various units in the system, where the cable goes around sharp corners, in the vicinity of holding cleats which may be clamping the cable too tightly causing potential damage, and across the areas where the cable is exposed to physical damage from outside sources, such as equipment or falling objects. If a cable is damaged, it should be replaced as soon as possible. It is mandatory that the ground leads and connections to carrier current phones be thoroughly inspected and maintained in good condition, since considerable hazard may exist to the operator or equipment if a ground connection is broken. 7. 2. 2 Pager Phones The most readily available test set to determine if a pager telephone is operating correctly is the pager phone itself. The following physical check of the system can be performed at any phone station. 7. 2. 2 a Listen Circuit Remove the handset from its cradle and listen to determine if the circuit is functional, as indicated by the presence of noise or conversation on the line. If no noise or voice signals are present at the handset receiver, take the following corrective action: 1. Operate the handset press-to-talk switch several times. Any corrosion on the contacts of this switch may cause a receiver to be temporarily inoperative. Repeated operation may clear the condition. 2. Open the cabinet and see if the battery cables are properly connected and are making firm contact. Check the handset cable and its connections in the cabinet of the pager phone, and see if there is any evidence of a break in the cable, corroded contacts, or poor connections. 3. Remove the handset receiver earpiece by unscrewing it counterclockwise (to the left), and remove the receiver from the socket. Examine the handset cavity; in some units, a patch of cotton batting or floss is used as a barrier to reduce acoustic feedback in the handset. If the cotton patch has absorbed moisture, remove it and replace with a crumpled ball of soft rubber, stuffed just far enough into the handset so it will not touch the receiver or switch terminals. 7. 2. 2 b Page Circuit and Talk Circuit Push the page switch, squeeze the handset press-to-talk switch, and call any other phone.

50|$|Beginning on the mid-morning of 11 October, Albacore was depth charged {{numerous}} times. At 1548, the conning officer finally {{spotted the}} Japanese attackers, two submarine chasers and an airplane. A third ship equipped with sound gear {{joined the group}} and continued the hunt. The ships crisscrossed over Albacore, close enough for propeller noise to reverberate throughout her hull and compelled her to proceed at silent running, with her ventilator fans shut down. After a chase of nearly seven hours, the Japanese ships disappeared astern, and Albacore then surfaced to clear the immediate area. The next day, Albacore headed for Midway Island. Although she had had several opportunities to score during the patrol, Albacore was not credited with any damage to Japanese shipping. The submarine arrived at Midway Island on 20 October and commenced a refit.With her refurbishing completed and a new Oerlikon 20 mm cannon installed, Albacore sailed on 11 November for her second patrol. Her assigned areas were the St. George's Channel, New Britain, along {{the east coast of}} New Guinea to Vitiaz Strait, and the Dallman Pass off Madang harbor. On 24 November, the submarine spotted a convoy of two cargo vessels. Albacore maneuvered into position and fired two stern tubes, but neither torpedo found its target. Two days later, on 26 November, Albacore herself became the quarry. Two Japanese destroyers depth charged her and the explosions caused numerous small leaks around the <b>cable</b> packing <b>glands</b> in the pressure hull. After a two-hour chase, the Japanese retired, and Albacore shifted her patrol area to Vitiaz Strait. Another golden opportunity arose on 13 December, when Albacore found three Japanese destroyers. She released a three-torpedo spread but again was unsuccessful. On 18 December, Albacore was stationed off Madang. The submarine discovered {{what seemed to be a}} transport and a destroyer.|$|R
