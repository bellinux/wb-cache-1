50|$|Orviston {{is known}} as the last town {{accessible}} by the Monument/Orviston road - a 10.8-mile paved county road stemming from Beech Creek, Pennsylvania, and ending at the entrance to Orviston. Traffic can flow through Orviston, however, West on the Orviston-Kato road, South on the Orviston Mountain road to Romola and Marsh Creek, and North on the Dehass road to PA 144 N and E of Clarence. All are unpaved mountain roads. Formed prior to the mining boom, Orviston was so named in 1904 as replacement for its original name, Hayes Run, Pennsylvania, in honor of Judge Ellis Orvis, owner of the Orviston Fire Brick Company and President Judge of the 49th Judicial District of Pennsylvania. Judge Orvis owned a number of brick plants including the <b>Centre</b> <b>Brick</b> and Clay Company at the Western end of Orviston as well as the Snow Shoe Fire Brick Company in Snow Shoe, PA among others. The now defunct Beech Creek Railroad - charted August 12, 1882 under the name Susquehanna and Southwestern Railroad which was absorbed by the New York Central Railroad which later became the Penn Central - ran through Orviston and its sister town, Monument, Pennsylvania, until the early 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known use of {{the place}} name 'Child's Hill' is in 1593. (Today, the apostrophe in the name is optional.) In the 18th century, Childs Hill was a <b>centre</b> for <b>brick</b> and tile making, supplying material for building Hampstead. The Castle Inn dates from this period: the first record of it is in 1751.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has {{an elaborate}} exposed roof structure consisting of small arched trusses springing from sandstone impost blocks, which are <b>centred</b> on <b>brick</b> piers {{at the corners}} of the octagons. The trusses meet at a midpoint below the roof pinnacle; the remainder of the roof is supported with struts springing from a central half-post. It has a timber boarded ceiling with exposed rafters, and the dormers are expressed in the ceiling.|$|R

50|$|Etawah {{was known}} for its {{handloom}} products; {{most of them are}} converted into powerlooms thanks to the advent of better technology. 'Etawah' is derived from the burner of bricks (where bricks are made); it has thousands of <b>brick</b> <b>centre</b> between its boundaries.|$|R
50|$|From {{at least}} the 17th century, Dunton Green was a <b>centre</b> for making <b>bricks</b> and tiles. In 1862 the Dunton Green Brick, Tile and Pottery Works was established: a large concern with clayholes or pits, kilns and an engine house. Whilst digging for clay many fossils were discovered.|$|R
50|$|Family {{residential}} {{houses were}} built with gardens {{in front of}} them, and there were avant-corps and arcades on them. These were built with reinforced concrete, with a main wall at the <b>centre</b> from <b>brick.</b> There were numerous designer, for example József Malomsoky, Zoltán Czellecz, Ádám Solta, Ildikó Császár, Kálmán Mészáros, József Tiefenbeck, Tamás Szubi, Gábor Rombauer. József Malomsoky gained the rights to plan the Western part of Dunaújváros {{with one of his}} plains from 1956. There were built two schools, one with 16, and another one with 20 rooms.|$|R
50|$|In 1885 Kellys {{reported}} two Wesleyan chapels, one {{built in}} 1804. The chapel built in 1839 is Grade II* listed. It recorded that Friskney parish was a <b>centre</b> for <b>brick</b> making, and the catching of shrimps and cockles. In {{the early part}} of the 19th century, much of the land was wetlands or swamp, where wild fowl were caught by use of decoy ponds. One of these ponds is now a listed ancient monument. The swamp was drained in the early 19th century and the land converted for arable cultivation.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{residence}} {{dates from}} the 17th century and was enlarged in the 19th {{with the addition of}} a neo-gothic staircase tower.

The roof is crowned with metal spikes.|$|R
50|$|Brick Gothic is characterised by {{the lack}} of figural {{architectural}} sculpture, widespread in other styles of Gothic architecture; and by its creative subdivision and structuring of walls, using built ornaments and the colour contrast between red bricks, glazed bricks and white lime plaster. Many of the old town <b>centres</b> dominated by <b>Brick</b> Gothic, as well as some individual structures, have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.|$|R

[...] The Sutherland Library may move its main branch to the South Village shopping centre, instead of having a [...] "technology hub" [...] at the site. [...] Roadworks will be undertaken on the Princes Highway, Oak Road and Flora Street to improve traffic flow to ameliorate the expected impact of the South Village shopping centre on traffic in Kirrawee. [...] Over 1500 jobs {{are expected to be}} created by the South Village project, with hundreds of ongoing retail positions in the shopping centre.|$|R
5000|$|Located down {{slope and}} {{approximately}} 75-100m west-northwest {{of the cottage}} ruins is a scatter of metal, mostly scrap iron such as bolts, metal plating and sheeting, rail tracks and rail cut offs, and a crucible basket. This area has been tentatively interpreted as a [...] "workshop" [...] attached to the smelting operations. Material is spread across the slope for 50m, with a brick scatter to the south, metal artefacts concentrated in the <b>centre,</b> and a <b>brick</b> stockpile (local and firebricks) situated at the northern end. Fragments of stoneware were recorded immediately upslope from the [...] "workshop" [...] area.|$|R
50|$|A site in Alfred Street, Fortitude Valley {{containing}} two cottages {{was purchased}} from local merchant Thomas Charles Beirne for {{the sum of}} £850. The new site was in a central location close to the shopping area and to public transport with the Brunswick Street railway station directly adjacent. At that time a cottage near the corner of Alfred Street was refurbished for use as the clinic, while the second cottage was sold for removal enabling {{the construction of the}} new purpose-built clinic and nurse training <b>centre.</b> The <b>brick</b> building of two-storeys and basement was commenced in 1923, and was nearing completion in October when it was discovered that the Brisbane City Council intended to sewer the area, delaying it being finished while the drainage was altered. The Department of Public Works reported on 4 January 1924 that the building was completed, pending the connection to the sewerage. Matron Chatfield moved in on 15 January, although the opening of the new clinic was delayed until October 1924 waiting for drainage approvals. The building cost £5,000.|$|R
5000|$|From 1882, {{a wave of}} Jewish {{immigrants}} fleeing persecution {{in eastern}} Europe settled in the area. The chapels, which had previously served the Huguenot community, were adapted as synagogues. Many Jewish relief societies were founded to aid the poor. Jewish immigrants entered the local garment industry and maintained {{the traditions of the}} market. The severe damage inflicted throughout the East End during the Blitz and later bombing in World War II served to disperse the Jewish communities to new areas. The area around Middlesex Street suffered a decline. The market continued to prosper. Beginning in the 1970s, a new wave of immigration from India and east Asia restored the area's vitality - <b>centred</b> on nearby <b>Brick</b> Lane.|$|R
50|$|The parish {{church of}} St Michael (St Mary in earlier records) {{dates to the}} twelfth century and is grade II* listed. Toseland Hall is a seventeenth century grade II* listed manor house {{to the west of}} the village <b>centre,</b> built from <b>brick</b> with a tiled roof. The Manor is two stories high and {{contains}} attics and the moulded bricks are constructed with a geometric pattern. It was built by Nicholas Luke around 1600 who was at the time was also the lord of the manor and has been owned by various prominent figures such as Dean of Ely Cathedral in 1624. During the 1881 census the property was occupied by Alfred Maine who was a farmer that owned more than 350 acres of land and since then has been used for agricultural purposes such as cultivating land.|$|R
5|$|In 1038, Kraków {{became the}} seat of the Polish government. By the end of the 10th century, the city was a leading <b>centre</b> of trade. <b>Brick</b> {{buildings}} were constructed, including the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, Romanesque churches such as St. Adalbert's, a cathedral, and a basilica. The city was almost entirely destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241. It was rebuilt practically identical, based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław, introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for tax benefits and new trade privileges for the citizens. In 1259, the city was again ravaged by the Mongols. A third attack in 1287 was repelled {{thanks in part to the}} new built fortifications. In 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (Kazimierz in Polish) declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him, Kazimierz (Casimiria in Latin). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka.|$|R
40|$|A new {{finding of}} the {{observation}} of an elemental gradient or zoning of calcium and sulphur in fired brick bodies is described, that {{does not appear to}} have been reported in the literature before. Many raw clays used in brickmaking and pottery contain sulphur and calcium evenly distributed in low amounts in the unfired clay body. However, when the clay body is fired in the kiln at 1050 °C, the elements sulphur and calcium appear to combine to a compound, most probably calcium sulphate. The formation of calcium sulphate, visualised using energy dispersive imaging micro X-ray fluorescence (?-XRF), only occurs around a so-called reduction core, also known as ‘black core’, caused by reduced magnetite Fe 3 O 4 in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>brick</b> body. The presence of a black reduction core appears to cause the formation of a calcium sulphate layer around the black reduction core. This research contributes to the understanding of phenomena like salt formation, efflorescence and durability in solid clay brick bodies. Large sums are spent on building conservation by national economies and improvement of bricks is of key interest to them. <br/...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{introduced}} for detecting changes from point clouds that avoids registration. For many applications, changes are detected between two scans {{of the same}} scene obtained at different times. Traditionally, these scans are aligned to a common coordinate system having the disadvantage that this registration step introduces additional errors. In addition, registration requires stable targets or features. To avoid these issues, we propose a change detection method based on so-called baselines. Baselines connect feature points within one scan. To analyze changes, baselines connecting corresponding points in two scans are compared. As feature points either targets or virtual points corresponding to some reconstructable feature in the scene are used. The new method is implemented on two scans sampling a masonry laboratory building before and after seismic testing, that resulted in damages {{in the order of}} several centimeters. The <b>centres</b> of the <b>bricks</b> of the laboratory building are automatically extracted to serve as virtual points. Baselines connecting virtual points and/or target points are extracted and compared with respect to a suitable structural coordinate system. Changes detected from the baseline analysis are compared to a traditional cloud to cloud change analysis demonstrating the potential of the new method for structural analysis. </p...|$|R
50|$|Dunwich Cemetery overlooks Moreton Bay and is bounded to {{the west}} by a camping area. It is {{otherwise}} circled by Flinders Avenue, Bingle Road, East Coast Road and Yabby Street: a section on the north west faces a jetty. The reserve comprises an open grassed area scattered with mature trees and extends over 3.295 hectares. The cemetery is thought to contain approximately 10,000 burials, largely those of inmates of the Benevolent Asylum, though {{most of these are}} unmarked.The cemetery reserve is entered from Flinders Avenue on the south through a gateway at the <b>centre</b> of a <b>brick</b> columbarium. In the north western corner are a cluster of memorials including those of the 26 passengers from the Emigrant, which are identified only by metal trefoil markers and a modern metal sign bearing all their names. Nearby are the graves of Dr David Ballow and Dr George Mitchell who attended them. The memorial over the Ballow grave {{is in the form of}} a sarcophagus and that over the Mitchell burial a stone obelisk; metal railings enclose both. There is also a memorial to Dr Patrick Smith, the first Medical Superintendent of the Benevolent Institution from 1885 to 1900 and sundry other memorials.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a new horizontal retort (Steriflow Standard 1 -Basket Model, Barriquand, Paris, France) was evaluated {{on the basis of}} temperature, heat and lethality distribution. Time-temperature data for these studies were obtained from bare thermocouples (type T), and rectangular bricks fabricated from Teflon$ sp{ rm TM}$ and Lexan$ sp{ rm TM}$ with thermocouples positioned at their geometrical centres. The effect of entrapped air on processing parameters for bricks packaged in retort pouches was determined using silicone rubber bricks (10 x 14. 5 x 2 cm), containing 5 thermocouples with their junctions positioned from the geometrical centre to near the top surface. The processing media employed were steam/air at two temperatures (121. 1 $ sp circ$C and 115. 6 $ sp circ$C) and two levels of superimposed air over-pressure, corresponding to 65 % and 75 % steam content. With the exception of the highest level of over-pressure (116 kPa), 60 ml of entrapped air caused the heating rate index (f$ sb{ rm h}$) to double. At low levels of air over-pressures, the slowest heating region (often assumed to be the geometrical <b>centre)</b> in the <b>brick</b> was shifted to a height equivalent to 3 / 4 of the brick thickness from the centre when the entrapped air volume was 60 ml. For similar conditions, the location receiving the least combined lethality during heating and cooling was near the top surface of the brick...|$|R
