40|$|Bibliography : pages 48 - 50. The study {{attempted}} {{an exploration}} of the relation between aspects of autonomy and cognitive development, at the concrete operational stage. This was intended as a contribution to extending Piagetian theory in order to encompass an understanding of variations in cognitive development. Thirty Sub A boys and girls were individually tested on a modified Piagetian Inventory, and a modified sentence completion test of autonomy. The Vineland Scale was administered to their parents, and teachers completed a teacher rating scale of autonomy, developed for this study. Through regression analyses, it was found, in line with previous research, that autonomy was situationally specific. Linkages between some aspects of autonomy and specific areas of <b>concrete</b> operational <b>thinking</b> were also evident. A number of preliminary interpretations were offered for the findings. It was concluded that the linkage between aspects of autonomy and areas of <b>concrete</b> operational <b>thinking</b> could be understood within a Piagetian framework, with implications for a revision of Piagetian theory...|$|R

5000|$|Dubowitz {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation and a characteristic facial appearance (small, round, triangular shaped with a pointed, receding chin, a broad, wide-tipped nose, and wide-set eyes with drooping eyelids). Symptoms vary among patients, but other characteristics include a soft, high pitched voice; partial webbing of fingers and toes; palate deformations; genital abnormalities; eczema; hyperactivity; preference for <b>concrete</b> <b>thinking</b> over abstract; language difficulties and aversion to crowds. The pathogenesis of the disease {{is yet to be}} identified and no medical tests can definitively diagnose the disease. [...] The main method of diagnosis is through identification of facial phenotype.

50|$|Gentile posited then, that {{knowledge}} as thought fixed against a fuller range of thinking limits thinking's every proposition. If truth is what surpasses {{the conditions of}} every proposition, taking a known postulate as truth removes its criteria from having that capability in thinking. Objectifying actuality. Truth then cannot be known by thought, since knowledge held as thought is privative toward thinking as decided by what's thought. Only thinking as it penetrates, not given in to what categories of thought orient it, can be truth, {{so long as it}} does not resort to thought in doing so which would objectify it. Such thinking is truth because it therefore defines reality as by that thinking, rather than excluding truth from the possibility of thinking because of its relation to yielding thoughts. Only because thinking's results, namely thoughts, do not pertain to what is arising from its act, the truth, does thinking itself become questioned as a proper conductor of truth. That however does not detract from the nature of truths being defined within the act as the <b>concrete.</b> <b>Thinking,</b> being the condition in which truths are measured, in fact affirms thinking's own condition as truth, and when coupled with the idea that it generates thoughts which negate it, must the concrete be identified with thinking rather than simply being denied to thought, seen as abstract, and having that together assumed with thinking as denied also. For thinking cannot therefore be solely a producer of thoughts alone to Gentile, as is the position taken by materialists, because thoughts are to him what negate it, but must also be what produces the stable environment wherein being happens. Which then is the direct result of oneself as the further quality in which reality is not negated, as it is by thoughts to themselves.|$|E

40|$|Carl Schmitt’s {{conceptual}} {{history of}} war is routinely invoked to comprehend the contemporary mutations in the concept and practice of war. This literature has passively relied on Schmitt’s interpretation of the nomos of the Ius Publicum Europaeum, which traced the transition from early modern ‘non-discriminatory war’ to the US–American promotion of discriminatory warfare as a new category in liberal international law. This chapter provides a critical reconstruction of Schmitt’s antiliberal narrative of war and argues that his polemical mode of concept formation led to a defective and, ultimately, ideological counterhistory of absolutist warfare, designed to denigrate liberalism’s wars as total while remaining silent on Nazi Germany’s de facto total wars. The historical critique is supplemented by an interrogation of his theoretical presuppositions: decisionism, {{the concept of the}} political, and <b>concrete</b> order <b>thinking.</b> It shows that Schmitt’s history of warfare is not only empirically defective but also theoretically unsecured by a succession of arbitrarily deployed and hyperabstract theoretical registers. At the center of Schmitt’s work yawns a huge lacuna: the absence of social relations as a category of analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{takes the}} view that second-order {{thinking}} or metacognition {{is important for the}} development of critical thinking and self-reliant learning. It describes both preliminary findings and methodological problems encountered in a project designed to follow the development of metacognitive abilities in five and six year olds. It hypothesizes that metacognition is not solely age developed, but that social environment; pedagogical practice; the nature of the cognitive problem posed and the individual’s affective state at a given time impact upon the development of metacognition in the individual child.

50|$|Most studies {{indicate}} that conservation occurs in a similar stages across cultures, but that {{there are differences in}} the rate at which conservation (and other cognitive abilities are acquired) across cultures. For example one study examining U.S. and Zambian female adolescents found no difference in between their ability to correctly answer conservation of weight tasks. Another study looked at children from many countries (Australia, Netherlands, England, New Zealand, Poland, and Uganda) and tested for the ages at which conservation appears. They found that the rate at which children acquired conservation varied slightly in different countries, but that the age trends for when conservation develops are similar across borders despite cultural upbringing. A review of cross-cultural studies looking at Piagetian tasks supported this finding, and found that while the general stages of cognitive development outlined by Piaget do occur across cultures, the rate of development is not consistent across cultures and sometimes the final stage of <b>concrete</b> operational <b>thinking</b> is not reached by all cultures due to environmental factors.|$|R

The dissertation introduces a new coding procedure for thought listings to measure the concrete or abstract construal level of media users. Results show that individuals in a positive mood (vs. a negative mood) and from a collectivistic cultural background (vs. individualistic) show more positive attitudes, report stronger intentions to act and judge blood donation to be more relevant, partially because the participants showed a more abstract construal of the blood donation message.

40|$|The {{severity}} of many psychological disorders {{is associated with}} an increasing amount of different stimuli or situations that elicit a maladaptive response. This {{is known as the}} process of (over) -generalization and is often characteristic of individuals with emotional disorders. Recently, abstract repetitive thought has been proposed to be a transdiagnostic marker in several disorders (e. g., worry in anxiety; rumination in depression). The present study examined the impact of an abstract thinking style (compared to a more <b>concrete</b> <b>thinking</b> style) as a mechanism that contributes to generalization. Students (N= 83) were trained in either an abstract or <b>concrete</b> <b>thinking</b> mode and then completed a learning phase and finally a generalization test phase.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Michel Foucault’s {{concepts}} of authorship and power. Jacques Derrida has often {{been accused of being}} more of a literary author than a philosopher or political theorist. Richard Rorty complains that Derrida’s views on politics are not pragmatic enough; he sees Derrida’s later work, including his political work, more as a “private self-fashioning” than <b>concrete</b> political <b>thinking</b> aimed at devising short-term solutions to problems here and now. Employing Foucault’s work around authorship and the origins of power, I show that Derrida is indeed fashioning himself. This self-fashioning is not merely private or fanciful. Rather, I argue that Derrida can be read as employing what Foucault would call “technologies of the self” to not only show the play of possibility and impossibility at work in all politics and thought, but also to use his savoir to create two important and potentially constructive power structures. First, there is the power of deconstruction itself as a “militant critique” that calls for a forceful and irreducible justice. Second, there is the power of Derrida himself, understood as leaving behind a legacy of himself as the “originator” of deconstruction and as a public intellectual...|$|R
