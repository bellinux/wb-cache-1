5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know?

25|$|Only {{a handful}} of people claimed to have {{successfully}} contacted Jandek before he began regularly playing in public in 2004 (see below). He releases albums through his own record label Corwood Industries, keeping a Houston post office box so fans <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> Corwood for a typewritten catalogue and order Jandek’s albums, usually at low prices. Many of his albums feature photos of a caucasian man at various ages; although it seemed likely that this man was the principal performer, this presumption was not certain until his live debut in 2004.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{development}} {{for the use of}} a USB Flash Drive as an application carrier is to carry the Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE) application developed by Microsoft. COFEE is a set of applications designed to search for and extract digital evidence on computers confiscated from suspects. Forensic software is required not to alter, in any way, the information stored on the computer being examined. Other forensic suites run from CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, but cannot store data on the media they are run from (although they <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> other attached devices, such as external drives or memory sticks).|$|E

2500|$|It is also {{somewhat}} slow {{to remove}} the page table entries of a process. [...] The OS may avoid reusing segment values to delay facing this, or it may elect to suffer the waste of memory associated with per-process hash tables. [...] G1 chips do not search for page table entries, but they do generate the hash, {{with the expectation that}} an OS will search the standard hash table via software. [...] The OS <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> the TLB. [...] G2, G3, and early G4 chips use hardware to search the hash table. [...] The latest chips allow the OS to choose either method. [...] On chips that make this optional or do not support it at all, the OS may choose to use a tree-based page table exclusively.|$|E
