It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E

Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E

Cotto entered the fight as The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division and #6 in their pound-for-pound rankings. Margarito entered the match as The Ring magazine's #4 ranked welterweight. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 29 June, {{the rebels}} {{attacked}} the Ustaše {{in a village}} on the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje to assist. From Mostar, a company of the 21st Battalion was despatched to relieve the Ustaše, who had managed to hold off the rebels. The Home Guard company then took over the post from the Ustaše. The same day, two new battalions arrived in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from Osijek and the 15th Battalion from Travnik. These reinforcements arrived just as Prpić received confirmation that Avtovac had been captured by the rebels. The remaining small garrison in Gacko, consisting of only 20 gendarmes and 30 Ustaše, were holding out but expecting more attacks by the rebels. In the morning, the attack by elements of the 10th Battalion stalled until the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Julije Reš, personally took command of the operation, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Italians. The promised Italian intervention commenced about midday, and about 100 trucks of Italian soldiers arrived in Gacko about 17:00. As they had passed through Avtovac, the rebels had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east. About 18:00, the 10th Battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse. ZNDH aircraft from Mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and Plužine.|$|E

5|$|Further to the west, the 9th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division {{had been}} {{involved}} in heavy fighting in Buron, which was defended by 200 men from the 12th SS. With support from the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse), by noon Buron had been taken, although the Canadian assault companies suffered 60% casualties. South of Buron, a counter-attack by Panzer IV and Panther tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment was defeated by 17pdr SP Achilles self-propelled anti-tank guns and 17-pounder anti tank guns of the 245th Battery, 62nd Antitank Regiment. Thirteen German tanks were destroyed {{in one of the most}} successful antitank engagements of the campaign, for the loss of four tank destroyers and a further four damaged. Gruchy was captured with relatively less difficulty, with the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade encountering only mortar and artillery fire in their drive to Authie. The capture of Authie facilitated the 59th Infantry Division assault on St-Contest and that village fell too, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> an advance on Caen.

5|$|Because of the 1976 {{disturbances}} and {{the subsequent}} arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by Jacek Kuroń, Antoni Macierewicz, Jan Józef Lipski and Adam Michnik founded and operated the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotników; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role {{of the working class}} in resisting the abuses of the regime and the newly formed opposition increasingly became characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> other opposition formations, it engendered political pluralism. More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO), Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZW) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN). The periodical Robotnik ("The Worker") was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71, but was later developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of Solidarity. The KPN represented the minority at that time right-wing of the Polish opposition scene. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the Polish constitution, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-Helsinki Soviet Bloc human rights movements {{and for the most part}} had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.|$|E
5|$|After going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Pressey {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics {{to play in the}} 2013 Orlando Summer League. He was a known {{commodity}} to the Celtics. Pressey's AAU team had even practiced at the team facility in Waltham. His performance in the Summer League led to Pressey signing a deal with the Celtics on July 22, 2013. The contract was believed to be a three-year deal for the league minimum, which was $490,180 during his rookie season. The Celtics began the season without four-time All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo who had endured a anterior cruciate ligament injury during the prior season. Pressey made his regular season debut in the 2013–14 Celtics season opener on October 30 at the Air Canada Centre against the Toronto. He did not play in the next three games, but after the Celtics got off to an 04 start, head coach Brad Stevens shuffled the lineup. On November 6, at home against the Utah Jazz, Pressey recorded the first three assists, first steal and first field goal of his career. Then on November 9, he posted four assists and tallied in 7 points in 21 minutes of play. He posted a team-high 5 assists on November 19, 2013 against the Houston Rockets. He established a new career high with 8 assists on November 25 against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 15, with Rondo's return imminent, the Celtics traded guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks, <b>clearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Pressey to start that night against the Toronto Raptors. Pressey posted 10 assists and no turnovers in his first start. On January 22, with Rondo, Avery Bradley and Jerryd Bayless all sitting out and Pressey making his second career start, Pressey scored a career-high 20 points against Washington before fouling out. Since Rondo's return, Pressey's occasional starts have been to give Rondo rest. He posted a double-double on April 5 against the Detroit Pistons with 12 points and a career-high 11 assists. On April 11, he had another career high with 13 assists as part of a 10-point double double against the Charlotte Bobcats. He matched the 13 assists the following night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|E
