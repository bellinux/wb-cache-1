5|$|Halo.Bungie.Org is {{the most}} widely read Halo fansite. In 2007, it {{received}} about 600,000 page views a day.

At a time when there was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films that fans submitted.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its growth {{has been associated with}} its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social <b>contests,</b> <b>and</b> there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again {{disagree}} on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E

5|$|Rush married Anne Aby (known as Annie) Fitzpatrick on 18 September 1865, at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. Annie Fitzpatrick, born 1846, was the {{daughter}} of Irish ex-convicts. She bore Rush fourteen children, three of whom died in infancy and two in early adulthood. None of Rush's children became professional sportsmen, though three of his sons competed successfully in various amateur sculling <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> one as a cyclist. His daughter Emily was a well-known amateur singer during her youth. Two Rush sons fought in the Boer War, another went gold-prospecting on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields, and died there. Rush retired around 1913, to a cottage and ten acres of land in Hurstville, New South Wales. He died there on 22 December 1922, after a brief illness. Rush is buried in Sydney's Waverley Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign {{a role model}} for future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display <b>contests,</b> <b>and</b> instant coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E

5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's {{instructions to}} refurbish the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the <b>contests</b> (<b>and</b> hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|Enix was a Japanese {{video game}} {{publishing}} company founded in September 1975 by Yasuhiro Fukushima. Initially a tabloid publisher named Eidansha Boshu Service Center, it was renamed to Enix in 1982, and shortly thereafter ventured into video game publishing for Japanese home computers {{such as the}} PC-8800 series, the X1 series, and the FM-7. Enix initially found games to release by holding contests for programming hobbyists and publishing the winners, with the first titles appearing in February 1983. Enix continued to hold <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> publish the winners through 1993. When Enix moved into traditional publishing for video game consoles in 1985, it began with ports of two of its more successful games, Door Door (1983) and The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983). From that point onward, Enix served as a publisher for both video games developed independently by other companies {{as well as for}} titles in franchises owned by Enix and created by licensed developers. Enix's flagship franchise was the Dragon Quest series of console games, developed primarily by Chunsoft; some of the games, such as Dragon Quest VII (2000), have sold millions of copies, and the series as a whole has sold over 68 million copies as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Volition {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to Volition removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding <b>contests,</b> <b>and</b> expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, Volition created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E

5|$|During the Predators' {{training}} camp in September 2005, Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre-season games. Recovering {{in time for the}} season-opener, he debuted with the Predators on October 5, 2005, at home against the San Jose Sharks. Early in the game, Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when he touched the puck. Trailing 2–1 in the third period, he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game, en route to a 3–2 win. The following game, Kariya participated in his first NHL shootout (the tie-breaker was newly implemented by the League for the 2005–06 season) after the Predators remained tied with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2–2 following overtime. The last of three shooters for the Predators, Kariya was the lone player to score in the shootout, leading Nashville to a 3–2 win. The two wins helped Nashville go undefeated in their first eight games, two wins shy of the League's record for consecutive victories to start a season. On April 18, 2006, {{the last day of the}} regular season, Kariya scored a hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings in a 6–3 win, helping the Predators secure the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In his first season with Nashville, Kariya set team records with 31 goals, 54 assists and 85 points. His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore's team record set in 2002–03, while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning's mark set in 1998–99. With five shootout goals over seven attempts, Kariya ranked fourth in the NHL in shootout scoring percentage at 71.4% (among players who had taken at least five attempts). On a team basis, the Predators set franchise records with 49 wins and 106 points, ranking fourth in the West. Matching up against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Kariya opened the post-season with four assists in Game 1 to lead Nashville to a 4–3 win. After taking Game 1, the Predators went on to lose the next four <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> were eliminated from the playoffs. The team was markedly weakened for the playoffs with starting goaltender Tomáš Vokoun unavailable due to injury and Kariya's linemate Steve Sullivan playing hurt. Kariya had two goals and seven points over the series.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season <b>contests</b> <b>and</b> were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
