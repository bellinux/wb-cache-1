40|$|In the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), a patient, {{after an}} {{overnight}} fast ingests {{a load of}} glucose. Then measurements of glucose concentration are taken every 30 minutes during two hours. The test is used to aid diagnosis of diabetes, namely, type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance. Several mathematical models have been introduced to describe the glucose-insulin system during an OGTT. Models consist on systems of differential equations where most parameters are unknown. Estimation of these parameters is an aim of this work. In a minimal model, two of such parameters are proposed for classification {{by means of a}} SVM technique. Consequently, a case is made for this <b>classification</b> <b>as</b> an <b>aid</b> for diagnosis. Comment: 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Satisfying non-trivial {{information}} needs involves collecting information from multiple resources, and synthesizing {{an answer that}} organizes that information. Traditional recall/precision-oriented information retrieval focuses on just one phase of that process: how to efficiently and effectively identify documents likely to be relevant to a specific, focused query. The TREC Interactive Track has as its goal the location of documents that pertain to different instances of a query topic, with no reward for duplicated coverage of topic instances. This task {{is similar to the}} task of organizing answer components into a complete answer. Clustering and classification are two mechanisms for organizing documents into groups. In this paper, we present an ongoing series of experiments that test the feasibility and effectiveness of using clustering and <b>classification</b> <b>as</b> an <b>aid</b> to instance retrieval and, ultimately, answer construction.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in {{information and communication}} technology have made ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things popular and practicable. These applications create enormous volumes of data, which are available for analysis and <b>classification</b> <b>as</b> an <b>aid</b> to decision-making. Among the classification methods used to deal with big data, feature selection has proven particularly effective. One common approach involves searching through {{a subset of the}} features that are the most relevant to the topic or represent the most accurate description of the dataset. Unfortunately, searching through this kind of subset is a combinatorial problem that can be very time consuming. Meaheuristic algorithms are commonly used to facilitate the selection of features. The artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) employs the intelligence underlying fish swarming behavior as a means to overcome optimization of combinatorial problems. AFSA has proven highly successful in a diversity of applications; however, there remain shortcomings, such as the likelihood of falling into a local optimum and a lack of multiplicity. This study proposes a modified AFSA (MAFSA) to improve feature selection and parameter optimization for support vector machine classifiers. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of MAFSA in classification accuracy using subsets with fewer features for given UCI datasets, compared to the original FASA...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} diatom taxa are {{currently}} being described each year and molecular data sets are providing phylogenetic evidence that challenges the traditional systematic arrangement of diatoms, but is such information being integrated into the classification? The traditional diatom <b>classification</b> originated <b>as</b> an <b>aid</b> to identification {{rather than as an}} arrangement expressing perceived relationships, and characters for identification continue to bias taxonomic descriptions. Reference to types for nomenclatural purposes has resulted in overly narrow taxon descriptions; i. e. types have been considered representative specimens (typical) of taxa, whereas they may not lie at the centre of the range of variation of a taxon. This paper discusses how taxonomic concepts are subject to change in the light of new data and that such changes should be reflected in the systematic arrangement. It presents some thoughts on character choice and the need to make appropriate comparisons before new taxa are erected. The importance of the suprageneric classification is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{the current}} imaging standard for confirming the diagnosis of a calca-neonavicular coalition. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate three-dimensional (3 D) multi-planar CT images of calcaneonavicular coalitions and adjacent tarsal relation-ships, compared to controls, in order to obtain an understanding of the 3 D anatomy for <b>classification</b> and <b>as</b> an <b>aid</b> to surgical resection. Methods All patients who underwent CT of bilateral feet at our institution to evaluate a suspected calcaneonavicular coalition between 9 / 2005 and 3 / 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-four feet (37 patients) were included in this analysis. In addition, 12 patients with a presumed normal calcaneonavicular relationship, who underwent CT of bilateral feet for various other diagnoses, were included as a control cohort. Seven measurements were performed on the 3 D reconstructions to quantify the shape of the coalition (dorsal and plantar widths of the calcaneal and navicular contributions, coalition depth of the calcaneal and navicular contributions, and coalition length). The coalitions were classified into four types based on their appearance and their relationship to adjacent tarsal bones. Results 32 / 37 patients (86 %) were noted to have bilateral involvement (69 coalitions). Coalitions were categorize...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this paper}} was to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of literature regarding the classification systems and surgical management of thoracolumbar spine trauma. METHODS: A Pubmed search of 2 ̆ 2 thoracolumbar 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 spine 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 fracture 2 ̆ 2 was used on January 05, 2013. Exclusionary criteria included non-Human studies, case reports, and non-clinical papers. RESULTS. One thousand five hundred twenty manuscripts were initially returned for the combined search string; 150 were carefully reviewed, and 48 manuscripts were included in the review. DISCUSSION: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has a high prevalence in North America. The thoracolumbar junction is a point of high kinetic energy transfer and often results in thoracolumbar fractures. New classification systems for thoracolumbar spine fractures are being developed in an attempt to standardize evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as well as reporting in the literature. Earlier <b>classifications</b> such <b>as</b> the Denis 2 ̆ 23 -column model 2 ̆ 2 emphasized anatomic divisions to guide surgical planning. More modern <b>classification</b> systems such <b>as</b> the Thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS) emphasize initial neurologic status and structural integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex as a guide for surgical decision making and have demonstrated a high intra- and interobserver reliability. Other systems such <b>as</b> the Load-Sharing <b>Classification</b> <b>aid</b> <b>as</b> a useful tool in planning the extent of instrumentation and fusion. CONCLUSION: There is still much controversy over the surgical management of various thoracolumbar fractures. Level I data exists supporting the nonsurgical management of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic compromise. However, for the majority of fracture types in this region, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish standards of care...|$|R
