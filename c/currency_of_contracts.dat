40|$|The {{research}} investigates academics’ {{perceptions of}} managerialist ideology {{and practice in}} universities, especially the growing expectations of the current prevailing ideology within the NHE context. The purpose of the research is threefold: first, it investigates academics’ perceptions of new managerialism and its practice {{in terms of their}} psychological contracts; second, it investigates values and practices associated with managerialist ideology and its effect on the ideological <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> academics’ psychological <b>contracts,</b> and third, it explores the state <b>of</b> academics’ psychological <b>contracts</b> in UK universities (especially in England) and how this differs from one type of university to another. The boundaries for the research include the four main university types that constitute HE in England (i. e. ancient, red brick, plate glass and post- 1992). The research uses a qualitative critical and extreme case of business academics, where the sample size consists of 32 academics. The data gathered from the interviews with academics from the four university types were first analysed thematically within each type, before the results of each were compared with the whole. The computing software package, MAXQDA is used for the data analysis. The research findings provide evidence that the NHE context in England is deeply marked by a growing managerialist style and the expectation of meeting certain goals. The data show that the proliferating culture of accountability, audit and performance characterising this NHE environment is currently impacting on academics’ working lives. The findings add to the debate against new managerialism, by demonstrating that it is perceived by many academics to be on the increase and affecting their psychological contracts. In addition, these findings also indicate that the contemporary policies and practices of new managerialism in England negatively impact upon academics’ perceptions {{of the extent to which}} the ideological <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> their psychological <b>contract</b> is fulfilled. The research provides insights by showing how practice differs across the university types being compared. The four main university types under study demonstrate both the similarities and differences of the impact of managerialism on the academic environment in England...|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} address {{the issues raised by}} the Commission's Green Paper. Thus study reaches the {{following}} conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. II/ 636 / 97 The legal implications of the European economic and monetary union (EMU) under the laws of New York State and other U. S. jurisdictions {{is one of the most}} important legal questions facing the international financial markets today. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that at the end of March 1995 the OTC derivatives market stood at $ 47. 5 trillion. Approximately half <b>of</b> all derivatives <b>contracts</b> worldwide are believed to be governed by New York law, including most U. S. swap contracts, up to half <b>of</b> the swap <b>contracts</b> in the London derivatives market and a significant proportion <b>of</b> swap <b>contracts</b> in other offshore financial centers (e. g., Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore). The Deutsche mark is the world's second most widely used currency after the U. S. dollar, and taken together the 15 <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> the European Union and the ECU basket currency form a powerful currency bloc. Aside from the derivatives market, eurobonds denominated in EU currencies are frequently issued by U. S. corporations in offshore transactions governed by New York law. As with derivatives <b>contracts,</b> many <b>of</b> these transactions involve long-term obligations. Finally, long-term loan agreements and cross-border commercial transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions also involve obligations denominated in EU currencies. In May 1995 the European Commission's Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single European Currency predicted that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the proposed single currency would be recognized as the successor to existing EU national currencies at the fixed conversion rates at which the single currency will substitute EU national currencies. The Commission's Green Paper thus concluded that under the laws of non-EU jurisdictions the continuity of monetary obligations and other terms <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> such as interest rates and other ancillary obligations could be expected. This study {{will address the}} issues raised by the Commission's Green Paper. Thus study reaches the following conclusions regarding the legal implications of EMU for transactions governed by the laws of U. S. jurisdictions, regardless of whether legislation ensuring the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is passed in particular American jurisdictions and regardless of whether such legislation applies prospectively or retroactively. All long-term debts denominated in EU currencies must be discharged in the new single European currency - the euro - at the official conversion rates at which the euro will substitute existing EU currencies. All foreign exchange transactions (e. g., FX forwards, cross currency swaps and currency options) in which an EU currency is used on one side of the transaction (e. g., a US$/DM swap) must be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. All foreign exchange transactions involving the exchange <b>of</b> two <b>currencies</b> participating in EMU (e. g., a DM/FFr swap) should also be discharged in the euro at the applicable conversion rates. In the case <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> involving periodic payments (i. e., a cross currency interest rate swap) the economic effect will be to impose an obligation on one party to make net payments for the remaining life <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> similar to an annuity. It may be necessary to explore the tax implications of this with the U. S. tax authorities. All fixed interest rate obligations (including fixed rate swaps) must be discharged at the rate specified in the contract. All floating interest rate obligations linked to particular EU national currencies should be discharged in accordance with the interest rates established by successor price sources for the euro in the event that existing price sources are no longer available after EMU. Force majeure clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge <b>of</b> EU <b>currency</b> debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> is no longer available due to circumstances beyond the party's control will not be triggered by EMU. Impossibility clauses used in debt transactions which call for the discharge <b>of</b> EU <b>currency</b> debts in U. S. dollars or some other currency in the event that the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency should not be triggered by EMU. All obligations denominated in the ECU basket currency should be discharged in the euro at the rate of one euro for one ECU, unless the terms <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and the surrounding circumstances establish a clear intention to the contrary. Substantially identical legislation confirming the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in accordance with the above principles has been proposed in the three leading U. S. trading jurisdictions â€” New York, Illinois and California. This legislation has been enacted into law in New York and Illinois. This study reaches the following conclusions with respect to this legislation. Notwithstanding certain possible discrepancies, the New York and Illinois legislation confirms the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the continuity regulations endorsed by the Council of the European Union. Any discrepancies between the EU Council regulations and the New York or Illinois legislation must be resolved by applying the applicable rules established under the EU Council regulations. Assuming that the New York and Illinois legislation applies retroactively, the legislation does not contravene the provisions of the United States Constitution prohibiting the states from enacting legislation that impairs the obligation <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> This is because state legislation confirming the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> after EMU in a manner that is broadly consistent with the EU Council regulations is declaratory of existing law and does not impair pre-existing contractual obligations in any manner. In any case, such legislation has been enacted to protect a broad societal interest (i. e., the avoidance of needless litigation after EMU), and would therefore be upheld by American courts in deference to the judgment of the state legislatures. Because the New York and Illinois legislation recognizes the continuity <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in a manner that is broadly consistent with the monetary sovereignty of the European Union over the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> EU member states, the legislation does not infringe the U. S. Federal Government's undisputed authority over international monetary relations. emu, economic and monetary union, usa, legal, new york...|$|R
40|$|Stability in {{exchange}} rates {{has been the}} objective of several international monetary agreements since the early twentieth century. Thus the par value <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> was determined {{in terms of a}} specified amount of gold, under the gold standard, whilst, the Bretton Woods agreement and the Smithsonian agreement defined the value <b>of</b> each <b>currency</b> in terms <b>of</b> the dollar, where the dollar was defined in terms of gold. Nevertheless, all these various systems have failed to eliminate the arguments between the proponents and the opponents of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes. Although the major industrial countries have adopted a relatively flexible exchange rate regime, most developing countries have held their currencies pegged to the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> a major industrial country, or a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies,</b> with the aim of meeting a particular macroeconomic criterion. The choice of pegs tends to be influenced by trade shares, however, adopted according to the objective function the domestic authorities aim to fulfil. The literature has defined several macroeconomic objectives of a peg but found no particular peg to be universally adopted by all developing countries. An examination <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> invoicing literature shows that, international trade involves incurring of risk by firms, exporters and importers. This risk is partly determined by the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> denomination <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> which firms are expected to seek means of minimizing. With respect to currencies used to invoice contracts, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it is the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the exporter which tends to be used to denominate trade contracts. However, on an ad hoc basis, certain commodities and raw materials were found to be invoiced in vehicle currencies, such as the dollar. Moreover, the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> invoicing is found to be influenced by many factors. In particular, inflation differentials were essential. Low inflation currencies are generally preferred by trading partners. A major issue of concern discussed in the literature is the potential effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the volume of international trade. The evidence on this has gone both ways. Some have argued that these fluctuations are of less concern because firms can use the forward market as means of reducing their impact. The analytical framework presented in the present thesis deals with an important issue for the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). These economies depend on oil revenues as the main source of income. Consequently, both government and private spending rely heavily on the oil sector. However, analyzing this invoicing policy without considering the behavior of the exchange rates between the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> these countries and those of their major trading partners, would be misleading. Thus, the present model adopts an integrative approach aimed at choosing a currency or a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> for invoicing oil, and determining how the choices of the same arrangements or alternative arrangements adopted for pegging the domestic currencies can affect the welfare function adopted for the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency(s)</b> for invoicing oil. This welfare function, as it is argued in the thesis, is based on stabilizing the real, rather than the nominal, value of oil revenues. The historical perspective has demonstrated close correlations between inflation rates, money growth rates and oil revenues in the GCC economies. Moreover, the dependence of these economies on oil revenues as the major source of income, has been argued to be the decisive factor that has resulted in their currencies being pegged to the dollar. The results from the estimation, however, do not support a peg to the dollar, nor invoicing oil in dollars. Nonetheless, other single currencies have failed to fulfill the optimality condition, thus favoring pegging to a trade-weighted basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies,</b> and an invoicing scheme for oil which is based on a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> Trade shares prove to be important, since deviations from purchasing power parity are passed via them. Despite the different levels of stability resulting from alternative combinations of peg and invoice choices, statistical evidence concludes that there are no significant differences amongst the resulting variances of the real value of oil revenues in terms <b>of</b> the domestic <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> the GCC member states. Accordingly, it may be argued that if the sole objective of the authorities in these countries is to stabilize the real value of oil revenues, any choice of the alternatives considered in the present thesis would yield the same result in terms of stability...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{international}} loans by commercial banks are denominated in the home <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the lending bank or a transaction currency like the US dollar. The focus of this dissertation is to provide an explanation for this empirical observation {{and to develop a}} model to determine whether or when an optimal currency choice may exist for the bank^ A model is developed to analyze the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> in <b>contracting</b> international loans by commercial banks, where given the size of the loan, the bank chooses the rate of interest and the proportion of the loan to be denominated in its home currency. The bank maximizes the home <b>currency</b> value <b>of</b> the loan subject to a profit condition and a no-default condition by the borrower. The analysis is carried out for conditions of certainty as well as uncertainty and distinction is made between borrowers which are sovereign countries and individual firms borrowing internationally. ^ A major result obtained is that no unique optimum currency denomination exists for the bank. If, however, the expectation of exchange rate movement is asymmetric, then a particular currency is preferred to another. Also in the presence of institutional ceilings on the interest rate and moral hazard problems, home <b>currency</b> denomination <b>of</b> the loan is optimal for the bank. If the bank is risk averse, home currency denomination is preferred. ^ In the case of an involuntary default caused by temporary shortfall of the earnings of the borrower, a lending rule is derived for the bank which indicates that relending to the borrower {{is in the interest of}} the bank if the new loan and the accumulated arrears on past loans do not exceed the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s penalty from a default. If the loan repayment exceeds the penalty amount, the excess debt, it is concluded, must be forgiven. ...|$|R

For each <b>contract,</b> standard models <b>of</b> the Unbiased Expectations Hypothesis (UEH) and Cost-of-Carry hypothesis (COC) are extended to derive volatility models corresponding {{to each of}} the two standard approaches. Each volatility model is formulated as a system of individual equations for the conditional variances of futures returns, spot returns and the domestic risk-free interest rate. The empirical results suggest that the conditional volatility of futures return for emerging markets is significant in explaining the conditional volatility of returns in the underlying spot market. For developed markets, however, the conditional volatility of the spot returns is significant in explaining the conditional volatility of futures returns. Moreover, it is found that the domestic risk-free interest rate has little impact on the conditional variances of the futures, spot and domestic risk-free interest rates. ...|$|R
