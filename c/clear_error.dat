5|$|Morris was rested for the {{following}} match against Leicestershire, so Barnes partnered Brown {{at the top of}} the order. The pair put on 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a leg before wicket (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a <b>clear</b> <b>error.</b> Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from spinners, and bowled four overs without success in the second innings. The Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and Barnes as Australia came closest to losing a match for the whole tour. The tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory—effectively seven wickets down with one injured player—before scraping home to win by four wickets.|$|E

500|$|In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a {{violation}} of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution occurs when prosecutors use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race. If a defendant alleges that a prosecutor challenged a prospective juror on the basis of that juror's race (a process known as a [...] "Batson challenge"), trial courts will conduct a three-part analysis of the peremptory challenge in question: [...] "irst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties’ submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination." [...] A court will only sustain a Batson challenge if all three elements of this test are satisfied. On appeal, a trial court's findings with respect to a Batson challenge will only be reversed if a trial court judge committed <b>clear</b> <b>error.</b> Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that findings with respect to a prosecutor's explanation of the reasons for their use of peremptory challenges is [...] "entitled to 'great deference'".|$|E

The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santería adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is {{necessary in order to}} achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense.

The Ninth Circuit denied the Anonymous Online Speakers petition and upheld the district court decision. It further instructed the district court to determine the scope and procedure for disclosing the identities of the anonymous speakers.|$|E

Patterns of student difficulty that emerge from close analysis of <b>clear</b> <b>errors</b> may guide instructor preparation and use of material that is supportive of student learning. A closer account of student difficulty with particular specialist styles may help institutions to respond more adequately to expanding student populations and to determine an appropriate balance between general and specific purpose language courses.|$|R
