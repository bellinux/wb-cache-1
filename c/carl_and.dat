She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. <b>Carl</b> <b>and</b> Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E

5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W.

The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, <b>Carl</b> <b>and</b> Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, <b>Carl</b> <b>and</b> Lenny do in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of <b>Carl</b> <b>and</b> Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and <b>Carl</b> <b>and</b> Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the great}} French naval superiority, the French had {{conducted}} insufficient pre-war planning for {{an assault on}} the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming.
