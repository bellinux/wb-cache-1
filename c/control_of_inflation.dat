2500|$|By {{the time}} Lamont was {{appointed}} Chancellor, the Conservative government's principal economic {{objective was to}} regain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> The Thatcher government had been elected in 1979 on a manifesto that had listed restoration of sound money as its first priority. [...] Having peaked at 21.9% in 1980, inflation (as measured by the 12-month increase in the Retail Prices Index) fell to 3.3% {{at the beginning of}} 1988. However controlling inflation through the targeting of the growth of the domestic money supply, as proposed in that manifesto, {{turned out to be more}} problematic than its authors had envisaged and during his time as Chancellor, Lawson had increasingly been drawn instead to targeting the exchange rate to provide an external monetary anchor. [...] From its low point in February 1988, inflation rose with apparent inexorability: of the 31 months until it peaked at 10.9% in October 1990, there were only four months when inflation fell. [...] In response, interest rates were progressively increased, doubling from 7.4% in June 1988 to 15% in October 1988, being cut by one point to 14% when the pound entered the ERM, the level of interest rates Lamont inherited as chancellor. [...] As a result, the economy began to slow, contracting by 1.1% in the third quarter of 1990 and shrinking a further 0.7% in the final quarter of the year. [...] Thus Lamont's period as Chancellor started with inflation at its highest level since 1982 and the economy in recession.|$|E

40|$|Unemployment in Britain {{has fallen}} from high European-style levels to US levels.

I interpret the reform of monetary policy as an institutional change that reduced inflationary expectations in the face of falling unemployment.

40|$|Rapid rise in {{the price}} of food grains and their {{continued}} upsurge is a matter of concern for not only the government and policy makers but also for all concerned with social welfare. This is particularly so because increased prices of basic food item cause great distress to the poor sections of the society who have to spend a large part of their income on food. Quite naturally, understanding the causes <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> is <b>of</b> high priority for framing the right policy to tackle the problem needs a clear understanding of the factors that led to the price rise. The current study tries to examine how prices get determined in Indian food grains market. This requires a slightly different approach from the conventional demand and supply framework as government intervenes in the market through open market operations. To this end, we propose a structural model, explaining the behavior of food grain prices in the India since 1980 - 81 through 2011 - 12 incorporating role of government interventions. Our results confirm that there is strong impact of demand as well as supply side factors.

50|$|Thatcherism is {{associated}} with the economic theory of monetarism. In contrast to previous government policy, monetarism placed a priority on controlling inflation over controlling unemployment. According to monetarist theory, inflation is the result of there being too much money in the economy. It was claimed that the government should seek to control the money supply to control inflation. However, by 1979 it was not only the Thatcherites who were arguing for stricter <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> The Labour Chancellor Denis Healey had already adopted some monetarist policies, such as reducing public spending and selling off the government's shares in BP.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal rate of monetary expansion when government resorts to inflationary finance to generate additional investment for enhancing growth. If there are lags in tax collection, {{an increase in}} inflation erodes real fiscal revenue, thereby worsening the current balance while reducing government investment. This impedes capital accumulation as well as increases the welfare cost <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> As such, the optimal rate of monetary expansion, equilibrium capital-labor ratio and output are lower while the marginal cost of inflationary finance is higher {{than they would be}} without collection lags.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{real-time}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> balloon <b>inflation</b> inside porcine arteries. In a first step, experiments {{were done in}} a coronary artery of an excised heart. In a second step, experiments were done in a beating heart setup providing conditions very close to in vivo conditions without the complications. A programmable syringe pump was used to inflate a compliant balloon in arteries, while intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) monitoring was performed. In a feedback loop, IVOCT images were processed to provide the balloon diameter values in real-time to control the pump action {{in order to achieve}} a target diameter. In different experiments, various flow rates and target diameters were used. In the excised heart experiment, there was good convergence to target diameters resulting in a satisfactory balloon inflation control. In the beating heart experiment, there were oscillations in the diameter values due to cyclic arterial contractions. In these experiments, the control system maintained diameter averages satisfactorily close to predetermined target values. Real-time <b>control</b> <b>of</b> balloon <b>inflation</b> could not only provide a safer outcome for angioplasty procedures but could also provide additional information for diagnostics since it implicitly provides information about the artery response to the inflation process.
