30|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> (CPs) are the {{chlorinated}} semivolatile {{organic compounds}} {{with the highest}} production volume (1 million tonne/year), and were main substitutes for PCBs in open applications [315]. In May 2017, short-chain <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> (SCCPs) were listed as POPs under the Stockholm Convention, {{with a range of}} exempted uses [109]. For medium-chain <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> (MCCPs), a recent review also documented similar persistence and accumulation challenges [284]. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> bioaccumulate in meat/fat [316, 317] and might pose a risk for the future safe production of food from animal origin, considering their large use volumes in open applications and bioaccumulation potential. High levels of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> (short-, medium- and long-chain <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins)</b> have been detected in wildlife in China, accounting for more than 95 % of all POPs detected in the biota [318, 319]. CPs in sewage sludge are in the mg/kg range [320, 321], and are currently transferred to agricultural soils via this pathway, accumulating and eventually contaminating food-producing animals and wildlife. SCCPs and MCCPs are also transferred from food contact materials such as baking ovens [322] or food blenders [323] to food and human intake.|$|R

The Sharpless Solvents Corporation commissioned the first industrial photochloration plant for the chlorination of pentane in 1929. The commercial production of chlorinated paraffins {{for use as}} high-pressure additives in lubricants began around 1930. Around 1935 the process was technically stable and commercially successful. However, {{it was only in}} the years after World War II that a greater build-up of photochloration capacity began. In 1950, the United States produced more than 800,000 tons of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> hydrocarbons. The major products were ethyl chloride, tetrachlorocarbon and dichloromethane. Because of concerns about health and environmentally relevant problems such as the ozone depletion behavior of light volatile chlorine compounds, the chemical industry developed alternative procedures that did not require chlorinated compounds. As a result of the following replacement of chlorinated by non-chlorinated products, worldwide production volumes have declined considerably over the years.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of polypropylene is accelerated {{when it is}} heated in mixtures with a fire retardant <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> (Cl 70 %) whose dehydrochlorination rate is simultaneously reduced. The mechanism proposed to account for this behaviour involves the attack of the chlorine atoms, which propagate the dehydrochlorination reaction, on the tertiary hydrogen atoms of polypropylene with formation of HCl. The kinetic chain length of the dehydrochlorination is decreased {{and the rate of}} evolution of HCl is lowered, while the radicals formed on the polypropylene chain lead to its scission and volatilisation.

This occurs at temperatures at which pure polypropylene is stable and leads to an increase in the overall rate of volatilisation of the mixtures compared with that of the separate components. A partial overlapping of volatilisation of polymer and additive, which otherwise degrade in two well separated temperature ranges when heated alone, is observed.

Moreover, data from scuffing resistance show SbDDP with T 321 exhibits good synergistic effect，but SbDDP with T 321 exhibits antagonistic effect.

50|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> {{have the}} general sum formula CxH(2x−y+2)Cly and are {{categorized}} into three groups: Low molecular weight <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> are short chain chloroparaffins (SCCP) with 10 to 13 carbon atoms, followed by medium chain chloroparaffins (MCCP) with carbon chain lengths of 14 to 17 carbon atoms and long chain <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffins</b> (LCCP), owing a carbon chainwith more than 17 carbon atoms. Approximately 70% of the chloroparaffins produced are MCCPs {{with a degree}} of chlorination from 45 to 52%. The remaining 30% are divided equally between SCCP and LCCP. Short chain chloroparaffins have high toxicity and easily accumulate in the environment. The European Union has classified SCCP as a category III carcinogen and restricted its use.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{maximize}} the biodegradation of the commercial <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> Cereclor S 52 using an axenic culture of Pseudomonas sp. 273. Tests of the adherence of growing cultures to hydrocarbon substrates showed differences between Cereclor S 52 and a readily degradable chlorinated alkane, 1, 10 -dichlorodecane (DCD). In the bioreactor, Cereclor S 52 was degraded by up to 73 % by means of multiple additions of DCD. This is indicative of an upper limit for the degradation of Cereclor S 52 in this system. The degradative enzymes in Pseudomonas sp. 273 {{did not appear to}} be induced by Cereclor itself, by yeast extract, or by hexadecane. The work suggests that DCD acted to induce degradative enzymes, as a cosubstrate, and as a solvent to improve the bioavailability of Cereclor S 52 in the bioreactor...|$|E

A micro-structure model of specimen surface layer under wet grinding conditions was proposed, which could be used for explaining the boundary lubrication mechanism of cutting fluids. The characteristic was revealed that organizational structure and shearing strength of specimen surface layer at wet grinding conditions descended along the out normal line direction of the specimen surface. Based on experimental research, high-performance oil-based cutting fluids were developed and tested in several machine-building factories.

40|$|The {{flame-retardant}} chemicals, which commercially find {{applications in}} rubbers, {{are considered to}} be toxic chemicals, because of the liberation of their harmful volatile by products, when rubbers are on fire.

As a result, the application of this chemical as a flame-retardant in rubbers and plastics is on the rise, at present particularly in the developed western countries. Thus in view of utilizing this chemical in local industries, as a flame retardant especially in the silica filler added rubber floor - tile compounds, an attempt has been made in this work, to evaluate the chemical for its fire retardant property in their vulcanizates.

40|$|Poly vinylidene {{chloride}}-vinyl chloride emulsions (PVDC) {{were added}} {{as a substitute}} for <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> (CP) in the preparation of ultra-low density fiberboards (ULDFs). The micromorphology and fire performance of ULDFs were investigated using a scanning electron microscope, limiting oxygen index instrument, and cone calorimeter. The results showed that PVDC specimens were coated with a regularly smooth film, while the distribution of CP inside CP specimens was uneven. The limiting oxygen index increased with the dosage of PVDC, then reached a plateau at 50 mL and 28 %, slightly higher than CP specimens (27. 3 %). The peak of heat release rate, mean heat release rate, mean CO, and total smoke release of PVDC specimens was reduced 43. 3 %, 13. 5 %, 38. 5 %, and 51. 5 % lower than respective CP specimens, and with nearly the same total heat release (only 0. 04 MJ/m 2 higher).

40|$|The {{synergistic}} effect of two fire retardants, a Si-Al compound and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin,</b> was tested on ultra-low density fiberboards (ULDFs). To further understand {{the mechanism of}} fire retardancy, morphologies of unburned and burned ULDFs were studied using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was found that as {{the volume of the}} burned ULDFs shrank, some crevices appeared. In addition, less fly ash formed on the top of specimens, and more bottom ashes remained in the original framework, with a clear network of structure built by the fibers. Carbon was almost absent in the fly ash; however, the weight ratio of C in the bottom ashes reached the maximum (> 43 %) of the composition. Oxygen, Al, and Si appeared to have varying weight ratios for different ashes. Oxygen content increased with increasing Si and Al contents. Furthermore, Cl sharply decreased to less than 1 % after combustion. Therefore, upon combustion, it was found that almost all of the substances in ULDFs, except for the Si-Al compound, were pyrolyzed to volatile carbon oxides and Cl compounds, especially the fly ash and lightweight C compounds.

40|$|Concems {{about the}} high {{production}} volumes, persistency, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>paraffin</b> (CP) mixtures, especially short-chain CPs (SCCPs), are rising. However, information on their levels and fate in the environment is still insufficient, impeding international classifications and regulations. This knowledge gap is mainly due to the difficulties that arise with CP analysis, in particular the chromatographic separation within CPs and between CPs and other compounds. No fully validated routine analytical method is available yet and only semi-quantitative analysis is possible, {{although the number of}} studies reporting new and improved methods have rapidly increased since 2010. Better cleanup procedures that remove interfering compounds, and new instrumental techniques, which distinguish between medium-chain CPs (MCCPs) and SCCPs, have been developed. While gas chromatography coupled to an electron capture negative ionisation mass spectrometry (GC/ECNI-MS) remains the most commonly applied technique, novel and promising use of high resolution time of flight MS (TOF-MS) has also been reported. We expect that recent developments in high resolution TOF-MS and Orbitrap technologies will further improve the detection of CPs, including long-chain CPs (LCCPs), and the group separation and quantification of CP homologues. Also, new CP quantification methods have emerged, including the use of mathematical algorithms, multiple linear regression and principal component analysis.
