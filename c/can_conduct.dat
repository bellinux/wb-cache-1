5|$|When ionic {{compounds}} dissolve, {{the individual}} ions dissociate and are solvated by the solvent and dispersed throughout the resulting solution. Because the ions are released into solution when dissolved, and <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> charge, soluble ionic compounds {{are the most}} common class of strong electrolytes, and their solutions have a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

25|$|Risk {{stratification}} is best performed via programmed {{electrical stimulation}} (PES) in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory.

If a tachycardia involving the accessory pathway can be triggered, the cardiologist can then assess how rapidly the accessory pathway is able to conduct. The faster it <b>can</b> <b>conduct,</b> the higher the likelihood the accessory pathway <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> fast enough to trigger a lethal tachycardia.|$|E

40|$|The line-start {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor without starter devices {{has a wide}} range of industrial applications, thus this paper presents a kind of line-start surface-mounted and interior {{permanent magnet}} synchronous motor (LSSIPMSM), which has a <b>canned</b> <b>conducting</b> layer which made of the copper between the surface-mounted PMs and rotor core. The LSSIPMSM performances were analyzed and the key parameters were optimized based on combinations of analytical method and finite element method. The dynamic, steady state performances of LSSIPMSM with PMs of different heights and <b>canned</b> <b>conducting</b> layers of different thicknesses were investigated. Finally, the optimal parameters were obtained. Electromagnetic finite element model of the LSSIPMSM was established to analyze the starting capability and steady state synchronization, and the temperature field of LSSIPMSM with different demagnetization conditions was researched by 3 -dimensional temperature finite element model. The results show that LSSIPMSM has good dynamic and steady state performances...|$|R
25|$|Graphite is an {{electric}} conductor, consequently, useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. It <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> electricity {{due to the}} vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within {{the plane of the}} layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones.|$|E

Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters, the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100 megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET <b>can</b> <b>conduct.</b> An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E

25|$|Lava {{tubes are}} formed when {{a flow of}} {{relatively}} fluid lava cools on the upper surface sufficiently to form a crust. Beneath this crust, which being made of rock is an excellent insulator, the lava can continue to flow as a liquid. When this flow occurs over a prolonged period of time the lava conduit can form a tunnel-like aperture or lava tube, which <b>can</b> <b>conduct</b> molten rock many kilometres from the vent without cooling appreciably. Often these lava tubes drain out once the supply of fresh lava has stopped, leaving a considerable length of open tunnel within the lava flow.|$|E
