5|$|In {{the style}} of a {{traditional}} musical, this episode follows a two-act structure – with the acts separated by a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> instead of an intermission. However, in {{the style of}} a traditional Scrubs episode, this is preceded by a cold open.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria was {{attacked}} and stripped {{of her clothes}} by Vince's Devils (Victoria, Torrie Wilson, and Candice Michelle), but she was saved by Ashley Massaro. During a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> that night, Vince McMahon announced a Gauntlet Bra & Panties Match for New Year's Revolution between all five girls. At the event, Maria {{was the first to}} enter the Gauntlet match and eliminated Michelle and Wilson before being eliminated by Victoria. The match was ultimately won by Massaro.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd in}} the stands, the {{opposing}} players and all four umpires gave Ripken a standing ovation lasting more than 22 minutes, {{one of the longest}} standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> during the entire ovation. During the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire Camden Yards warning track to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} number (0, 3, 6) and {{placement}} (natural, unnatural) of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on perception, comprehension and memory were examined. Eighty-eight college students were shown {{one of two}} films and then asked to complete six tasks: (1) estimation of film's duration, (2) rating of film's comprehensibility, (3) summarization of story plot and theme, (4) scene recognition, (5) temporal ordering of scenes, and (6) identifying the location of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Overall, results suggest that an unnatural placement of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> has an adverse effect on cognitive processing and that performance increasingly deteriorates with more <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Conversely, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appearing at natural breakpoints led to a higher overall performance that was less affected {{by the number of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> that occurred. An effect of film was also found, suggesting that a film with a more organized plot structure can integrate natural <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> more beneficially than a less-structured film...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> by a television network in both monopoly and duopoly settings. Viewers dislike commercials in the model, while the networks seek to maximize the total audience for these commercials through their choice of the number, length, and timing of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> The model’s prediction of a network’s optimal choice seems to match what we observe in reality; in particular, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appear more frequent {{toward the end of}} the program, and the optimal length of breaks is single-peaked. In duopoly equilibrium, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on two networks must have the same length and appear at the same time. Compared to monopoly, the breaks in a duopoly equilibrium are longer and/or appear later...|$|R
5|$|Traditionally {{the contest}} {{will consist of}} an opening {{ceremony}} in which the performers are welcomed to the event, the performances of the entries, a recap of the songs to help televoting viewers decide which entries to vote for, an interval act usually performed after the televoting has closed, {{the results of the}} televoting or back-up jury voting which is then followed by the declaration of the winner and a reprise of the winning song. At various points throughout the show, networks may opt out for a few minutes to screen a <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{played his}} {{first game of the}} season on February 15 against the Dallas Stars. The game was also witness to a piece of Canucks history as Henrik Sedin {{recorded}} two assists to pass Markus Naslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer, with 757 points. After recording the record setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes the play stopped, and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Naslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. As for Kesler, he registered an assist and blocked three shots in over 17 minutes of ice time of the 4–3 loss. After experiencing some discomfort in his right foot, Kesler had X-rays taken. The X-rays were negative and he continued to play.|$|E

5|$|Wii Sports {{has been}} {{featured}} on television multiple times. The game {{was featured in}} commercials for the Wii system, and in news features on ABC and NBC. The game has appeared on various comedy shows. An episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien featured host Conan O'Brien competing against his guest, tennis star Serena Williams, in a match of Wii Sports tennis. On an episode of the Rick Mercer Report, former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien beat Rick Mercer {{in a game of}} Wii Sports boxing. The boxing game also appeared on an episode of The Colbert Report where a clip featured Mii versions of Stephen Colbert and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi boxing. At the 80th Academy Awards Show, host Jon Stewart and Jamia Simone Nash were caught playing Wii Sports tennis on one of the event's gigantic projection screens after a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> as part of a joke. Wii Sports has also been featured in mainstream movies such as Tropic Thunder and in commercials for products such as Kellogg's Smart Start.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E

Terrestrial channels can take <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> during breaks in action during sporting events.|$|R
