5|$|Each {{state is}} divided into {{judicial}} districts presided over by a District and Sessions Judge. He {{is known as a}} District Judge when he presides over a civil case, and a Sessions Judge when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a High Court judge. Below him, there are <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> known by different names in different states.

2500|$|The {{court was}} created by the First Charter of Justice, issued by King George III in the form of letters patent dated 2 April 1787. The <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> as {{established}} by the Charter was composed of the Deputy Judge Advocate of New South Wales, who was commonly known in the colony as the “judge-advocate”, and two other persons appointed to the court by the Governor of New South Wales. The judge-advocate was the presiding officer. [...] The court had jurisdiction to hear and determine summarily actions relating to land, houses, debt, contract, trespass, and most other common law or equitable cases of any amount.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legal status}} of the court has been debated. Under English law at the time, the monarch could only {{establish}} common law courts in settled lands, which the English had considered the colony of New South Wales to be. However, equitable {{and other types of}} courts could not be established except by an Act of Parliament made by the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain. This position was recognised by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1832 in Harris v.

50|$|Macquarie {{recommended}} that the plan be adopted and suggested to the English authorities that Bent should be made the first judge of any such court created. Bent was passed over for the position, and instead it was offered to his brother Jeffrey Bent. The establishment of this latter court, the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature (commonly {{referred to as the}} Supreme Court) lessened the workload of Bent as the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> over which he presided was abolished {{as a result of the}} establishment of that Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Bassett {{was one of}} {{the delegates}} to the Constitutional Convention and, without {{supplying}} much input, signed the Constitution. Meanwhile, the Delaware Constitution of 1776 was in need of revision, and Bassett once again joined with another of Delaware's Founding Fathers, John Dickinson in leading the convention to draft a revision, which became the Delaware Constitution of 1792. Upon his retirement from the United States Senate in 1793, Bassett began a six-year term as the first Chief Justice <b>of</b> the Delaware <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas. At the time it was a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> general <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and the predecessor of the present Delaware Superior Court. By this time Bassett was formally a member of the Federalist Party, and as such was elected Governor of Delaware in 1799. It was during his time in office that Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours first came to Delaware to begin his gunpowder business.|$|R
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of the Judicial order, until 2014, Portugal was divided in 231 uneven comarcas, constituting the {{territorial}} areas of jurisdiction <b>of</b> the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> first instance. Depending on the size of its population, each comarca could have from a single <b>court</b> <b>of</b> general jurisdiction with just a single judge to a complex structure <b>of</b> diverse <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> special <b>jurisdiction</b> (<b>civil,</b> criminal, criminal procedure, labour, family, etc.), each of which, by itself, could include several specialized sections and judgeships. The comarcas were grouped in 57 judicial circles (círculos judiciais) and these in four judicial districts (distritos judiciais).|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the city}} limits, these courts have shared {{jurisdiction}} with the JP courts on Class C criminal misdemeanor cases, and have exclusive jurisdiction on cases involving city ordinances. Municipal courts have limited <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over public matters relating to public safety (e.g., dangerous dog determinations). Confusion surrounding a municipal court's <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is complicated {{that if a}} municipal court is a [...] "court of record," [...] the Legislature has authorized municipalities to adopt ordinances that give municipal courts concurrent jurisdiction over substandard building cases with county and/or district <b>courts.</b> The matter <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> has been further confused by the advent <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> penalties for conduct that can be prosecuted as a Class C misdemeanor (e.g. certain parking violations, red light camera violations).|$|R
50|$|Secondly, Bent {{came under}} the {{influence}} of his brother. Unfortunately, Bent's brother proved to be the opposite of Bent and was obstructive at every possible time. Whilst Bent had been initially progressive in allowing convict lawyers to appear in the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> to assist litigants as agents, he sided with his brother that they {{should not be allowed to}} appear in the newly created Supreme Court of Civil Judicature to which his brother had been appointed.

5000|$|The Court was a {{superior}} <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> and criminal <b>jurisdiction.</b> The jurisdiction <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> {{was defined by}} reference to the jurisdiction <b>of</b> the English <b>courts</b> which existed as of July 15, 1870, the date the North-West Territories became part <b>of</b> Canada.

5000|$|The {{punctuation}} in the document, as reproduced above, {{seemed to}} indicate a close connection of some kind between setting fee levels and professional conduct. But in the event the setting of fee levels was later abandoned, while, in respect of professional conduct, statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties were given to a body which would have persons who are not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority, and who would not be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> criminal or <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator, and would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation. This could have been seen as an objectionable aberration, but that instead a preponderance of political opinion welcomed such an arrangement, regarding it as a pioneering development, may be explained at least in part by observing that the usage [...] "" [...] had gained some currency at the time.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> criminal or <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|R

50|$|The Supreme Court of the State of New York is the trial-level {{court of}} general {{jurisdiction}} in the New York State Unified Court System. (Its Appellate Division {{is also the}} highest intermediate appellate court.) It is vested with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, although outside New York City it acts primarily as a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> with most criminal matters handled in County Court. There is a branch of the New York Supreme Court in each of New York's 62 counties. Unlike in most other states, the Supreme Court is a trial court and is not the highest court in the state.
