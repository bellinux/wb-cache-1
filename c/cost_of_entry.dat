5|$|Twelve {{groups of}} farmers and fishermen, {{a total of}} 325 individuals, banded {{together}} in the Kampoeng Rawa Association on 4 August 2012. This group was tasked with managing the new tourist site, which opened, despite construction being incomplete, shortly before Eid al-Fitr (18–19 August). The site was quickly popular, receiving an average of 2,000 visitors a day during the Eid holidays, and became a common location for events held by the local government. In late August 2012, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> was Rp. 2,500 per person, with an additional parking fee of Rp. 5,000 per car, although various activities were extra. During the four-day Eid al-Fitr holiday in 2013, the attraction received over 14,000 visitors.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that {{production}} of high-quality output is a precondition for firms in less developed countries {{to participate in the}} export market. Institutional deficiencies that raise the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into high-quality production therefore limit the positive impact that trade liberalization can have on income or growth. Institutional reform that reduces the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into high-quality production and trade reform therefore have synergistic effects on income and, possibly, growth. In contrast, institutional reform that reduces the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into low-quality production (e. g., reforms targeted at small businesses) interferes with the impact of trade reform. The model that yields these results is also used to analyze impacts of foreign direct investment and of subsidies to entrepreneurship in the presence of unemployment. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to investigate, {{using data}} {{on both the}} placing of {{automobile}} dealers and automobile demand and supply variables, the effects of new automobile dealers' entry in previously monopoly markets. First, we identify relevant variables which influence the existence {{and the number of}} automobile dealers in a geographical area. Then, using an adapted model from Bresnahan e Reiss (1990), we estimate the fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> new auto dealers' entry in monopoly markets. We conclude that the fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> a second automobile dealer {{do not seem to be}} significantly higher than the fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> the first one. This conclusion increases the probability that the exclusivity clause present in the concession contracts does not harm the competition in the automobile Brazilian distribution market. ...|$|R
500|$|Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, {{against whom}} they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves [...] "supporters" [...] of only one. This practice {{continued into the}} early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while {{it was true that}} a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481); not highlighted in the report was that within the City of Manchester itself, there were more City season ticket holders (approximately 4 for every 3 United). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.|$|E

2500|$|Satoshi Kanazawa {{said that}} part of the success of eHarmony can be {{explained}} by the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> in terms of the amount of time required to answer the initial questionnaire—over 18 hours, although other sources put the time to complete the relationship questionnaire at approximately one hour. Using Laurence Iannaccone's original idea that success of fundamentalist churches is explained by the high demands imposed on their members, Kanazawa hypothesizes that a similar self-selection mechanism is at work with eHarmony: [...] "they select their members very carefully, and only admit those who are very committed (or desperate; if anyone who chooses to join eHarmony is truly desperate to get married, then it can potentially and partially explain why it produces such a high proportion of all marriages in the US)." [...] Another factor suggested by Dan Ariely is the limited choice of partners offered, which may make the decision easier for some.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between international trade {{and the quality of}} economic institutions. We model institutions as fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> in a framework that has two key features. First, preferences over entry costs differ across firms and depend on firm size. Larger firms prefer to set higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> in order to reduce competition. Second, these costs are endogenously determined in a political economy equilibrium. Trade opening can lead to higher entry costs when it changes the political power in favor of a small elite of large exporters, who in turn prefer to install high entry barriers.

40|$|The typical <b>cost</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> {{environmental regulations}} {{consists of an}} engineering estimate <b>of</b> the compliance <b>costs.</b> In industries where fixed costs are an important determinant of market structure this static analysis ignores the dynamic effects of the regulation on market power, as higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> and investment can increase concentration. We evaluate the welfare effects of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the US Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a fully dynamic model of oligopoly {{in the tradition of}} Ericson and Pakes [13]. Using a recently developed two-step estimator, we recover the primitives of this model. We solve for the Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) of the model and simulate the welfare effects of the Amendments. We find the regulations impose a large welfare penalty on producers and consumers, primarily through a shift in the distribution <b>of</b> the sunk <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A primary {{consideration}} for the game was the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> to enjoy the new features of the game particularly in Pro mode; both {{the cost of the}} new keyboard and Pro guitars (ranging from $80 to 280) and the time investment to learn these aspects was considered high and may only cater to niche players. The Metro noted that if one does not purchase any of the additional hardware controllers, [...] "it's not much different to Rock Band 2". Goldstein commented that the amount of investment into the game will affect one's perception of the game's value: [...] "either something completely new and challenging or just more tracks to rock out to". Goldstein further noted that with the cost and time spent on the Pro guitar models, [...] "why not spend a little more and buy the real thing". Several reviewers commented that the buttoned Mustang Pro guitar is not as sturdy as other instruments and does not have the same tactile feel as a real guitar. Specifically, the reviewers noted that the width of the button impressions do not vary in width as real guitar strings would, and there is no tactile feedback as one would have with a fretboard. These reviewers suggested that players, if dedicated to the Pro guitar mode, to wait for the stringed Fender Squier which had more favorable reviews.|$|E

40|$|While {{the current}} system of {{auctioning}} exclusive licences may {{be the best way to}} allocate new frequencies for today, spectrum auctions may soon become technologically obsolete, economically inefficient, and legally unconstitutional. An alternative is to step beyond the current paradigm of licensed exclusivity to a system of full openness <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> This would allow access to spectrum bands through access fees that are determined by demand and supply conditions at the time. Prices for access would vary, depending on congestion. Long-term access at a certain price could be obtained by using a futures market. Such a system converts fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into marginal <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> usage, and removes incentives for collusive pricing. ...|$|R

The paper first describes a new and unique cross-country database that presents consistent and comparable information on the contribution of the SME sector to total employment in manufacturing and GDP across different countries. We then show that the share of formal SMEs in manufacturing increases as countries grow richer, while the informal sector loses importance. We also find that several dimensions of the business environment, such as lower <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> and better credit information sharing are associated with a larger size of the SME sector...|$|R

Hence, committing to not becoming active in sellers' markets can be profittable for the intermediary. We discuss different platform tariff systems to analyze this hold-up problem. We find that proportional fees (which are observed in many relevant real-world examples) mitigate the problem, unlike classical two-part tariffs (which most {{of the literature on}} two-sided markets examines). Thus, we offer a novel explanation for the use of proportional platform fees...|$|R
