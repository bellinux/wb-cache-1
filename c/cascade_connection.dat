40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general linear dual-rate {{structure}} for multirate signal processing, which encompasses the usual multirate building blocks-expanders, LTI filters, decimators, and their cascade combinations-as special cases. Structural properties of such dual-rate systems are studied in detail; in particular, several equivalent implementation structures are proposed: 1) <b>cascade</b> <b>connections</b> {{of a black}} expander, a linear periodically time-varying system, and a block decimator; 2) vector sample-rate changers; and 3) <b>cascade</b> <b>connections</b> of an expander, certain linear switching time-varying system, and a decimator. Using such general building blocks in multirate signal processing allows more design freedom and therefore can achieve what is otherwise impossible. This is illustrated in nonuniform multirate filter banks. Using the general building blocks as synthesis systems, the incompatibility for alias cancellation and structural dependency constraint for design, both due to fractional decimation ratios in different channels, are eliminated. Hence optimal design of synthesis systems is possible...|$|R

40|$|The Krohn-Rhodes {{complexity}} theory for pure (without linearity) automata is well-known. This theory uses an operation of wreath product as a decomposition tool. The main {{goal of the}} paper is to introduce the notion of complexity of linear automata. This notion is ultimately related with decompositions of linear automata. The study of these decompositions is the second objective of the paper. In order to define complexity for linear automata, {{we have to use}} three operations, namely, triangular product of linear automata, wreath product of pure automata and wreath product of a linear automaton with a pure one which returns a linear automaton. We define the complexity of a linear automaton as the minimal number of operations in the decompositions of the automaton into indecomposable components (atoms). This theory relies on the following parallelism between wreath and triangular products: both of them are terminal objects in the categories of <b>cascade</b> <b>connections</b> of automata. The wreath product is the terminal object in the Krohn-Rhodes theory for pure automata, while the triangular product provides the terminal object for the <b>cascade</b> <b>connections</b> of linear automata.

Roland von Eötvös discovered the weak equivalence principle (one of the cornerstones in Einsteinian relativity). Rado von Kövesligethy discovered laws of black body radiation before Planck and Wien.Hungary is famous for its excellent mathematics education which has trained numerous outstanding scientists. Famous Hungarian mathematicians include father Farkas Bolyai and son János Bolyai, designer of modern geometry (non-Euclidean geometry) 1820-1823. János Bolyai is together with John von Neumann considered as the greatest Hungarian mathematician ever. The most prestigious Hungarian scientific award is named in honor of János Bolyai. Paul Erdős, famed for publishing in over forty languages and whose Erdős numbers are still tracked;and John von Neumann, Quantum Theory, Game theory a pioneer of digital computing and the key mathematician in the Manhattan Project. Many Hungarian scientists, including Zoltán Bay, Victor Szebehely (gave a practical solution to the three-body problem, Newton solved the two-body problem), Mária Telkes, Imre Izsak, Erdős, von Neumann, Leó Szilárd, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller emigrated to the US. The other cause of scientist emigration was the Treaty of Trianon, by which Hungary, diminished by the treaty, became unable to support large-scale, costly scientific research; therefore some Hungarian scientists made valuable contributions in the United States. Thirteen Hungarian or Hungarian-born scientists received the Nobel Prize: von Lenárd, Bárány, Zsigmondy, von Szent-Györgyi, de Hevesy, von Békésy, Wigner, Gábor, Polányi, Oláh, Harsányi, and Herskó. All emigrated, mostly because of persecution of communist and/or fascist regimes. Names in psychology are János Selye founder of Stress-theory and Csikszentmihalyi founder of Flow- theory. Tamás Roska is co-inventor of CNN (Cellular neural network) Some highly actual internationally well-known figures of today include: mathematician László Lovász, physicist Albert-László Barabási, physicist Ferenc Krausz, biochemist Árpád Pusztai and the highly controversial former NASA-physicist Ferenc Miskolczi, who denies the green-house effect.
