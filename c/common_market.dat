5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European <b>Common</b> <b>Market,</b> which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the <b>Common</b> <b>Market.</b>|$|E

40|$|The GATT Rounds {{show that}} trade {{liberalization}} {{is essentially a}} cooperative non-stationary dynamic process. Therefore, the impact of Regionalism on trade liberalization possibly changes over time. I adapt the trade liberalization model of Devereux (1997) to examine how this impact varies. <b>Common</b> <b>markets</b> lead to a one-time shock in immediate tariffs, {{as well as to}} a change in their rate of decline. I find that <b>common</b> <b>markets</b> that happen late in the trade liberalization process are more likely to lead to a decline in immediate tariffs. <b>Common</b> <b>markets</b> also increase the rate of decline of tariffs after their formation. ...|$|R

5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the <b>Common</b> <b>Market,</b> Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E
5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> functioned smoothly.

5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> in 1973.|$|E
40|$|This paper expands on {{previous}} {{work by the}} author {{on the effects of}} regionalism on the speed of trade liberalization. Trade liberalization is essentially a cooperative nonstationary dynamic process and it is on the basis of such a model that the impact of regionalism needs to be examined. In doing so I am able to examine how the impact of <b>Common</b> <b>Markets</b> on trade liberalization differs with time. This has been ignored by the literature up to now. This paper uses a completely different trade liberalization process from the earlier paper and confirms and expands the previous results. The trade liberalization model used is adapted from Devereux (1997). <b>Common</b> <b>Markets</b> will have two effects. They will cause a one-time shock on immediate tariffs and will change the rate of decline of tariffs after that. The results are that <b>Common</b> <b>Markets</b> that happen late in the trade liberalization process are more likely to lead to a decline in immediate tariffs. <b>Common</b> <b>Markets</b> will also increase the rate of decline of tariffs after their formation...|$|R

5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} <b>common</b> <b>market</b> (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the <b>common</b> <b>markets,</b> and the European Union in particular, on the policy-making, administrative, judiciary, and {{territorial}} autonomy of nation states is to date fairly well explored. Less explored, by contrast, {{is the impact of}} <b>common</b> <b>markets</b> on the legislature of nation states. This paper proposes that <b>common</b> <b>markets</b> produce supranational law that displaces national legislatures as the traditional legislative bodies of the nation state. The displacement, however, varies in intensity across legislative arenas. An analysis of the legislative output of the EU and MERCOSUR for the years 1958 - 1999 and 1991 - 1999 respectively (a total of over 1, 800 relevant laws were coded) reveals an interesting pattern to this displacement. Intense displacement occurs above all in arenas directly and, due to spillover, indirectly related to the trade of physical goods. These include the environment, transportation, and public health. But in other arenas, including labor, capital, and services, states retain significant substantive and institutional integrity. The protectionist tendencies of states in these arenas, along with the geopolitical and commercial nature of <b>common</b> <b>markets,</b> probably explain such limitations. The implications of these findings for state strength in spheres other then legislation are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Since the 11th century, present-day Zimbabwe {{has been}} the site of several {{organised}} states and kingdoms {{as well as a}} major route for migration and trade. The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923. In 1965, the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations, which it withdrew from in December 2003.

5|$|Since the 20th century {{there has}} been {{significant}} population movement to England, mostly {{from other parts of}} the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s {{there has been}} a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.|$|E

5|$|The area of Africa {{now known}} as Malawi was settled by {{migrating}} Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland, a protectorate of the United Kingdom, became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a one-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who remained president until 1994, when he lost an election. Arthur Peter Mutharika is the current president. Malawi has a democratic, multi-party government. The country has a Malawian Defence Force that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is pro-Western and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several international organisations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the African Union (AU).|$|E
