30|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{taught us that}} LH has certain {{disadvantages}} with respect to patient safety when compared to VH and AH. Technical developments have already contributed to the enhanced safety of LH. However, further simplifying the LH is necessary, since reducing the operation time of LH may reduce health care costs and complication rates [20, 21]. Our study demonstrates that the <b>colpotomy</b> step in LH should be simplified. Not only is this surgical step time consuming bu it is also regarded as significantly more difficult when compared to AH. A vaginal approach of the <b>colpotomy</b> step may solve these issues.

A 5 -mm grasper was used to guide the uterus to the <b>colpotomy</b> site. The myoma was grasped with a tenaculum and removed vaginally. The clamps were placed on the edges of the wounds, and the fundus of the uterus was delivered, via the posterior <b>colpotomy</b> incision, into the vagina. The uterine incision was sutured in one to two layers. The repaired uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, and the <b>colpotomy</b> incision was closed. After a laparoscopic final check to control hemostasis, a Redon catheter was left for drainage.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the surgical <b>colpotomy</b> is a time-consuming step in the LH procedure, that is preceded by the hazardous dissection of the uterine arteries, bladder, and cervix, risking blood loss and ureter injuries. <b>Colpotomy</b> time comprises 16  % of the total operation time, even reaching 45  %. Albeit an extreme value, it does demonstrate the difficulty that can be experienced when performing this task. This is substantiated by our structured interview. In accordance with a previous study [8], our structured interview revealed that experts find <b>colpotomy</b> in LH significantly more difficult than in AH, and that the same trend is seen for <b>colpotomy</b> in LH compared to VH (although not significant). It is also demonstrated that a rise in BMI proved {{to be associated with}} a longer <b>colpotomy</b> time. This effect of BMI on the duration of surgery is in line with other studies [15, 16]. However, in our study, the effect of BMI on the <b>colpotomy</b> time remained even after correcting for total operation time. Apparently, higher BMI apart from the additional procedure time, accounts for an additional complicating factor regarding the <b>colpotomy</b> step. These women especially may benefit from the simplification of this procedure. Moreover, as the incidence of obesity is increasing, higher BMI will become part of everyday work in laparoscopic surgery [17]. No other factors, such as the amount of blood loss, previous abdominal surgery, or the presence of complications seemed to influence the duration of <b>colpotomy.</b> Surprisingly, also for uterine weight no correlation was found with <b>colpotomy</b> time. It is our opinion, that the <b>colpotomy</b> procedure can be regarded as independent from “uterine” factors, such as uterine weight. Indeed, when performing the <b>colpotomy</b> after all uterine ligaments and arteries have been dissected, the obtained additional mobility of the uterus will compensate for restrictions due to uterine weight. However, although uteri weighing up to 930  g were removed, the vast majority of uteri in our cohort weighed below 360  g. Therefore, we realize that, based on the results from our cohort, our statement may not fully apply to very large uteri. Yet, support of our opinion can be found in literature, where the feasibility of LH in women with larger uteri has already been established [18, 19]. A limitation of our study is the high number of exclusions, especially given the prospective design of this study. However, the overall effect of the exclusions on the outcome of our study is limited. Missing data can be considered random and therefore effect cohort size rather than the results, although the introduction of bias cannot be fully excluded. Only one surgical protocol was used for our prospective study, and this raises the question of external validity regarding other surgical protocols. However the relative <b>colpotomy</b> time that resulted from our prospective study matches the estimated relative <b>colpotomy</b> time from our interview (16  % vs 18  %, respectively), in which gynecologists participated who use different protocols. This study did not focus on procedural steps of the LH other than <b>colpotomy,</b> which could be considered a flaw. For instance, dissection and sealing of the uterine artery would have been an interesting addition. On the other hand, this step has already been enhanced by new surgical techniques and technology. All other steps of the hysterectomy procedure are relatively straightforward and appear to be in no apparent need of improvement. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, our findings regarding <b>colpotomy</b> time are important. A recent study demonstrated that operative time was an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and reoperation [20]. Furthermore, a cost analysis of different approaches to hysterectomy showed that patient operation room costs and total patient costs are higher for LH when compared to VH, and that longer operation time proved to be an important contributor to these higher costs [21]. In light of these studies, reducing CT and thereby the TOT may have beneficial effects on patient morbidity as well as on health care costs. This will become increasingly important, since there is an increase of laparoscopic hysterectomy procedures {{at the expense of the}} number of vaginal hysterectomies [22].|$|E

30|$|Method: This video {{presentation}} describes the <b>colpotomy</b> tube and uterine manipulator and demonstrates their use during a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.|$|E
30|$|Background: We have {{previously}} {{reported on the}} use of the Plymouth <b>colpotomy</b> tube for total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). We developed this as an alternative to similar devices currently available which we felt were unnecessarily complicated, and whose cost was a disincentive to uptake of the TLH procedure (ESGE 15 th Annual Congress Oct 2006). We have recently developed a simple uterine manipulator which can be used with the <b>colpotomy</b> tube during TLH procedures.|$|E
30|$|New {{surgical}} {{techniques and}} technical equipment {{have attempted to}} facilitate laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH), after shortcomings of LH in comparison with vaginal hysterectomy (VH) and abdominal hysterectomy (AH) were demonstrated [1]. New alternatives for conventional suturing, such as bipolar coagulation, have improved hemostasis of the uterine and ovarian pedicles [1]. Furthermore, in a systematic review, the superiority of vessel-sealing devices with respect to blood loss and shorter operation time in some abdominal procedures was demonstrated compared to other electrothermical devices [2]. Finally, barbed sutures have been introduced for vaginal vault closing, and this technique appears to be equal compared to standard sutures with respect to time to cuff closing, cuff healing, and sexual function [3]. Although some of these effects are debatable, for instance due to possible contributing factors such as learning curve, they do demonstrate the efforts to facilitate the LH. Certainly, notwithstanding the well-known benefits of LH, VH remains {{the gold standard for}} the hysterectomy procedure [1, 4], even though in contrast with this statement, recent studies have shown that LH was associated with shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, and less postoperative pain compared to VH [5, 6]. Yet, LH is still associated with a longer operating time [4, 7]. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that LH is regarded as more difficult when compared to AH and VH [8]. Learning curve issues and implementation errors have contributed to these results. However, there still are technical opportunities to simplify the LH procedure. Our hypothesis is that the <b>colpotomy</b> should be addressed in this context. <b>Colpotomy</b> is part of the final surgical steps in the LH procedure, following the ligation of the uterine arteries, the skeletonizing of the cervix, and the dissection of the bladder from the cervix. These steps are relatively hazardous and time consuming in the procedure. It is in this anatomical area where most of the bleeding and ureter injuries occur [9, 10]. Moreover, the delicacy of laparoscopic surgery in this anatomical area was demonstrated by the initial higher incidence of ureter injuries during LH, which only decreased after a certain learning curve was passed [11]. In this light, an alternative route for <b>colpotomy</b> has been investigated: analysis of the current <b>colpotomy</b> procedure demonstrated that the main difficulties of this surgical step are the limited visibility during <b>colpotomy</b> (due to the anterior view of the endoscope combined with the location of the cervix deep in the pelvis), and the need for a 360 ° circular cutting motion during <b>colpotomy.</b> To overcome these difficulties, a vaginal approach to the <b>colpotomy</b> was suggested. The first test with a prototype of a vaginal <b>colpotomy</b> device on an in vitro vaginal model demonstrated a significant reduction of <b>colpotomy</b> time [12].|$|E
30|$|The only {{complication}} recorded {{during the}} audit period was an accidental posterior <b>colpotomy</b> incision during an operative laparoscopy (resection of endometriosis).|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{energy sources}} {{are used in}} the form of either {{monopolar}} current or harmonic scalpel for <b>colpotomy</b> in total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This is associated with lateral thermal damage to adjacent organs such as the urinary bladder or lower ureter. The risk of scar dehiscence with this method is higher than that for abdominal hysterectomy. The objective of this new technique is to reduce these complications. The <b>colpotomy</b> is done using a blade and scissors through the vaginal tube without using any energy source. The resulting edge of the cut is sharper than that done by cautery, making it easy to pick full thickness of vagina. <b>Colpotomy</b> with this method is quicker than when using an energy source. There are also no toxic fumes thus visibility is not affected...|$|E
30|$|In our case, {{we decided}} to avoid vaginal {{manipulation}} of the fibroid as we were concerned we might encounter significant haemorrhage due to its broad base. At laparoscopy, distortion of the pelvic anatomy required extensive ureterolysis and identification of the uterine arteries at the level where they cross the ureters to safely ligate them (video). Identification of the correct area to perform the <b>colpotomy</b> also proved difficult. <b>Colpotomy</b> was finally performed laparoscopically by inserting two fingers in the vagina above the fibroid and digitally palpating and applying tension onto the anterior vaginal vault. Indeed other authors have reported that {{the identification of the}} limit between the cervix and the vagina can be particularly laborious [8]. Auber et al. achieved complete devascularization of the uterus laparoscopically and thus identified the limit between the ischaemic reversed cervix and the normal vascularized vagina. They then used this limit to guide the <b>colpotomy</b> which they performed by vaginal route [1]. In retrospect, apart from the limited access, a vaginal approach to our case would place the ureters at risk due to the distorted pelvic anatomy; therefore, we recommend that the <b>colpotomy</b> can be performed laparoscopically with safety by the method described above.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. With the {{widespread}} adoption of laparoscopic and robotic surgery, {{more and more}} women are undergoing minimally invasive surgery for complex gynecological procedures. The rate-limiting step is often the delivery of an intact uterus or an unruptured adnexal mass. To avoid conversion to a minilaparotomy for specimen retrieval, we describe a novel technique using an Anchor Tissue Retrieval System bag in conjunction with a pneumo-occluder to easily retrieve large specimens through a <b>colpotomy</b> incision. Surgical Technique. After completion of the robotic-assisted hysterectomy, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were too large to be retrieved intact despite multiple attempts of delivery through the <b>colpotomy</b> incision. Prior to resorting to a minilaparotomy or morcellation of the specimen, a 15 [*]mm anchor retrieval bag with a pneumo-occluder was placed through the vagina and the intact specimen was easily placed inside the bag under direct visualization and removed through the <b>colpotomy</b> incision intact. Conclusion. We routinely utilize this technique to retrieve hysterectomy specimens that are not readily delivered through the <b>colpotomy</b> incision and find this technique to be safe, highly efficient, and cost effective when {{there is a need to}} remove large intact specimens during minimally invasive surgery...|$|E
30|$|Our data {{suggests}} that secondary hemorrhage is rare but may occur more often after TLH than after other hysterectomy approaches. Large size of uteri, {{excessive use of}} energy source for uterine artery, and <b>colpotomy</b> may play a role. The comparison of different energy sources like ultrasonic (harmonic) or bipolar with scissors for <b>colpotomy</b> in TLH is worth studying. TLH is a feasible and safe technique in cases of enlarged uteri, which permits avoidance of laparotomy with evident benefits for the patients [10].|$|E
30|$|A {{posterior}} <b>colpotomy</b> {{was performed}} following {{the insertion of}} the McCartney tube per vaginum, using monopolar diathermy to make a transverse incision over the posterior lip of the McCartney tube. This allowed retrieval of the uterine body and inspection of the operative field while maintaining the pneumoperitoneum. This is a major advantage over other techniques. The posterior <b>colpotomy</b> was then sutured laparoscopically in a continuous running suture and tied vaginally. The estimated blood loss was minimal, and the operating time was 2 h.|$|E
30|$|Operative technique: In 1999 Flint and Chu Jon {{described}} suturing multiple myomas into a chain using {{a single}} stitch of silk, with posterior removal via <b>colpotomy.</b> This shortened operative time and lessened probabilities of inadvertently leaving fibroids in the abdominal cavity. In our institution, myomata removal is preferably done by <b>colpotomy,</b> and we recently started using Flint’s chain technique, which we considered a feasible approach. After enucleation of the fibroids and assembling {{them into a}} chain with suture, a <b>colpotomy</b> is performed laparoscopically with a sponge forceps in the vaginal cul-de sac as a guide. The end of the suture containing the myomas is stitched into the sponge, and gentle traction of the forceps accomplishes vaginal extraction of the fibroids. In this manner we have taken out different sizes of fibroids (maximum 9  cm) and up to nine myomas from a single patient.|$|E
30|$|Finally in {{collaboration}} with the technical university of Delft we developed a method to simplify the <b>colpotomy</b> (the amputation of the uterus from the vaginal wall).|$|E
40|$|Both {{posterior}} <b>colpotomy</b> with associated fimbriectomy and laparoscopy offer {{rapid and}} effective methods {{for carrying out}} interim and post-abortion tubal sterilization. They can effectively be performed on an out-patient basis. Posterior <b>colpotomy</b> has the added advantage {{that it can be}} conveniently performed under a combination of intravenous neuroleptanalgesia and local vaginal anesthesia. This series exemplifies {{the manner in which the}} burden upon hospital facilities and medical and paramedical personnel can be minimized. In addition, utilization of the “home-care program” has improved patient acceptance and convenience...|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: <b>Colpotomy</b> for myomata removal is safe, {{inexpensive}} and simple. When chain stitching of the myomata is added, {{the chance of}} leaving fibroids behind is greatly reduced.|$|E
30|$|Next, a {{prospective}} cohort study was performed at two hospitals specialized in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. From June 2010 to May 2014, LH procedures were timed {{to assess the}} duration of <b>colpotomy.</b> The total operating time (TOT) {{was defined as the}} time from the insertion of the Veress needle to the final stitches used for closing last trocar incision site. <b>Colpotomy</b> time (CT) was defined as the time from the first incision in the vaginal fornix (after ligating the uterine arteries and all uterine ligaments) until the complete separation of the cervix from the vaginal wall. An extrafascial technique was used to perform total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The vaginal wall was opened anteriorly at the vesicovaginal fold, after which the <b>colpotomy</b> was completed. All consecutive LH procedures were eligible for inclusion. This study was exempt from approval by the medical ethics committee. Procedures were performed by five gynecologists who perform LH on a regular basis and have experience in well over 100 TLH procedures. The number of participating gynecologists was chosen to enhance the external validity of the outcome. Inter-surgeon variability was minimized by using similar surgical procedure protocols. Furthermore, all surgeons received their training at the Leiden Residency Program. The Valtchev or Clermont Ferrand uterine manipulator was used. Bipolar and ultrasonic instruments were used for <b>colpotomy.</b> Basic patient characteristics were gathered. The uterine weight and the total amount of blood loss were measured in the operating room. Patients were excluded in case of missing <b>colpotomy</b> time. Complications were classified according to the severity of the complications {{on the basis of the}} framework set by the Dutch Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology (NVOG) [14].|$|E
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{showed a}} total TLH procedure time of 118  min (75 – 158) among the experts (N[*]=[*] 20) and 155  min (100 – 190) in the novice group. The <b>colpotomy</b> time / total operation time was 17 %. The prospective time measurement study showed a total TLH operation time of 117 (35 – 240) min. Whereas the colpotomy/ total operation time was 18 %. The new method of <b>colpotomy</b> enabled {{a reduction of}} 80 – 90 % of amputation time of the TLH measured in vitro. A prototype will be shown.|$|E
30|$|The {{successful}} {{performance of}} this procedure and the patient's uneventful recovery, including early hospital discharge and rapid return to normal activity the following week (although intercourse was deferred for 4 weeks because of the posterior <b>colpotomy</b> scar), suggest that this technique can be recommended to colleagues. Various laparoscopic supracervical techniques have been described to allow removal of the uterine body. Morcellation is either time-consuming or expensive, depending on whether a manual or a mechanical technique is employed. Enlargement of the port sites negates {{the advantage of a}} laparoscopic procedure. Morcellation also requires preoperative endometrial assessment as the uterine body is removed in a piecemeal fashion. Posterior <b>colpotomy</b> to allow removal of the uterine body leads to loss of the pneumoperitoneum. But the use of the McCartney tube inserted transvaginally allows the pneumoperitoneum to be maintained and therefore offers a very safe and effective method for removing and retrieving the uterine body, suturing the posterior <b>colpotomy,</b> and inspecting the operative field [11, 12].|$|E
30|$|Vaginal cuff {{dehiscence}} {{was defined}} as partial or complete separation of the vaginal cuff with or without evisceration. TLHs and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies (RAHs) in our study were defined as hysterectomies performed entirely through a laparoscopic or robotic approach, including <b>colpotomy</b> and cuff closure [17]. Hysterectomies performed laparoscopically but with a vaginal <b>colpotomy</b> and/or cuff closure were categorized as laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). As a separate diagnostic code did not exist to distinguish TLH and RAH from LAVH {{for a majority of}} the study period, appropriate classification of hysterectomy type was confirmed by operative note review.|$|E
30|$|Past studies demonstrating an {{increased}} risk of dehiscence following TLH have suggested that the technique of monopolar electrosurgery may predispose patients to dehiscence. While we did not demonstrate an association between dehiscence and technique of <b>colpotomy,</b> obesity may confer a protective effect through the physiologic property of increasing impedance in the monopolar circuit. With increased impedance owing to increased adipose tissue in the circuit, less total energy is delivered to a given area, which may lead to less tissue destruction at time of <b>colpotomy.</b> Further studies detailing the thermal effect of electrosurgery as it relates to tissue type are warranted.|$|E
30|$|Materials and methods: From April 2007 to April 2008 a {{total of}} six n.o.t.e.s cholecystectomies, using the trasvaginal access, were {{performed}} in six patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis in our hospital. Exclusion gynaecologic criteria included rectovaginal endometriosis, fixed retroverted uterus and mass in the pouch of Douglas. With the patient in steep Trendelemburg position, under laparoscopic control, the transvaginal access was achieved via a 2  cm posterior <b>colpotomy</b> performed 1  cm below the cervix. The peritoneal cavity and organs were explored by a double channel scope in retroflexed position.
