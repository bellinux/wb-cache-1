40|$|AbstractLaser {{cladding}} using a {{scanned beam}} {{is quite a}} similar process than laser cladding using static optics (e. g. lens or mirror optics). The main difference comes from the manipulation of the laser beam. In laser cladding with scanning optics the laser beam is manipulated with a scanner so that the laser's area of influence can be shaped numerically. This increases <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> flexibility. Scanning optics enable laser beam modification considerably versatile way than normal static optics can. This is due to possibility of numerical adjustment of scanning amplitude, laser power and scanning frequency. By modifying these parameters clad beads geometry can by modified quite freely. However scanned laser beam in surface modification process creates some restricting factors to the process. Mainly limitations for the process parameter values come from the dual characteristics of the energy input. This paper treats usability of scanning optics in laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> in general level. In this paper is discussed how scanned beam {{can be used to}} increase the flexibility but also maters that limit the usage of scanned beam in <b>cladding</b> <b>process.</b> Process possibilities and limitations are presented in trough experimental data and examples...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} application of continuous coaxial laser cladding by powder injection as a surface treatment or coating process. The investigation aimed to establish {{the relationship between a}} change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> variables and the geometry and characteristics of an Al- 20 wt-Si single pass clad layer formed on an Al 1370 -F substrate using a Nd:YAG laser. The main process variables considered were: laser power, laser scanning velocity and the powder feed rate. The relationship between a change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> variables and the geometry and characteristics of the clad layer was established by statistically analysing the variation in the process response with a change in the main laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> variables. The process variables were varied based on a full-factorial, experimentally optimized test matrix. The clad geometry which is mainly defined by: the clad height, width, clad aspect ratio, depth of alloy penetration, and the clad root angle/wetting angle was investigated. In addition to the clad geometry several clad characteristics were investigated such as the dilution of the clad layer in the substrate material, the Vickers microhardness and microstructure of the clad crosssection, the powder efficiency of the process and the amount of visible defects. The study successfully established the relationship between the main laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> variables and the clad geometry and characteristics. The secondary objective of establishing a suitable processing window by considering the relationship mentioned above was only partially met since it is believed that further refinement of the experimental cladding test setup and therefore also the experimental variable test levels is required...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} thermal damage of the {{substrate}} during the laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process.</b> The laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> is known as a process which causes small thermal damage in the base material situated directly below the deposited powder. However when the laser <b>cladding</b> <b>process</b> is applied to martensitic steels, that have been previously treated in order to obtain well balanced hard and tough structures, the deposition of the heated powder as well as the interaction of the laser beam with the surface can modify the base material properties beneath the cladding layer. As a consequence uncontrolled, different and variable in hardness microstructures are produced. A 1 kW fiber laser source transmitted trough a 50 μm delivery fiber was employed to deposit a common Co-base powder over a martensitic stainless steel. Different process conditions were tested in order to reproduce different temperature fields in the base material. The temperature field in the substrate was measured making use of micro-thermocouples able to capture the fast heating and cooling thermal cycles during the deposition process. The microstructure analysis of the heat affected zones beneath the cladding layer together with the microhardness measurements allowed the thermal damage in terms of extension and intensity to be characterized and compared with the corresponding thermal cycles...|$|E
