In the experiment, trainee translators are asked to use several types of resources, including a set of pre-annotated <b>contexts</b> of various types, and to identify the <b>contexts</b> that {{they consider to be}} the most relevant for their task. We present the first results of this experiment, which confirm our general assumption about the usefulness of such rich <b>contexts</b> and indicate some differences regarding the use of <b>contexts</b> in the source and target language.

We reasoned that in common ingroup <b>contexts,</b> self-categorization, but not perceived complexity, would be positively related to intergroup bias. In contrast, in crossed categorization <b>contexts,</b> perceived complexity, but not self-categorization, would be negatively related to intergroup bias. In two studies, and in line with predictions, we found that while self-categorization and intergroup bias were related in common ingroup <b>contexts,</b> {{this was not the case}} in crossed categorization <b>contexts.</b> Moreover, we found that perceived category complexity, and not self-categorization, predicted bias in crossed categorization <b>contexts.</b> We discuss the implications of these findings for models of social categorization and intergroup bias. © 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the use of belief <b>contexts</b> for the {{formalization}} of multi-agent reasoning. In addition to representational power, belief <b>contexts</b> provide implementational advantages. We substantiate this claim by discussing a paradigmatic case study, the Three Wise Men puzzle. 1 Introduction and motivations Belief <b>contexts</b> [4, 7, 8] are a formalism for the representation of propositional attitudes. Their basic feature is modularity: knowledge can be distributed in different, separated modules, called contexts; the interactions between them, i. e. the transfer of knowledge between <b>contexts,</b> can be formally defined according to the application. For instance, the beliefs of an agent can be represented {{with one or more}} <b>contexts,</b> distinct from the <b>contexts</b> representing beliefs of other agents; different <b>contexts</b> can be used to represent the beliefs of an agent in different situations. Interaction between <b>contexts</b> can express the effect of communication between agents, and the evo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} now {{on-going}} discussions, not to say endless discussions, about the intrinsic definition of <b>contexts</b> {{have been at the}} center stage of every single meeting of the conceptual graph community. It is our opinion that this lack of consensus about <b>contexts</b> is in direct relation to its lack of a formal definition. As a matter of fact, no formal definition of <b>contexts</b> was given up to this moment, not even in John Sowa's original book. Being a vital issue in conceptual graph theory, this paper addresses the problem of providing formal semantics to the definition of <b>contexts,</b> when used for information packaging. It proposes a definitional framework for <b>contexts,</b> based on formal concept analysis [17], bridging these two research areas.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we bring}} to the {{management}} scholar’s attention the concept of <b>contexts</b> of experience as {{a key factor in}} understanding the changes currently influencing the strategies of many businesses and the behavior of many consumers. The topic is introduced with a critical analysis of how the marketing literature has dealt with the difference between goods and services. Then we define the <b>contexts</b> of consumption of goods and services as <b>contexts</b> of experience for the subjects populating them. Consumers interact in these <b>contexts,</b> learning and feeling emotions. We go on to further analyze the role of emotions and the process of value co-production within <b>contexts</b> of experience. Finally, we propose to divide <b>contexts</b> of experience into two categories that may be useful for designing a successful marketing strategy, i. e. the (few) <b>contexts</b> with a high intensity of experience in which the firm conducts an exploratory activity of complexity, and the (many) <b>contexts</b> in which it exploits the results of this exploration...|$|R

We describe VEGEMATIC, a system that constructs such <b>contexts</b> by concatenating overlapping five-grams from Google‘s N-gram corpus. We propose and operationalize a set of constraints to identify good <b>contexts.</b> VEGEMATIC uses these constraints to filter, cluster, score, and select example <b>contexts.</b> An evaluation experiment compared the resulting <b>contexts</b> against human authored example <b>contexts</b> (e. g., from children‘s dictionaries and children‘s stories). Based on rating by an expert blind to source, their average quality was comparable to story sentences, though {{not as good as}} dictionary examples. A second experiment measured the percentage of generated <b>contexts</b> rated by lay judges as acceptable, and how long it took to rate them.

25|$|In general, the {{determinants}} of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on <b>context,</b> so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated from a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on <b>context.</b> The <b>context</b> within which regulatory elements act includes cis-acting <b>context</b> that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and trans-acting <b>context</b> that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish <b>context.</b> As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing silencers and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new silencers or disrupt existing enhancers.|$|E
