They also face the <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E

40|$|Transferring a {{language}} text into another language {{is the idea}} of translation. There are so many ways based on so many different points of view to achieve the goal. Applying one of the theories of translation, the writer analyzes the process of translation of the Indonesian translation entitled Chicken Soup for the Unsinkable Soul from its original English book. This thesis is based on Nida and Taber's eight <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> of content transfer theory. It discusses the <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> occurring in the process of content transfer, including the changes of meaning and the naturalness of the target language. This study of problems of content transfer emphasizes on the process of content transfer with which English as the source language and Indonesian as the target language. The analysis is done by using a qualitative approach. It focuses on the process of content transfer rather than on the product of the rendering book. The finding shows that from the eight <b>common</b> <b>problems,</b> there are seven <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> occur in the process of content transfer of the Indonesian translation entitled Chicken Soup for the Unsinkable Soul from the original English book. Only four <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> cause a change in meaning and three <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> cause an unnaturalness of the target language...|$|R

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advantage}} of this method over addition of organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds is that it avoids the <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> of over-addition.

This occurs even if the equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled.|$|E

5|$|Acne {{is a very}} <b>common</b> <b>problem,</b> {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} is a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin {{systems can be}} used to {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} not been {{recorded}} since the original pair of Negros fruit doves were shot in May 1953 at Mt Kanlaon. However, a local hunter in southern Negros claimed to have shot it in the nineties, which has given hope that the species may still exist, and as such the IUCN lists the Negros fruit dove as Critically Endangered, as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds. If the species still exists, {{it is likely that}} habitat destruction for agriculture, timber, and charcoal-burning and hunting, a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> for all other pigeons on Negros, are major threats.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.

Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
