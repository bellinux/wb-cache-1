40|$|International audienceNotched {{round bars}} {{made of a}} semi-crystalline polymer, {{polyamide}} 6, were submitted to creep tests. In order to study the microstructural evolution of the material during creep deformation, these tests were stopped at two <b>characteristic</b> <b>creep</b> times: i) {{the end of the}} secondary creep stage, ii) the onset of the failure during the tertiary creep stage, allowing 3 D through thickness Synchrotron Radiation Tomography (SRT) -inspections. This SRT-technique allowed features of the damage to be assessed at a micrometre resolution within the notched region, such as spatial distributions of void volume fraction and void heights and diameters. These deformation mechanisms have already been observed and studied during steady strain rate loading and a multi-mechanism model coupled with damage formulation proposed to simulate notched specimens submitted to tensile loads. This model, based on porous visco-plasticity, was used here to simulate the creep behaviour of this PA 6 material. The optimization procedure has led to a set of material coefficients capable of reproducing both macroscopic behaviour (creep curves) and damage micro-mechanisms. The level of maximum damage within the material and the spatial distributions of void volume fraction obtained numerically were compared successfully to experiments and the Cauchy stress tensor has been proved {{to be related to the}} void deformation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Expansins are plant {{proteins}} {{that have the}} capacity to induce extension in isolated cell walls and are thought to mediate pH-dependent cell expansion. J. K. C. Rose, H. H. Lee, and A. B. Bennett ([1997] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94 : 5955 – 5960) reported the identification of an expansin gene (LeExp 1) that is specifically expressed in ripening tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruit where cell wall disassembly, but not cell expansion, is prominent. Expansin expression during fruit ontogeny was examined using antibodies raised to recombinant LeExp 1 or a cell elongation-related expansin from cucumber (CsExp 1). The LeExp 1 antiserum detected expansins in extracts from ripe, but not preripe tomato fruit, in agreement with the pattern of LeExp 1 mRNA accumulation. In contrast, antibodies to CsExp 1 cross-reacted with expansins in early fruit development and the onset of ripening, but not at a later ripening stage. These data suggest that ripening-related and expansion-related expansin proteins have distinct antigenic epitopes despite overall high sequence identity. Expansin proteins were detected in a range of fruit species and showed considerable variation in abundance; however, appreciable levels of expansin were not present in fruit of the rin or Nr tomato mutants that exhibit delayed and reduced softening. LeExp 1 protein accumulation was ethylene-regulated and matched the previously described expression of mRNA, suggesting that expression is not regulated at the level of translation. We report the first detection of expansin activity in several stages of fruit development and while <b>characteristic</b> <b>creep</b> activity was detected in young and developing tomato fruit and in ripe pear, avocado, and pepper, creep activity in ripe tomato showed qualitative differences, suggesting both hydrolytic and expansin activities...|$|E
