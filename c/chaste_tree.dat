[...] Chaucer, in [...] "The Flower and the Leaf," [...] refers to it as an attribute of the chaste Diana, and in the 16th century the English herbalist William Turner reports the same anaphrodisiac properties of the seed, both fried and not fried. More recently, this plant has been called monk's pepper in the thought that it was used as anti-libido medicine by monks to aid their attempts to remain chaste. There are disputed accounts regarding its actual action on libido, with some claims that it is anaphrodisiac and others that it is aphrodisiac. Because of the complex mechanism of action it can be probably both, depending on concentration of the extract and physiologic variables (see below).|$|E

In vitro microplate-based assays using cDNA-expressed CYP 450 isoforms and fluorogenic substrates were used. Components of the commercial herbal preparations interfered with the assays and limited the concentration ranges that could be tested. Nevertheless, the fluorogenic assays were robust, reproducible and easy to perform and thus are still useful for initial screening for potential herb/drug interactions. None of the preparations affected CYPs 1 A 1 or 2 C 9 at the concentrations tested but all preparations inhibited some of the enzymes with potencies around 1 g/mL. The three most potent interactions were: <b>chaste</b> <b>tree</b> berry and CYP 2 C 19 (IC 50 0. 22 g/mL,); <b>chaste</b> <b>tree</b> berry and CYP 3 A 4 (IC 50 0. 3 g/mL); black cohosh and CYP 2 C 19 (IC 50 0. 37 g/mL,).

A number of placebo controlled studies gave proof that extracts of VAC had beneficial effects on premenstrual breast pain. This breast sensation is induced by latent hyperprolactinemia which is characterized by secretory episodes of prolactin release by the pituitary in response to stress and deep sleep phases.

40|$|Background: Vitex agnus-castus is a {{herbal drug}} with antiprolactin effect {{and it is}} {{effective}} in premenstrual syndrome and hypermenorrhea. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate vitex agnus-castus extract (<b>chaste</b> <b>tree)</b> in comparison with placebo in treating patients with mastalgia, and evaluation of its acceptability and side effects. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 117 women with mastalgia, aged 15 - 50 years old, referring to women’s health centers, were divided into two groups. One group (55 patients) received 60 drops of vitex agnus-castus daily for three months and the control group (62 patients) received placebo for the same period of time. Results: By the end of the treatment, 88. 4 % of the vitex agnus-castus group and 17 / 7 % of the placebo group showed positive response (P= 0. 0001). vitex agnus-castus was well tolerated and caused no side effects.

40|$|The diffuse benign breast disease {{mastopathy}} is {{most common}} in reproductive-aged women. According to the World Health Organization, mastopathy {{is defined as a}} fibrocystic disease (FCD) characterized by a broad spectrum of proliferative and regressive changes in breast tissues. The prevalence of this disease varies from 30 to 40 %. The magnitude of clinical manifestations is highly diverse varying from slight premenstrual tension to the acute pain syndrome accompanied by the higher volume and density of the gland with the formation of nodular proliferations and cysts. In most cases, the present women regard mastopathy as a handicap in daily life and try to resort to sparing therapy options, such as homeopathy or phytotherapy. The phytotherapeutic preparation Mastodinon is one of these pathogenetic effective drugs to treat premenstrual syndrome and FCD.

In general, the speed and percentage of seed germination was greatly increased by the most treatments including hot water immersion and dry heating (germination increased up to 83 %), clearly indicating that there is a physical (seed coat) dormancy in this species, while untreated seeds (i. e., control) had relatively moderate germination and emergence percentages. This positive (or damaging at high temperatures) effect of dry heat on seed germination and emergence rate and percentage, implies the potential effect of fire on promotion of V. agnus castus seed germination and in some cases it could be taken into account, as long as fire is a frequent ecological factor in Mediterranean-type ecosystems...|$|E

A specific questionnaire was developed for determining the effect of Vitex on psychic and somatic complaints, on the four characteristic PMS symptom complexes depression, anxiety, craving, and hyperhydration (DACH), and on single groups of symptoms. After a treatment period of three menstrual cycles 93 % of patients reported a {{decrease in the number of}} symp-toms or even cessation of PMS complaints. To a certain extent, this effect was observed within all symptom complexes and correlated with the global assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Whereas 85 % of physicians rated it as good or very good, 81 % of patients assessed their sta-tus after treatment as very much or much better. Analysis of frequency and severity of mas-todynia as the predominant symptom revealed that complaints still present after 3 months of therapy were mostly less severe. Ninety-four percent of patients assessed the tolerance of Vi-tex treatment as good or very good. Adverse drug reactions were suspected by physicians in 1. 2 % of patients, but there were no serious adverse drug reactions.
