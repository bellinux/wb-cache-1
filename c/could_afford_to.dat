5|$|The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees {{needed a}} top-tier {{starting}} pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners felt they <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> part with Pineda {{because of their}} depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Parthian army is unknown, as is {{the size}} of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological {{excavations}} in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower. Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> live off the land.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, who feared free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{looked at}} it from every angle, but insurmountable {{difficulties}} seemed to be blocking the way. One thing I <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> do: I <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> be a coward".|$|R
50|$|Data from 2012 {{showed that}} the {{percentage}} of households of Vučitrn that <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> basic goods and services was lower than Kosovo's average. Whereas 20% of all Kosovan residents <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> a meal with meat once per week, the same was true of 15% of Vučitrn residents; 30% compared to Kosovo's average of 42% <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for public utilities; 24% compared to Kosovo's average of 34% were unable to cover the expenses of treating flu or any other minor illness; 37% compared to Kosovo's average of 49% <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> buy new clothes and footwear whenever necessary; 67% compared to Kosovo’s average of 71% <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> go to a restaurant once a month; and 74% compared to Kosovo's average of 76% <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for a week's holiday away from home once a year. A similar percentage to Kosovo's average (36% of households) <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> invite family or friends for a meal at least once a month.|$|R
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> act.|$|E
5|$|Concorde was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. Air France (AF) and British Airways (BA) {{were the only}} airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay a high price in exchange for Concorde's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7995, more than 30 times {{the cost of the}} cheapest option to fly this route.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices (usually involving {{animals and}} foodstuffs) to various deities, spirits, and ancestors. Deceased ancestors {{were thought to}} require food and drink in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the ancestors in a family shrine or temple. Wealthy families who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> bury their dead in large tombs often placed the food items at the entrances of such complexes.|$|E
50|$|Strikes {{were also}} a problem, as the company <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay its employees.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of cutbacks, RTÉ <b>could</b> only <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> spend €2 on {{sandwiches}} per audience member.|$|R
60|$|But the Colonel said he <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> lose, and {{therefore}} could {{not hope to}} win.|$|R
5|$|For his lighter missile troops, Philip II {{employed}} mercenary Cretan archers {{as well as}} Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian javelin throwers, slingers, and archers. He hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, {{who were}} capable of building {{state of the art}} siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.|$|E
5|$|He donated his parents' house, Osborne on the Isle of Wight, to {{the state}} and {{continued}} to live at Sandringham. He <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit. Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, and had benefited from advice from Edward's Jewish financier friends, such as Ernest Cassel, Maurice de Hirsch and the Rothschild family. At a time of widespread anti-Semitism, Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} into the Kikuyu people {{in the village of}} Ngenda, which lay in an area of sugar cane and cattle pasture. His father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They were shamba folk, living in a {{homestead}} built on a spur of land near the River Thiririka; they were farmers, raising crops and breeding both sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> keep several wives, each of whom lived in a separate nyom ba (woman's hut).|$|E

5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> buy the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} {{a small proportion of}} the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only they <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> keep a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to have exceeded 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited exclusively from the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5000|$|A lease-in-perpetuity (999-year lease) was {{introduced}} (1892) {{to provide security}} for settlers who <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> purchase freehold land.|$|R

50|$|Originally, Aldi shops {{were often}} {{ridiculed}} as being cheap shops selling low-quality goods, whose customers <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> shop elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|Adam Mort {{established}} a grammar school by the chapel in 1631 {{which was in}} use until 1833. Children from poor families were admitted free and those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay covered the costs. Mort's School closed in 1894. In 1832 children were taught in a barn at the vicarage, the curate, Alfred Hewlett, improved it and the chapel {{was used as a}} classroom. A national school built by subscription on land donated by Captain Durie of Damhouse opened in November 1841. Meanleys Infant School was opened at Gin Pit in 1904 to serve the mining community that had grown up by there. Other schools were built at Ellesmere Street and Marsland Green.|$|E
5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
50|$|Tromsø <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> extend Prijović' loan-deal, and he {{returned}} to Sion when the loan-deal expired on 1 July 2013.|$|R
50|$|Davies left Exeter {{at the end}} of the 2015-16 {{season after}} the club <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> offer him a new contract.|$|R

5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> take significant {{damage in the}} battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{attended}} Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Washington, {{where he}} lettered in baseball, leading {{his team to}} the Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to the title game as a senior in 2002. He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus {{to prevent him from}} attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2010, Stevens {{signed a}} {{long-term}} deal with Butler, extending his contract through the 2021–22 season. Financial {{terms of the}} contract were not disclosed; however, Butler president Bobby Fong had publicly stated that the university <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> increase Stevens' base salary to approximately US $1,000,000 a few days prior. Stevens had previously made US$395,000 plus benefits in base salary, a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach. His total compensation for 2009–10 was estimated at US$750,000. Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures.|$|E
