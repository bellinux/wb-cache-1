40|$|Flight {{transition}} data {{applicable to}} swept wings at high subsonic speeds {{are needed to}} make valid assessments {{of the potential for}} natural laminar flow or laminar flow control for transports of various sizes at various cruise speeds. NASA initiated the variable <b>sweep</b> <b>transition</b> flight experiment (VSTFE) to help establish a boundary layer transition data base for use in laminar flow wing design. The carrier vehicle for this experiment is an F- 14, which has variable sweep capability. The variable sweep outer panels of the F- 14 were modified with natural laminar flow gloves to provide not only smooth surfaces but also airfoils that can produce a wide range of pressure distributions for which transition location can be determined.

The disturbance growth traces shown are too scattered to define a transition criteria to replace the F- 111 data band, which has been used successfully to design NLF gloves. Still, a careful review of the clean-up glove data may yield cases for which the transition location is known more accurately. Liquid crystal photographs of the clean-up glove show much spanwise variation in the transition front for some conditions, and this further complicates the analyses. Several high quality cases are needed in which the transition front is well defined and at a relatively constant chordwise station...|$|R

In the Variable <b>Sweep</b> <b>Transition</b> Flight Experiment (VSTFE), also a cooperative effort between Langley and Ames/Dryden, basic transition data on an F- 14 wing with variable sweep will be obtained to provide a data base for laminar flow wing design.

40|$|The {{effects of}} leading-edge bluntness and <b>sweep</b> on boundary-layer <b>transition</b> on flat plate models were {{investigated}} at Mach numbers of 2. 00, 2. 50, 3. 00, and 4. 00. The effect of <b>sweep</b> on <b>transition</b> was also determined {{on a flat}} plate model equipped with an elliptical nose at a Mach number of 0. 27. Models used for the supersonic investigation had leading-edge radii varying from 0. 0005 to 0. 040 inch. The free-stream unit Reynolds number was held constant at 15 million per foot for the supersonic tests and the angle of attack was 0 deg. Surface flow conditions were determined by visual observation and recorded photographically. The sublimation technique was used to indicate transition, and the fluorescent-oil technique was used to indicate flow separation. Measured Mach number and <b>sweep</b> effects on <b>transition</b> are compared with those predicted from shock-loss considerations as described in NACA Rep. 1312. For the models with the blunter leading edges, the transition Reynolds number (based on free-stream flow conditions) was approximately doubled {{by an increase in}} Mach number from 2. 50 to 4. 00; and nearly the same result was predicted from shock-loss considerations. At all super- sonic Mach numbers, increases in <b>sweep</b> reduced the <b>transition</b> Reynolds number and the amount of reduction increased with increases in bluntness. The shock-loss method considerably underestimated- the sweep effects, possibly because of the existence of crossflow instability associated with swept wings. At a Mach number of 0. 27, no reduction in the transition Reynolds number with sweep was measured (as would be expected with no shock loss) until the sweep angle was attained where crossflow instability appeared...|$|R

For this experiment, full-span upper-surface gloves will be fitted to a variable sweep F- 14 aircraft. The results of two initial tasks are documented: a parametric pressure distribution/boundary-layer stability study and the design of an upper-surface glove for Mach 0. 8. The first task was conducted to provide a data base from which wing-glove pressure distributions could be selected for glove designs. Boundary-layer stability analyses were conducted {{on a set of}} pressure distributions for various wing sweep angles, Mach numbers, and Reynolds number in the range of those anticipated for the flight-test program. The design procedure for the Mach 0. 8 glove is described, and boundary-layer stability calculations and pressure distributions are presented both at design and off-design conditions.

40|$|Two {{research}} programs are described which directly {{relate to the}} application of natural laminar flow (NLF) technology to transonic transport-type wind planforms. Each involved using state-of-the-art computational methods to design three-dimensional wing contours which generate significant runs of favorable pressure gradients. The first program supported the Variable <b>Sweep</b> <b>Transition</b> Flight Experiment and involves design of a full-span glove which extends from the leading edge to the spoiler hinge line on the upper surface of an F- 14 outer wing panel. Boundary-layer and static-pressure data will be measured on this design during the supporting wind-tunnel and flight tests. These data will then be analyzed and used to infer the relationship between crossflow and Tollmein-Schlichting disturbances on laminar boundary-layer transition. A wing was designed computationally for a corporate transport aircraft in the second program. The resulting wing design generated favorable pressure gradients from the leading edge aft to the mid-chord on both upper and lower surfaces at the cruise design point. Detailed descriptions of the computational design approach are presented along with the various constraints imposed {{on each of the}} designs. Wing surface pressure distributions, which support the design objective and were derived from transonic three-dimensional analyses codes, are also presented.

The main objective of the VSTFE {{was to determine the}} effects of wing sweep on boundary layer transition at conditions representative of transport aircraft. The experiment included the flight testing of two laminar flow wing gloves. Glove 1 was a cleanup of the existing F- 14 A wing. Glove 2, not discussed herein, was designed to provide favorable pressure distributions for natural laminar flow at Mach number (M) 0. 700. The transition locations presented for glove 1 were determined primarily by using hot film sensors. Boundary layer rake data was provided as a supplement. Transition data were obtained for leading edge wing sweeps of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degs, with Mach numbers ranging from 0. 700 to 0. 825, and altitudes ranging from 10, 000 to 35, 000 ft. Results show that a substantial amount of laminar flow was maintained at all the wing sweeps evaluated.

40|$|We analyze {{nonlinear}} magneto-optical rotation (NMOR) in rubidium vapor {{subjected to}} continuously-scanned magnetic field. By varying magnetic-field <b>sweep</b> rate, a <b>transition</b> from traditionally-observed dispersive-like NMOR signals (low sweep rate) to oscillating signals (higher sweep rates) is demonstrated.

TBPS exhibits an adsorption behavior typically observed for dialkyl sulfides including intact adsorption and low coverage phases with molecules predominantly lying flat on the surface.

30|$|For the {{necessity}} of plenty of DC and pulse measurement, stable valence change mechanism (VCM) devices with Ti/HfO 2 /Pt structure [5 - 12] is made use of in this work. In the DC positive voltage <b>sweep</b> the SET <b>transition</b> is abrupt, but it becomes gradual under current sweep. The RESET process is gradual in negative voltage sweep. So SET and RESET are current and voltage controlled, respectively. Combining positive current sweep SET and corresponding negative voltage sweep RESET operation, stable and uniform distributions of on-state and off-state resistance can be obtained. Gaining inspiration from the DC SET/RESET characteristics, we proposed a novel pulse operation scheme, i.e. the width and height of the pulse series are adjusted to control the SET and RESET process, respectively. Our new method {{is different from the}} traditional pulse operation with single constant program/erase pulse.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Ames 12 -Foot Low-Turbulence Pressure Tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of sweep on the boundary-layer stability characteristics of an untapered variable-sweep wing having an NACA 64 (2) A 015 section normal to the leading edge. Pressure distribution and transition were measured on the wing at low speeds at sweep angles of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 deg. and at angles of attack from - 3 to 3 deg. The investigation also included flow-visualization studies on the surface at sweep angles from 0 to 50 deg. and total pressure surveys in the boundary layer at a sweep angle of 30 deg. for angles of attack from - 12 to 0 deg. It was found that <b>sweep</b> caused premature <b>transition</b> on the wing under certain conditions. This effect resulted from the formation of vortices in the boundary layer when a critical combination of sweep angle, pressure gradient, and stream Reynolds number was attained. A useful parameter in indicating the combined effect of these flow variables on vortex formation and on beginning transition is the crossflow Reynolds number. The critical values of crossflow Reynolds number for vortex formation found in this investigation range from about 135 to 190 and are in good agreement with those reported in previous investigations. The values of crossflow Reynolds number for beginning transitions were found to be between 190 and 260. For each condition (i. e., development of vortices and initiation of transition at a given location) the lower values in the specified ranges were obtained with a light coating of flow-visualization material on the surface. A method is presented for the rapid computation of crossflow Reynolds number on any swept surface for which the pressure distribution is known. From calculations based on this method, it was found that the maximum values of crossflow Reynolds number are attained under conditions of a strong pressure gradient and at a sweep angle of about 50 deg. Due to the primary dependence on pressure gradient, effects of sweep in causing premature transition are generally first encountered on the lower surfaces of wings operating at positive angles of attack...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work, a new bio-based polyurethane (PU) based on castor oil was synthesized as host polymer in electrolytes for application in {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC). In {{the first stage of}} this work, castor oil based polyol was synthesized via transesterification reaction under nitrogen gas atmosphere at room temperature. The polyol possessed acid value of 3. 0 mg KOH g− 1, hydroxyl value of 190 mg KOH g− 1 and molecular weight of 2786 g mol− 1, characteristics suitable for producing flexible PU. The polyol was reacted with 4, 4 ’-diphenylmethane diisocyanate at room temperature in appropriate ratios to form flexible PU. The formation of urethane linkage was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared analysis by the disappearance of NCO peak and appearance of amine (secondary), carbonyl and ether group in PU chain. For the preparation of PU polymer electrolytes, the PU was added with sodium iodide (NaI) and lithium iodide (LiI) salts in different weight percentages to form PU-LiI and PU-NaI systems respectively. 3 -propyl- 1 -methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) ionic liquid was added to the highest conducting sample of PU-NaI and PU-LiI systems to enhance the conductivity as well as the efficiency of DSSC. The characteristics of polymer electrolytes were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, transference number measurement and linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry. Glass <b>transition</b> temperature of – 15. 8 °C of PU decreased upon addition of salts. The lowest glass transition temperature of PU-NaI system was – 26. 2 °C and PU-LiI system was – 27. 3 °C. The highest conductivity achieved for the systems were 4. 28 × 10 − 7 S cm− 1 and 1. 41 × 10 − 6 S cm− 1, respectively. The inclusion of PMII ionic liquid to the PU-NaI and PU-LiI enhanced the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes by one order of magnitude and also lowered the Tg value to – 33. 0 °C. Ionic liquid is believed to act as plasticizer to soften the polymer backbone iv therefore increase the polymer segmental motion to ease ions migration which in turn increased the ionic conductivity. The conductivity for all PU electrolyte films increased with increase of temperature and follow the Arrhenius behaviour for PU-NaI, PU-LiI and PU-NaI-PMII systems, and Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher behaviour for PU-LiI-PMII. The calculation of activation energy, Ea from the gradient of Arrhenius and Vogel-Tamman- Fulcher plots showed that the trend of conductivity was consistent with the trend of Ea, i. e: the higher conducting sample possessed lower activation energy. The addition of ionic liquid to the PU-salt also enhanced electrochemical stability window of the polymer electrolytes. The electrochemical stability windows were 2. 0 V.
