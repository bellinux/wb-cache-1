40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} tenets of oncology is that tumors arise from stem cells. In the colon, stem cells are thought to reside {{at the base of}} <b>crypts.</b> In the early stages of tumorigenesis, however, dysplastic cells are routinely found at the luminal surface of the <b>crypts</b> whereas the cells at the bases of these same <b>crypts</b> appear morphologically normal. To understand this discrepancy, we evaluated the molecular characteristics of cells isolated from the bases and orifices of the same <b>crypts</b> in small colorectal adenomas. We found that the dysplastic cells at the tops of the <b>crypts</b> often exhibited genetic alterations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and neoplasia-associated patterns of gene expression. In contrast, cells located at the base of these same <b>crypts</b> did not contain such alterations and were not clonally related to the contiguous transformed cells above them. These results imply that development of adenomatous polyps proceeds through a top-down mechanism. Genetically altered cells in the superficial portions of the mucosae spread laterally and downward to form new <b>crypts</b> that first connect to preexisting normal <b>crypts</b> and eventually replace them...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A {{program of}} {{research}} was established {{on the question}} whether melatonin played a chemopreventive {{role in the development}} of foci of aberrant <b>crypts</b> in the intestinal tract of male rats. Male F 344 rats were injected i. p. with an aqueous solution of 15 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) on day 50 and day 57, and a group was also injected i. p with 0. 5 mg melatonin in 0. 5 ml of 10 % ethanol solution 5 times per week beginning at age 47 days. Foci and multiplicity of aberrant <b>crypts</b> were deter-mined after 8 weeks. These groups of animals were kept in light daily from 4 : 30 to 16 : 30. Results: In the group receiving AOM and the melatonin injections, there were fewer foci of aber-rant <b>crypts</b> in the colon and the average number of <b>crypts</b> was lower after 8 weeks, compared to the group on AOM alone. Conclusions: Melatonin inhibited the formation of foci of aberrant <b>crypts</b> in the descending colon of rats. Also, it reduced the number of aberrant <b>crypts</b> per focus from foci with 3 and more aberrant <b>crypts.</b> Key words: melatonin, foci of aberrant <b>crypts</b> in the colon, rats, inhibitio...|$|R
5000|$|In humans, {{the percent}} of colonic <b>crypts</b> {{deficient}} for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age. [...] On average, {{the percent of}} colonic <b>crypts</b> deficient for CCOI reaches 18% in women and 23% in men by 80-84 years of age. [...] Colonic tumors often arise {{in a field of}} <b>crypts</b> containing a large cluster (as many as 410) of CCOI-deﬁcient <b>crypts.</b> In colonic cancers, up to 80% of tumor cells can be deficient in CCOI.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the human}} colonic <b>crypts</b> in the images have high {{expression}} of the brown-orange stained CCOI. However, {{in some of the}} colonic <b>crypts</b> all of the cells lack CCOI and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei at the outer walls of the <b>crypts.</b> Greaves et al. showed that deficiencies of CCOI in colonic <b>crypts</b> are due to mutations in the CCOI gene. As seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three <b>crypts</b> appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross-cut area.|$|R
5|$|Inside {{the walls}} the tower {{included}} a <b>crypt</b> chapel, {{which may be}} the site of a previous church. The <b>crypt</b> chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests. At an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E

A stone slab was removed exposing steps leading to a <b>crypt</b> under the chancel. This contained six coffins, four of which contained the bodies of the first and second LordsStanley and their wives. Once the details had been recorded, the <b>crypt</b> was resealed.|$|E

Per the pre-match stipulation, Paul Bearer would be {{cemented}} in a glass <b>crypt</b> if Undertaker lost. Throughout {{the duration of the}} match, Bearer was locked on a chair inside a glass <b>crypt</b> with the pump of cement truck above him. After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys, Undertaker pinned D-Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win. After the match, Undertaker pulled the lever to the cement truck, which in turn filled the <b>crypt</b> with Bearer inside full of cement.|$|E
5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the <b>crypt</b> (known today as <b>Crypt</b> of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the <b>crypt,</b> the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture. In the <b>crypt</b> the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E

In addition, apparent discrepancies noted with regard to the prevalence of <b>crypts</b> in these other populations may also simply be due to dif-ferences in the definitions used to describe <b>crypts</b> 2, 3 …suggesting the need for guidelines to provide expert consensus with respect to nomenclature...|$|R

5|$|While in {{most cases}} a Norman church entirely {{replaced}} a Saxon one, at Ripon the cathedral uniquely retains its early Saxon <b>crypt,</b> while a similar <b>crypt</b> also survives below the former cathedral of Hexham. At Winchester the excavated foundations of the 10th-century cathedral – when built, the largest church in northern Europe – are marked on grass of the cathedral close. At Worcester, a new cathedral {{was built in the}} Norman style from 1084, but the <b>crypt</b> contains re-used stonework and columns from its two Saxon predecessor churches. Elsewhere, the abbey church of Sherborne preserves much masonry from the former Saxon cathedral, in the west front, transepts and crossing, so that the nave and crossing of present late medieval abbey retains the proportions of the previous Saxon structure.|$|E

The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the <b>crypt</b> and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples.

40|$|Studies of {{the cell}} {{kinetics}} of the colonic <b>crypts</b> could explain the morphogenesis of colonic adenomas and results suggest that a derangement of the proliferative zone of the colonic <b>crypts</b> takes place before adenoma development. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether this is the case or not. The labelling distribution and labelling index (LI) of the colonic <b>crypts</b> was examined with ex vivo autoradiography. Eight patients with intestinal neoplasms, three with familial polyposis coli, four with ordinary colon cancer, and one with two colonic adenomas. Similar labelling distributions and absent upward shift of the active proliferative zone in <b>crypts</b> were observed in patients with familial polyposis and in those with non-polyposis cancer, or adenomas.
