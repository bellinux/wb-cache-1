5|$|The Vobster Breach {{colliery}} had {{a unique}} system of long <b>coking</b> ovens which, {{along with the}} other buildings, have been designated as a Scheduled monument. The boiler chimney of Oxley's Colliery near Buckland Dinham which operated for a few years in the 1880s is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Broom Pit was {{the deepest}} at , and longest-lasting of the Middleton collieries. In 1896 the Middleton Broom, Little and Middleton Main Pits, all managed by John Neal, {{employed}} over 600 workers. By 1923 just the Broom Pit was working, employing more than 1,000 men and supplying <b>coking,</b> gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks. Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940. At {{the time the}} collieries were nationalised in 1947, the workforce had reduced to 436. Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, <b>coking</b> coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the <b>coking</b> coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new <b>coking</b> coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the <b>coking</b> elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially <b>coking</b> coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E
25|$|Fishburn <b>coking</b> {{plant was}} built in 1954 {{alongside}} the colliery to produce high grade coke for industry and a coke for the domestic market called Sunbrite {{as well as other}} byproducts from the <b>coking</b> process such as town gas which was supplied directly to the nearby Winterton Hospital and to the national grid.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of the steel {{industry}} in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of <b>coking</b> coal.|$|E
25|$|Line 7, an east-west line running {{parallel}} and to {{the south}} of Line 1 and Batong Line, from Beijing West Railway Station to Jiaohuachang (<b>Coking</b> Plant).|$|E
25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from <b>coking</b> coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from <b>coking</b> coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make steel.|$|E
25|$|Water {{quality was}} also {{affected}} by four <b>coking</b> plants, at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and Coalite. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue <b>coking</b> plant were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The <b>coking</b> plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} specific analytical methods {{designed to measure}} the particular {{physical and chemical properties}} of coals. These methods are used primarily to determine the suitability of coal for <b>coking,</b> power generation or for iron ore smelting in the manufacture of steel.|$|E
25|$|Russia's {{antitrust}} body, the Federal Antimonopoly Service, {{claimed that}} Evraz Holding, owned {{in part by}} Abramovich, had breached Russian competition law by offering unfavorable terms for contractors and discriminating against domestic consumers for <b>coking</b> coal, a key material used in steel production.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s {{the water}} quality {{deteriorated}} rapidly, {{as a result of}} coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from <b>coking</b> plants, from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of industrial effluent before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main <b>coking</b> plants has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled restocking with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996 there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.|$|E
25|$|The northernmost {{extent of}} the South Yorkshire Coalfield is marked by the change of its richest and highest grade coal seam, the Barnsley Seam or Bed, to a thin seam of {{inferior}} coal which occurs {{to the north of}} Barnsley. The southern limit was marked by the Barnsley Bed losing its <b>coking</b> qualities.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{is present}} in <b>coking</b> {{wastewater}} streams, as a liquid by-product of the production of coke from coal. In some cases, the ammonia is discharged to the marine environment where it acts as a pollutant. The Whyalla steelworks in South Australia {{is one example of}} a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium sulfate, an {{important}} nitrogen fertilizer, is most commonly produced as a byproduct from <b>coking</b> plants supplying the {{iron and steel}} making plants. Reacting the ammonia produced in the thermal decomposition of coal with waste sulfuric acid allows the ammonia to be crystallized out as a salt (often brown because of iron contamination) and sold into the agro-chemicals industry.|$|E
25|$|Hot blast allowed blast {{furnaces}} to use anthracite or lower grade coal. Anthracite {{was difficult to}} light with cold blast. High quality metallurgical <b>coking</b> coal deposits of sufficient size for iron making were only available in Great Britain and western Germany in the 19th century, but with less fuel required per unit of iron, {{it was possible to}} use lower grade coal.|$|E
25|$|The Black Country is {{a region}} of the West Midlands in England, west of Birmingham, and {{commonly}} refers to {{all or part of}} the four Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. During the Industrial Revolution, it became one of the most industrialised parts of Britain with coal mines, <b>coking,</b> iron foundries, glass factories, brickworks and steel mills producing a high level of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|The 'Battle of Orgreave' {{took place}} on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave <b>Coking</b> Plant near Rotherham, which {{striking}} miners were attempting to blockade. The confrontation, between about 5,000 miners and {{the same number of}} police, broke into violence after police on horseback charged with truncheons drawn – 51 pickets and 72 policemen were injured. Other less well known, but bloody, battles between pickets and police took place, for example, in Maltby, South Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|Angered by the council's {{continuing}} {{demands for}} improvements, Miller declared {{he would not}} seek additional economic concessions from the employers but only non-economic improvements. National stockpiles of coal were somewhat high, so a winter-time heating crisis never emerged. However, the ongoing effects of the 1973 oil crisis had greatly enhanced the demand for coal, and steel and iron makers had few <b>coking</b> supplies on-hand. These factors kept the union's negotiating position strong despite the two contract rejections.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{amounts of}} {{pyridine}} are released into environment from some industrial {{processes such as}} steel manufacture, processing of oil shale, coal gasification, <b>coking</b> plants and incinerators. The atmosphere at oil shale processing plants can contain pyridine concentrations of up to 13µg·m−3, and 53µg·m−3 levels were measured in the groundwater {{in the vicinity of}} a coal gasification plant. According {{to a study by the}} US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, about 43,000 Americans work in contact with pyridine.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its brittleness, and on the handling, crushing and milling it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and <b>coking</b> ovens at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary to know these data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|E
25|$|The coke must {{be strong}} enough to resist the weight of {{overburden}} in the blast furnace, which is why <b>coking</b> coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is direct reduced iron, where any carbonaceous fuel {{can be used to make}} sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including coal tar, ammonia, light oils, and coal gas.|$|E
25|$|Coal railway {{lines were}} closed and {{numerous}} mine sites flooded. According to an analysist at Macquarie Group almost all the available stockpiles of <b>coking</b> coal in Queensland were exhausted in late January 2011 due to reduced rail capacity. About 15% of the state's annual output of coal production was lost and by late March 2011 recovery was progressing slowly. Four months after the floods the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal was operating at half its capacity as the open-cut mines in the region continued to deal with de-watering issues.|$|E
25|$|Cycloalkanes {{reported}} as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H2), which means this process requires high temperature. Dehydrogenation of decalin {{is the most}} thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second {{because of the presence}} of the methyl group. Research on catalyst development for dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes has been carried out for decades. Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo) and Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are highly investigated for dehydrogenation. However, <b>coking</b> is still a big challenge for catalyst’s long-term stability.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, interest in vegetable oils as fuels for internal combustion engines was reported in several countries during the 1920s and 1930s and later during World War II. Belgium, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Japan and China were reported to have tested and used vegetable oils as diesel fuels during this time. Some operational problems were reported due to the high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which results in poor atomization of the fuel in the fuel spray and often leads to deposits and <b>coking</b> of the injectors, combustion chamber and valves. Attempts to overcome these problems included heating of the vegetable oil, blending it with petroleum-derived diesel fuel or ethanol, pyrolysis and cracking of the oils.|$|E
25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, fluid catalytic cracking was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke, and more sophisticated forms of thermal cracking have been developed for various purposes. These include visbreaking, steam cracking, and <b>coking.</b>|$|E
25|$|In catalysis, the {{reaction}} does not proceed directly, but through reaction {{with a third}} substance known as catalyst. Although the catalyst takes part in {{the reaction}}, it is returned to its original state {{by the end of}} the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include <b>coking</b> where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.|$|E
500|$|Bell Brothers was {{recorded}} in the Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory of 1923 as having an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal for <b>coking</b> and manufacturing. Sir Hugh Bell was chairman and managing director; Arthur Dorman and Charles Dorman were directors. That same year, Bell Brothers, described in the Sydney Morning Herald as [...] "owners of coal and ironstone mines and blast furnaces and rolling mills", was finally merged completely with Dorman Long. Sir Arthur Dorman was chairman; both Hugh Bell and his son Maurice Bell were among the directors. When Arthur Dorman died in 1931, Hugh Bell, aged 87, briefly became chairman of 'Dorman versus Bell'; he died on 29 June 1931.|$|E
500|$|The first Allied {{bombardment}} of a Japanese coastal town {{was conducted on}} 14 July {{in conjunction with the}} air attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu. A bombardment group commanded by Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth designated Task Unit 34.8.1 (TU34.8.1) was detached from TF38 to attack the iron works at Kamaishi in northern Honshu. At the time the city had a population of 40,000 and the iron works was among the largest in Japan. However, due to shortages of <b>coking</b> coal and other raw materials, the iron works was running at less than half its capacity. TU34.8.1 comprised the battleships , [...] and [...] as well as the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] and nine destroyers. Allied prisoners of war had been assigned to work at the Nippon Steel Company, and were housed in two camps in Kamaishi.|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the <b>coking</b> of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Coking</b> coal {{should be}} low in ash, sulfur, and phosphorus, {{so that these}} do not migrate to the metal. Based on the ash percentage, the <b>coking</b> coal {{can be divided into}} various grades. These grades are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, seven Chinese {{coal mining}} {{companies}} produced 100 million metric tonnes of coal or more. These companies were Shenhua Group, China Coal Group, Shaanxi Coal and Chemical Industry, Shanxi <b>Coking</b> Coal Group, Datong Coal Mine Group, Jizhong Energy, and Shandong Energy.
