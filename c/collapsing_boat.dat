50|$|After {{tutoring}} Nero, Anicetus {{was made}} {{commander of the}} fleet at Misenum in 60 AD. He was later employed by the emperor to murder Nero's own mother, Agrippina the Younger. Nero wished to see his mother crushed in a <b>collapsing</b> <b>boat,</b> and employed Anicetus {{to see to it}} that this contraption was built. Nero put this strategy into action, though the <b>collapsing</b> <b>boat</b> failed to kill Agrippina. Afterwards, Anicetus himself stabbed Agrippina to death, on orders from Nero.|$|E

50|$|According {{to press}} reports, torrential rain {{occurred}} near Shantou, where Kit moved ashore. Eight {{people were killed}} and over one hundred were injured. About 74,000 ha of farmland were inundated. More than 24,000 houses were damaged and 759 houses <b>collapsed.</b> Forty <b>boats,</b> one bridge, and several river embankments were also damaged. The total damage in the area was estimated at a little over $35.1 million USD. In Fujian Province, heavy rain due to the remnants of Kit and Mamie resulted in nine lives lost, with an addition 51,000 losing their homes. About 26,000 ha of farmland were inundated and over 1,200 houses were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|On 2 April 1898 a cyclone was {{described}} as causing more damage at Cossack than had ever been experienced before. Tramway, rails, road and bridges were destroyed and telegraph line downed. Houses <b>collapsed</b> and all <b>boats</b> slipped their moorings. The damage was estimated at over 30000 pounds. Whim Creek registered 747 mm of rain in 24 hours, the highest daily rainfall ever recorded in Western Australia.|$|R
25|$|Most recently, Bertness {{and colleagues}} (Bertness et al. 2014b) {{performed}} a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing {{border of the}} marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of Sesarma crabs {{and the intensity of}} herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant <b>collapse,</b> 2) <b>boat</b> wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a) This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.|$|R
60|$|For {{two hours}} more, inch by inch, they fought their {{way along the}} edge of the foaming rocks, until Kit feared he had made a mistake. And then, when on the verge of himself turning back, they came abreast of a narrow opening, not twenty feet wide, which led into a land-locked {{enclosure}} where the fiercest gusts scarcely flawed the surface. It was the haven gained by the boats of previous days. They landed on a shelving beach, and the two employers lay in <b>collapse</b> in the <b>boat,</b> while Kit and Shorty pitched the tent, built a fire, and started the cooking.|$|R
2500|$|The first unit {{to cross}} about a [...] {{from the river}} mouth was a company of the 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), of the 156th Brigade. Several of the flimsy <b>boats</b> <b>collapsed,</b> and the men were forced to wade across the chest deep river. Once across they {{established}} a bridgehead on the Ottoman bank of the river. When they were secure the engineers started building a pontoon bridge, for the main force to cross. By 23:00 almost three of the division's battalions had crossed the river. The 8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and the 4th Battalion, Royal Scots, from the 156th Brigade and the 7th Battalion Highland Light Infantry from the 157th Brigade.|$|R
5000|$|In this short, Mickey Mouse and {{his friends}} Donald Duck and Goofy attempt to build a boat (which they name Queen Minnie), which is made from {{fold-out}} parts (the instructions simply say [...] "All You Do Is Put It Together" [...] and [...] "Even A Child Can Do It"), though they encounter problems of their own as they go (e.g. Donald paints the rudder which keeps being turned by Mickey, and Goofy thinks the figurehead is an actual woman). Their maiden voyage {{turns out to be}} their last, as the <b>boat</b> <b>collapses</b> as it sets sail, thanks to Minnie Mouse hitting the champagne bottle (to christen the boat) just too hard on the boat.|$|R
25|$|The River Ant was navigable to Dilham {{prior to}} 1810, when {{consideration}} {{was given to}} extending navigation northwards along {{the course of the}} river. Plans were drawn up by William Youard and John Millington in 1811 {{and it was one of}} Millington's two plan that formed the basis of a bill presented to Parliament in early 1812. It was opposed by the inhabitants of Worstead and Dilham, who feared that their businesses would <b>collapse</b> if <b>boats</b> could reach North Walsham, but the navigation was nevertheless authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 5 May 1812, which created the Company of Proprietors of the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Navigation. They had powers to raise £30,000 by the issuing of shares, and a further £10,000 if required, either from shares or by mortgage. Work on the construction of the canal did not start until 1825, with some of the delays caused by a claim for damages made by Issac Harris Lewis, who owned his own staithe at Dilham and felt that the new canal would damage his trade. His case was heard in April 1825 and he was awarded £1,500 in compensation. Work began in the same month, employing 100 men from Bedfordshire.|$|R
40|$|Salt marsh die-off is a Western Atlantic {{conservation}} {{problem that}} has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. It has been hypothesized to be driven by: 1) eutrophication decreasing plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant <b>collapse,</b> 2) <b>boat</b> wakes eroding creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affecting plant health, 4) substrate hardness controlling herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releasing herbivorous crabs from predator control. To distinguish between these hypotheses we quantified these variables at 14 Narragansett Bay salt marshes where die-off intensity ranged from < 5 % to nearly 98 %. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. Herbivory explained 73 % of inter-site variation in die-off and predator control of herbivores and substrate hardness also varied significantly with die-off. This suggests that salt marsh die-off is being largely driven by intense herbivory via the release of herbivorous crabs from predator control. Our results and those from other marsh systems suggest that consumer control may not simply be a factor to consider in marsh conservation, but with widespread predator depletion impacting near shore habitats globally, trophic dysfunction and runaway consumption may be {{the largest and most}} urgent management challenge for salt marsh conservation...|$|R

50|$|Originally Taylor {{tested the}} boat on Walker Lake in Nevada but his backers demanded a more {{accessible}} location, so Taylor switched to Lake Tahoe. An attempt {{was set for}} 13 November 1980, but when conditions on the lake proved unfavourable, Taylor decided against trying for the record. Not wanting to disappoint the assembled spectators and media, he decided to do a test run instead. At 432 km/h (270 mph) Discovery II started to become unstable. It has been speculated {{that it may have}} hit a swell. Whatever the cause, the boat's unstable lateral oscillations caused the left float to <b>collapse,</b> sending the <b>boat</b> plunging into the water. The cockpit section with Taylor's body was recovered three days later. The cockpit had not floated as intended and Taylor drowned as a result.|$|R
5000|$|Against Australia II, {{a genuine}} ‘break-through’ design, Liberty won three races and arguably {{should have won}} the series but for two events. Firstly, {{just prior to the}} crucial fifth race, when Liberty was leading Australia II by 3-1 and needed only one more race to win the cup, the US boat broke its jumper struts close {{to the top of the}} mast. Although repairs were made, they weren’t totally {{effective}} and on the first leg of the race, the port jumper strut again <b>collapsed</b> disadvantaging the <b>boat.</b> Australia II went on to win the fifth race by 1:47 secs. [...] Secondly, Liberty was 57 seconds ahead at the start of the fifth leg on the final race. Conner’s tactical mistake of not covering Australia II on the final downwind run allowed Australia II to overtake the US boat and eventually win the race and the America’s Cup.|$|R
5000|$|The umpire, John Garrett, {{decided to}} restart the race from {{the eastern end of}} Chiswick Eyot. Shortly after the restart the boats clashed and the oar of Oxford crewman Hanno Wienhausen was broken. Garrett judged the clash to be Oxford's fault and allowed the race to continue. Cambridge quickly took the lead and {{went on to win the}} race. The Oxford crew entered a final appeal to the umpire which was quickly rejected; and Cambridge were {{confirmed}} as winners by [...] lengths. It was the first time since 1849 that a crew had won the boat race without an official recorded winning time. After the end of the race Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods, received emergency treatment after <b>collapsing</b> in the <b>boat</b> from exhaustion. Because of the circumstances, the post-race celebrations by the winning Cambridge crew were unusually muted and the planned award ceremony was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|On April 2, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} high risk for severe weather, {{including}} a 30% risk area for tornadoes across northern Louisiana into far eastern Texas. Strong, long-track tornadoes were expected {{to occur in the}} region. Early that day, an EF1 tornado near Breaux Bridge, Louisiana killed a mother and daughter after destroying their mobile home while they were inside of it. Another EF1 struck Alexandria, causing considerable damage to homes and businesses. Later that afternoon and evening, multiple strong tornadoes touched down in the threat area. Several of these tornadoes were large and wedge shaped, though none exceeded EF2 in intensity. One of these EF2 tornadoes struck Belah and Trout, toppling metal truss towers, snapping many trees and power poles, and <b>collapsing</b> a <b>boat</b> business. Another EF2 struck Aimwell, damaging several homes and a church. An EF2 tornado near Winnsboro tossed trailers and mobile homes, and also destroyed a small home. Several tornadoes continued to touch down across parts of the Southern United States the following day, including an EF1 that killed one person after destroying a mobile home near Whitmire, South Carolina. An EF2 tornado near Cameron snapped many trees and power poles, and destroyed several barns and metal storage buildings. Several businesses in the downtown portion of Gordon, Georgia sustained significant damage {{as a result of an}} EF2 tornado as well. Overall, this outbreak produced 59 tornadoes and three deaths.|$|R
5|$|Fred {{prompted}} a hurricane warning for Cape Verde {{for the first}} time ever and was the first storm to pass through the islands as a hurricane since 1892. Strong winds there left about $2.5million in damage. Two deaths were presumed to have occurred after two fishermen never returned to port. Seven other sailors likely drowned offshore Guinea-Bissau after their fishing <b>boat</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Tropical storms Grace, Henri, and Ida left negligible impact on land. Hurricane Joaquin's intensity and slow movement in the vicinity of the Bahamas resulted in severe damage on some islands. Additionally, the American cargo ship SS El Faro went missing near Crooked Island and eventually capsized during the storm, drowning 33people. Rough seas in Haiti also caused damage and one death from a fisherman drowning. Joaquin was the most intense satellite era tropical cyclone of non-tropical origins. The remnants of Kate affected the British Isles, particularly Wales in the United Kingdom. Throughout the season, these storms collectively caused at least $730.4million in damage and 89deaths.|$|R
