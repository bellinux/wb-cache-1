5000|$|... #Caption: A light {{industrial}} or {{yard track}} switch joint, where the points are joined to the <b>closure</b> <b>rails</b> by bolts through a [...] "joint bar" [...] or [...] "fish plates".|$|R
50|$|Joints {{are used}} where the moving points meet the fixed rails of the switch. They allow the points to hinge easily between their positions. Originally the movable switch blades were {{connected}} to the fixed <b>closure</b> <b>rails</b> with loose joints, but since steel rails are somewhat flexible {{it is possible to}} make this join by thinning a short section of the rail itself. This can be called a heelless switch.|$|R
50|$|As a {{replacement}} for the <b>rail</b> <b>closures</b> the OHE ran bus services instead.|$|R
40|$|Because {{the rail}} joints have gaps, impacts occur when a railway wheel {{encounters}} these discontinuities. In case of railway switches the vertical interaction forces between wheels and rail are amplified by presence of major discontinuities in frog of switch area. These large impact forces may cause damage to wheel, track and vehicle. A modern solution {{to clear up}} this problem is to eliminate the interior rail joints included in railway switches using aluminothermic welding method. In this paper is presented some aspect about the computation of length <b>closure</b> <b>rails</b> {{and the effect of}} weld cooling to ensure a good operating of railway switches after the elimination of interior rail joints...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{safety systems}} {{are needed to}} meet the growing demand of railway operation. In this paper we {{introduce}} general techniques {{for the detection of}} tracks and their components in 3 D laser scanning data. These techniques make use of feature based methods, such as support vector machines, as well as model based methods, such as template matching. The focus of this work are robust and precise detectors for infrastructure elements, such as <b>rails,</b> tracks, <b>closure</b> <b>rails,</b> and frogs. These parts can be used for both, track maintenance and train-borne localization. The approach is evaluated experimentally on 3 D laser scanning data and compared with a reference system. Furthermore, the approach is generic such that it can be used for data of any suitable laser scanning system...|$|R
50|$|The tram {{network that}} {{operated}} in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its operation had a cost 2.4 {{times higher than}} the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shut down the network, despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003. Since the <b>closure,</b> the <b>rails</b> have been dismantled and sold.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the State Government {{announced}} a rationalisation of ticket offices across the CountryLink network, but {{ruled out the}} <b>closure</b> of further <b>rail</b> services in the immediate future. Ticket prices increased on 1 November.|$|R
5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the <b>closure</b> of <b>rail</b> lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.|$|R
50|$|Buses were a main mode of travel, {{along with}} automobiles, {{trackers}} and tongas.But after the <b>closure</b> of Dhanbad-Chandrapura <b>Rail</b> line efforts {{are being made}} to revive buses transport facility. Which is certainly not a good substitute for railways which is the cheapest mode of transportation.|$|R
5000|$|This ban in the {{meantime}} left the motive power duties {{on the line to}} other designs, notably the 0-4-2T's which ran for many years. The [...] "517" [...] class gave way to the [...] "14xx"class which were used for passenger and goods traffic until <b>closure.</b> Steam <b>rail</b> motors ran on the line for a few years but having the same weaknesses here as elsewhere were converted to auto trailers. Towards the end of the line's existence GWR diesel railcars were used to reduce costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} {{the line in the}} Saint Petersburg area is {{difficult}} to follow because various changes were made between 1894 and 1928. Of particular note was the <b>closure</b> of Primorsky <b>Rail</b> Terminal (due to flooding) in 1924 and the re-routing of trains to Finlyandsky Rail Terminal.|$|R
50|$|The {{city has}} been served by Resistencia International Airport since 1965; its terminal, {{completed}} in 1971, was designed by renowned modernist architect Amancio Williams. Its access via highways includes National Route 11 (north to south), National Route 16 (westbound), and the General Belgrano Bridge, which has connected Resistencia to its twin port city of Corrientes since 1973. Following the <b>closure</b> of <b>rail</b> lines in the area during the privatization of the nation's railways in the early 1990s, the city's rail links were re-established {{with the opening of}} the provincially funded Sefecha line in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, a {{landslide}} occurred on a spoil tip {{used by the}} colliery. The landslide displaced and blocked the main railway line (Barnsley to Barnetby, or Doncaster to Thorne Line, formerly the South Yorkshire Railway) north-east of Hatfield and Stainforth railway station. The <b>closure</b> affected <b>rail</b> services between Doncaster and Goole (to Hull) and Scunthorpe (to Cleethorpes). [...] The route is also a major freight line, with around 20% of UK rail freight using the section, and freight services had to be diverted over lines via Brigg and Lincoln.|$|R
5000|$|Ownership of Waterloo International station {{passed to}} BRB (Residuary) Ltd., {{with no clear}} {{plans for the future}} use of the Eurostar platforms. Some reports had {{suggested}} that they might be used for shops, but a parliamentary written answer of 4 June 2008 stated platform 20 was to be used by some South West Trains services from December 2008. At the time of <b>closure,</b> Network <b>Rail</b> had no immediate plans to use the other four former international platforms for domestic use [...] and they were disused from November 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, another cyclone {{devastated the}} town, and Cooktown's {{population}} declined further. With the <b>closure</b> of the <b>rail</b> link to Laura in 1961 and the [...] "Peninsula Development Road" [...] {{opened up to}} the south, the population declined {{to just a few}} hundred people before it gradually began to climb again.|$|R
25|$|There {{was some}} public {{reaction}} against tramway abandonment, but seemingly {{less than the}} similarly unsuccessful reaction against the Beeching <b>Rail</b> <b>closures</b> in the 1960s. Some people, particularly motorists, welcomed the removal of trams, which were perceived as obstructing the highway. Not all passengers transferred to replacement buses, and car ownership continued to increase.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1960 <b>closure,</b> the <b>rail</b> line, land, and all {{equipment}} and rolling stock {{were sold to}} a holding company named the Don Mower Lumber Company (no relation to the former Mower Lumber Company), and the railroad was conveyed to the Midwest Raleigh Corporation, which started to scrap the railroad and equipment. However, a group of local businessmen led by Pennsylvania train aficionado Russell Baum convinced the West Virginia state legislature to make the Cass Railroad a state park. In 1963, the first tourist excursion train left the Cass depot for Whittaker Station (four miles North).|$|R
25|$|The {{rail network}} is {{primarily}} centred {{on the central}} belt and is used principally {{as a means of}} public transport, with some freight movements â€“ for example from the port facilities at Grangemouth and Hunterston Ore Terminal. After a large rationalisation of routes in the 1960s which was undertaken by the Beeching Axe, which led to station and line <b>closures,</b> the <b>rail</b> network is being expanded, to cope with ever-increasing levels of passenger demand. The rail-operator Abellio ScotRail operates most routes within Scotland, with long-distance connections to London operated by East Coast or Virgin Trains. Proposals which have been mooted include the electrification of the rail system to cut journey times.|$|R
50|$|After the quarry's owner Lafarge {{moved to}} road {{transport}} in 1993, {{the line was}} threatened with <b>closure</b> by British <b>Rail</b> (BR), and it {{was taken over by}} a group of enthusiasts. The Weardale Railway currently runs for 18 mi between Bishop Auckland and the site of Eastgate-in-Weardale Station, making the line one of the longest preserved standard gauge heritage railways in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Until 1956 {{the village}} had an active railway station. This was closed {{as part of}} the 1950s <b>rail</b> <b>closure</b> programme, prior to the Beeching Axe. The station is now used as {{commercial}} office premises. The railway line running through the station remains active, {{as part of the}} Ipswich to Lowestoft line, and crosses the main street at an automatic level crossing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of Phase II of a Federal Railroad Administration sponsored study looking at low-cost means to increase speeds through turnouts by retrofit or upgrade. To meet this objective, lead length and frog angle were considered fixed, eliminating the costs to relocate the frog or switch points. Based on extensive research, it was determined in Phase I that the best solution was to optimize the existing AREMA geometry by reducing the switch angle, incorporating a new diverging switch rail, and reshaping both the curved stock and <b>closure</b> <b>rails.</b> Dynamic simulations showed that higher speeds could be achieved over the optimized geometry without increasing peak wheel/rail forces experienced over the traditional geometry. In Phase II the new design was tested by retrofitting an AREMA # 20 crossover on New Jersey Transit. Full testing of the crossover included comparison with a standard AREMA # 20 based on lateral and vertical wheel/rail forces and lateral car body accelerations. From current observations and test results, the new turnout design meets the goal of providing a low-cost means to increase the speeds through existing turnouts. By establishing a superior geometry within the same dimensions as the AREMA standard, railroads {{will be able to make}} the necessary modifications at low cost and without the need of additional space. In addition, this approach, applicable to the large majority of existing turnouts, is expected to result in improved ride quality and decreased wear, leading to a longer service life and decreased maintenance costs...|$|R
50|$|The Met Office {{and other}} weather {{services}} have three colour coded warning levels. Yellow: Be aware. Possible travel delays, or {{the disruption of}} your day-to-day activities. Amber: Be prepared. Could cause road and <b>rail</b> <b>closures,</b> interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. Red: Take action. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. Avoid dangerous areas.|$|R
50|$|The North Coast railway {{line from}} Bobawaba to Townsville opened in 1913 and Home Hill railway station opened {{as part of}} that. It {{provided}} for both passengers and the sale of produce. By the 1970s the improvements to roads and the rising use of motor vehicles saw rail services in the region under threat of reduction or even <b>closure.</b> The <b>rail</b> motor service to Townsville ceased and in 1993 staff numbers at the Home Hill station were reduced. In 2003 the station and its goods shed was closed. However, the trains continue {{to stop at the}} station for passengers to board and disembark but {{under the supervision of the}} train crew rather than station staff.|$|R
40|$|In my {{graduation}} thesis I {{focused on}} curved turnouts as devices which enable the transition between tracks in curves (arc and transtiton curve). This {{is perceived as}} one of the more complexed processes in railway transport. The first part of the thesis covers the theoretical background. It therefore represents the clasification of turnouts, their labeling and components. The calculation of horizontal elements (radius of the turnout track, and lengths changes of <b>closure</b> <b>rails)</b> and altitude profile of the turnout is essential for the design of the turnouts. This is how the speed through the turnout is defined. I have used this knowledge to design the doublel track, which runs in an arc (R = 800 m) and then with the transition curve ends into the station area. Longitudinal slope of the rail is Sâ€° = 2 â€°. The track connection in the arc is composed by right internal curved turnout (KR 1) and right external curved turnout (KR 2). In the end of the transition curve the station track split from the internal rail track. All this enables the right internal parabolic turnout (KR 3). These calculations are all based on the turnout 60 E 1 - 500 - 1 : 12. What is more I also made the calculations for horizontal elements and the altitude profile for the entire turnout area. In the final part of the thesis I drew a ground plan and the altitude profile of the turnout area. All designing work was done accordingly to the Guideline about the railway superstructure (Pravilnik o zgornjem ustroju Å¾elezniÅ¡kih prog, UL RS, Å¡t. 92 / 2010). ...|$|R
50|$|Collarenebri {{is a town}} {{in north}} western New South Wales, Australia. The town in the Walgett Shire local {{government}} area and on the Barwon River approximately 75 km northeast of Walgett and south west of Mungindi on the Gwydir Highway. It is 16 km from Pokataroo which was the nearest railway town prior to <b>closure</b> of the <b>rail</b> service there. The town is 150 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|Amber: Be prepared. There is an {{increased}} likelihood {{of bad weather}} affecting people in the concerned area, which could potentially disrupt people's plans and possibly cause travel delays, road and <b>rail</b> <b>closures,</b> interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. Amber means {{people need to be}} prepared to change plans and protect themselves, their family and community from the impacts of the severe weather based on the forecast from the Met Office.|$|R
50|$|Searching for and {{exploring}} abandoned railways is {{another area of}} railfan interest. Using old maps, one may find the former route, and the abandoned railway stations, tunnels and bridges may remain after a railway <b>closure.</b> Some abandoned <b>rail</b> rights-of-way have been converted to rail-trails for recreational use such as bicycling, walking, hiking, running or jogging. This would be considered railbanking, where the right-of-way is preserved, by keeping it intact, for the potential reactivation of rail service in the future.|$|R
50|$|Work on the {{extension}} of the East London line commenced and the line was closed on 22 December 2007. It reopened on 27 April 2010 when tracks on a new alignment were connected to a disused North London Line viaduct from Shoreditch to Dalston, making Whitechapel part of the London Overground network. Temporary bus services operated during the <b>closure,</b> of which <b>rail</b> replacement route ELW remained in service until the ELL fully opened on 23 May 2010.|$|R
50|$|Traffic levels {{started to}} fall in the 1950s and 1960s with the spread of greater car {{ownership}} in the UK, especially after the Severn Bridge opened in 1966. A further sudden drop occurred between 1968 and 1970 with {{the removal of the}} Taff Vale railway branch line from Cardiff via Penarth {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe. The wholesale <b>closure</b> of rural <b>rail</b> links all over the country accelerated the switch to private car use by holidaymakers.|$|R
5000|$|The Beeching Axe saw two {{significant}} <b>rail</b> <b>closures</b> including the former North British Railway lines to Silloth (closed on 7 September 1964) and Edinburgh via Galashiels (the Waverley Line, closed on 6 January 1969). The closure programme also claimed the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick Railway (the [...] "Port Road") in 1965, {{resulting in a}} significant mileage increase via the Glasgow South Western Line & [...] to reach Stranraer Harbour and thus Northern Ireland.|$|R
2500|$|The General {{election}} in October 1964 returned the Labour Government 1964â€“1970 under Prime Minister Harold Wilson after 13 years of Conservative government. During {{the election campaign}} Labour had promised to halt <b>rail</b> <b>closures</b> if elected, but they quickly backtracked, and later oversaw {{some of the most}} controversial closures. Tom Fraser was appointed Transport Minister, but was replaced by Barbara Castle in December 1965. Castle published a map, Network for Development, in 1967 showing the railway system [...] "stabilised" [...] at around 11,000 route miles (17,700km).|$|R
50|$|Carmarthen {{railway station}} {{is on the}} West Wales Line. It was opened in 1852. Carmarthen town is served by rail links through to Cardiff via Swansea {{to the east and}} Fishguard Harbour, Milford Haven, Tenby, Pembroke and Pembroke Dock to the west. Carmarthen town is served by daily direct {{intercity}} trains to London. Like many rural areas, it suffered a number of <b>rail</b> <b>closures</b> in the 1960s under the Beeching Axe. The line to Llandeilo was closed in 1963 and to Lampeter and Aberystwyth in 1965.|$|R
50|$|Murrow West {{railway station}} was a {{station on the}} Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway in Murrow, Cambridgeshire between Spalding, England, and March. It opened in 1867 and was closed by the British Transport Commission in July 1953 due to low usage. The line itself survived until <b>closure</b> by British <b>Rail</b> in November 1982. The station has mostly been {{demolished}} although the signal box still survives, having {{been converted into a}} private dwelling after the closure of the line and subsequent removal of the track.|$|R

5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its <b>closure.</b> British <b>Rail</b> discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost Â£2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a Â£2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further Â£4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|R
5|$|With the <b>closure</b> of the <b>rail</b> terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's {{main source}} of revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.|$|R
