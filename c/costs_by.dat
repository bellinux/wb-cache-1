40|$|IP-based Wireless Sensor Networks (IP-WSNs) {{are gaining}} {{importance}} for their {{broad range of}} applications in health care, home automation, environmental monitoring, industrial control, vehicle telematics, and agricultural monitoring. In all these applications, a fundamental issue is the mobility in the sensor network, particularly with regards to energy efficiency. Because of the energy inefficiency of network-based mobility management protocols, they can be supported via IP-WSNs. In this paper, we propose a network-based mobility-supported IP-WSN protocol called mSFP, or the mSFP: “Multicasting-supported Inter-Domain Mobility Management Scheme in Sensor-based Fast Proxy Mobile IPv 6 Networks”. Based on [8, 20], we present its network architecture and evaluate its performance by considering the signaling and mobility cost. Our analysis shows that the proposed scheme reduces the signaling cost, total cost, and mobility cost. With respect {{to the number of}} IP-WSN nodes, the proposed scheme reduces the signaling <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 7 % and the total <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 3 %. With respect to the number of hops, the proposed scheme reduces the signaling <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 6. 9 %, the total <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 2. 5 %, and the mobility <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 1. 5 %. With respect to the number of IP-WSN nodes, the proposed scheme reduces the mobility <b>cost</b> <b>by</b> 1. 6 %...|$|R

Some firms lowered <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E

In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group. KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> building a larger combined company. Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.|$|E

Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E

5|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Alta to Oslo were flown non-stop. Conversely, all services to airports in Northern Norway were flown using the smaller Fokker 50. Thus SAS was able to reduce <b>costs</b> <b>by</b> no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead {{increased the number of}} flights. The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo. From 1989 to 1990, the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7,711 to 10,035.|$|E
