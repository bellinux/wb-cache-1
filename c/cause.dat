40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{propose a}} method of redistributing {{ill-defined}} <b>causes</b> of death (IDCD) based on the investigation of such <b>causes.</b> METHODS In 2010, {{an evaluation of the}} results of investigating the <b>causes</b> of death classified as IDCD in accordance with chapter 18 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) by the Mortality Information System was performed. The redistribution coefficients were calculated according to the proportional distribution of ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation in any chapter of the ICD- 10, except for chapter 18, and used to redistribute the ill-defined <b>causes</b> not investigated and remaining by sex and age. The IDCD redistribution coefficient was compared with two usual methods of redistribution: a) Total redistribution coefficient, based on the proportional distribution of all the defined <b>causes</b> originally notified and b) Non-external redistribution coefficient, similar to the previous, but excluding external <b>causes.</b> RESULTS Of the 97, 314 deaths by ill-defined <b>causes</b> reported in 2010, 30. 3 % were investigated, and 65. 5 % of those were reclassified as defined <b>causes</b> after the investigation. Endocrine diseases, mental disorders, and maternal <b>causes</b> had a higher representation among the reclassified ill-defined <b>causes,</b> contrary to infectious diseases, neoplasms, and genitourinary diseases, with higher proportions among the defined <b>causes</b> reported. External <b>causes</b> represented 9. 3 % of the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified. The correction of mortality rates by the total redistribution coefficient and non-external redistribution coefficient increased the magnitude of the rates by a relatively similar factor for most <b>causes,</b> contrary to the IDCD redistribution coefficient that corrected the different <b>causes</b> of death with differentiated weights. CONCLUSIONS The proportional distribution of <b>causes</b> among the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation was not similar to the original distribution of defined <b>causes.</b> Therefore, the redistribution of the remaining ill-defined <b>causes</b> based on the investigation allows for more appropriate estimates of the mortality risk due to specific <b>causes...</b>|$|R

The report presents high-level sentencing outcomes at both the charge and the case level {{for each of the}} reference offences.
