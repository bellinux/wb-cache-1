5|$|On 15 November, the OPCW {{approved}} {{a plan to}} transport Syria's chemical weapons to a location outside its territory by 5 February 2014, where the weapons would then be destroyed. Acceptance of shipments of the 1,000 tons of <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> for destruction have been refused by most countries approached by the OPCW. , Belgium and France were still considering whether to agree to such shipments.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> in the subway.|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> and {{energetics}} are separated. Agent and energetics are chemically {{mixed with}} caustic or water {{to destroy the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> using hydrolysis. The resulting chemical compounds are known as hydrolysates.|$|R
5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> to brainwash Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E
50|$|Aerodynamic {{dissemination}} is the non-explosive {{delivery of}} a <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> from an aircraft, allowing aerodynamic stress to disseminate the agent. This technique is the most recent major development in <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> dissemination, originating in the mid-1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{handheld}} Improved <b>Chemical</b> <b>Agent</b> Monitor (ICAM) is {{a hand-held}} device for monitoring specific <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> (i.e., mustard and nerve gas) contamination on surfaces.

30|$|Three indexes {{are used}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of the chemical flooding sensitivity analysis: the incremental recovery factor, which is the enhanced oil recovery compared with the base water flooding case; the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> efficiency is defined as the enhanced oil per unit <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> (tons incremental oil/tons chemical); the composite index, which is defined as the product of the incremental recovery factor and the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> efficiency. These three indexes will be {{used to evaluate the}} comprehensive effect.|$|R
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{will destroy}} the highest-priority chemicals, which were {{scheduled}} for removal from Syria by 31 December, {{on board the}} MV Cape Ray in international waters of the Mediterranean, using an U.S. Army Field Deployable Hydrolysis System. The United Kingdom gave the United States Â£2.5 million of specialist equipment and training to enable the highest-priority chemicals to be processed more quickly. In addition around 150 tonnes of priority two chemicals, toxic material similar to industrial <b>chemical</b> <b>agents,</b> will be transported to the UK {{with the help of}} the British Royal Navy and destroyed there. The remaining stock of priority two chemicals not going to Britain will be destroyed by commercial companies.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have been exposed to these agents.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of chemical weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet <b>chemical</b> <b>agents,</b> but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.
