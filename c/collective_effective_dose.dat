5000|$|Much {{ionizing}} radiation originates from radioactive materials and space (cosmic rays), {{and as such}} is naturally present in the environment, since most rock and soil has small concentrations of radioactive materials. The radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses; as a result, instruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence. In some cases, it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon its interaction with matter, {{as in the case}} of Cherenkov radiation and radio-luminescence. Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by {{ionizing radiation}} is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based on data from the atomic bombing in Japan and from reactor accident follow-up, such as with the Chernobyl disaster.

Further the aim is to see which signification variations have for the <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> Material and Methods: Local diagnostic reference level (local DRL) from CT-caput and CT-abdomen from 22 hospitals and X-ray institutes in Norway are used and quality assured. A questionnaire gathered data about scan-techniques and doses and various aspects with optimization. Effective dose was estimated for all examinations. Descriptive frequency, correlation and variance analysis were undertaken. Results: The local DRL vary with a factor 3 to 4 for caput and abdomen. Calculated average effective dose shows a small reduction for abdomen compared with an earlier study in Norway (1995). The study shows a reduction in local DRL in 20 % for those who frequently revise their protocols and where the radiograph has postgraduate studies in CT and work in a multidisciplinary (medical physicist, radiograph and radiologist) with optimization. Conclusion: CT laboratories emphasis different the optimization work and a large variation in the use of scan-parameters can be found. This results in variation of doses with CT-caput and CT-abdomen examinations. The work interprets that the dose contribution from CT to <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> can be reduced by 50 % by working with optimization of protocols.

The {{analyses}} of radiation hygienic monitoring conducted in Tula region territories {{affected by the}} Chernobyl NPP accident regarding cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 in the local foodstuffs and the {{analyses of}} populational annual <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> The materials and methods. The survey was conducted in Tula Region since 1997 to 2015. Over that period, more than fifty thousand samples of the main foodstuffs from the post-Chernobyl contaminated area were analyzed. Simultaneously with that, the external gamma - radiation dose rate was measured in the fixed control points. The dynamics of cesium - 137 and strontium- 90 content in foodstuffs were assessed along with the maximum values of the mean annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> to the population and {{the contribution of the}} collective dose from medical exposures into the structure of the annual <b>effective</b> <b>collective</b> <b>dose</b> to the population. The results. The amount of cesium- 137 and strontium - 90 in the local foodstuffs was identified. The external gamma- radiation dose rate values were found to be stable and not exceeding the natural fluctuations range typical for the middle latitudes of Russia’s European territory. The maximum mean annual <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> to the population reflects the stable radiation situation and does not exceed the permissible value of 1 mSv.

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays {{ionizing}} radiation has a considerable contribution in medical diagnostic and treatment. Using {{ionizing radiation}} is increasing rapidly, so biological effects of ionizing radiation {{should be considered}} more. X-rays {{in the range of}} diagnostic radiology have hazardous effects and risks that are defined as random effects. These effects obey the LNT hypothesis that occur at low doses and include many types of cancer and genetic mutations. So {{it is very important to}} assess the risk of exposure in medical examinations. Cancer is one of these hazardous risks caused by low dose ionizing radiation that may occur during life after exposure. According to BEAR 7, low dose radiation is defined as radiation that produces doses near zero up to 100 mSv. Materials and Methods: This work was carried out in eight radiology centers in the Sabzevar county of Iran for 485 patients in eight typical x-ray examinations chosen for the study: chest PA, chest AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP, abdomen AP, skull AP and Lat. In order to estimate the excess cancer risk, we need to obtain <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> caused by radiation in the study population. Usually effective dose offers precise assessment of radiography examination injuries in adult patients. In this study, we used the PCXMC Monte Carlo based software to obtain effective dose and organ dose. This software calculates organ and effective dose following input of patient and radiographic conditions. Results: Average patient weight and height, entrance surface dose, parameters used for each type of examination, and DAP values were entered. Effective dose, <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose,</b> number of radiographs per year and the excess cancer risk arising from these radiographic examinations were then calculated.   Discussion and Conclusion: Excess risk of fatal cancer due to x-ray examinations in the study population was calculated by <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> This risk in the population is about 0. 42 cases suffering fatal cancer per year in this county. If the doses from other diagnostic radiology procedures, in which absorbed dose to patients are considerably higher than conventional radiography, are added to this amount, then the excess risk will be significantly greater than that obtained in this assessment...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{frequency}} of CT procedures has registered {{a significant increase}} over the last decade, which led {{at the international level}} to an increasing concern on the radiological risk {{associated with the use of}} CT especially in paediatrics. This work aimed at investigating the use of computed tomography in Switzerland, following the evolution of CT frequency and dose data over a decade and comparing it to data reported in other countries. METHODS: The frequency and dose data related to CT are obtained by means of a nationwide survey. National frequencies were established by projecting the collected data, using the ratio of the number of CT units belonging to the respondents to the total number of CT units in the country. The effective doses per examination were collected during an auditing campaign. RESULTS: In 2008 about 0. 8 Million CT procedures (~ 100 CT examinations / 1000 population) were performed in the country, leading to a <b>collective</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of more than 6000 man.

With the purpose of maximal idea about stereoscopy of the formed image, and more reliable information about sizes and location of separate details in the investigated object, the task of determination of maximal corner of stereoimaging is resolved. ???????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ???????? ????? ???????????? ??????????. ? ?????????, ?????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????. ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????, ??????? ??? ?? ???? ??????????? ? ???? ???????, ???????? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????. ????? ?????????? ??????? ????????, ?????? ????????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????????? ???????. ? ????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ??????????????? ???????????, ? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ???????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ???? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{computed}} tomography (CT) worldwide {{is continuing to}} increase for both adults and children, posing population health risks due to radiation exposure. These risks are highest for children, reducing with age at exposure. <b>Effective</b> <b>dose</b> is a useful parameter for expressing relative risk and comparing dose. In this study, high sensitivity thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLD) were used to measure organ absorbed doses and to calculate <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> for paediatric CT examinations of the brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis. Formalisms recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) in Publications 60 and 103 were assessed. The <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> computed using ICRP 103 was 22 % lower for a CT brain examination, 16 % higher for a CT chest examination and 4 % lower for a CT abdomen/ pelvis examination {{when compared with the}} <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> computed using ICRP 60. These values were compared with <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> calculated using a dose length product (DLP) conversion method. The DLP derived <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> were within 30 % of the TLD derived <b>effective</b> <b>doses.</b> In summary, the <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> varies depending on the ICRP de?nition used, predominantly due to changes in tissue weighting factors. Furthermore, the DLP conversion method is relatively reliable for approximating <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> and easy to use...|$|R
