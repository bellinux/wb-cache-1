25|$|A stool {{culture can}} detect the bacterium, {{although}} it is not a routine test and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, or the variant <b>cefixime</b> potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC). On SMAC agar O157 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment sorbitol, while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of E. coli appear red. Sorbitol nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as E. coli O157. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using quick E. coli DNA extraction method plus PCR techniques. Newer technologies using fluorescent and antibody detection are also under development.|$|E
25|$|Many {{antibiotics}} {{that were}} once effective including penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance. Resistance to <b>cefixime</b> has reached a level such {{that it is no}} longer recommended as a first-line agent in the United States, and if it is used a person should be tested again after a week to determine whether the infection still persists. Cases of resistance to ceftriaxone have been reported but are still rare, though public health officials are concerned that an emerging pattern of resistance may predict a global epidemic. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral <b>cefixime</b> or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} include diarrhea, dyspepsia, {{nausea and}} vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, urticaria and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Though thrombocytopenia {{has been reported}} for many cephalosporins, {{it has not been}} reported for <b>cefixime.</b> There is no specific antidote for <b>Cefixime</b> overdosage. Gastric lavage may be performed. Dialysis will not remove <b>Cefixime</b> in significant quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefixime</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with known sensitivity or allergies to cephalosporin class of antibiotics. As <b>Cefixime</b> is a third generation cephalosporin, it is not contraindicated for patients with a true penicillin allergy.|$|E

50|$|Where {{resistance}} is uncommon, {{the treatment of}} choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the first choice. <b>Cefixime</b> is a suitable oral alternative.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2008, cefdinir, as Omnicef, was the highest-selling {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic in the United States, {{with more}} than US$585 million in retail sales of its generic versions alone. [...] Cefdinir is structurally similar to <b>cefixime.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cefixime</b> {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} cephalosporin antibiotic and is commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, urinary tract, and upper respiratory tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefixime</b> treats infections of the:Ear: Otitis {{caused by}} Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.Sinuses: Sinusitis.Throat: Tonsillitis, pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.Chest and lungs: Bronchitis, {{pneumonia}} caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.It {{is also used}} to treat typhoid fever.|$|E
50|$|Medications {{that have}} {{traditionally}} been known to lead to SJS, erythema multiforme, and toxic epidermal necrolysis include sulfonamide antibiotics, penicillin antibiotics, <b>cefixime</b> (antibiotic), barbiturates (sedatives), lamotrigine, phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin) (anticonvulsants) and trimethoprim. Combining lamotrigine with sodium valproate {{increases the risk of}} SJS.|$|E
50|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{action of}} <b>Cefixime</b> {{is due to}} the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It binds to one of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefixime</b> is an {{antibiotic}} useful {{to treat a}} number of bacterial infections. This includes otitis media, strep throat, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and Lyme disease. For gonorrhea typically only one dose is required. In the United States it is a second line treatment to ceftriaxone for gonorrhea. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Ceftriaxone and <b>cefixime</b> are third {{generation}} cephalosporins {{and are often}} used as treatments for N. gonorrhoeae infections. [...] The cephalosporins {{are part of a}} larger beta-lactam family of antibiotics. [...] The newly discovered H041 strain of N. gonorrhoeae, originally isolated from a commercial sex worker in Japan, was shown to be resistant to this antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|Many common {{antibiotics}} {{can successfully}} treat P. canis infections in both humans and animals. P. canis has shown sensitivity to ampicillin (penicillin), cefuroxime (second-generation cephalosporin), most third-generation cephalosporins (<b>cefixime,</b> cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone), ciprofloxacin (quinolones), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (sulfonamides), chloramphenicol, most aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. However, the bacterium is also resistant to numerous drugs, such as dicloxacillin (penicillin), some aminoglycosides (spectinomycin and neomycin), vancomycin (glycopeptides), cephalexin and cefadoxil (first-generation cephalosporin), erythromycin (macrolides), and imipenem (carbapenem).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefixime</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is not available as a generic medication in the United States. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.26 to 2.09 USD per dose. In the United States a course of treatment costs about 100 to 200 USD as of 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In {{both the}} acute and chronic forms, {{antibiotics}} are used if an infection is suspected. The {{treatment of choice}} is often azithromycin and <b>cefixime</b> to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia. Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class. [...] Doxycycline {{may be used as}} an alternative to azithromycin. In chronic epididymitis, a four- to six-week course of antibiotics may be prescribed to ensure the complete eradication of any possible bacterial cause, especially the various chlamydiae.|$|E
50|$|Fluoroquinolones were {{a useful}} next-line {{treatment}} until resistance was achieved through efflux pumps and mutations to the gyrA gene, which encodes DNA gyrase. Third-generation cephalosporins {{have been used}} to treat gonorrhoea since 2007, but resistant strains have emerged. As of 2010, the recommended treatment is a single 250 mg intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone, sometimes in combination with azithromycin or doxycycline. However, certain strains of N. gonorrhoeae can be resistant to antibiotics usually that are normally used to treat it. These include: <b>cefixime</b> (an oral cephalosporin), ceftriaxone (an injectable cephalosporin), azithromycin, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of third generation cephalosporins have the aminothiazole group at position C-7. Different groups are {{found at the}} 7-α-position like 7-α-iminohydroxy and 7-α-iminomethoxy. Ceftibuten however possesses a 7-α-ethylidene group. This group gives ceftibuten higher resistance to enhanced spectrum β-lactamases. Many of the oral third generation cephalosporins are esters of parenteral forms and are hydrolysed by esterases in the digestive tract (Cefteram-pivoxil). Some of the third generation drugs can be absorbed orally without the need of esterification. This is for example done with <b>Cefixime</b> and Cefdinir by putting a vinyl group in the C-3 position.|$|E

50|$|During {{the course}} of {{antibiotic}} treatment, serial {{white blood cell count}} and temperature are closely monitored. Typically, the intravenous antibiotics are continued until the patient is afebrile for at least 24 to 48 hours, then equivalent oral antibiotic agents can be given for a total of 2 - week duration of treatment. Intravenous fluids may be administered to compensate for the reduced oral intake, insensible losses (due to the raised temperature) and vasodilation and to optimize urine output. Percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement may be indicated to relieve obstruction caused by a stone. Children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (<b>cefixime,</b> ceftibuten and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy. If intravenous therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective.|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{studies in}} dogs have {{indicated}} that antacids significantly decrease the oral bioavailability of <b>cefixime.</b> Twelve healthy adult male volunteers participated in a randomized, four-way crossover trial to evaluate the influence of an aluminum-magnesium antacid (Maalox; 20 ml) on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefixime</b> (400 mg). Regimens were (i) <b>cefixime</b> alone; (ii) <b>cefixime</b> simultaneous with antacid; (iii) <b>cefixime</b> 2 h before antacid; and (iv) <b>cefixime</b> 2 h after antacid. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over a 24 -h period following each dose of <b>cefixime.</b> There was a 1 -week washout interval between regimens. <b>Cefixime</b> concentrations in serum and urine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Maximum <b>cefixime</b> concentrations in serum for regimens i through iv were (mean +/- standard deviation) 4. 9 +/- 1. 4, 5. 7 +/- 1. 3, 5. 1 +/- 1. 0, and 5. 5 +/- 1. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Corresponding values for area under the serum concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity were 38. 3 +/- 14. 5, 42. 8 +/- 13. 9, 38. 5 +/- 9. 8, and 41. 6 +/- 16. 7 micrograms. h/ml. There was a trend toward increased concentrations in serum and area under the curve of <b>cefixime</b> when it was administered concomitantly with antacid; however, these differences {{were not statistically significant}} (P greater than 0. 05; analysis of variance). We conclude that single-dose administration of an aluminum-magnesium antacid does not significantly decrease the oral bioavailability of <b>cefixime...</b>|$|E
