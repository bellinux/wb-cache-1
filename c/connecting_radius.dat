Numerous {{studies have shown that}} Low γ→α’ Transformation Temperature (LTT) welding consumables enable weld beads to be in compression after cooling. Owing to this, fatigue strength can be substantially improved. Low carbon martensitic stainless steel consumables (EN ISO 17633 -A -T Z 16 5 1) are widely available on the market in Europe, which also exhibit γ→α’ low temperature transformation (around 225 °C), despite dilution with base material. Experimental work conducted on partially penetrated symmetric and asymmetric fillet welded test pieces have shown good results with respect to weld root crack initiation and a substantial improvement of fatigue resistance with respect to weld bead toe crack initiation (m = - 5, FAT > 160). These results are all the more interesting because the weld bead <b>connecting</b> <b>radius</b> obtained with a heterogeneous welding consumable is smaller than with a homogeneous consumable such as G 3 Si 1.

30|$|Methodologies {{have been}} {{developed}} for calculating cutoffs of reservoir intervals with production capacity (RIPC) and reservoir intervals with accumulation capacity (RIAC) according to the types of pore throat structures and dynamic force by using data from petrophysical analysis, production tests and mercury injection. The data are from clastic reservoirs in the third member (Es 3) and the fourth member (Es 4) of the Shahejie Formation in the Shengtuo area on the North Slope of the Dongying Sag, Jiyang Depression, China. The method of calculating cutoffs of RIPC is summarized as follows: 1) determination of permeability cutoffs of RIPC; 2) classification of types of pore-throat structures according to mercury injection data and then relating porosity to permeability and determining the relationship between porosity and permeability according to each type of pore-throat structure; and 3) calculating porosity cutoffs of RIPC using established correlation between porosity and permeability according to the type of pore throat structure. The method of calculating cutoffs of RIAC includes: 1) establishing a functional relationship between oil-water interfacial tension and formation temperature; 2) calculating limiting values of maximum <b>connected</b> pore-throat <b>radii</b> according to formation temperature and dynamic forces of each reservoir interval; 3) correlating permeability with maximum <b>connected</b> pore-throat <b>radius</b> and then obtaining permeability cutoffs of RIAC; and 4) calculating porosity cutoffs on the basis of permeability cutoffs according to specific correlations, suitable for the type of pore-throat structure. The results of this study show that porosity and permeability cutoffs of clastic reservoirs decrease with depth. For a fixed permeability cutoff, the porosity cutoff of RIPC varies because the type of pore throat is different. At a fixed temperature, porosity and permeability cutoffs of RIAC decrease as dynamic force increases. For a fixed permeability cutoff of effective hydrocarbon accumulation, the porosity cutoff also varies with different types of pore throat.|$|R

40|$|The Sandvik Coromant {{division}} of Sandvik Group produces and sells products for metalworking applications. Coromant {{is a leading}} manufacturer of cemented carbide tools for turning, milling and drilling. The insert (cemented carbide) {{is the part of}} the tool that does the actual cutting in the workpiece. The thesis assignment was to develop a CAD Toolbox available to insert designers in UGS NX 3 CAD-system at Sandvik Coromant. It could contain for instance geometry or help programs or a combination of them. The main purposes with the Toolbox should be to facilitate the designer’s daily work, maintain standard and to integrate engineering knowledge. The thesis work was carried out at Sandvik Coromant, CTDP department in Sandviken, Sweden. Part of the project task was {{to find out what the}} Toolbox should be filled with in the future and to create the first object in the Toolbox. The chosen example object was the Wiper Cutting Edge, which is a patented insert nose configuration with several <b>connected</b> <b>radii</b> after each other, providing better workpiece surface finish or increased productivity. To find out the designers needs and therefore what objects to add in the Toolbox a survey was conducted at the Design Insert department at Sandvik Coromant. A questionnaire was handed out to the designers and the answers generated a list of widely different objects, for example ready NX 3 drawing templates. A number of NX 3 functions that might be useful in the Toolbox were tested and evaluated in the thesis, e. g. User Interface Styler, User Defined Feature (UDF) and Knowledge Fusion (KF). KF is a Knowledge Based Engineering application within UGS NX 3, which can enable rules controlling the user when designing. To evaluate the different functions a Wiper NX 3 sketch was created meeting the demands from the insert designers and thesis assignment. One stated demand was that the Toolbox has to be compatible with Teamcenter Engineering, which is a Product Lifecycle Management solution from UGS. The final selected Wiper Object solution was Knowledge Fusion enabled UDF’s with added Open C API-functions. Among the advantages with the KF enabled UDF concept compared to other solutions are that a new NX 3 dialog window can be connected to the UDF and that programming rules can evaluate dialog input data and give interactive feedback to the user. Depending on type of Toolbox object the application technique in NX 3 could vary. Sometimes standalone UDF’s are advantageous and sometimes KF could be beneficial to use together with a UDF.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate anatomical and biomechanical parameters of the canine capal joint in order to determine the physiological situation of articular loading. 121 carpal joints of 61 dogs of varying age weighing more than 20 kg were examined. The joint angle of the carpal joint was measured in 50 standing dogs. Long term tensile stresses of the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone were determined by the split line method. The distal articular surface of the radius showed two different types of split line patterns, a clear transverse orientation or one singular attractive point at the dorsal rim of the articular surface. The split lines at the dorsal aspect of the radius diverged towards its distal end, which is an evidence of a transverse strain of the articular surface during loading. In all joints compressively loaded regions were located especially in the dorsal parts of the articular surfaces. The articular surfaces of the second carpal bone showed two different split line patterns depending on the weight of the dogs. The palmar aspects of the proximal articular surfaces of the metacarpal bones showed evident transverse tensile stress. The silicon cast method was used to determine the contact areas and Fuji pressure sensitive film to determine the contact pressures at different loading steps. In all joints of the carpus the contact areas increased nonlinear with an increasing loading rate. They never included more than 50 % of the convexe articular surface. Contact areas in the antebrachiocarpal joint always were larger than those of the midcarpal and carpometacarpal joint at the same loading step, the latter being nearly identical for each loading step. Because of the hyperextension the antebrachiocarpal contact areas were located close to the dorsal edge of the articular surfaces, while in the midcarpal and carpometacarpal joint they reached further palmar. The centres of the contact pressures corresponded closely with the centres of the contact areas. Greater pressures in the antebrachiocarpal joint were located medially, in the midcarpal joint they were equally distributed over the whole articular surface, while in the carpometacarpal joint they were found laterally. The long term loading situation of the articular surfaces was investigated by means of computertomography-osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM). Individual CT-datasets were matched onto one target joint surface. Thus the mean values of all bone density measurements of the subchondral bone could be visualized. Areas of high bone density were very consistent and coincided with the location of high compressive load in the split line investigation and the contact areas. In the antebrachiocarpal joint, areas with high bone density were found dorsomedially. In both the midcarpal and carpometacarpal joint they were more equally distributed over the joint surfaces. With increasing age the subchondral bone density increases as well. Furthermore the bone density maxima are more clearly demarcated in older animals. The joint angle of the carpal joint of standing dogs showed a significant correlation with the age of the animals. Body weight and breed did not have any influence. From the biomechanical point of view the distal radioulnar ligament is a tensile loaded structure which <b>connects</b> <b>radius</b> and ulna distally and inhibits a separation of the two bones in stress. Moreover it increases the congruence of the antebrachiocarpal joint and thus is stressed with compressive forces. Because of the physiologic hyperextension and valgus-angulation of the carpal joint the articulation with the greatest range of motion, the antebrachiocarpal joint, is loaded unilaterally. Due to the limited range of motion in both the midcarpal and carpometacarpal joint the load is equally distributed over the articular surface in these two joints...|$|R

However, in the natural scaling limit of small hole size inversely proportional to time, the decay remains exponential. The big distinction between the straight and drivebelt stadia is that in the drivebelt case there are multiple families of MUPOs leading to qualitatively new effects.

We first analyzed the case of a 2 D cut which covers few voids and a 2 D cut which covers approximately 50 voids. The obtained PCF in the case of many voids was then discussed in comparison to the bootstrap predictions for a PVT process and the observed PCF for an astronomical catalog. An approximated formula which <b>connects</b> the averaged <b>radius</b> of the cosmic voids to the first minimum of the PCF is given. Comment: 19 pages 14 figure...|$|R
