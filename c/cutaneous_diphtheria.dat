40|$|The fowlpox, {{also known}} as contagiosum epithelioma, {{is caused by a}} {{poxvirus}} of the genus Avipoxvirus and affects both domestic and wild birds. The disease has two forms <b>cutaneous</b> and <b>diphtheria.</b> In March 2008 the sector of rehabilitation of wild birds from Mangual das Garças Park, located in Belém, Pará attended a duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis) that had nodular lesions in regions of the wing devoid of feathers. The lesions consisted of two large cutaneous tumor-like nodules that measured 4, 2 x 3, 8 cm and 2, 8 x 2, 2 cm in length and width, respectively. The nodules were surgically removed, fixed in 10 % formalin, processed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Histopathology showed acanthosis and expressive hyperkeratosis, some cells showed spongiosis. The confirmatory diagnosis of fowlpox was established by the pathognomonic sign of the presence of large intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion corpuscles (Bollinger bodies) in epithelial cells.

5000|$|Fibiger's {{doctoral}} {{research was}} on diphtheria. He developed more efficient method of growing bacteria {{in a laboratory}} setting. He discovered {{that there were two}} different forms (strains) of the diphtheria bacillus (Corynebacterium diphtheriae) that produce two different symptoms, now called nasopharyngeal and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> He also produced a blood serum against the disease. He was known for his methodological system of research. One of his experiments from 1898 in which he tested the blood serum for diphtheria is regarded by some as the first controlled clinical trial. While working as a Junior Physician in Blegdamshospitalet, he tested his diphtheria serum among hundreds (484) patients. As would be in modern clinical trial, he separated serum-treated and untreated patients, and found that more of untreated patients died than the treated ones. According an article in The British Medical Journal in 1998, : experiment in 1898 was the first clinical trial in which random allocation was used and emphasised as a pivotal methodological principle. This pioneering improvement in methodology, combined with a large number of patients and rigorous planning, conduct, and reporting, makes the trial a milestone in the history of clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Transmission-based {{precautions}} {{remain in}} effect for limited periods of time (i.e., while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent persists or {{for the duration of}} the illness (Appendix A). For most infectious diseases, this duration reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infectious agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> RSV), transmission-based precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., M. tuberculosis) state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictate the duration of precautions 12). In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks. The duration of contact precautions for patients who are colonized or infected with MDROs remains undefined. MRSA is the only MDRO for which effective decolonization regimens are available. However, carriers of MRSA who have negative nasal cultures after a course of systemic or topical therapy may resume shedding MRSA in the weeks that follow therapy. Although early guidelines for VRE suggested discontinuation of contact precautions after three stool cultures obtained at weekly intervals proved negative, subsequent experiences have indicated that such screening may fail to detect colonization that can persist for >1 year. Likewise, available data indicate that colonization with VRE, MRSA, and possibly MDR-GNB, can persist for many months, especially in the presence of severe underlying disease, invasive devices, and recurrent courses of antimicrobial agents. It may be prudent to assume that MDRO carriers are colonized permanently and manage them accordingly. Alternatively, an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive devices (e.g., 6 or 12 months) before reculturing patients to document clearance of carriage may be used. Determination of the best strategy awaits the results of additional studies. See the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline for discussion of possible criteria to discontinue contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with MDROs.|$|E

40|$|Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causative {{agent of}} <b>cutaneous</b> and {{pharyngeal}} <b>diphtheria</b> in humans. While lethality is certainly caused by diphtheria toxin, corynebacterial colonization may primarily require proteinaceous fibers called pili, which mediate adherence to specific tissues. The type strain of C. diphtheriae possesses three distinct pilus structures, namely the SpaA, SpaD, and SpaH-type pili, which are encoded by three distinct pilus gene clusters. The pilus is assembled onto the bacterial peptidoglycan by a specific transpeptidase enzyme called sortase. Although the SpaA pili are {{shown to be}} specific for pharyngeal cells in vitro, {{little is known about}} functions of the three pili in bacterial pathogenesis. This is mainly due to lack of in vivo models of corynebacterial infection. As an alternative to mouse models as mice do not have functional receptors for diphtheria toxin, in this study I use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host for C. diphtheriae. A simple C. elegans model would be beneficial in determining the specific role of each pilus-type and the literature suggests that C. elegans infection model can be used to study a variety of bacterial species giving insight into bacterial virulence and host-pathogen interactions. My study examines the hypothesis that pili and toxin are major virulent determinants of C. diphtheriae in the C. elegans model host...|$|R

It {{was found that}} the cell population of the peritoneal washings contained approximately 57 per cent macrophages, 22 per cent lymphocytes, 11 per cent granulocytes and 8 per cent mast cells. The lymphocyte count was significantly reduced and the granulocyte count increased after sensitization. The animals sensitized to M. butyricum exhibited delayed skin reactivity to tuberculin and the spreading of macrophages in vitro was significantly inhibited with the same antigen. On the contrary, the spreading of macrophages obtained from animals sensitized to BCG was not inhibited by tuberculin and there was no cutaneous reactivity. Spreading of macrophages obtained from rats sensitized by diphtheria toxoid was significantly inhibited in the presence of diphtheria toxoid, but not in the presence of tuberculin. These animals displayed delayed <b>cutaneous</b> hypersensitivity to <b>diphtheria</b> toxoid. Spreading of macrophages from normal rats was unaffected by serum antibodies. This was true either when the peritoneal cells were treated with antiserum prior to contact with antigen, or when the antigen—antibody reaction took place in the chamber containing the macrophages ready to spread. These results indicate that the technique of macrophage spreading inhibition is able to detect specifically hypersensitivity of delayed type and offers a convenient method for the in vitro study of delayed hypersensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Corynebacterium diphtheriae is {{commonly}} isolated from cutaneous skin lesions in the Northern Territory of Australia. We prospectively assessed 32 recent isolates from infected skin lesions, {{in addition to}} reviewing 192 isolates collected over 5 years for toxin status. No isolates carried the toxin gene. Toxigenic C. diphtheriae is now a rare occurrence in the Northern Territory. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is frequently isolated from cu-taneous lesions in tropical areas, including the north of Aus-tralia and the central Australian desert region (2, 14), geo-graphical areas {{that are part of}} the Northern Territory (NT).

40|$|Corynebacterium ulcerans {{is mainly}} {{known for its}} ability to cause animal infections. Some strains of C. ulcerans produce {{diphtheria}} toxin, which can cause life-threatening cardiopathies and neuropathies in humans. Human cutaneous C. ulcerans infection is a very rare disease that mimics classical <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> We present a very rare case of a C. ulcerans skin infection caused by a non-diphtheria toxin-producing strain of C. ulcerans that resolved after 3 weeks of therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate. A pet cat was the probable source of infection. The presence of C. ulcerans in the mouth of the cat was confirmed by 16 S rRNA gene analysis and the API Coryne system. In cases of human infection with potentially toxigenic corynebacteria, it is important to determine the species and examine the isolate for diphtheria toxin production. If toxigenicity is present, diphtheria antitoxin should be administered immediately. Carriers and potential infectious sources of C. ulcerans include not only domestic livestock but also pet animals.

40|$|After {{a decade-long}} resurgence, {{including}} a large <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria</b> outbreak in Washington State, the diphtheria incidence {{rate in the}} United States reached its lowest recorded level ever in 1980 [...] two patients (0. 01 case per million). Mortality paralleled the decline in incidence rate. Only 143 of the 3, 141 US counties reported noncutaneous diphtheria patients during 1971 - 81; most were located in the West. The highest attack rates were experienced by children less than 15 years old (0. 8 case per million) and by American Indians (22. 6 cases per million). Persons immunized with three or more doses of diphtheria toxoid had a lower death-to-case ratio (1. 3 per cent) than totally unimmunized persons (13. 4 per cent).

The onset of respiratory diphtheria is insidious and begins after an incubation period of 2 – 5 days. Initial symptoms of illness include a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, malaise, and low-grade fever. The hallmark of respiratory diphtheria is the presence of an exudate that organizes into a tough, grayish-white pseudomembrane over the tonsils, the pharynx, or larynx. The pseudomembrane is strongly adherent to the underlying tissue, and attempts to dislodge it usually result in bleeding. Accompanying inflammation of the cervical lymph nodes and surrounding soft-tissue swelling of the neck give rise to a “bull-neck ” appearance and are a sign of moderate to severe disease.

40|$|Pharyngeal or <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria</b> {{is caused}} by toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and {{occasionally}} by Corynebacterium ulcerans. Both organisms are capable ofproduc-ing an exotoxin that causes local tissue necrosis, and when absorbed into the bloodstream causes toxaemia and systemic complications that include demyelinating peripheral neuritis with associated paralysis and myocarditis with cardiac failure. ' Non-toxigenic strains cause a mild disease that resembles localised disease caused by toxigenic strains. Before the introduction of mass immunisa-tion programmes in the 1940 s and 50 s, the infection was endemic in most countries, with a seasonal increase in the colder months in temperate regions and periodic epidemics. The highest incidence of diphtheria was in preschool children, although the disease was uncommon {{in the first year}} of life. Diphtheria still remains endemic in many developing countries.

40|$|Skin ulcers are a {{commonly}} encountered problem at departments of tropical dermatology in the Western world. Furthermore, the general dermatologist {{is likely to}} be consulted more often for imported chronic skin ulcers because of the ever-increasing travel to and from tropical countries. The most common cause of chronic ulceration throughout the world is probably pyoderma. However, {{in some parts of the}} world, cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most prevalent causes. Mycobacterium ulcerans is an important cause of chronic ulcers in West Africa. Bacterial infections include pyoderma, mycobacterial infections, diphtheria, and anthrax. Pyoderma is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta-hemolytic streptococci group A. This condition is a common cause of ulcerative skin lesions in tropical countries and is often encountered as a secondary infection in travelers. The diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds. Antibacterial treatment for pyoderma should preferably be based on culture outcome. Floxacillin is generally active against S. aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci. Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, M. marinum, and M. tuberculosis may cause ulcers. Buruli ulcers, which are caused by M. ulcerans, are endemic in foci in West Africa and have been reported as an imported disease in the Western world. Treatment is generally surgical, although a combination of rifampin (rifampicin) and streptomycin may be effective in the early stage. M. marinum causes occasional ulcerating lesions in humans. Treatment regimens consist of combinations containing clarithromycin, rifampin, or ethambutol. Cutaneous tuberculosis is rare in travelers but may be encountered in immigrants from developing countries. Treatment is with multiple drug regimens consisting of isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is still endemic in many tropical countries. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria</b> ulcers are nonspecific and erythromycin and penicillin are both effective antibacterials. Antitoxin should be administered intramuscularly in suspected cases. Anthrax is caused by spore-forming Bacillus anthracis. This infection is still endemic in many tropical countries. Eschar formation, which sloughs and leaves behind a shallow ulcer at the site of inoculation, characterizes cutaneous anthrax. Penicillin and doxycycline are effective antibacterials. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different species belonging to the genus Leishmania. The disorder is one of the ten most frequent causes of skin diseases in travelers returning from (sub) tropical countries. The clinical picture is diverse, ranging from a painless papule or nodule to an ulcer with or without a scab. Treatment depends on the clinical manifestations and the species involved. Sporotrichosis, chromo(blasto) mycosis, and mycetoma are the most common mycoses that may be accompanied by ulceration. Infections are restricted to certain regions and often result from direct penetration of the fungus into the skin. Anti-mycotic treatment depends on the microorganism involved. The most common causes of infectious skin ulceration encountered in patients from tropical countries who present at a department of tropical dermatology are reviewed in this articl...|$|E
40|$|Diphtheria {{is caused}} by {{diphtheria}} toxin-producing Corynebacterium species. While classical respiratory diphtheria is transmitted by droplets, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria</b> often results from minor trauma. This report concerns the first case of sexually transmitted diphtheria in a patient with non-gonococcal urethritis after orogenital contact. Diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness {{is caused by}} Corynebacterium species harbouring the diphtheria toxin-encoding tox gene. Diphtheria is a WHO-notifiable disease and alerts both clinicians and public health authorities. Infections caused by toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae are now extremely rare in industrialised countries and are mostly associated with travel or contact with a person from an endemic area such as India, Indonesia, Brazil or the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. 1 Respiratory diphtheria is usually transmitted by droplets, whereas cuta-neous diphtheria often results from minor trauma and frequently shows co-infection with other bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of refugees seeking asylum in Europe in recent years poses new challenges for the healthcare systems in the destination countries. The goal {{of the study was}} to describe the evolution of medical problems of asylum seekers at a tertiary care centre in Switzerland. At the University Hospital Basel, we compared all asylum seekers during two 1 -year time periods in 2004 / 05 and 2014 / 15 concerning demographic characteristics and reasons for referrals and hospitalizations. Hundred ninety five of 2 ' 544 and 516 of 6 ' 243 asylum seekers registered at the national asylum reception and procedure centre Basel were referred to the University Hospital Basel in 2004 / 05 and 2014 / 15, and originated mainly from Europe (62. 3 %, mainly Turkey) and Africa (49. 1 %, mainly Eritrea), respectively. Median age was similar in both study periods (26. 9 and 26. 2 years). Infectious diseases in asylum seekers increased from 22. 6 % to 36. 6 % (p< 0. 001) and were the main reasons for hospitalizations (33. 3 % of 45 and 55. 6 % of 81 hospitalized patients, p = 0. 017) in 2004 / 05 compared to 2014 / 15. The leading infectious diseases in hospitalized patients were tuberculosis (n = 4) and bacterial skin infections (n = 2) in 2004 / 05; Malaria (n = 9), pneumonia (n = 6), Chickenpox (n = 5), other viral infections (n = 5) and bacterial skin infections (n = 5) in 2014 / 15. Infectious diseases like malaria, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> louseborne-relapsing fever or scabies were only found in the second study period. Almost one third of the admitted asylum seekers required isolation precautions with median duration of 6 - 9. 5 days in both study periods.
