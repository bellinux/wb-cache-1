5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater as the <b>central</b> <b>focus</b> of French efforts, but in both {{instances}} the Italian theater became the most important.

Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E
