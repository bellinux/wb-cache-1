5|$|On August 2, 1923, President Harding died {{unexpectedly}} in San Francisco {{while on}} a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and <b>came</b> <b>downstairs</b> to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered {{the oath of office}} in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{was an avid}} pilot, {{licensed}} to fly from early adulthood. He flew often, for pleasure, {{one of the few}} concert audio engineers who did. In the 1970s between Presley concert dates, Jackson flew the singer's personal jet airliner, a converted Convair 880 named Lisa Marie after Presley's daughter. For Presley's band rehearsals at Graceland, Jackson would fly some [...] from Lititz to Memphis with the back of a small plane loaded with assorted mic stands, cables and monitor loudspeakers. The band would rehearse for a bit in Graceland's racquetball court, then hang out in the Jungle Room waiting for Presley who rarely <b>came</b> <b>downstairs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual {{friends and}} {{convinced}} him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini [...] "knew {{a heck of a}} lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get the word out that you have a record", and that [...] "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff." [...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango <b>came</b> <b>downstairs</b> and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to his wife, one day {{in early}} 1927 Ives <b>came</b> <b>downstairs</b> with tears in his eyes. He could compose no more, he said, [...] "nothing sounds right." [...] There have been {{numerous}} theories advanced to explain the silence of his late years, which seems as mysterious as {{the last several decades}} of the life of Jean Sibelius, who also stopped composing at almost the same time. While he had stopped composing, and was increasingly plagued by health problems, he did continue to revise and refine his earlier work, as well as oversee premieres of his music. After continuing health problems, including diabetes, in 1930 he retired from his insurance business, which gave him more time to devote to his musical work, but he was unable to write any new music. During the 1940s he revised his Concord Sonata, publishing it in 1947 (an earlier version of the sonata and the accompanying prose volume, Essays Before a Sonata were privately printed in 1920).|$|E
