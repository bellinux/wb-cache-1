5|$|Frank Marshall {{invented the}} Modern Benoni in 1927, but his {{experiments}} {{with the opening}} went largely ignored for over 20 years. In the 1950s the system was revitalized by players in the Soviet Union, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> Mikhail Tal. Its subsequent adoption by players of a similarly aggressive and uncompromising style such as Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov established the opening's {{reputation as one of}} Black's most dynamic responses to 1.d4.|$|E
5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien.

5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E

Although Lancelet reciprocates Gwenhwyfar's love, he is also Arthur's friend and an honorable man. This situation causes terrible suffering to both Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar.|$|R

5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them,</b> and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien.

Members of the peerage also played for I Zingari, including Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke and George Harris, 4th Baron Harris. At least three players were Members of Parliament, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> Alfred Lyttelton and Edward Stanhope who were both {{members of the}} Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Cecil Wilson, who appeared for the side twice, also served as an Anglican Bishop of Melanesia and Bishop of Bunbury.|$|E

Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French-German border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the Malagasy vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority and desire for Malagasy self-governance across the island. These factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant Malagasy nationalists, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E

Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E

50|$|According to Martin (1976), the Dagombas {{pushed back}} the Konkomba and {{established}} divisional <b>chiefs</b> <b>among</b> <b>them.</b> The main towns had {{the character of}} outposts, strategically located on the east bank of the River Oti but Bikpakpaam {{were by no means}} assimilated. Relations between them and the Dagombas were distant and hostile. There was little, if any, mixing by marriage. Part of the oral history of the creation of Dagbon suggests that the Dagombas conquered Bikpakpaam when they moved into {{the eastern part of the}} Northern Region. Bikpakpaam however have vehemently and consistently refused the claim that they were in the battle against Dagombas. The Konkomba have often insisted that they voluntarily moved away, in search for fertile lands and greener pastures for their livestock, when Dagombas arrived. David Tait (1964) quotes an elder of Bikpakpaam as saying “When we were growing up and met our fathers, they told us they (our forefathers) stayed in Yaan/Chare (Yendi) with the Kabre and Bikwom. The Dagombas at the time lived mainly in Tamale and Kumbungu from where they rose, mounted their horses and moved towards Yendi”. We saw the horses and had to move further east.|$|R
5|$|One {{night during}} {{preparations}} for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and {{was seen as a}} bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon's son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{all this}} has led to the {{enduring}} image of an ineffectual leadership in foreign and military affairs under Zaoutzes. This may explain why, despite the resumption of Leo's affair with Zoe, the relationship between Zaoutzes and the emperor became strained: tales of an alleged plot by Zaoutzes's son to murder Leo in 894/895 indicate a rift between the two, and although Zaoutzes himself was not involved, a major quarrel between them ensued shortly after. Although they were reconciled, Zaoutzes's standing seems to have declined further thereafter, as two of his protégés, found guilty of accepting bribes, were punished by Leo. Nevertheless, in late summer 898, following the death of Theophano in December 865 or 866 and of Zoe's first husband Gouzouniates in early 898, Leo at last married Zoe, raising her to Augusta. In the next year, however, both Zoe and Stylianos died. Following their deaths, Leo proposed to marry yet again, choosing Eudokia Baïana as his wife. Zaoutzes's numerous relatives, who had benefited from his patronage, were fearful of losing their positions to the new Empress's relations, and conspired to overthrow Leo. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> was Basil, Zoe's nephew. The plot, however, was betrayed by the eunuch servant Samonas, and the conspiracy suppressed. The Zaoutzes relatives were exiled or confined to monasteries, and the clan's power broken. Samonas himself was richly rewarded: he was taken into the imperial service and rapidly promoted, becoming parakoimomenos by 908, before he too fell from favor.|$|E

60|$|After riding for {{two hours}} longer Mr. Hardy {{consulted}} the Gauchos {{if there were any}} stream near, but they said that it would be at least two hours' riding before they reached another, and that that was a very uncertain supply. Mr. Hardy therefore decided to halt at once, as the men knew this part of the plain thoroughly, from hunting ostriches on it, and from frequent expeditions in search of strayed cattle. They had all lived and hunted {{at one time or another}} with the Indians. Many of the Gauchos take up their abode permanently with the Indians, being adopted as members of the tribe, and living and dressing like the Indians themselves. These visits are generally undertaken to avoid the consequences of some little difficulty--a man killed in a gambling quarrel, or for rivalry in love. Sometimes they make their peace again, satisfy the blood-relations with a bull, secure absolution readily enough by confession and a gift of a small sum to the Church, and return to their former life; but as often as not they remain with the Indians, and even attain to the rank of noted <b>chiefs</b> <b>among</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

60|$|The {{students}} of right remained a vivid {{color in the}} impression of the university town. They pervaded the place, and decorated it with their fantastic personal taste in coats and trousers, {{as well as their}} corps caps of green, white, red, and blue, but above all blue. They were not easily distinguishable from the bicyclers who were holding one of the dull festivals of their kind in Leipsic that day, and perhaps they were sometimes both students and bicyclers. As bicyclers they kept about in the rain, which they seemed not to mind; so far from being disheartened, they had spirits enough to take one another by the waist at times and waltz in the square before the hotel. At one moment of the holiday some <b>chiefs</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> drove away in carriages; at supper a winner of prizes sat covered with badges and medals; another who went by the hotel streamed with ribbons; and an elderly man at his side was bespattered with small knots and ends of them, {{as if he had been}} in an explosion of ribbons somewhere. It seemed all to be as exciting for them, and it was as tedious for the witnesses, as any gala of students and bicyclers at home.|$|R

60|$|Just as {{daylight}} {{was breaking}} a tremendous yell was heard, {{followed by a}} hasty discharge of muskets; {{then there was the}} sound of horses' hoofs galloping at full speed, and then, headed by Blacking, two to three hundred natives came up to the camp.

500|$|Las Casas {{returned}} to Guatemala in 1537 wanting to employ his new method of conversion {{based on two}} principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on {{knowledge and understanding of}} the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like.

Through the efforts of Las Casas's missionaries the so-called [...] "Land of War" [...] came to be called [...] "Verapaz", [...] "True Peace". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native <b>chiefs,</b> <b>among</b> <b>them</b> those of Atitlán and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Marroquín who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission.
