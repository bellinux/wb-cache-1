Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator.

Many of these applications require the underlying middleware, operating systems, and networks to provide end-to-end quality of service (QoS) support to enhance their efficiency, predictability, scalability, and fault tolerance. The Object Management Group (OMG), which standardizes CORBA, has addressed many of these application requirements recently in the Real-time CORBA and Fault- tolerant CORBA specifications.

40|$|Embedded {{control systems}} appear {{in many of}} the {{manufactured}} products upon which our society increasingly depends. System developers need better development methods in order to be more confident that the systems which they deliver will behave properly. The need is particularly pressing in the case of distributed, hard real-time control systems for which testing is notoriously difficult. In recent years, much research has been conducted into formal techniques for analyzing the quantitative temporal properties of system models. Such work offers the promise of complementing testing in the validation of systems by approaches which include simulation, symbolic monitoring, assertion checking and verification.

40|$|<b>Controller</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (CAN) {{are widely}} used in the {{development}} of embedded real-time systems. As embedded systems are becoming more complex, the development of dependable software for such systems has become a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a technique to develop dependable synchronization code for CAN-based embedded systems. Our approach is to factor out synchronization as a separate aspect, synthesize synchronization code and then compose it with the functional code. Specifically, we allow the designer of a CAN-based application to first design core functional code. The designer can then annotate the functional code with control points and specify high-level "global invariants " specifying the synchronization policies. Our methodology generates synchronization code based on message passing in a CAN system and then automatically integrates the synchronization code into the functional code at appropriate control points. We propose and evaluate two solutions: one of which is based on a centralized active monitor and the other is a decentralized solution based on replication. The synchronization code developed is derived from high-level formal specifications via formal methods and is correct-by-construction, and will guarantee high assurance in safety-critical applications. ...|$|R

These nonlinear observers are based, first, on high gain approach, and then on high order sliding mode approach allowing robustness and finite time convergence.

The observers offer the very-first solution for dynamical estimation of rolling resistance in standard driving conditions, the rolling resistance being very difficult to estimate by an online procedure.

40|$|The <b>Controller</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (CAN) {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} Networked Control Systems (NCSs), such as construction machineries, hybrid vehicles, robotics, and other applications. The message response time (MRT) or communication delay is the main issue to degrade the performance of CAN-based NCSs since its exact value is time-varying and unpredictable. The online acquisition of exact MRT can be quite helpful for the delay compensation of NCSs. However, since the clocks on different nodes are asynchronous, the MRT acquisition in CAN is a challenging work. The current delay acquisition methods for asynchronous systems are not suitable for the delay compensation in CAN-based NCSs because they either increase the bus load of CAN or cannot acquire the exact MRT in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel online real-time MRT estimation method for periodic CAN messages based on the analysis of message traces on CAN bus. The proposed method can estimate the exact MRT of the received message instance in real time without increasing the bus load and can be conveniently embedded into the CAN nodes without requiring additional equipment. In order to validate the proposed method, practical experiments are carried out and the experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can effectively estimate the exact MRT of periodic CAN messages...|$|R
