40|$|In today 9 ̆ 2 s {{construction}} market, subcontractors execute significant {{portions of}} construction work. Subcontractors lessen resource requirements faced by <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> and provide specialized expertise to construction projects. The reliance of <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> on subcontractors to execute major portions of construction work makes {{the success of}} construction projects highly susceptible {{to the performance of}} these subcontracting organizations. As a result, subcontractors' selection decisions are of crucial importance to <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> bearing in mind that such decisions are exercised by <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> multiple times in every single project. This paper contributes a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to guide <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> in their subcontractor selection decision...|$|R
40|$|The general contractor-subcontractor {{relationship}} has been a focus {{of interest in the}} literature and yet its impact on a <b>general</b> <b>contractor's</b> economic performance remains a virtually unexplored area in the construction management literature. This research presents the findings of a questionnaire survey administered to 500 large US <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> to explore this issue. The findings reveal that maintaining a relationship of high quality with subcontractors is positively and strongly associated with the perceived performance of <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> responding to the survey.

50|$|<b>General</b> <b>contractors</b> often {{run their}} own business. They hire {{subcontractors}} to complete specialized construction work and may manage a team of plumbers, electricians, builders, carpenters and other specialists. <b>General</b> <b>contractors</b> build their business by networking with potential clients, buying basic construction tools, and ensuring that their subcontractors complete high-quality work. <b>General</b> <b>contractors</b> don't usually complete much construction work themselves, {{but they need to}} be familiar with construction techniques so they can manage workers effectively.|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} investigates {{the perception of}} <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> of affordable rehabilitation housing projects {{in the state of}} Texas. This study was carried out in collaboration with a corporation that is working on affordable rehabilitation housing in the state of Texas. For the purpose of maintaining anonymity, this organization is referred to as ?Corporation X?. To evaluate the perceptions of the <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> involved in affordable rehabilitation housing with Corporation X, face-to-face or Skype interviews were carried out. The results showed positive aspects, as well as attributes to be improved, from the <b>general</b> <b>contractors?</b> perspective. Although the contractors do not expect a sizable return on investment, their morale is high due to the satisfaction they feel knowing they are helping underprivileged communities. The cost constraint compounded by the poor existing condition of the houses challenge the ability of <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> to attain quality standards. However, the <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> claim they maintain work with high standards of safety and so have not experienced accidents on these sites...|$|R
50|$|A <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> is {{responsible}} for providing all of the material, labor, equipment (such as engineering vehicles and tools) and services necessary {{for the construction of}} the project.

2500|$|Contract bonds, used {{heavily in}} the {{construction}} industry by <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> as a part of construction law, are a guaranty from a Surety to a project's owner (Obligee) that a <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> (Principal) will adhere to the provisions of a contract. The Associated <b>General</b> <b>Contractors</b> of America, a United States trade association, provides some information for their members on these bonds.

50|$|An owner builder is {{a homeowner}} that is {{contracting}} their own homebuilding or other construction project rather than hiring a licensed <b>general</b> <b>contractor.</b> Owner builders manage the building schedule {{and take on}} all the responsibility and liability that would normally fall on the <b>general</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|R
40|$|The green {{building}} market has seen tremendous {{growth in the}} past decade. Organizations such as the US Green Building Council have emerged to become a dominant leader in the building industry. Although the {{green building}} rating systems are cross-disciplinary, much of the focus has been directed towards design-related input. 	<b>General</b> <b>Contractors</b> {{play an important role}} in delivering successful sustainable construction projects. If an integrated project delivery method is chosen, the <b>General</b> <b>Contractor</b> may offer insightful preconstruction assistance by providing ideas on green construction methods and materials. As sustainable building practices become more prominent in the construction industry, <b>General</b> <b>Contractors</b> must remain knowledgeable on current green building standards in order to stay competitive. 	Two of the most important aspects of business for a <b>General</b> <b>Contractor</b> involve time and money. Through qualitative literature review and quantitative results from a case study, this research analyzes time and cost in sustainable construction projects from a <b>General</b> <b>Contractor's</b> perspective. The research also examines whether the management of a sustainable construction project is substantially different than a non-sustainable construction project for a <b>General</b> <b>Contractor.</b> Finally, because the green building process involves multiple parties, the collaboration effort from all parties involved in a green building project will be studied.

50|$|The <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> is a manager, and {{possibly}} a tradesman, employed by the client {{on the advice of}} the architect, engineer or the architectural technologist or the client him/herself if acting as the manager. A <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> is responsible for the overall coordination of a project.A <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> must first assess the project-specific documents (referred to as bid, proposal or tender documents). In the case of renovations, a site visit is required to get {{a better understanding of the}} project. Depending on the project delivery method, the contractor will submit a fixed price proposal or bid, cost plus price or an estimate. The <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> considers the cost of home office overhead, general conditions, materials, and equipment as well as the cost of labor to provide the owner with a price for the project.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{small and}} medium {{contractors}} have experienced liquidity crisis due to recession of construction business according to global financial crisis in 2008. Those got to soon fall into serious financial difficulty because of profitability worsening and short-term debt, so many poor and dishonored <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> appeared due to strengthening of loan conditions of bank/financial sector. Comparatively large <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> could cope with liquidity crisis by using diversification and various financing methods, but small and medium <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> has relatively experienced bigger difficulty due to unified business structure and nonexistence of financing methods. Accordingly, {{this study has}} analyzed relationship on financial structure by an enterprise scale through empirical analysis by targeting <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> under global financial crisis in last 2008. Based on Financial Statements {{of a total of}} 358 <b>general</b> <b>contractors,</b> this study has performed correlation analysis and T-Test analysis by extracting an enterprise scale variable, a composition variable of current liabilities and long-term liabilities. As a result of this study, financing status of small and medium contractors is relatively poor, compared to a large company, and it was analyzed that direct financing is mostly impossible. Besides, it was analyzed that direct financing through banks and financial sectors is also difficult. Based on the analysis results like this, this study has suggested a method for solving liquidity crisis of small and medium <b>general</b> <b>contractors.</b> The first method is to secure transparency of financial activity of <b>general</b> <b>contractors,</b> and the second method is to ease lending practice of banks and financial sectors. The third method is to introduce Government’s direct financing techniques and activate it...|$|R
