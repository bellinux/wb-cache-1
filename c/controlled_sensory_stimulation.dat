40|$|The {{study of}} sensory {{processes}} may take either of two main approaches. In the one, the physiological properties of specific sensory anatomical structures and structure groups are determined and analyzed. This {{is the line}} of attack {{of most of the}} contributors to this symposium. In the other approach, which is the one that our own work takes, the psychophysical properties of the sensory systems are determined and analyzed, by recording specific behavioral indices of perceptual response to <b>controlled</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation.</b> With sufficient experimental ingenuity such behavioral studies can be carried out on any form of animal. We shall be concerned here with the human species, whose behavioral repertory includes verbal report, an extremely valuable index of sensory response and discrimination. When the psychologist or psychophysicist attempts to assemble into a coherent picture the multitude of facts that have been established about human color vision he soon finds that he needs an integrating conceptual scheme for {{the way in which the}} physiological mechanism seems to be functioning.

40|$|Results of a {{functional}} {{analysis indicated that}} the hand mouthing {{of a woman with}} developmental disabilities was maintained by multiple sources of <b>control</b> (<b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> and access to a leisure item). Further assessment revealed that access to several other items also produced high rates of hand mouthing. However, direct observation conducted in the woman's home indicated that none of these items was delivered contingent upon hand mouthing. When the consequence observed most frequently in the home was incorporated into the functional analysis, rates of hand mouthing were no higher than they were during an alone condition. We concluded that hand mouthing, although maintained by automatic reinforcement, was also susceptible to social contingencies when exposed to them during assessment, thereby producing a partially false-positive outcome...|$|R

Of this aspect, family group was the best, nursing group was the second and control group was the last group in classification.

40|$|Amputation of damaged {{tissue is}} one of the oldest {{surgical}} techniques, reaching prevalence in the 16 th century (1). Improved emergency medicine has allowed more individuals to survive traumatic injuries as amputees, but prosthetic limbs remain the only means to restore any degree of function to these patients. Inadequate tactile feedback is a leading shortcoming of prosthetic limbs, but for artificial hands, just a few sensors that relay grasp pressure back to the user can provide the functionality needed to enable delicate tasks (2). In addition to improved motor <b>control,</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> could alleviate phantom limb pain, which affects ~ 80 % of amputees (2). On page 314 of this issue, Tee et al. (3) report a Digital Tactile System (“DiTact”) based on a low-power flexible organic transistor circuit that transduces pressure stimuli into oscillating signals like those generated by skin mechanoreceptors. Mammalian skin is a multilayered viscoelastic material that can stretch up to ~ 125 % from its resting dimensions without any apparent loss in sensitivity to external stimuli such as pressure or temperature. Replicating skin mechanical and functional properties remains an elusive engineering challenge. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding field of flexible electronics has made substantial strides, and complex circuits can now be produced on soft substrates. Advances in microcontact printing, inkjet deposition, and organic electronics have delivered stretchable and flexible, wearable, and even epidermal sensors (4 – 6) ...|$|R

A therapeutic activity approach that can benefit persons with dementia is sensory stimu-lation. This article will review the meaning of <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> for whom it is appropriate, and the benefits. The activity assessment is integral in determining activities that are successful in stimulating the senses. The different ways to implement <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> are discussed. The writer refers to his own clinical experience of more than 10 years in the practical imple-mentation of <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> activities. The 6 different types of <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> and the outcomes of <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> are described. Key words: activities, dementia, <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> PLANNING and implementing sensorystimulation activities for residents with dementia are imperative. As persons with de-mentia regress, the need for offering activi-ties increases. As the progression of demen-tia occurs, there are fewer opportunities for them to initiate their own activities. 1 One thing a caregiver {{can do to help}} the shrink-ing world is to offer <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Sen-sory stimulation can be used with persons in all stages: mild dementia, moderate dementia, or severe dementia. <b>Sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> has been shown to have a positive short-term ef-fect on their quality of life. 2 There are many steps in implementing sen-sory stimulation correctly.

40|$|Spinal cord excitability, as {{assessed}} by modulation of Hoffmann (H-) reflexes, is reduced with fatiguing isometric contractions. Furthermore, spinal cord excitability is reduced during non-fatiguing {{arm and leg}} cycling. Presynaptic inhibition of Ia terminals is believed to contribute to this suppression of spinal cord excitability. Electrical stimulation to cutaneous nerves reduces Ia presynaptic inhibition, which facilitates spinal cord excitability, and this facilitation is present during arm cycling. Although {{it has been suggested}} that reducing presynaptic inhibition may prolong fatiguing contractions, it is unknown whether <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> can alter the effects of fatiguing exercise on performance or spinal cord excitability. Thus, the aim of this experiment was to determine if <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> can interfere with fatigue-related suppression of spinal cord excitability, and alter fatigue rates during cycling sprints. Thirteen participants randomly performed three experimental sessions that included: unloaded cycling with <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (<b>CONTROL</b> + STIM), sprints with <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (SPRINT + STIM) and sprints without stimulation (SPRINT). Seven participants also performed a fourth session (CONTROL), which consisted of unloaded cycling. During SPRINT and SPRINT + STIM, participants performed seven, 10 s cycling sprints interleaved with 3 min rest. For CONTROL and CONTROL + STIM, participants performed unloaded cycling for ~ 30 min. During SPRINT + STIM and CONTROL + STIM, participants received patterned <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> to nerves of the right foot. H-reflexes and M-waves of the right soleus were evoked by stimulation of the tibial nerve at multiple time points throughout exercise. <b>Sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> facilitated soleus H-reflexes during unloaded cycling, whereas sprints suppressed soleus H-reflexes. While receiving <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> there was less suppression of soleus H-reflexes and slowed reduction in average power output, compared to sprints without stimulation.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) {{are common}} {{developmental}} disorders thought to affect more than 1 % of the UK population (Baird et al, 2006, The Lancet 368, 210). Whilst the current official diagnostic criteria for ASD concentrate on {{signs and symptoms}} associated with social behaviour, it is also well known that sensory difficulties are {{a major factor in}} the presentation of this condition (Simmons et al, 2009, Vision Research 49, 2705). Over the past few years we have been investigating these sensory symptoms of ASD using a combination of questionnaire and focus group data, with the aim of clarifying precisely what they are. Concentrating on the visual symptoms, our questionnaire data revealed that individuals with higher levels of autistic traits complained of more visual symptoms than those with lower trait levels. Specific issues highlighted included problems with bright light, especially artificial lighting and, more specifically, flicker from fluorescent lighting (a particular problem in supermarkets). Some individuals also complained of specific colours in artificial lights. Note that the symptoms associated with these aversions could be particularly strong and involve headache and nausea. The focus group (n = 6) of adults with ASD revealed more detail about these issues. It became clear that low-frequency visual flicker, once noticed, can be hard to divert attention from. Also, seeing certain colours (eg, red) would “hurt”. Another symptom reported by a number of individuals is distress caused by strongly repetitive patterns like shelving or grids. General sensory issues highlighted by the focus group included the importance of having <b>control</b> over <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> in order to reduce sensory stress and how certain types of <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> could be calming in some situations (although none of our sample reported visual calming experiences other than seeking out natural lighting). Our data provide a fascinating insight into the complex sensory world of individuals with ASD and are not readily explained by existing theories of ASD. There is also a conundrum in that behavioural measurements of sensory thresholds appear to show little difference between those with ASD and controls. We speculate that the strength of sensory symptoms in ASD might be closely involved with the more well-known social signs and symptoms that currently define it.

40|$|Background and Aims: Literature {{from medical}} and health {{sciences}} indicated that <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{had a positive}} effect on traumatic brain injury patients. The present study was aimed to find out the effectiveness of a specific <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (4 modalities) in comparison with another <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (5 modalities) on recovery in comatose patients following severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: The study design was experimental, repeated measured with three groups. Two <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> models were compared with one control group. Forty-five participants with traumatic brain injury were recruited from surgical wards at Maharaj Nakhon Sri Thammarat Hospital, Thailand. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups, each group of 15 participants. Outcomes of the program were recovery determined by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). Inter rater agreement of the CRS-R was 0. 85. Descriptive statistics, Fisher’s exact test, repeated measure analysis of variance, and post hoc comparison were used for data analysis. Results: All the patients were equally comparable regarding their baseline characteristics, and basic recovery determined by CRS-R. Recovery scores of the three groups were improved. However, those who received the <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> program (4 modalities) had significantly higher CRS-R scores (P< 0. 001) after 5 days when compared to the two other groups. Conclusion: The <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> therapy had positive effects on traumatic brain injury patients. Application of the program required few stimuli materials which could be stored at the patient’s bedside making them accessible to care providers.

40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{has shown}} promise in {{improving}} human walking after {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Previous studies have demonstrated some improvement with open-loop, non-individualized <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> but after SCI, there are many unique, individual changes in sensorimotor processing. These changes make a priori identification of the best <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pattern difficult for any given individual. Real-time optimization provides {{a solution to this}} individuality problem, through optimizing <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> parameters for a given subject in on-line (in real-time). In this research, I developed an approach to optimize <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> to maximally assist human walking after incomplete SCI. To do so, I had to develop and validate a novel optimization algorithm for globally-optimizing noisy, time-variant, black-box systems, while maximizing the information gained from each test (experiment). I optimized <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> across a range of SCI subjects, across multiple <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulation</b> sites, and with different stimulation parameterizations. In all subjects and stimulation sites, the optimal stimulation protocol produced better walking (i. e. less external force assistance was required) than three alternative stimulation protocols: an industry-standard stimulation protocol, a no-stimulation protocol, and a random-stimulation protocol. The optimization approach minimized the total force required from an assistive orthosis, and post-hoc analysis of the optimization sessions produced {{a better understanding of how}} stimulation parameters affected specific gait features (e. g. hip forces during swing). Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) frequency had divergent effects on the stance and swing phases – high frequencies tended to assist with swing, but low frequencies tended to assist with stance. For the two peripheral nerve stimulation sites (posterior tibial and common peroneal nerves), the optimal gait-phase for stimulation was generally after mid-stance and before early swing. There was some variability within this time-range depending on the specific feature under study. Experimental history (i. e. time spent walking/time spent being stimulated) proved to be as important a predictor as any of the stimulation parameters. Ph. D...|$|R

The nonpharmacological interventions {{seem to be an}} efficient, inexpensive, and easy tool for family caregivers. Moreover, sleeping disorders increase caregivers’ distress and may lead to hospitalization. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed. Eleven randomized controlled trials have been found. Among these eleven trials, one referred to massage therapy and acupuncture, and the other ten studies referred to bright light therapy. Results: The results demonstrated that there are no relevant randomized controlled trials of music therapy, aromatherapy, and multisensory environment/Snoezelen referring to sleeping disturbances. Several studies have been conducted about the effect of the bright light therapy, and there is also another study that combines massage therapy and acupuncture therapy.

This study investigated the possibility that increased arousal associated with prenatal bimodal stimulation could have enduring effects upon subsequent postnatal behavioral organization and perceptual abilities in bobwhite quail.
