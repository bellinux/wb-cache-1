5000|$|On 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires {{occurred}} in Victoria, {{otherwise known as}} Black Saturday bushfires. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered {{and the majority of}} calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Due to the unprecedented amount of calls coming through Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement [...] "You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 — that’s 1223 — as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero" [...] which temporary replaced their front end announcement While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, <b>call</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, [...] "You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented highvolume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stayon the line and you will be answered by the next available operator". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.|$|E
