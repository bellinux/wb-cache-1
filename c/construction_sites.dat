5|$|Because of {{the last}} years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), {{but most of them}} are still <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Beside these, there are some other {{building}} areas like Tineretului, Lombului or Oser, which are likely to become districts in the following years.|$|E

40|$|Good safety {{practice}} {{ensures the}} construction {{will be running}} smoothly without any unwanted accidents. For safety practice in <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> the safety practices are crucial since the <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> is exposed to danger. In the <b>construction</b> <b>site,</b> accidents occur usually can causes the fatalities, permanent disabilities, and non-permanent disability to the victim. This accident can be avoided from continuously occur. That means an accidents during construction at the <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> due to the mistake can be controlled and reducing from time to time. The worker needs to follow the rules and regulation in construction to reduce the hazard. This research is conducted to study the safety practice towards zero accident at <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> To achieve the objective in this research, researcher is able to produce three objectives which are to study the safety on site, to determine the safety practice used in <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> and to give recommendation on safety practices at <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> Questionnaires were distributed to the worker at <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> The results from the data analysis shows that safety practices used {{in the construction industry}} is need to be improved {{in order to reduce the}} accidents...|$|R

5|$|Sophisticated {{techniques}} {{were used to}} delay {{the construction of the}} road. Sit-ins and site invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily. This led to large numbers of police and constant security patrols being employed to protect the <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> at great expense. By December 1994, the total cost of construction had been estimated at £6 million and rising by £500,000 every month.|$|E

Much of the work took place outdoors at <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
40|$|Construction are {{characterized}} by some overall requirements (e. g. quality, expected time and cost compliance, productivity, profitability, workers’ health and safety) to be satisfied. The necessary process to fulfil these requirements should start from the <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> design phase. The {{aim of the research}} is the implementation of <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> information in BIM models in order to support the execution phase design since {{the early stages of the}} project. These information concern, among the others, the choice optimization of site plants and equipment (i. e. <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> facilities), during the design phase. For this purpose, the creation of a BIM database of <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> facilities is needed. Each record of the database has thus to discharge a panel of BIM <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> requirements, each of them characterized by a set of physical and operational parameters whose relationships with project information lead the choices of the site designer. The methodology for the identification of these kind of BIM requirements has followed these steps: (i) definition of a set of information characterizing building elements/materials from a <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> point of view; (ii) <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> facilities identification and classification; (iii) first investigation in order to assess which is the adequate detail level of site plants and equipment graphic representation in order to create the above mentioned database. A case history is presented in order to show how BIM is useful for <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> designers to optimize their work, sharing information with the other figures involved in the construction process...|$|R

The US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created.

5|$|Haynes {{attended}} {{public schools}} through eighth grade {{and received a}} basic education.

He began by working as a custodian at a local church and later for the railroad, hauling ballast to <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> At the church, he joined the choir where he met and began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed two more years. Bertha and her family moved to Alabama during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of revival meetings were held in Indiana by Francis Murphy, a leader of a national temperance organization known as the Murphy Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents' urging, and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to Bertha.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
