25|$|The {{destruction}} of the Second Temple in 70 <b>CE</b> <b>marked</b> {{a turning point in}} Jewish history. In the absence of the Temple, the synagogue became the center of Jewish life. When the Temple was destroyed, Judaism responded by fixating on the commandments of the Torah. Synagogues replaced the temple as a central meeting place, and the rabbis replaced high priests as Jewish community leaders. Because of the rabbis' dominance after 70 CE, the era is called the rabbinic period. The rabbis filled the void of Jewish leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Revolt, and they created a new kind of Judaism through their literature and teachings.|$|E
25|$|June 1240 <b>CE</b> <b>marked</b> {{the arrival}} of the English crusade led by Richard of Cornwall, brother of the King Henry III of England and {{brother-in-law}} of Emperor Frederick II. As-Salih Ayyub, King of Egypt, offered Richard of Cornwall a new treaty to be complementary to the earlier treaty held with Theobald IV, Count of Champagne, France. His offer this time included his readiness to recognize the legitimacy of the concessions made by his uncle and opponent as-Salih Ismail, King of Damascus, to the Crusaders, so that the Galilee, and Jaffa and Ashkelon, and all of the city of Jerusalem, including Bethlehem and Majdal Yaba, in addition to Tiberias, Safed, and Belvoir Castle and Al-Tur Castle, were all included in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{this period}} saw {{the rise of}} the Mississippian culture in the modern United States c. 800 <b>CE,</b> <b>marked</b> by the {{extensive}} 12th-century urban complex at Cahokia. The Ancestral Puebloans and their predecessors (9th – 13th centuries) built extensive permanent settlements, including stone structures that would remain the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century. In Mesoamerica, the Teotihuacan civilization fell and the Classic Maya collapse occurred. The Aztec Empire came to dominate much of Mesoamerica in the 14th and 15th centuries. In South America, the 14th and 15th centuries saw {{the rise of the}} Inca. The Inca Empire of Tawantinsuyu, with its capital at Cusco, spanned the entire Andes Mountain Range, making it the most extensive Pre-Columbian civilization. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent road system and unrivaled masonry.|$|E

25|$|Modern historians {{view the}} Bar-Kokhba Revolt as being of decisive {{historic}} importance. They note that, unlike {{the aftermath of}} the First Jewish–Roman War chronicled by Josephus, the majority of the Jewish population of Judea was either killed, exiled, or sold into slavery after the Bar-Kokhba Revolt, and Jewish religious and political authority was suppressed far more brutally. The Jews became a minority in Judea, remaining strong only in the Galilee, Bet Shean and the Golan. The massive destruction and loss of life occasioned by the revolt has led some scholars such as Bernard Lewis to date the beginning of the Jewish diaspora from this date. Hadrian's death in 138 <b>CE</b> <b>marked</b> a significant relief to the surviving Jewish communities. Some of the Judean survivors resettled in Galilee, with Sepphoris being one of the centers where rabbinical families from Judea relocated. Rabbinic Judaism had already become a portable religion, centered around synagogues.|$|E
2500|$|The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period, lasting {{from the}} 5th to the 10th century <b>CE,</b> <b>marked</b> {{the start of}} the Middle Ages of European history. The Early Middle Ages {{followed}} the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 10th to 13th centuries). The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with Late Antiquity. The term [...] "Late Antiquity" [...] is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while [...] "Early Middle Ages" [...] is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the later medieval period.|$|E
2500|$|The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was {{the process}} of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule. The Fall {{is not the only}} unifying concept for these events; the period {{described}} as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse. The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376. For Cassius Dio, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 <b>CE</b> <b>marked</b> the descent [...] "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron". Gibbon started his story in 98 and Theodor Mommsen regarded the whole of the imperial period as unworthy of inclusion in his Nobel Prize-winning History of Rome. Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times. As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other markers include the Crisis of the Third Century, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 (or 405), the sack of Rome in 410, the death of Julius Nepos in 480, {{all the way to the}} Fall of New Rome in 1453.|$|E
