5000|$|ZCTAs are {{generalized}} area {{representations of}} the United States Postal Service (USPS) <b>ZIP</b> <b>code</b> service areas, but {{are not the same}} as <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes.</b> Individual USPS <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> can cross state, place, county, census tract, census block group and census block boundaries, so the Census Bureau asserts that [...] "there is no correlation between <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> and Census Bureau geography." [...] Moreover, the USPS frequently realigns, merges, or splits <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> to meet changing needs. These changes are usually not reflected in the annual TIGER releases. Each ZCTA is constructed by aggregating the Census 2010 blocks whose addresses use a given <b>ZIP</b> <b>code.</b> In assembling census statistical units to create ZCTAs, the Census Bureau took the <b>ZIP</b> <b>code</b> used by the majority of addresses in each census unit at the time the data was compiled. As a result, some addresses end up with a ZCTA code that is different from their <b>ZIP</b> <b>code.</b> ZCTAs are not developed for <b>ZIP</b> <b>codes</b> that comprise only a small number of addresses. Several ZCTAs represent ZIPs that no longer exist due to realignment by the USPS.|$|R
