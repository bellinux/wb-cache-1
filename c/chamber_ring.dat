5000|$|A {{collapse}} is {{triggered by}} the emptying of the magma chamber beneath the volcano, sometimes {{as the result of}} a large explosive volcanic eruption (see Tambora in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on the flanks of a volcano (see Piton de la Fournaise in 2007) or in a connected fissure system (see Bárðarbunga in 2014-2015). If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture, the [...] "ring fault", develops around the edge of the <b>chamber.</b> <b>Ring</b> fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as ring dykes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur {{as the result of a}} single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.|$|E
50|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the case}} expands {{to seal the}} sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp. model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard. The SIG SG 510 rifle family incorporates a <b>chamber</b> <b>ring</b> near the shoulder. The Seecamp pistol has a ring near the rear end of the chamber.|$|E

Until now, this property has been studied only in living animals {{and has not been}} accessible to in vitro analysis. In this study, we describe an in vitro system in which cultured peripheral nervous system neurons are separated from their neuron targets by an isolator <b>chamber</b> <b>ring.</b> Using pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alphaherpesvirus capable of transneuronal spread in neural circuits of many animals, we have recapitulated in vitro all known genetic requirements for retrograde and anterograde transneuronal spread as determined previously in vivo. We show that in vitro transneuronal spread requires intact axons and the presence of the viral proteins gE, gI, and Us 9. We also show that transneuronal spread is dependent on the viral glycoprotein gB, which is required for membrane fusion, but not on gD, which is required for extracellular spread. We demonstrate ultrastructural differences between anterograde- and retrograde-traveling virions. Finally, we show live imaging of dynamic fluorescent virion components in axons and postsynaptic target neurons...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) mediates coronary vasodilation through activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by way of particulate guanylate cyclase. Background. CNP has known peripheral vasodilator properties, and preliminary data have suggested that it can function as a coronary vasodilator. Methods. The actions of CNP were studied in instrumented dogs and in organ <b>chamber</b> <b>rings</b> in the presence and absence of a known antagonist to particulate guanylate cyclase, HS- 142 - 1. Additionally, the actions of HS- 142 - 1 were tested on acetylcholine-mediated coronary vasodilation, and immunohistochemical staining was utilized to localize the presence of CNP in the coronary endothelium. Results. CNP relaxed isolated coronary arteries with (mean ± SEM 45. 9 ± 7 %*) and without (72. 0 ± 7 %*†) an endothelium (*p < 0. 05 for CNP effect alone, †p < 0. 05 for endothelium vs. no endothelium with CNP). Intracoronary infusions increased coronary blood flow (baseline, 64. 6 ± 5. 1 ml/min; CNP- 5, 79. 9 ± 6. 1 *; CNP- 20, 103. 3 ± 13. 6 * [*p < 0. 05 vs. baseline value]) and reduced coronary vascular resistance (baseline, 1. 6 ± 0. 3 mm Hg/ml per min; CNP- 5, 1. 4 ± 0. 3 *; CNP- 20, 1. 2 ± 0. 3 *). Intracoronary injections increased coronary blood flow (Δ baseline coronary flow, 30 ± 9 * ml/min [*p < 0. 05]). HS- 142 - 1 significantly attenuated these increases (Δ coronary flow, 30 ± 9 * ml/min [CNP] to 14 ± 6 † [CNP + HS- 142 - 1] [†p < 0. 05 CNP vs. CNP + HS- 142 - 1]) and the relaxation of organ <b>chamber</b> <b>rings</b> (56 ± 7 % [CNP] to 18 ± 6 %† [HS- 142 - 1 + CNP]). Finally, CNP was localized to the coronary endothelium and smooth muscle by immunohistochemical staining. Conclusions. CNP functions as a coronary vasodilator through activation of cGMP by way of particulate guanylate cyclase. CNP-mediated coronary vasodilation is attenuated by intracoronary HS- 142 - 1. Intracoronary HS- 142 - 1 does not affect acetylcholine-mediated coronary vasodilation. These observations support a role for exogenous CNP as a potent coronary vasodilator...|$|R

50|$|Below {{the bell}} chamber {{there may be}} one or more sound chambers, (one of {{which is likely to}} house the clock {{mechanism}} if the church has one) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> or room. Typically, the rope's length is such that it falls close to or on {{to the floor of the}} <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b> About 5 ft from the floor, the rope has a woolen grip called the sally (usually around 4 ft long) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held tail-end.|$|R
50|$|However in reality, it {{required}} very advanced and rare expertise {{for one person}} to ring changes, which most churches did not have and it alienated bell ringers from the church. The sound of a chime was a feeble substitute for the rich sound of swinging bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently the Ellacombe apparatus {{has been removed from}} many towers in the UK, but there are still visible holes in the ceiling which the ropes would come through into the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> and often the frames are still in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> without ropes.|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{validation}} of pharmacological actions of 7 Senegalese plants used in traditional medicine {{for the treatment}} of respiratory illness was carried out. Changes in contractility of isolated rat trachea were assessed in organ <b>chambers.</b> <b>Rings</b> were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min before experiments were carried out, during which time the resting tension was adjusted, as required. Rings were first exposed to methanolic plants extracts (10 - 2 and 10 - 1 mg/ml) or solvent. After a 30 min incubation period, they were contracted with acetylcholine in a cumulative manner (10 - 9 to 10 - 3 M). Extracts from leaves of Guiera senegalensis, Melaleuca leucodendron and Hymenocardia acida elicited a significant dosedependant inhibition of the contractile agonist, suggesting further investigations on its chemical composition, the underlying mechanisms involved and its potential health value. However, in rings preincubated with extracts from Cymbopogon giganteus leaves and Salvadora persica roots, effect of the contractile agonist was not affected. Moreover, a hypereactivity was observed with extracts from Gossypium barbadense leaves and Cassia occidentalis seeds. These results provide evidence that Senegalese herbals may be of interest as valuable source of information for the selection of plants for focussed screening programmes and for therapeutically useful product...|$|R
