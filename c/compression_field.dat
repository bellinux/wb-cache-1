50|$|Collins has {{concentrated}} {{his research}} effort on understanding how cracked reinforced concrete resists shear stress. Shear failures can cause concrete structures to collapse without warning and hence, accurate analytical models for shear behaviour {{are critical for}} public safety. Unfortunately, most traditional shear design procedures rely upon empirical design rules which lack a rigorous theoretical basis and can be dangerous if applied to new situations. The <b>Compression</b> <b>Field</b> Theory, and subsequently the Modified <b>Compression</b> <b>Field</b> Theory, developed by Professor Collins {{and his colleagues at}} the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, provides a rational basis for shear design and has received worldwide recognition. A Simplified Modified <b>Compression</b> <b>Field</b> Theory is currently the design standard in the Canadian CAN/CSA A23.3-04 which is the basic truss model, and soon to be updated and included in the European Building Code. He is the author of over 80 technical papers, 8 of which have received a research prize.|$|E

Davros prepares to detonate the reality bomb before the TARDIS materialises in front of him. The clone Doctor and then Donna try to use a device that will refocus the reality bomb onto the Daleks, but Davros blasts them both with electricity and destroys the device. This causes Donna to become imbued with Time Lord knowledge that she gained during the clone Doctor's creation, and she disables the reality bomb with seconds to spare. The two Doctors help her disable the Daleks and relocate the missing planets, but the control panel is destroyed before Earth can be relocated. Motivated by Dalek Caan's prophecy of the Daleks' extinction, the new Doctor destroys the Daleks and the Crucible. A shocked Davros is angered by Dalek Caan's betrayal. The original Doctor offers to save Davros who refuses, labeling the Doctor as [...] "the Destroyer of Worlds" [...] before he is killed by the ship's destruction.

40|$|The {{mixing of}} an {{impurity}} into a flowing fluid {{is an important}} process {{in many areas of}} science, including geophysical processes, chemical reactors, and microfluidic devices. In some cases, for example periodic flows, the concepts of nonlinear dynamics provide a deep theoretical basis for understanding mixing. Unfortunately, the building blocks of this theory, i. e. the fixed points and invariant manifolds of the associated Poincare map, have remained inaccessible to direct experimental study, thus limiting the insight that could be obtained. Using precision measurements of tracer particle trajectories in a two-dimensional fluid flow producing chaotic mixing, we directly measure the time-dependent stretching and <b>compression</b> <b>fields.</b> These quantities, previously available only numerically, attain local maxima along lines coinciding with the stable and unstable manifolds, thus revealing the dynamical structures that control mixing.

This connection appears to persist as the onset of turbulence is approached. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} a project dealing with ductility in high performance concrete structures. The main objectives were to investigate the material and structural ductility/brittleness of prestressed structural elements of High Performance Concrete (HPC). The aim was {{to get a better}} understanding of the fracture process and to study sudden and brittle failures formed by shear stresses. The project was split into three parts: (I) Torsion of cylindrical pole elements, (II) Shear, torsion and bending of hollow core slabs, and (III) Shear, torsion and bending of cylindrical pole elements. Laboratory investigations were performed and displacements were carefully studied. The test results were compared with different code models and especially with the Modified <b>Compression</b> <b>Field</b> Theory(MCFT) proposed by Collins & Mitchell (1991). A computer program based on MCFT was written to calculate the interaction between shear, torsion and bending.

40|$|The {{data size}} of hyperspectral image {{is too large}} for storage and transmission, {{and it has become}} a {{bottleneck}} restricting its applications. So it is necessary to study a high efficiency compression method for hyperspectral image. Prediction encoding is easy to realize and has been studied widely in the hyperspectral image <b>compression</b> <b>field.</b> Fractal coding has the advantages of high compression ratio, resolution independence, and a fast decoding speed, but its application in the hyperspectral image <b>compression</b> <b>field</b> is not popular. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for hyperspectral image compression based on hybrid prediction and fractal. Intraband prediction is implemented to the first band and all the remaining bands are encoded by modified fractal coding algorithm. The proposed algorithm can effectively exploit the spectral correlation in hyperspectral image, since each range block is approximated by the domain block in the adjacent band, which is of {{the same size as the}} range block. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides very promising performance at low bitrate.

The high penetration 30 deg injector allowed hydrogen to pierce the core-flow, aided by the engine’s natural shock train. The injector-induced vortices ensured the centrally located and previously inaccessible air was redistributed to the more accessible cowl-side combustor surface.
