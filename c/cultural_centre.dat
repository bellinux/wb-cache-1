40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concentrated}} on <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> built between years 1960 and 1990 {{in the former}} socialist Czechoslovakia. Six <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> have been chosen and analyzed to conclude the purposes they serve {{as well as the}} programs they offer. These chosen <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> are run as municipal organisations financed from the town budgets. The six towns where they are located are similar to each other in terms of their history, size and the time when their <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> were built. All of these centres share difficulties with the lack of cultural interest of local citizens, bad technical shape of the buildings in question and low budget. The aim of this thesis is to compare the functioning of these six <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> and conclude whether being directly funded and influenced by the municipal councils has a positive impact and should {{serve as a model for}} <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> or should be replaced by a different one. It also focuses on cooperation between the management of <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> and municipal officials, cooperation with other local cultural institutions and <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> from different towns...|$|R

5|$|New Caledonia was {{annexed to}} France in 1853, {{and became an}} {{overseas}} territory of France in 1956. An independence movement led to a failed revolt in 1967, and was restarted in 1984, pursuing total independence status from the French rule. When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia to decide on holding the referendum for independence, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the Kanak leader of the independence movement, had mooted a proposal {{to set up an}} Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture (ADCK). After Tjibaou's assassination in 1989, the French President François Mitterrand ordered that a <b>cultural</b> <b>centre</b> on the lines suggested by Tjibaou be set up in Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia; it was to be the last of Mitterrand's Grands Projets.
