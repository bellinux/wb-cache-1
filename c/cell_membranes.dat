5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E

Like bacteria, the <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria.

The polycation diethylaminoethyl-dextran enhanced viral attachment and subsequent entry. At {{the site of}} viral attachment to the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane,</b> three distinct interactions occurred between the viral envelope and <b>cell</b> <b>membrane,</b> namely, (i) dissolution of viral envelopes on the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane,</b> which itself remained unaltered; (ii) simultaneous dissolution of both the envelope and <b>cell</b> <b>membrane,</b> resulting in passage of viral nucleoids directly into the cytoplasm; and (iii) dissolution of the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> with direct penetration of intact enveloped particles into the cytoplasm, followed by intracytoplasmic disruption of the envelope, resulting in release of nucleoids into the cytoplasm.

40|$|AbstractThe {{addition}} of progesterone (1 – 100 μmol/l) to the extracellular fluid bathing rat hepatocytes {{led to a}} rapid and fully reversible depolarization of the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane.</b> The progesterone-induced depolarization was paralleled by a decrease of potassium selectivity and an increase of <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> resistance and was abolished {{in the presence of}} the potassium channel blocker barium. Accordingly, in whole cell recordings, progesterone led to a decrease of the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> conductance. 17 α-Hydroxyprogesterone and β-estradiol were less effective by a factor of 10, whereas cholesterol, corticosterone and hydrocortisone did not significantly alter the potential difference across the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane.</b> In conclusion, acute administration of progesterone depolarized rat hepatocytes by decreasing the potassium conductance of the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane...</b>|$|R
5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their cytosol. Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} <b>cell</b> <b>membranes,</b> either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E

40|$|Breaching of the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} and most common causes of cell injury, tissue damage, and disease. If the compromise in <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> is not repaired quickly, irreversible cell damage, cell death and defective organ functions will result. It is therefore fundamentally important to efficiently repair damage to the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane.</b> While the molecular aspects of single cell wound healing are starting to be deciphered, its bio-physical counterpart has been poorly investigated. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes as a model for single cell wound healing, we describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of the wound electric current circuitry and the temporal dynamics of <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> potential variation. In addition, we show the role of calcium influx in controlling electric current circuitry and <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> potential variations. (i) Upon wounding a single cell: an inward electric current appears at the wound center while an outward electric current is observed at its sides, illustrating the wound electric current circuitry; the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> is depolarized; calcium flows into the cell. (ii) During <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> re-sealing: the wound center current density is maintained for a few minutes before decreasing; the <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> gradually re-polarizes; calcium flow into the cell drops. (iii) In conclusion, calcium influx is required for the formation and maintenance of the wound electric current circuitry, for <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> re-polarization and for wound healing.

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
40|$|Drug {{efficacy}} {{depends on}} the amount of a preparation reaching the target tissue (grade of tissue transfer).

The <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability of phenytoin or valproate depended on the concentration of albumin.

5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on <b>cell</b> <b>membranes,</b> such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

The transfer of potassium ions through nerve <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium.
