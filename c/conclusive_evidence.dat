5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidence</b> of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidence</b> clauses.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{evidence}} that exogenous plant miRNAs {{are present in the}} sera and tissues of various animals and that these exogenous plant miRNAs are primarily acquired orally through food intake [20], the safety of GMO-derived miRNAs has been debated [21 – 25]. Nonetheless, further studies have detected the presence of exogenous miRNAs in human samples from uncommon dietary sources (e.g. rodents), indicating that exogenous miRNAs originate from technical artefacts rather than dietary intake [26]. Hence, there are no <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidences</b> and consensus about this topic.|$|R

Since there was no statistically significant increase in severity of accident in British Columbia due to driving with opposite control, no increase in rate of injury or death was assumed in Rwanda as well.|$|R

The different structures and inappropriate physical contacts {{may result in}} the controversy of DNA conductivity reported over the last decade. In order to prove this hypothesis, an AFM based experimental method has been developed in this paper. The AFM based nanomanipulation system can be used either as a nanolithography tool to make small-gap electrodes or a nanomanipulation tool to elongate, deform and cut DNA molecules.

Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E

Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidence</b> of the event.

40|$|Abdominal wall hernia {{is common}} but {{reliable}} scientific data about its work relatedness {{is very limited}} and inconsistent. In this paper, a less common type of abdominal wall hernia in a 30 year old male worker is presented with recurrence after first surgery {{when he returned to}} work. In contrast with almost all kinds of hernia, a lifelong limitation for heavy lifting was recommended. It seems that contrary to popular belief, work relatedness of abdominal wall hernia is seriously doubtful, although <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidences</b> are not enough. It is preferable to make decisions cautiously for return to heavy duties of work after surgery of large umbilical, umbilical & epigastric or incisional hernia, while avoiding recommendations for long days off work after surgery of any hernia...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the changes on ultrastructural {{features}} of the follicular cells along {{the growth of the}} oocyte of Pseudotylosurus microps (Gunther, 1868).

Very peculiar intercellular deposits forms between the perinucleolar and vitellogenic phase of oocyte maturation. Although largely referred to in the specialized literature, our attempts to correlate the follicular cells changes with the formation of the oocyte envelopes or even with an endocrine function are not supported by <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidences</b> in the present paper...|$|R

5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika.

5|$|However, {{the first}} <b>conclusive</b> <b>evidence</b> that the Balts were uniting is {{considered}} to be the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include 21 Lithuanian dukes; it specifies that five of those were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was Živinbudas, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother Dausprungas, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) and his brother Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E

Similarly, John Lesley writing around 1578, refers to the three foreign orders of chivalry carved on the gate of James V's Linlithgow Palace with his ornaments of St Andrew, proper to this nation.
