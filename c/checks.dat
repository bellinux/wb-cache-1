40|$|Ontology formal {{model and}} {{ontology}} <b>checking</b> recently {{are still under}} hot discussion. In this paper, an ontology concept model is constructed using Description Logics.

50|$|Non-sufficient funds (NSF) is a {{term used}} in the banking {{industry}} to indicate that a cheque cannot be honored because insufficient funds {{are available in the}} account on which the instrument was drawn.

5|$|Since {{substitute}} <b>checks</b> {{are considered}} legal <b>checks,</b> substitute <b>checks</b> {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute <b>checks</b> in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute <b>checks</b> include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

40|$|New {{websites}} and smartphone applications provide easy-click <b>checking</b> {{opportunities that}} can help consumers in many domains. However, this technology is not always used effectively. For example, many consumers skip <b>checking</b> Terms and Conditions links even when a quick evaluation of the terms can save them money, but they <b>check</b> their smartphone while driving even though this behavior is illegal and dangerous. Four laboratory experiments clarify the significance of one contributor to such contradictory deviations from effective <b>checking.</b> Studies 1, 2, and 3 show that, like basic decisions from experience, <b>checking</b> decisions reflect underweighting of rare events, {{which in turn is}} a sufficient condition for the coexistence of insufficient and too much <b>checking.</b> Insufficient <b>checking</b> emerges when most <b>checking</b> efforts impair performance even if <b>checking</b> is effective on average. Too much <b>checking</b> emerges when most <b>checking</b> clicks are rewarding even if <b>checking</b> is counterproductive on average. This pattern can be captured with a model that assumes reliance on small samples of past <b>checking</b> decision experiences. Study 4 shows that when the goal is to increase <b>checking,</b> interventions that increase the probability that <b>checking</b> leads to the best possible outcome can be far more effective than efforts to reduce the cost of <b>checking...</b>|$|R

Sometimes the term is extended to cover cases in which the king moves out of <b>check</b> and reveals a discovered <b>check</b> from another piece (this is also known as a royal check); it does not generally apply to cases where the original <b>checking</b> piece is captured, but it does apply to cases where the <b>check</b> is actually a checkmate (since there's no term [...] "cross-checkmate").|$|R

5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial <b>checks</b> on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional <b>checks.</b> One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such <b>checks</b> are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) tend to <b>check</b> repeatedly and after <b>checking</b> episodes {{they tend to}} be uncertain about their memory for <b>checked</b> events. It seems plausible that memory distrust motivates <b>checking,</b> but why <b>checking</b> is repeated and why one <b>check</b> is not enough to reassure the patient is uncertain. To study this, an interactive computer animation displaying light bulbs or gas rings was developed and healthy participants were asked to engage in repeated <b>checking.</b> In five separate experiments we found that repeatedly <b>checking</b> the same class of items resulted in sharp decreases in detail and vividness of memory of the <b>checked</b> events while the accuracy of the memory remained intact. The phenomenological quality of the experienced memory distrust was highly similar to the ambivalence OCD patients tend to report about their memory after <b>checking.</b> Furthermore, there were some indications that repeated <b>checking</b> not only undermines trust in memory, but may also reduce the sense that one acted responsibly. The experimental preparation may be used as a model for OCD <b>checking.</b> The study suggests that repeated <b>checking</b> is sufficient to cause paradoxical effects on memory trust and that repeated <b>checking</b> is a counterproductive safety strategy...|$|R
