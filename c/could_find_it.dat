Paraná did not need {{the support of the}} saquaremas, he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> elsewhere. Throughout his life, Paraná managed to set aside past grievances when doing so could further opportune alliances.

500|$|Greaney {{needed a}} setpiece for the episode that {{enabled him to}} get into a vision of the {{characters}} in the future, and The Simpsons writer George Meyer {{came up with the idea}} of the Indian casino. When Homer and Bart first enter the casino, Homer tells Bart that [...] "Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian." [...] He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying [...] "Hi-how-are-you?" [...] in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) [...] "did [...] so funny when we were at the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending." ...|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{a career}} in music in Ukraine meant having an {{unstable}} income, causing Leontovych to seek employment wherever he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> Leontovych worked in Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, and Podolia guberniyas {{over the next few}} years in order to remain gainfully employed. His first position after graduating was in a secondary school in the village of Chukiv (present-day Vinnytsia Oblast) as a vocal and math teacher. During this time Leontovych continued to transcribe and arrange folk songs. He completed his [...] "First compilation of songs from Podolia" [...] and began working on his second compilation. He also inspired the children at the school to sing in the choir and play in the orchestra. He would later write a book about this as a professor at the Kiev Conservatory, titled [...] "Як я організував оркестр у сільській школі" [...] (How I organized an orchestra in a village school).|$|E

Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that The Smeezingtons [...] " [...] making some of the most cohesive yet expansive pop music today...incredibly well-versed in the language of American music {{and the ways in which}} it can still be stretched and molded". In an analepsis, before Mars played at the Super Bowl Half-time show, Idolator critic Kathy Iandoli praised The Smeezingtons' work, in the single by Sugababes [...] "Get Sexy", calling them [...] "a crew of talented fellas". Erik Adams, music critic, of The A.V.

The Lettrist poet Isidore Isou included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by Charles Baudelaire with the [...] "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became [...] "destruction of the word for nothing".

500|$|Pocket Books {{published}} 250,000 {{copies of}} Killing Time {{in the first}} print run. After the publishing, Gene Roddenberry's assistant, Richard Arnold, {{received a letter from}} a reader stating that the book was suggesting a romantic link between Kirk and Spock. This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, who reportedly [...] "became livid". Following his complaints to Pocket Books, the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed. Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 and 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item. Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, [...] "If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in Killing Time, they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it...</b> Just as beauty is in supposedly {{in the mind of the}} beholder, so is questionable material." [...] More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition.|$|E

2500|$|When Nelson was 11 years old, {{the family}} moved to Fort Worth, where he barely survived typhoid fever after losing nearly half his body weight to the disease, which also left him unable to sire children. Soon after his baptism at age 12, he started caddying at Glen Garden Country Club. On his caddying days, Nelson said, [...] "I knew nothing about caddying at first, but it wasn't {{difficult}} to learn. The other caddies, though, didn't like to see any new ones, because that might mean they wouldn't get a job sometime." [...] An article on Nelson in Sports Illustrated noted that initially caddies were not permitted to play at the club: [...] "e would often practice in the dark, putting his white handkerchief over the hole so he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in the darkness." [...] The club later changed its policy and sponsored a caddie tournament, where a 14-year-old Nelson beat fellow caddie and future golf great Ben Hogan by a single stroke after a nine-hole playoff. Nelson and Hogan were rivals but close friends in their teen years, and for the first part of their professional careers as well, but Nelson's early success was difficult for the struggling Hogan to deal with, and they gradually grew apart, while retaining mutual respect.|$|E

2500|$|Recall {{that the}} moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on {{hypothetical}} imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. What would the categorical imperative look like? We know that it could never {{be based on the}} particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or commands), by definition, apply universally. [...] From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only {{in a way that the}} principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. [...] The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.|$|E

Attacks had been carried out on the 6 and 16 April {{and by the end}} of the month, seven ships had been sunk. More ominously, RAF Coastal Command was making better efforts to defend convoys against air attack. On 16 April, a Bristol Beaufighter from RAF Aldergrove shot down a Fw 200C-3 – the first Condor lost in action to an enemy fighter. On 18 April, another Condor was badly damaged by convoy fire from , and crashed in Ireland. Further {{operations}} failed. , [...] and [...] escaped the commands shadowing efforts. [...] and [...] were found on 11 and 14 May, sinking one ship from each convoy, but failed to guide any U-Boats to their targets. In May, only three ships sunk and one damaged. Around this time, the He 111 units were withdrawn owing to heavy losses in the Channel. They were replaced by Kampfgeschwader 26 and Kampfgeschwader 30, which had remained under Luftflotte 5 after the withdrawal of Fliegerkorps X to the Mediterranean. These units made up 20 He 111 and 24 Ju 88s, which operated directly against British shipping and ports. III./KG 40 also converted to the Fw 200 instead of the He 111, to allow it to operate further away from Britain and avoid air attack.|$|E
2500|$|Sergeant Buckland {{had given}} {{evidence}} on 3 March {{that he had}} investigated Dala and his evidence was so disparaging to Gribble's claims for the site that Commissioner Wood visited Dala on the 14th to see for himself. From what he found, Wood had no hesitation in declaring Buckland unreliable and less than candid with the commission and confirmed Gribble's account. The rainy season was late and the ash and footprints were still present and clearly visible (the first rain of the season fell {{the day after the}} Commission left). Sergeant Buckland had claimed that when he visited the site he found no evidence of a police camp, Wood found the site strewn with empty food cans and tobacco tins which he regarded as evidence of a police camp. A partially burnt tree surrounded by ash was peppered with what Gribble claimed were bullet scars but which Buckland had testified were marks made by stones or other blunt objects. Recalled by Wood, Buckland admitted that one of the marks had been a bullet scar and that Quartpot, a police tracker, had later dug a bullet from it which Wood asked to be produced. Constable Donegan, who had taken possession of the bullet, had said that he was not certain if he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> however it was found and given to Wood. Later, Inspector Douglas said that the bullet looked like a [...]44, the same caliber as the police issue Winchester although lighter in weight, but stated that it would be impossible for a bullet to pass through a human body and lodge in a tree behind it. Green noted that the Winchester rifle was a popular model carried by travelers in the area and that bullets extracted from trees in the Kimberley did not necessarily come from police rifles. At the subsequent trial of Regan and St Jack, Buckland repeated his testimony that there was no police camp at Dala, the tree scars had been made by a stone and the recovery of the bullet was never brought up.|$|E
