500|$|The first bombers {{equipped}} with Project E weapons were English Electric Canberra bombers based in Germany and the United Kingdom that {{were assigned to}} NATO. These were replaced by Vickers Valiant bombers in 1960 and 1961 as the long-range Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor assumed the strategic nuclear weapon delivery role. Project E weapons equipped V-bombers at three bases in the United Kingdom from 1958. Due to operational restrictions imposed by Project E, and the <b>consequential</b> <b>loss</b> of independence of half of the British nuclear deterrent, they were phased out in 1962 when sufficient British megaton weapons became available, but remained in use with the Valiants in the United Kingdom and RAF Germany until 1965.|$|E

40|$|In 1999, Italy {{experienced}} a devastating epidemic of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) {{caused by an}} H 7 N 1 virus subtype. After this epidemic, a ministerial decree was passed to implement control measures for low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) due to H 5 and H 7 subtypes. We investigated whether these control measures have decreased the public expenditure associated with epidemics of LPAI and HPAI by comparing the direct and <b>consequential</b> <b>losses</b> of the 1999 epidemic to the losses associated with successive epidemics. The estimated total economic burden of the epidemics was about € 650 million (€ 217 million in direct losses and € 433 million in <b>consequential</b> <b>losses).</b> The 1999 epidemic accounted for most of these losses (€ 507 million: € 112 million in direct losses and € 395 million in <b>consequential</b> <b>losses),</b> whereas the total economic burden for the 5 successive LPAI was € 143 million (€ 105 million in direct losses and € 38 million in <b>consequential</b> <b>losses).</b> These results demonstrate that {{the implementation of a}} coordinated set of diseasecontrol measures, which included both emergency and prophylactic vaccination, was able to reduce the overall costs associated with avian influenza epidemics. The results also show that the application of adequate LPAI control measures may limit the risk of emergence of an HPAI virus in an area with a high poultry density, allowing the complete disruption of the poultry market and its huge associated costs to be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Swine {{epidemics}} {{can have}} very large devastating financial consequences. Governments generally bear the direct losses, {{such as the}} value of destroyed animals. <b>Consequential</b> <b>losses,</b> such as the losses resulting from empty buildings and movement standstills, are completely borne by the farmers (and other participants of the production chain) involved. In the Netherlands, {{as a result of}} the 1997 / 1998 epidemic of classical swine fever, the government dramatically changed its risk financing policy, so that farmers now have to pay a significant amount of the direct losses themselves. The goal of this paper is to analyze how this amount can be financed most efficiently. Risk financing instruments studied include a fund, a bank guarantee and an insurance scheme. The paper also considers the opportunities for an insurance scheme for <b>consequential</b> <b>losses.</b> Risk financing instruments are evaluated on the costs and incentives for risk prevention. Costs are analyzed by using a Monte Carlo simulation model...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of an {{innocent}} misrepresentation, there can be no claim for delictual damages, since the misrepresentation was made without fault; nor a claim for contractual damages, since there is no breach of contract—unless, that is, the representation was warranted to be true.

It makes a difference, though, whether the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, negligently or innocently.

Only very recently was it decided that the same applies to a negligent misrepresentation. These damages, being delictual in character, are measured according to the plaintiff’s negative interest and include compensation for <b>consequential</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R
