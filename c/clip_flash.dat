5000|$|In a {{creative}} {{plan to get}} around the legal issues of releasing [...] "What Matters More" [...] without his label's approval, Webb composed a series of coded emails directing listeners to a secret website where they could piece together the missing track by playing an elaborate alternate reality game. The ARG became so popular that INO Records was forced to embrace Webb’s decision to leak the track and distribute it for free online. One of these emails included a code, indicated by random underscores in the text, which was part of a more elaborate set of clues that would lead to the artifacts, including downloads of audio and video <b>clips.</b> <b>Flash</b> drives hidden at coffee shops around the country pointed fans to websites where they could unlock a set of musical [...] "stubs" [...] derived from album tracks. The fans were then responsible for reordering and connecting the audio samples together, to construct the entire song piece by digital piece. Once the song's stubs were all collected, the release announcement for the album was unlocked.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Knock You Down", {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, premiered on March 23, 2009. The video begins with Hilson slowly falling backwards onto a bed, and then West appears and raps the introduction. Both start reflecting on their previous relationship, before the <b>clip</b> <b>flashes</b> {{back to the}} previous events. West is shown to be an artist, who is painting a portrait of Hilson. Hilson and West begin to caress each other, as she as shown in several seductive poses in a bed and sings {{in front of a}} white backdrop. The video returns to the present, showing Hilson and West breaking up, as both of them fall backwards onto the floor, similar to the way Hilson falls onto the bed in the opening sequence. Visual effects come into play greater in this scene, as when West falls, he shatters into pieces. Ne-Yo then appears, and sings his lines in front of a grey backdrop. Ne-Yo and Hilson proceed to go on a date at a party in West and Hilson's apartment, and are seen being affectionate by West. He then confronts Hilson, and Ne-Yo also approaches the duo before Hilson walks off, torn between the two men. The clip ends with Hilson falling backwards onto a bed, in similar fashion as the opening scene.|$|R

The stage featured dozens of large video screens that showed visual effects, video <b>clips,</b> and <b>flashing</b> text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles. Channel surfing, prank calls, video confessionals, a belly dancer, and live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo were incorporated into the shows. On stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including the leather-clad egomaniac [...] "The Fly", the greedy televangelist [...] "Mirror Ball Man", and the devilish [...] "MacPhisto". In contrast to other U2 tours, each of the Zoo TV shows opened with six to eight consecutive new songs before older material was played.|$|R
5000|$|The Hollywood Blues Tour was {{a concert}} tour through the United States and Canada, {{undertaken}} by American rock band ZZ Top. Named after a warm-up {{show at the}} House of Blues in West Hollywood, California, the tour was their second of which to be staged without a supporting album. As a result, they did not perform any newer material. Although this was a criticism for the tour, it was generally well-received—a critic from The Florida Times-Union regarded the band as [...] "one of rock's most reliable acts; you just know they're {{going to put on}} a good show". In contrast to ZZ Top's elaborately-staged productions from previous tours, the Hollywood Blues Tour utilized an austere stage setup. To embrace the group's renowned concept of visual imagery, the stage featured an LED drape for a backdrop video screen that showed visual effects, video <b>clips</b> and <b>flashing</b> text phrases, along with amplifiers stacks and a Van de Graaff generator.|$|R
5000|$|Viral {{advertising}} is personal and, while coming from an identified sponsor, {{it does not}} mean businesses pay for its distribution. Most of the well-known viral ads circulating online are ads paid by a sponsor company, launched either on their own platform (company webpage or social media profile) or on social media websites such as YouTube. Consumers receive the page link from a social media network or copy the entire ad from a website and pass it along through e-mail or posting it on a blog, webpage or social media profile. Viral marketing may take the form of video <b>clips,</b> interactive <b>Flash</b> games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, text messages, email messages, or web pages. The most commonly utilized transmission vehicles for viral messages include: pass-along based, incentive based, trendy based, and undercover based. However, the creative nature of viral marketing enables an [...] "endless amount of potential forms and vehicles the messages can utilize for transmission", including mobile devices.|$|R
5000|$|Viral {{marketing}} and viral advertising are buzzwords referring to marketing techniques that use pre-existing social networks to produce increases in brand awareness or to achieve other marketing objectives (such as product sales) through self-replicating viral processes, {{analogous to the}} spread of virus or computer viruses. It can be word-of-mouth delivered or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet. Viral promotions may take the form of video <b>clips,</b> interactive <b>Flash</b> games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, or even text messages. The goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to identify individuals with high social networking potential (SNP) - and have a high probability of being taken by another competitor—and create viral messages that appeal to this segment of the population. The term [...] "viral marketing" [...] has also been used pejoratively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns—the unscrupulous use of astroturfing on-line combined with undermarket advertising in shopping centers to create the impression of spontaneous word-of-mouth enthusiasm.|$|R

40|$|To have a rich {{presentation}} of a topic, {{it is not only}} expected that many relevant multimodal information, including images, text, audio and video, could be extracted; {{it is also important to}} organize and summarize the related information, and provide users a concise and informative storyboard about the target topic. It facilitates users to quickly grasp and better understand the content of a topic. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically generating a rich {{presentation of}} a given semantic topic. In our proposed approach, the related multimodal information of a given topic is first extracted from available multimedia databases or websites. Since each topic usually contains multiple events, a text-based event clustering algorithm is then performed with a generative model. Other media information, such as the representative images, possibly available video <b>clips</b> and <b>flashes</b> (interactive animates), are associated with each related event. A storyboard of the target topic is thus generated by integrating each event and its corresponding multimodal information. Finally, to make the storyboard more expressive and attractive, an incidental music is chosen as background and is aligned with the storyboard. A user study indicates that the presented system works quite well on our testing examples...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{generation}} of high technology. Our daily life is full of computing in the aspects of work and leisure. Computing also influences on art, and now a computer can be {{a new form of}} representation. Artists use computers to create and show their art works, and viewers now not only view those art works but also involve in art works through the interactivity of a computer. Motion graphics are attractive. Flash based programs are rich in interaction. This project combines the two features to create a user driven art that promotes classical music to children and of course to every one. In such an interactive and attractive way, users enjoy the music and listen to the three world-known songs from Saint Saëns 2 ̆ 7 s Carnival of Animals- Royal March of Lion, Aquarium, and the Swan. When the music starts, by clicking the mouse, users can add motion graphics related to the music on a computer screen. It is a problem {{to figure out a way}} to generate pixel-based motion graphics with Flash, which usually deals with vector images. First built are the codes, that give this project functions of interaction. Users can choose a song, add motion graphics on a computer screen, pause or play the music, change the volume of the sound, choose different color, and print out images they create. The rest are the motion graphics, that reflect the unique theme of each song. In order to display well, different methods are examined to generate motion graphics, including loading FLV files exported by After Effects, and adding movie <b>clips</b> built in <b>Flash,</b> and more. The result shows that adding movie <b>clips</b> built in <b>Flash</b> is the best way. Other ways result in the pixilated edges of graphics, the difficulty of making alpha movies, or other technical problems. Having the capabilities of enabling users to control the program and displaying motion graphics in high quality, this project performs as a new medium introducing classical music to new generations...|$|R

Soramimi clips in Israel were almost {{exclusively}} the work of amateurs publishing their work on the internet, and were popular mainly during the mid-2000s, with the most transcribed musical group being Era.
