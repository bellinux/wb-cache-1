Several officers were among the captured, the public criticism grew hard on Musharraf.|$|E

25|$|The {{closeness}} of the action, and coordinated fire {{from both sides of}} the valley indicated that the attackers in this ambush were different than the groups that were using sporadic, long range, harassing fire in the past. The latest acronym for attackers used by the Americans was AAF, for anti-Afghan fighters. These AAF were more professional and probably represented groups from areas outside of Nuristan. They would be Pashtuns, who hated the Tajiks and Hazara tribes that made up the ANA, or Afghan National Army. The AAF would disguise themselves in ANA uniforms and set up fake checkpoints to extract taxes and tolls from local contractors, and allied themselves with smugglers transporting illegal timber and gems across the border into Pakistan. Urdu and Pashtun HIG warriors bringing in arms and ammunition from Pakistan would cross the border in the other direction. Their fake government <b>check</b> <b>points</b> and “taxes” would finance and complete the economic cycle and serve to finance AAF operations. On the whole the AAF was a broader based and more formidable force in 2007 than before the American invasion, and represented a significant escalation.|$|E

40|$|Memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> is {{a pivotal}} {{technique}} in systems reliability, with applications ranging from crash recovery to replay debugging. Unfortunately, many traditional memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> use-cases require high-frequency checkpoints, something for which existing application-level solutions are not well-suited. The {{problem is that}} they incur either substantial run-time performance overhead, or poor memory usage guarantees. As a result, their application in practice is hampered. This paper presents Lightweight Memory <b>Check</b> <b>pointing</b> (LMC), a new user-level memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> technique that combines low performance overhead with strong memory usage guarantees for high <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> frequencies. To this end, LMC relies on compiler-based instrumentation to shadow the entire memory address space of the running program and incrementally checkpoint modified memory bytes in a LMC-maintained shadow state. Our evaluation on popular server applications demonstrates the viability of our approach in practice, confirming that LMC imposes low performance overhead with strictly bounded memory usage at runtime...|$|R

2500|$|Initially {{the weapons}} issued were of WW2 vintage such as Lee–Enfield rifles and Sten sub machine guns.

Small stocks of Federal Riot Guns (FRG) were kept and used to fire plastic bullets to knock down doors and other obstacles during search operations. A number of Carl Gustav (Charlie G) 84mm recoilless rifles were stocked but rarely deployed as the weapon was unsuited to most operations. (see Boat Sections below).

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{overview}} of decentralized <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> using QOS in MOG. <b>Check</b> <b>pointing</b> is more crucial in MOG systems than in their conventional wired counter parts due to host mobility. Dynamically, less reliable wireless links frequent disconnections and variation in mobile systems. The algorithms and protocols than we can take an adaptive protocol to reduce the overhead and leasing mechanism is for storage but have a problem that can overcome by synchronous snapshot algorithm {{is that we have}} rollback/recovery algorithm but have low communication, and storage overhead. The mutable checkpoints should be minimized. If we talk about a large scale super computing system with coordinated <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and rollback recovery. We have work fraction is relatively low correlated failures must be taken in to account. We can also see an NP-Complete problem, so these all problems can overcome by using an algorithm said to be as Reliability Driven (ReD). With ReD an MH simply sends its <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data to one selected neighboring MH, and also serves as a stable point of storage for <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data received from a single approved neighboring MH. Here ReD works to maximize the probability of <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data recovery during job execution.
