5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler <b>crank</b> <b>arm,</b> an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> with a spider and chainring, and a right <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left hand thread for a special freewheel must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|E
25|$|Cheaper cranksets {{may have}} the chainrings welded or riveted {{directly}} to the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> or spider. More expensive sets have the chainrings bolted on {{so that they can}} be replaced if worn or damaged, or to provide different gearing.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the effects of independent <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> and slope on pedaling kinetics during an anaerobic maximal-effort cycling bout. After undergoing 6 weeks of training with independent <b>crank</b> <b>arms,</b> each of 6 male cyclists completed four 30 s Wingate tests under different cycling conditions of: fixed <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> on level surface; fixed <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> on a slope; independent <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> on level, and; independent <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> on a slope. Two-dimensional pedal forces recorded using instrumented pedals were used to derive pedaling effectiveness, work distribution and power output. The effects of the <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> and the slope were minimal, but highly effective and consistent pedaling force (90 % effectiveness, 70 % work and effective force of 155 ± 6 N) was observed between 45 - 135 ˚ of the crank cycle in all experimental conditions...|$|R
2500|$|Marketed {{and known}} {{by a variety}} of names (Z-cranks, P.M.P cranks, etc.) non-straight <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> have been {{introduced}} several times. However, [...] "as long as the distance from crank axle to pedal is fixed, there is no pedaling advantage in using bent crank arms".

2500|$|On older styles, the spider—the multi-armed {{piece that}} connects the {{chainring}} to the bottom bracket axle—was a separate piece from the <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> The most common modern cranks have an integrated spider on the drive-side <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> [...] However, Middleburn, TA, and Surly currently produce cranks with separate detachable spiders, enabling {{a wide variety of}} chainring patterns to be used with the same cranks.|$|E
2500|$|No one {{was injured}} on Sarah Dixon, but the boat itself was {{sustained}} serious damage, {{both from the}} direct crash by the Larsen and from being jammed into the Henderson. The outside cylinder timbers were smashed, a stern-wheel <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> (called a “pitman”) was broken, the guards were badly damaged, as was the cabin structure. [...] Witnesses to the event said {{it looked like the}} Dixon would be cut in two.|$|E
2500|$|It takes {{a couple}} of weeks of regular use to become {{accustomed}} to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. [...] However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching back and forth between crankset types only takes a minute or two. [...] Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor's Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> movements that allow application of power through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. [...] Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the front derailleur, while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.|$|E
25|$|Note that if {{a normal}} right-side-drive {{crankset}} is installed backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal holes {{at the end of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>arms</b> would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen the pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the <b>crank</b> <b>arms.</b> A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. [...] This generally equates to [...] "no visible slack". [...] A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> and pulls the rear triangle forwards. [...] On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. [...] Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. [...] Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|E

50|$|When {{the stroke}} of a {{mechanism}} needs to be calculated, first identify the ground level for the specified slider-crank mechanism. This ground level is the axis on which both the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> pivot-point and the slider pin are positioned. Draw the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> pivot point anywhere on this ground level. Once the pin positions are correctly placed, set a graphical compass to the given link length of the <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> Positioning the compass point on the pivot point of the <b>crank</b> <b>arm,</b> rotate the compass to produce a circle with radius equal {{to the length of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> This newly drawn circle represents the potential motion of the <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> Next, draw two models of the mechanism. These models will be oriented in a way that displays both the extreme positions of the slider. Once both diagrams are drawn, the linear distance between the retracted slider and the extended slider can be easily measured to determine the slider-crank stroke.|$|E

50|$|The {{retracted}} {{position of the}} slider is determined by further graphical evaluation. Now that the crank path is found, draw the crank slider arm in the position that places it {{as far away as}} possible from the slider. Once drawn, the <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> should be coincident with the ground level axis that was initially drawn. Next, from the free point on the <b>crank</b> <b>arm,</b> draw the follower link using its measured or given length. Draw this length coincident with the ground level axis but in the direction toward the slider. The unhinged end of the follower will now be at the fully {{retracted position}} of the slider. Next, the extended position of the slider needs to be determined. From the pivot point of the <b>crank</b> <b>arm,</b> draw a new <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> coincident with the ground level axis but in a position closest to the slider. This position should put the new <b>crank</b> <b>arm</b> at an angle of 180 degrees away from the retracted <b>crank</b> <b>arm.</b> Then draw the follower link with its given length {{in the same manner as}} previously mentioned. The unhinged point of the new follower will now be at the fully extended position of the slider.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{asynchronous}} (ASY) <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> (cranks at 180 ° relative to each other) with synchronous (SYN) <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> (parallel crank setting) during the 30 s Wingate anaerobic test. Methods: Thirty-two physically active men (aged 22. 1 ± 2. 4 y) completed two Wingate tests (one ASY and one SYN) separated by 4 d in a randomized counterbalanced order. The Wingate tests were completed on a modified electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Performance measures assessed during the two tests include peak power, mean power, minimum power, time to peak power, rate to fatigue and maximum cadence (RPMmax). Blood lactate concentration was also measured before and 5 min after the tests. Results: Peak and mean power (both absolute and relative to body weight) during SYN <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> were significantly (p < 0. 001) less than during ASY <b>arm</b> <b>cranking.</b> Rate to fatigue and RPMmax were also significantly (p = 0. 012) lower during SYN <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> compared with ASY <b>arm</b> <b>cranking.</b> No significant difference was found between test conditions for minimum power, time to peak power or blood lactate concentration. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ASY <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> results in higher peak and mean anaerobic power compared with SYN <b>arm</b> <b>cranking</b> during the Wingate test. Therefore, an ASY <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> configuration should be used to assess anaerobic power in most individuals although specific population groups may require further testing to determine which crank configuration is most suitable for the Wingate test...|$|R

Hence, we investigated whether an adapted submaximal <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> test on an ergometer for the upper body is reliable to use, and if the submaximal test for the <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> ergometer is valid compared to the test on the bicycle ergometer. Different types of reliability measures of the adapted submaximal test on an <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> ergometer were assessed in healthy volunteers, such as test-retest, interobserver, interergometer, and between <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> and bicycle ergometer. A crossover design was used. The measurements were proportionally distributed over 30 volunteers. Based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the magnitude of within-person differences, we revealed a good reliability of the submaximal test. For the test-retest reliability, the ICC was 0. 76, the interobserver reliability was 0. 82, and the interergometer reliability 0. 63. In addition, the criterion validity was also tested by comparing the calculated [latin capital V with dot above]o 2 max during the submaximal test on the <b>arm</b> <b>crank</b> ergometer and on the bicycle ergometer.
