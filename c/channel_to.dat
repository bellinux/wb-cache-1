5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol <b>Channel</b> <b>to</b> the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which would have run from the Bristol <b>Channel</b> <b>to</b> Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the Bristol <b>Channel)</b> <b>to</b> Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} loss of the battle Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the <b>channel</b> <b>to</b> attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
