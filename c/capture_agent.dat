50|$|Neutron capture therapy (NCT) is a noninvasive {{therapeutic}} modality {{for treating}} locally invasive malignant tumors such as primary brain tumors and recurrent {{head and neck}} cancer. Briefly summarized, it is a two-step procedure: first, the patient is injected with a tumor-localizing drug containing the non-radioactive isotope boron-10 (10B) that has a high propensity or cross section (σ) to capture slow neutrons. The {{cross section of the}} 10B is many times greater than that of the other elements present in tissues such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the second step, the patient is radiated with epithermal neutrons, the source of which is either a nuclear reactor or, more recently, an accelerator. After losing energy as they penetrate tissue, the neutrons are absorbed by the <b>capture</b> <b>agent,</b> which subsequently emits high-energy charged particles that can selectively kill tumor cells that have taken up sufficient quantities of 10B (Fig.1).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{technologies for}} the rapid and scalable production of high-affinity, high-specificity protein <b>capture</b> <b>agents</b> which possess the affinities and specificities of antibodies, but also exhibit improved chemical, biochemical, and physical stability. I will discuss how the chemical flexibility of comprehensive, one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) libraries of oligopeptides {{may be combined}} with iterative in situ click chemistry to select multi-ligand <b>capture</b> <b>agents.</b> Large OBOC libraries {{form the basis of}} individual peptide ligands, and also permit chemically designed stability through the incorporation of artificial (azide or acetylene) and non-natural amino acid building blocks. The in situ click chemistry method then utilizes the target protein as the catalyst, or template, for assembling its own biligand via formation of a 1, 2, 3 -triazole linkage between two individual ligands (azide and acetylene). This process can be repeated to produce triligands, tetraligands, and other higher-order multi-ligands with an accompanying increase in affinity and specificity through cooperative interactions. Once found, multi-ligand <b>capture</b> <b>agents</b> can be produced in gram amounts via conventional synthetic methods such as the Cu(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). This is a general and robust strategy for the inexpensive, high-throughput construction of protein <b>capture</b> <b>agents</b> that can be exploited to detect protein biomarkers in multi-parameter clinical diagnostic assays. While high-affinity protein <b>capture</b> <b>agents</b> represent a significant technology advance, they are just one component of what is necessary for highly multiplexed measurements of protein biomarkers. It is also important to develop or optimize the actual assay platforms that can enable sensitive multi-parameter protein measurements using these <b>capture</b> <b>agents.</b> Silicon nanowire (SiNW) nanoelectronic sensors can provide quantitative, label-free multi-parameter measurements of protein biomarkers in real time. However, SiNW sensors can be challenging to deploy because unprotected Si forms a native oxide layer that can significantly reduce the detection sensitivity of the nanowire sensors via dielectric shielding. Another technical challenge is the development of chemistries which allow for the selective encoding of nanowire surfaces with the <b>capture</b> <b>agents.</b> To overcome these challenges, the final part of this thesis presents a general method to functionalize organic and biological molecules on highly passivated Si(111) surfaces with minimal surface oxidation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{currently}} {{great interest in}} the fabrication of protein-detecting arrays comprised {{of large numbers of}} immobilized protein <b>capture</b> <b>agents.</b> While most efforts in this arena have focused on the use of biomolecules such as antibodies and nucleic acid aptamers as <b>capture</b> <b>agents,</b> synthetic species have many potential advantages. However, synthetic molecules isolated from combinatorial libraries generally do not bind target proteins with the high affinity necessary for array applications. Here, we demonstrate that simple linear peptides bind dimeric proteins tenaciously when immobilized, although they exhibit only modest affinity in solution. These data show that high-affinity bidentate <b>capture</b> <b>agents</b> for dimeric proteins can be created by simply immobilizing modest-affinity ligands on a surface at high density, bypassing the requirement for careful optimization of linker length and geometry that is normally required to create a high-affinity solution bidentate ligand...|$|R
50|$|BNCT of {{patients}} with brain tumors was resumed in the United States in the mid-1990s by Chanana, Diaz, and Coderre and their co-workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) and at Harvard/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) using the MIT Research Reactor (MITR). For the first time, BPA {{was used as the}} boron delivery agent, and patients were irradiated with a collimated beam of higher energy epithermal neutrons, which had greater tissue-penetrating properties than thermal neutrons. A research group headed up by Zamenhof at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and MIT was the first to use an epithermal neutron beam for clinical trials. Initially patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated and this was expanded to include patients with brain tumors, specifically melanoma metastatic to the brain and primary glioblastomas (GBMs). Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an epithermal neutron beam at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the <b>capture</b> <b>agent.</b> The clinical outcome of the cases treated at Harvard-MIT has been summarized by Busse. Although the treatment was well tolerated, {{there were no significant differences}} in the mean survival times {{of patients}} that had received BNCT compared to those who received conventional external beam X-irradiation.|$|E
50|$|There {{also has}} been {{interest}} in the possible use of gadolinium-157 (157Gd) as a <b>capture</b> <b>agent</b> for NCT for the following reasons: First, and foremost, has been its very high neutron capture cross section of 254,000 barns. Second, gadolinium compounds, such as Gd-DTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine Magnevist®), have been used routinely as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain tumors and have shown high uptake by brain tumor cells in tissue culture (in vitro). Third, gamma rays and internal conversion and Auger electrons are products of the 157Gd (n,γ)158Gd capture reaction (157Gd + nth (0.025eV) → 158Gd → 158Gd + γ + 7.94 MeV). Although the gamma rays have long pathlengths, orders of magnitude greater depths of penetration compared with the other radiations, the other radiation products (internal conversion and Auger electrons) have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter and can directly damage DNA. Therefore, it would be highly advantageous {{for the production of}} DNA damage if the 157Gd were localized within the cell nucleus. However, the possibility of incorporating gadolinium into biologically active molecules is very limited and {{only a small number of}} potential delivery agents for Gd NCT have been studied. Relatively few studies with Gd have been carried out in experimental animals compared to the large number with boron containing compounds (Table 1), which have been synthesized and evaluated in experimental animals (in vivo). Although in vitro activity has been demonstrated using the Gd-containing MRI contrast agent Magnevist® as the Gd delivery agent, there are very few studies demonstrating the efficacy of Gd NCT in experimental animal tumor models, and Gd NCT has to date never been used clinically (i.e., in humans).|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a robust and {{sensitive}} approach for detecting protective antigen (PA) exotoxin from Bacillus anthracis in complex media.

(2. 1 pM) in buffer, with minimal sensitivity reduction in 1 % serum. The powdered <b>capture</b> <b>agent</b> could be stably stored for several days at 65 °C, and the full electrochemical biosensor showed no loss of performance after extended storage at 40 °C.

The chemokine CXCL 8 is an interesting protein target due to its involvement in the human inflammatory response. We constructed a novel structural model of CXCL 8 interaction with its G-protein coupled receptor CXCR 1, taking into account previously reported experimental data. From this CXCL 8 :CXCR 1 model complex, the interaction of CXCL 8 with residues near the extracellular domains 3 and 4 of CXCR 1 were used as a scaffold for the rational design of a peptide <b>capture</b> <b>agent</b> called ‘IL 8 RPLoops’. A molecular dynamics simulation of IL 8 RPLoops indicates a stable helical conformation consistent with the CXCR 1 structure from which it was derived. CXCL 8 capture in fluorescence-based assays on beads and on glass demonstrates that IL 8 RPLoops is an effective <b>capture</b> <b>agent</b> for CXCL 8. Additionally, we found IL 8 RPLoops to be a potent inhibitor of CXCL 8 -induced neutrophil migration and CXCL 8 :CXCR 1 association.

40|$|Affinity agents {{increase}} microdialysis protein relative recovery, {{yet they}} have not seen widespread use within the microdialysis community due to their additional instrumentation requirements and prohibitive cost. This dissertation describes new affinity agents for microdialysis that require no additional instrumentation to use, have nearly 100 % particle recovery, are 7 times more cost efficient than alternatives, and have low specificity enabling their use {{for a wide variety}} of proteins. Initially gold nanoparticles were chosen as an affinity ligand support due to their high surface area/volume ratio and colloidal stability. Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) was immobilized to the gold nanoparticles, which served to sterically stabilize the particles and to act as a generic, reversible protein <b>capture</b> <b>agent.</b> A method was developed to reproducibly vary and quantify poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) graft density from 0. 09 to 0. 40 ligands/nm 2 on gold nanoparticles. During characterization of the polymer coated gold nanoparticles, irreversible particle agglomeration was observed at low polymer graft density in ionic solutions, which prevented further development as a protein <b>capture</b> <b>agent.</b> Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels, which have low nonspecific adsorption, low interparticle attractive forces owing to the low curvature of the particle, and a low Hamaker constant, were synthesized to overcome the agglomeration problem. A generic protein affinity ligand cibacron blue, was immobilized to the nanogels, which enabled rapid determination of particle recovery. The perfusion of the nanogels through a microdialysis probe was optimized yielding ~ 100 % particle recovery using a combination of a syringe and peristaltic pump. The microdialysis collection efficiency of CCL 2, a physiologically relevant cytokine, was increased 3 -fold with addition of the nanogel to the microdialysis perfusion fluid. The reduction in instrumentation requirements, low cost, and low specificity obtained with the new affinity agents will lead to increased affinity agent use for microdiaylsis protein sampling...|$|E
