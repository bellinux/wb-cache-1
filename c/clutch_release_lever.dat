40|$|Abstract: A simple {{model for}} driver and vehicle in {{longitudinal}} motion is developed and simulated. The {{focus is on}} describing and handling simulation of clutch lock and <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> which changes the model structure, both during start and gear shifts, in Simulink. Special attention is given the problem of simulating start and stop of a vehicle with rolling resistance at zero speed. Only principles for simulating the system with variable structure is of interest and therefore the models are maintained at lowest possible complexity. The system is successfully simulated and the validation is performed using three scenarios: one with only clutch lock and <b>clutch</b> <b>release,</b> one with start and stop of vehicle, and one full European drive-cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Commercial vehicle <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> {{bearings}} {{working at}} high speed, strong vibration,high temperature, damp and easy pollution conditions. Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the release bearing rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other. New life prediction model for the release bearing based on L-P theory and Tallian model,in which influence factors of fatigue life is introduced on the smelting process, surface defect, surface roughness, residual stress, elastohydrodynamic lubrication oil film, environmental cleanliness, temperature, the effect of varying load characteristics and other factors of fatigue life. The results show that: the <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing life prediction model of new and more close to the real conditions of automobile clutch, provide the theory basis {{for the development of a}} new generation high-speed heavy-duty <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing of the commercial vehicle...|$|R
