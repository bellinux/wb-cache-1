Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985â€“87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like <b>committee</b> <b>reports,</b> than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

5|$|The United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) is a West Group {{publication}} that collects selected congressional and administrative materials {{for publication in}} a single resource. U.S.C.C.A.N. {{was first published in}} 1941 with the 1st Session of the 77th Congress and has been published with every session of Congress since. U.S.C.C.A.N. is published in monthly pamphlets that contain a cumulative subject index and cumulative Table of Laws Enacted in addition to the selected documents. The pamphlets are then reissued in bound volumes after each session of Congress concludes. Among other documents, U.S.C.C.A.N. publishes the full text of new federal laws, selected <b>committee</b> <b>reports</b> from the House and Senate, signing statements, presidential proclamations, executive orders, reorganization plans, President's messages, federal regulations, proposed constitutional amendments, federal court rules, and sentencing guidelines all arranged in chronological order.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous <b>committee</b> <b>reports</b> that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the <b>committee</b> <b>reports</b> back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E

25|$|The House Rules {{provide that}} the {{chairman}} of a committee presides over its meetings, maintains decorum and ensures that the committee adheres to the House Rules governing committees and generally acts in an administrative role respective to such issues as determining salaries of committee staff, issuing congressional subpoenas for testimony and issuing <b>committee</b> <b>reports.</b> The committee's minority may also issue a Minority Report at their discretion. Also, a committee chairman along with the ranking member generally control the time each receives on the House Floor respective to a bill that originated or was reported out of their committee. The ranking member is second to the chairman.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{was then}} Leader of the House of Commons from 1998 until her {{replacement}} by Robin Cook in June 2001. Her tenure saw {{the introduction of}} Westminster Hall debates, which are debates held in a small chamber near Westminster Hall on topics of interest to individual MPs, <b>committee</b> <b>reports,</b> and other matters that would not ordinarily be debated in the Commons chamber. Debates {{that take place in}} Westminster Hall are often more consensual and informal, and can address the concerns of backbenchers. She received admiration for her work as Leader of the House, working on this {{and a number of other}} elements of the Labour government's modernisation agenda for Parliament. In 2000 she expressed republican sympathies.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, the {{confirmation}} process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination {{should go to the}} full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955. Once the <b>committee</b> <b>reports</b> out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1975, congressional Church <b>Committee</b> <b>reports</b> and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report {{revealed}} {{to the public for}} the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973. However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.|$|E
25|$|Each Senate {{committee}} and subcommittee {{is led by}} a chair (usually {{a member of the}} majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility. Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage {{on the floor of the}} full Senate the consideration of those bills the <b>committee</b> <b>reports.</b> This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before reform. The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member. In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.|$|E
