5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing <b>ciphering</b> machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E

They have three minutes to complete each question.

At the competitions with this test, it is included along with the individual test scores and team score for the total team score.|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Lincoln {{disliked the}} hard labor {{associated}} with frontier life. Some {{of his neighbors}} and family members thought for a {{time that he was}} lazy for all his [...] "reading, scribbling, writing, <b>ciphering,</b> writing Poetry, etc.", and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy [...] "physical labor", but loved to read. Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family, neighbors, and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Weems's The Life of Washington, and Franklin's Autobiography, among others.|$|E

These begin with relatively simple substitution <b>ciphers,</b> including the Bacon <b>cipher</b> and Polybius square, {{before moving on to}} transposition <b>ciphers,</b> Playfair <b>ciphers</b> and polyalphabetic <b>ciphers</b> such as the Vigenère <b>cipher,</b> the Autokey <b>cipher</b> and the Alberti <b>cipher.</b> In the later stages of the competition, the ADFGVX <b>cipher,</b> the Solitaire <b>cipher,</b> the Double Playfair <b>cipher,</b> the Hill <b>cipher,</b> the Book <b>cipher</b> and versions of the Enigma and Fialka <b>cipher</b> machines have all been used. The 2009 challenge ended with a Jefferson Disk <b>cipher,</b> the 2012 challenge ended with the ADFGVX <b>Cipher,</b> the 2014 with the Playfair <b>Cipher,</b> and the most recent challenge ended with a sectioned Cadenus transposition.|$|R

5000|$|Revised {{release in}} 2013, list was divided to three, [...] "e-Government Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List", [...] "Candidate Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List", and [...] "Monitored <b>Ciphers</b> List". Most of Japanese <b>ciphers</b> listed in {{previous}} list (except for Camellia) {{have moved from}} [...] "Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List" [...] to [...] "Candidate Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List". There were several new proposals like CLEFIA (Sony) as 128 bit block <b>cipher,</b> KCipher-2 (KDDI), Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream <b>ciphers,</b> however, only KCipher-2 has been listed on [...] "e-Government Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List". The reason why most of Japanese <b>ciphers</b> have not been selected as [...] "Recommended Ciphers" [...] is not that these <b>ciphers</b> are unsafe, but that these <b>ciphers</b> are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, international standards. There is possibility that <b>ciphers</b> listed on [...] "Candidate Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List" [...] will be moved to [...] "e-Government Recommended <b>Ciphers</b> List" [...] when they are used in many systems.|$|R
2500|$|In summer 1878, Tribune editor Whitelaw Reid {{published}} {{several of}} the enciphered telegrams in response to Tilden ally Manton Marble, who had publicly compared the alleged secrecy of Republicans with Tilden's supposed openness. Reid implied that the <b>ciphering</b> of the messages showed Democratic hypocrisy, and suggested that Republicans try to decipher the messages {{in order to learn}} their content. Other Republicans sent him additional ciphered telegrams. Eventually, nearly 400 telegrams were deciphered, mostly by Reid's Tribune staff. [...] In October, the Tribune published the story of the Democratic effort to sway election officials in the three disputed states, including the ciphered text of the messages and the details of the decryption.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>cipher</b> {{algorithms}} are {{categorized by}} block <b>cipher,</b> stream <b>cipher</b> and HASH, {{and they are}} weighed in faithful transmission which is known as independent condition. In faithful transmission, the <b>ciphers</b> are studied because of their root <b>cipher.</b> Intelligent application of <b>ciphers</b> is a direction that uses Bayesian model of cognition science. Bayesian inference is a rational engine for solving such problems within a probabilistic framework, and consequently {{is the heart of}} most probabilistic models of weighing the <b>ciphers.</b> The approach of this paper is that <b>ciphers,</b> which are considered as a suitable weight <b>cipher</b> to kinds of networks, are ranged based on root <b>ciphers.</b> This paper shows the other kinds of transformation among the different <b>cipher</b> algorithms themselves...|$|R
