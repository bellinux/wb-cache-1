30|$|Four types welding {{methods are}} {{typically}} used: linear welding, orbital friction welding, <b>circular</b> <b>welding,</b> and rotation welding. These methods differ in velocity and force. In linear and orbital friction welding, the velocity and frictional force is a sinusoidal wave caused by linear oscillatory and elliptical movement, respectively, during welding. For circular and rotation welding, the velocity and frictional force are constant and {{caused by a}} circular and rotation movement [3]. Linear welding and rotation welding have been well studied. Linear welding occurs with high-speed linear motion between the surfaces of two wood blocks. In this method, the welding pressure, amplitude, frequency, holding pressure, and time are the main parameters affecting welding efficiency. In contrast, wood dowel welding with lignin softening and degradation {{is caused by the}} increase in temperature resulting from the friction generated by the high-speed rotation between the wood dowel and the substrate hole [4 – 7].|$|E

This study presented the design, analysis, and simulation of a pipe-welding robot with fixed plinth for a constant <b>circular</b> <b>welding</b> around the pipes. Design of a welding robot capable of keeping the electrode orientation, welding speed, and distance between electrode and pipe surface constant can improve the quality of welding; thus, a five-linked articulated robot was designed for this purpose.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microstructural and mechanical characterisation of laser-welded lap joints in {{low carbon steel}} thin sheets. Different combinations of steel types (DC 05, S 355 MC) and thickness values are used to assemble welded specimens with linear and <b>circular</b> <b>weld</b> bead. Metallurgical observations and micro-hardness tests are used to characterise the weld microstructure. Mechanical response in tensile test is then {{used to evaluate the}} static strength, rotation angle of weld bead and failure mode of welded specimens. Lap-joints with <b>circular</b> <b>weld</b> showed a lower rotation angle compared to linear welds. The fracture in all tested specimens occurred at the base metal, far away from the weld. A simplified mechanical model is finally proposed to derive theoretical formulae for estimating the tensile strength of welded joints as a function of material properties and weld geometry. The analytical results are in good agreement with experimental findings and they estimate an increased strength for <b>circular</b> <b>welds,</b> compared to linear weld with same lateral width.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the weight}} {{reduction}} of drive train in automotive, {{it is necessary}} to fabricate <b>circular</b> <b>weld</b> of die casting aluminum alloy and carbon steel with high welding efficiency. In this study, friction stir welding of ADC 12 and S 45 C with <b>circular</b> <b>weld</b> line was evaluated, and the effect of welding tool shape was investigated for improving the weldability. The welding tool with flat shoulder was possible to fabricate the weld of ADC 12 and S 45 C with a thin reaction layer with less than 1 μm. However, the mechanical strength of the weld was lower than that of ADC 12. This is attributed to the microstructure of weld interface. Thus, material flow during FSW was enhanced by using a welding tool with a screw probe and a scroll shoulder. The fabricated weld by the welding tool achieved high weld strength equivalent to ADC 12. In this weld, uniform and thin reaction layer about 50 nm was formed on the weld interface...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFriction stir welding {{is known}} for his {{capability}} to achieve a linear weld. However, moreinvestigation on a curved friction stir weld trajectory is still required to industrialize this promising process. In the same perspective, this study is aimed at analyzing the influence of nonlinear tool trajectory in friction stir welding. The study considers a variety of circular trajectories on the plane plate and uses them for experimentation while considering different welding parameters of rotation speed feed speed, axial force and tilt angle. In FSW, the tool is generally needed to be tilted with a constant angle in the travel direction during welding process. Therefore, for circular trajectory, an adequate roll and pitch angle are assigned to the spindle in all tool positions.

40|$|Fatigue {{tests were}} carried out on <b>welded</b> <b>circular</b> hollow section K-joints typical to bridges. The tests {{specimens}} were large-scale (approximately 9 m long and 2 m high) trusses loaded in {{the plane of the}} truss. Measured member stresses showed that a significant proportion of the load in a truss member may be due to bending, underlining the importance of considering correctly this load case in the design of these structures. Measured hot-spot stresses in the joints were compared with hot-spot stresses calculated using the current design guidelines. It was found that the measured values are considerably lower than the calculated values, calling into question the applicability of the design guidelines to these types of (bridge) structures. The S–N fatigue results from the current study, on the other hand, showed that the fatigue resistance of the joints that were tested is lower than the corresponding S–N design curves. This means that when the considerably higher calculated hot-spot stress range is applied to the corresponding design curve, the predicted resistance is similar to the resistance predicted using the lower measured hot-spot stresses in combination with the lower measured S–N curve too. This has highlighted the importance of relating hot-spot stresses to the appropriate, corresponding S–N curves. Evidence from the fatigue tests has clearly demonstrated the effect of size on the fatigue strength of welded tubular joints. A comparison of fatigue S–N results from smaller and larger <b>welded</b> <b>circular</b> hollow section (CHS) joints has shown the same trend indicated in design specifications: a thicker failed member results in a lower fatigue strength. The size correction factor integrated into the S–N design curves of the specifications, however, does not seem to represent this significant effect justly. In light of the size effect results presented in this paper and the major influence of this effect on the design of welded CHS joints in general, it is recommended that a soundly based solution with targeted S–N curves and a representative size effect should be sought.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that rigidly-jointed truss beam-columns which are {{fabricated}} from <b>circular</b> tubes by <b>welding</b> have the high strength of lateral-torsional buckling. This is because the high torsional rigidity of tubular chords is effectively utilized against the lateral-torsional buckling, provided that the chords are well restraint by web members. However, the AIJ design standard uses the safest approximation and neglects the advantage of tubes or the restraining effect by web members, which obviously leads to uneconomical design. On the other hand, the web members may cause local deformations in the chords arround the connections, which reduce the buckling strength. Therefore, the rational design requires the accurate evaluation of the buckling strength, taking both advantageous and disadvantageous effects mentioned above into consideration. From this point of view, an experimental work and the theoretical analysis which includes the effect of the local deformation are carried out.

Fatigue design of these joints is not available in current standards. An understanding of the stress concentrations and failure in these connections is therefore necessary as a step towards understanding the fatigue behaviour of these connections. Stress concentration factors (SCFs) of welded thin-walled (t< 4 mm) circular hollow section (CHS) -to-plate T-joints are determined at different locations along the weld toes on the tubular brace. The distribution of SCFs along the weld toes shows that the highest SCF occurs at the weld toes in the circular brace at the 0 o line. The ratio of the end of test fatigue life (N 4) to the through thickness fatigue life (N 3) in the thin CHS-Plate T-joints is found to fall within the range of N 4 /N 3 found in previous research of both thick and thin-walled joints.
