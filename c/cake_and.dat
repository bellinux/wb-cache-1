5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden <b>cake,</b> <b>and</b> they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a marriage license on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an affidavit from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony {{was held in the}} evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the boarding house in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short honeymoon in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{used to run}} its trains through Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower City Center), {{which was}} built in 1928 and served as the main {{terminal}} for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit, and in 1955, the crosstown Red Line. By 1976, because of Cleveland Union Terminal's high rent, the massive size of the facility, {{and the need to}} switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms, Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station. Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12. According to Amtrak's employee magazine, a crowd of more than 300 gathered for the dedication of the $552,000 depot. Speakers included Mary J. Head, vice chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors, and Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk. Following the dedication ceremony, attendees were invited to tour the facility and enjoy <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> coffee.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops <b>Cake</b> <b>and</b> tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> eat it {{with regards to the}} truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H {{would have to}} defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on Raw, Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake. Orton, however, sought revenge by {{coming out of the}} <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of. On the October 4 episode of Raw, it was announced that because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would be able to choose between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday. Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 episode of Raw, a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels. Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage. During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.|$|E

25|$|Bĭng: The tea cake itself.

This is done to improve the appearance of the tea <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.|$|E
