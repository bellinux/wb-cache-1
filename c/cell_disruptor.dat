Method: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus, or Peptostreptococcus micros were suspended in Schaedler's broth medium and treated by a sonic or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler for 30 s and 150 s in vitro. Bacterial suspensions treated by an ultrasonic <b>cell</b> <b>disruptor</b> served as a positive control and untreated bacterial suspensions served as a negative control. Following sonication, samples were serially diluted, streaked on blood agar plates and incubated for 2 - 5 days at 37 °C. Results: Treatment by the sonic or ultrasonic scaler for up to 150 s did not reduce the viability of any of the tested periodontal pathogens. Compared to untreated controls, the viability of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced only following ultrasonication with the <b>cell</b> <b>disruptor</b> after 30 s (0. 72 and 0. 54 log CFU/ml, respectively) and of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, C. rectus, and P. micros after 150 s (1. 98, 1. 34, 1. 95 and 1. 98 log CFU/ml, respectively).

50|$|Modern {{physical}} <b>cell</b> <b>disruptors</b> typically operate via either pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. Although pneumatic {{machines are}} typically lower cost, their performance can be unreliable due to {{variations in the}} processing pressure throughout the stroke of the air pump. It is generally considered that hydraulic machines offer superior lysing ability, especially when processing harder to break samples such as yeast or Gram-positive bacteria, due {{to their ability to}} maintain constant pressure throughout the piston stroke. As the French Press, which is operated by hydraulic pressure, is capable of over 90% lysis of most commonly used cell types it is often taken as the gold standard in lysis performance and modern machines are often compared against it {{not only in terms of}} lysis efficiency but also in terms of safety and ease of use. Some manufacturers are also trying to improve on the traditional design by altering properties within these machines other than the pressure driving the sample through the orifice.

To address this issue, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry-based mitochondrial signaling assay to systematically investigate mitochondrial/cellular parameters known to be directly impacted by mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level, and cell viability. Modulation of these parameters by a training set of compounds, comprised of established mitochondrial poisons and 60 marketed drugs (30 nM to 1 mM), was tested in HL- 60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line) cultured in either glucose-supplemented (GSM) or glucose-free (containing galactose/glutamine; GFM) RPMI- 1640 media.

40|$|Abstract Background Hyperaccumulation, {{the rare}} {{capacity}} of certain plant species to accumulate toxic trace elements to levels several {{orders of magnitude}} higher than other species growing on the same site, {{is thought to be}} an elemental defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens. Previous research has shown that selenium (Se) hyperaccumulation protects plants from a variety of herbivores and pathogens. Selenium hyperaccumulating plants sequester Se in discrete locations in the leaf periphery, making them potentially more susceptible to some herbivore feeding modes than others. In this study we investigate the protective function of Se in the Se hyperaccumulators Stanleya pinnata and Astragalus bisulcatus against two cell disrupting herbivores, the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) and the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). Results Astragalus bisulcatus and S. pinnata with high Se concentrations (greater than 650 mg Se kg - 1) were less subject to thrips herbivory than plants with low Se levels (less than 150 mg Se kg - 1). Furthermore, in plants containing elevated Se levels, leaves with higher concentrations of Se suffered less herbivory than leaves with less Se. Spider mites also preferred to feed on low-Se A. bisulcatus and S. pinnata plants rather than high-Se plants. Spider mite populations on A. bisulcatus decreased after plants were given a higher concentration of Se. Interestingly, spider mites could colonize A. bisulcatus plants containing up to 200 mg Se kg - 1 dry weight, concentrations which are toxic to many other herbivores. Selenium distribution and speciation studies using micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) mapping and Se K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the spider mites accumulated primarily methylselenocysteine, the relatively non-toxic form of Se that is also the predominant form of Se in hyperaccumulators. Conclusions This is the first reported study investigating the protective effect of hyperaccumulated Se against cell-disrupting herbivores. The finding that Se protected the two hyperaccumulator species from both <b>cell</b> <b>disruptors</b> lends further support to the elemental defense hypothesis and increases the number of herbivores and feeding modes against which Se has shown a protective effect. Because western flower thrips and two-spotted spider mites are widespread and economically important herbivores, the results from this study also have potential applications in agriculture or horticulture, and implications for the management of Se-rich crops. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we report a simple and {{efficient}} method for detecting nonsteroidal estrogens in a biologic sample. This method uses polyclonal antibodies to estradiol (E 2) to immunoprecipitate these major biologically active steroidal estrogens, leaving behind the nonsteroidal estrogens, which are then detected in a cell-based transcriptional activation bioassay for estrogen receptor agonist. The immunoprecipitation method effeciently removed 99 % of radiolabeled E 2 and estrone (E 1) from human serum. In experiments in which supraphysiologic concentrations of E 2 and E 1 to human serum, all of the immunoreactive estrogens were still removed by the immunoprecipitation protocol. We carried out an in vivo validation study of this method in which we treated female macaques with the xenoestrogen nonylphenol (NP), during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. We used blood samples collected before and after treatment to evaluate and characterize endogenous and exogenous serum estrogens. An immunoassay for E 2 did not detect the NP in treated monkeys. The cell-based bioassay also did not detect the estrogenic activity of NP because of its saturation by the endogenous serum steroidal estrogens. However, when steroidal estrogens were removed by immunoprecipitation, we detected the estrogenic activity of NP in the bioassay. Thus, this approach is appropriate for detecting exogenous, nonsteroidal estrogens in serum samples.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} chondrocytes {{are responsible}} for the synthesis, maintenance, and turnover of the extracellular matrix, metabolic processes that contribute to the mechanical properties of these cells. Here, we systematically evaluated the effect of age and cytoskeletal disruptors on the mechanical properties of chondrocytes as a function of deformation. We quantified the indentation-dependent mechanical properties of chondrocytes isolated from neonatal (1 -day), adult (5 -year) and geriatric (12 -year) bovine knees using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We also measured the contribution of the actin and intermediate filaments to the indentation-dependent mechanical properties of chondrocytes. By integrating AFM with confocal fluorescent microscopy, we monitored cytoskeletal and biomechanical deformation in transgenic cells (GFP-vimentin and mCherry-actin) under compression. We found that the elastic modulus of chondrocytes in all age groups decreased with increased indentation (15 - 2000 nm). The elastic modulus of adult chondrocytes was significantly greater than neonatal cells at indentations greater than 500 nm. Viscoelastic moduli (instantaneous and equilibrium) were comparable in all age groups examined; however, the intrinsic viscosity was lower in geriatric chondrocytes than neonatal. Disrupting the actin or the intermediate filament structures altered the mechanical properties of chondrocytes by decreasing the elastic modulus and viscoelastic properties, resulting in a dramatic loss of indentation-dependent response with treatment. Actin and vimentin cytoskeletal structures were monitored using confocal fluorescent microscopy in transgenic <b>cells</b> treated with <b>disruptors,</b> and both treatments had a profound disruptive effect on the actin filaments.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} development of more competitive biotechnological processes is demanding the development of new downstream strategies to maximize product recovery and foster the economic feasibility and robustness of any desired process. From a biotechnological point of view, lipase production {{is considered one of the}} three most important bioprocesses in terms of enzyme sales. During the last years, lipolytic enzymes applications have been broaden to sectors ranging from the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food and paper to waste management industries, as a result of a close collaboration between academics and industry (Houde et al., 2004). The interest on triacylglycerol hydrolases or lipases (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) lies in the fact that they play a crucial role in biocatalysis of a plethora of chemical reactions, such as hydrolysis, interesterification, esterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis and aminolysis. Their reputation is built largely on their distinctive features, namely, they are quite stable and active in organic solvents, they do not require cofactors, they exhibit a high degree of chemo-, enantio- and regioselectivity, and they possess a wide range of substrate specificity. These features make these enzymes trade to be a well-known billion dollar business (Jaeger and Reetz, 1998; Hasan et al., 2006). However, there are concerns related to the stability of these enzymes at the operating conditions usually employed in biocatalysis. This problem can be circumvented by using extremozymes, whose naturally developed resistance to drastic reaction conditions (like resistance to denaturalization by chemical agents and by extreme values of temperature, pH and salinity) turns out to be their main appeal. One of the main limitations observed for the industrial implementation of the processes to produce this kind of enzymes lies in the high costs of downstream operations which represent more than 50 - 80 % of the total processing cost. Surprisingly, downstream strategies are usually neglected until a later phase of process development. This is a major reason for increased processing cost and eventually the reason for process implementation failures at real scale (Datar and Rosen, 1990). In this line, one of the bottlenecks faced in this kind of biological process is placed in the recovery of the desired intracellular metabolites, which makes it necessary to apply cell lysis methods. With this purpose, conventional methods fall into two main categories: physical (agitation in the presence of glass and ceramic beads, ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization, cryogenic grinding) and chemical (acid, alkali) (Ulloa et al., 2012). In this sense, another chemical method that can be proposed could be the addition of ionic liquids. These are liquid salts at or close to room temperature that have posed a new inspiration for Green Chemistry. These neoteric solvents have been getting increasing attention from the scientific community and industry not only due to their green potential but also to their unique combination of properties (Earle et al., 2006; Rebelo et al., 2005; Smiglak et al., 2006; Baranyai et al., 2004; Wasserscheid and Welton, 2007). The most distinctive feature of these compounds is their negligible vapour pressure, which may reduce the air pollution with respect to the conventional volatile organic solvents. Due to this, ionic liquids have opened up new fields at the interface of many conventional disciplines such as green chemistry, electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, surface science, catalysis and nanotechnology (Plechkova and Seddon, 2008). Another appealing aspect of ionic liquids lies in their tunability, which eases the existence of a plethora of combinations cation-anion, leading to thousands of new compounds with unknown properties and environmental risks. Due to all these properties, they are already used in extant processes and their production per annum surpasses the tonne magnitude (BASF Patent, 2005; Institute Français Du Pétrole, 2001). In this work, we have exploited their structural modularity to apply them as thermophiles <b>cell</b> wall <b>disruptor,</b> hypothesizing that the variation in polarity or hydrophobicity are crucial to interact with the lipidic bilayer of the cell membranes, even up to a complete solubilization. We have bet in this study in the bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB 27, whose lipolytic enzymes are mostly located intracellularly and attached to membrane. The interest of this new approach is supported by the fact that these enzymes are already being commercialized by top-companies such as Sigma-Aldrich but with very low levels of activity, as a consequence of the low levels of extracellular enzyme expression. First, flask cultures of Thermus thermophilus HB 27 were cultivated for 24 h at 70 °C. Then, six different ionic liquids (C 2 MIMCl, C 6 MIMCl, C 10 MIMCl, C 2 MIMC 2 SO 4, C 2 MIMHSO 4 and C 2 MIM(C 2 H 5) 2 PO 4) were added to the culture medium at concentrations of 1 g/L, and the effect of these molten salts pressure was analyzed by monitoring both the cell growth and the lipolytic enzyme distribution for 6 hours (from 24 to 30 h). The enzyme activity data were obtained from spectrometric measurement of the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl laurate (Deive et al., 2009), and allowed concluding a great lytic effect of C 10 MIMCl, since a drastic increase of the extracellular activity of 308 % was observed, to the detriment of the intracellular and membrane bound enzyme. In parallel, the cell growth was monitored by turbidimetric measurements at 600 nm and showed 43 % of decay, thus confirming the excellent lytic effect provided by the ionic liquid...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{modification}} of protein function by PKA phosphorylation {{is critical to}} a variety of processes in the heart, including the modulation of cardiac output in response to stress, and the transduction of cardioprotective signals. As a result, PKA phosphorylation events must be tightly regulated. This regulation is achieved by compartmentalisation of cAMP/PKA signal transduction cascades, which is mediated by phosphodiesterase enzymes (PDEs) and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). PDEs provide the only means of hydroysing cAMP in cells, and in recent years, the use of genetically encoded FRET-based cAMP sensors has allowed direct visualisation of discrete cAMP microdomains created by subcellular tethering of PDEs in cardiac cells. The physical compartmentalisation of PKA by AKAPs ensures that only a small subpopulation of PKA is activated by these cAMP microdomains. Macromolecular complexes nucleated by AKAPs bring together cAMP effectors, signal terminating enzymes and other scaffold proteins, to facilitate PKA signaling events. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the signaling elements which participate in these complexes to modulate PKA phosphorylation of the myofilament protein troponin I and the small heat shock protein Hsp 20 in the heart. Both of these proteins are phosphorylated by PKA at their N termini in response to β-adrenergic stimulation, resulting in increased cardiac output and enhanced cardioprotection. PKA phosphorylation of TnI mediates the fight or flight response, by reducing the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the myofilament and altering the strength of contraction and rate of relaxation of the heart to increase cardiac output. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, I investigated the specific PDE isoforms which regulate cAMP/PKA signaling at the myofilament. A novel FRET-based cAMP sensor which is targeted to troponin I at the myofilament demonstrated that PDE 4 is the main phosphodiesterase family which modulates cAMP levels in the subcellular compartment around troponin I. Biochemical studies identified a specific association between troponin I and the long phosphodiesterase isoform PDE 4 D 9. The binding site for PDE 4 D 9 on troponin I was mapped using peptide array technology to a region on the flexible C terminus of the myofilament protein, and the sequence information used to design a <b>cell</b> permeable peptide <b>disruptor</b> of this interaction. Disruption of the troponin I-PDE 4 D 9 complex in cells using this peptide was sufficient to promote PKA phosphorylation of troponin I in the absence of other stimuli. This approach may be of benefit in the treatment of diseases such as heart failure, where PKA phosphorylation of myofilament proteins is known to be reduced. Control of post-translational modifications at the level of the myofilament by specific PDE isoform inhibitors represents a promising therapeutic avenue which has not yet been explored. In the second part of the thesis I investigated the signaling components which regulate PKA phosphorylation of Hsp 20. Hsp 20 is known to protect against ischaemic injury and cardiac hypertrophy, and its cardioprotective actions are enhanced by PKA phosphorylation on Ser 16. Biochemical studies identified an interaction between Hsp 20 and AKAP-Lbc in cardiac cells, and selective knockdown of AKAP-Lbc confirmed that this interaction is required for β-adrenergic-induced PKA phosphorylation of Hsp 20 and the anti-apoptotic effects of Hsp 20 in cardiac myocytes. FRET-based studies using a cAMP sensor targeted to Hsp 20 demonstrated the role of PDE 4 isoforms in modulating cAMP levels around Hsp 20, and biochemical techniques identified PDE 4 D isoforms in the macromolecular complex formed by Hsp 20 and AKAP-Lbc. The AKAP-Lbc/PKA/Hsp 20 /PDE 4 D complex appears to play a key role in cardioprotection via the modulation of Hsp 20 Ser 16 phosphorylation, and selective targeting of signaling elements that enhance this modification represents a new therapeutic avenue for the prevention and treatment of pathological cardiac remodelling and ischaemic injury...|$|R

Methods High-speed shaking of clot samples in a <b>cell</b> <b>disruptor</b> manufactured for homogenization of tissue and faecal specimens was evaluated for processing frozen blood clots for DNA extraction. The method {{was compared to}} two commercial clot protocols based on a chemical kit and centrifugation through a plastic sieve, followed by the same DNA extraction protocol. Blood clots with different levels of parasitaemia (1 - 1, 000 p/μl) were prepared from parasite cultures to assess sensitivity of PCR detection. In addition, clots retrieved from serum samples collected within two epidemiological studies in Kenya (n = 630) were processed by high speed shaking and analysed by PCR for detection of malaria parasites and the human α-thalassaemia gene. Results High speed shaking succeeded in fully dispersing the clots and the method generated the highest DNA yield. The level of PCR detection of P. falciparum parasites and the human thalassaemia gene {{was the same as}} samples optimally collected with an anticoagulant. The commercial clot protocol and centrifugation through a sieve failed to fully dissolve the clots and resulted in lower sensitivity of PCR detection. Conclusions High speed shaking was a simple and efficacious method for homogenizing frozen blood clots before DNA purification and resulted in PCR templates of high quality both from humans and malaria parasites. This novel method enables genetic studies from stored blood clots. </p...|$|E

Cells were resuspended in 100 µl lysis buffer with 40 U/ml RNasin (Promega) and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were lysed in 1. 5 ml tubes using a Fastprep <b>cell</b> <b>disruptor</b> with 1 g of chilled glass beads (BioSpec Products). After lysis, 400 µl of lysis buffer was added and a hole was poked {{in the bottom of}} the tube to separate the lysate by centrifugation into another 1. 5 ml tube. The lysate was cleared by two centrifugations at 4 ºC. Aliquots corresponding to 25 OD 260 units in 350 µl were loaded onto an 11 ml linear 10 - 50 % (w/v) sucrose gradient, which was prepared with the Gradient Master (Biocomp), and separated by centrifugation for 160 min at 35, 000 rpm in a SW 40 Ti rotor (Beckman). The gradients were then fractionated by upward displacement with 55 % (w/v) sucrose, and fractions of ~ 900 µl were collected directly into tubes containing 2 ml of 8 M Guanidium-HCl using an Isco fractionation system. Corresponding fractions from 3 gradients were pooled and 5 in vitro-transcribed Bacillus subtilis mRNAs (Lyne et al., 2003) were added for normalization in the following amounts: Trp 0. 09 ng/µl, Dap 0. 45 ng/µl, Lys 0. 9 ng/µl, Phe 4. ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} OM cell disruption and consequently to improve extraction, {{several studies have}} been carried out using different methods of rupture (Schütte et al. 1983; Chisti and Moo-Young 1986; Cescut et al. 2011; Hegel et al. 2011; Prabakaran and Ravindran 2011; Jin et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2014; Byreddy et al. 2015, 2016). The chemical rupture with HCl {{is one of the most}} used methods to extract lipids from OY and according to Yu et al. present even greater efficacy compared to other methods when applied to the yeast Cryptococcus curvatus (Yu et al. 2015); in this same study, bead-beating was shown to be an effective method of rupture for yeast and easy to scale-up with fairly close results to HCl digestion (Schütte et al. 1983). In addition, not using chemicals means less costs and absence of corrosion effects. As such, in this study, the cell rupture method was optimized in order to optimize the extraction of lipids from two OY (Rhodotorula glutinis and Lipomyces kononenkoae) applying adaptations of two of the extraction methods most frequently used in the literature (Folch and Bligh and Dyer). The selected method of cell rupture was mechanical rupture with glass beads using fast prep equipment (PBMS <b>Cell</b> <b>disruptor</b> Fast Prep- 24, MP Biomedicals), which is recognized as a fairly effective method of cell rupture for yeast application. The yeasts used in this study are two OY with high potential for the production of lipids, one being the widely studied Rhodotorula glutinis, which can accumulate up to 72 % lipids (Ratledge 1991; Ageitos et al. 2011) and the other is Lipomyces kononenkoae that also presents high potential as shown by Slininger et al. (2016). In addition, they present morphological differences and different cellular wall structure, which allows to evaluate the possible influence these properties have on the extraction efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Plasma cell {{mastitis}} {{is distinct}} from the common form of mastitis and clinically resembles breast carcinoma. The lesion occurs in non-lactating young women, and the incidence rate is rising. Surgical resection is the main treatment, but cannot prevent recurrence of the disease. Disfigurement or removal of breast after the operations can cause marked physical and psychological distress. The etiology of plasma cell mastitis is unclear up till now. It is therefore necessary to investigate further the underlying immunological changes of the disease. Methods The lesions of plasma cell mastitis removed from patients through aseptic operation were mixed with normal saline into homogenate tube machine (homogenate tubes were disinfected and sterilized prior to treatment). The mixture was homogenized at medium speed and grinded in ultrasonic <b>cell</b> <b>disruptor.</b> The homogenate obtained was made into oil emulsion with Freund's adjuvant. Thirty female BALB/c mice (6 weeks after sexual maturity) were divided into five groups A-E: group A was blank control; group B was normal saline control; group C was inoculated with 0. 02 ml water-in-oil emulsion; group D was inoculated with 0. 04 ml water-in-oil emulsion; group E was complete Freund's adjuvant control. Results Pathology results showed that mouse mammary gland acinar cells remained integral without any abnormal changes observed in control groups A and B. Experimental groups C and D showed dilation of mouse mammary ductal tissue {{with a large number}} of epithelial cells and debris in the lumen, and fibrosis around ducts accompanied by large duct cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and especially plasma cell infiltration. Pathological changes were observed in 3 (50 %) mice and 5 (83. 3 %) mice in group C and D respectively. In group E, neutrophil infiltration in mammary gland was observed in 5 mice, but neither infiltration of plasma cells nor other abnormal pathological changes were observed. Conclusions The lesions of patient with plasma cell mastitis could make the female BALB/c mice experience the similar clinical and pathological manifestation. High-dose group can successfully establish a mouse model of plasma cell mastitis. </p...|$|E
