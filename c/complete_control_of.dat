5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Parcells had grown restless as coach of the Giants and yearned for <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the team. Knowing that he would not get that {{opportunity}} with George Young as GM, Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, Mara {{had given}} over <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> {{the team to}} his two sons. Jack, the older son, {{controlled}} the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations. NBC televised the Giants game versus the Green Bay Packers on September 20, 1946,—the first televised game in league history. The Giants advanced to their eighth championship game in fourteen seasons, where they were beaten by the Sid Luckman led Bears 24–14.|$|E

5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{engineers}} {{working on}} the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of dolostone rocks in the region, which enabled the production of natural cement. The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian's Rondout formation. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was mined. Several quarries operated on the mountain, including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the entire mountain.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E

30|$|At {{the time}} of the first pruning operation, two trials were {{established}} to determine the competitive effect of under-canopy vegetation on pine tree growth in South Africa, one on a Pinus patula Schiede ex Schltdl. & Cham. (4.5  years) and one on a Pinus tecunumanii F.Schwerdtf. ex Eguiluz & J.P.Perry (2.9  years) stand. This paper documents results at the final thinning operation carried out at 17 – 18  years. Treatments were weedy (no vegetation <b>control),</b> herbaceous (<b>complete</b> sustained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> woody vegetation), woody (<b>complete</b> sustained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> herbaceous vegetation), weedfree (<b>complete</b> sustained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> all competing vegetation) and operational (only the woody perennial broadleaves were removed prior to any pruning/thinning event in the commercial weed control treatment). From the time vegetation management treatments were first imposed, they were maintained and tree performance monitored over 14 – 15 successive growing seasons, including and up to the second and final thinning to 250 stems ha− 1.|$|R

At the same time, the North Vietnamese 66th Regiment and the 198th Special Forces Regiment began their final push on Hoa Binh airfield. At 11:30am, South Vietnamese {{soldiers}} at Hoa Binh airfield, mainly drawn from the 53rd Infantry Regiment and the 21st Ranger Battalion, were finally defeated. Simultaneously, the remnants of the ARVN 44th Infantry Regiment abandoned Phuoc An, leaving the North Vietnamese in <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces {{and marked}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Following a period of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government, elected five months previously, in a military coup. Planning started in early 1936, and the coup was launched on 17 and 18 July. The coup failed to take <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the country and civil war ensued.|$|E
5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Lộc Ninh District.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E

50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>of</b> {{the river}} was a {{strategic}} objective of {{both sides in the}} American Civil War. In 1862 Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis, Tennessee, while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans, Louisiana. The remaining major Confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the Union's Vicksburg Campaign (December 1862 to July 1863), and the fall <b>of</b> Port Hudson, <b>completed</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ending the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.|$|R

5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, the British Moss Litter Company was formed, from an {{amalgamation}} of the Hatfield Chase Peat Moss Litter Company, the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Company, {{and most}} of the other companies working on the moors. They gained control of works at Creyke's Siding and Moorends to the west, Medge Hall to the south, Swinefleet to the east, and Old Goole in the north, together with the mill on Hatfield Moors. Old Goole mill closed in 1902, although peat was stored there for another twelve years. The new company did not have <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the moors, as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor. The company was restructured in 1899, by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital. At the same time, Swinefleet Works was formally purchased, whereas it had been leased by the old company. Sales of peat rose steadily from 39,444 tons in 1893 to 74,948 tons in 1898.|$|E
5|$|In June 1453, Somerset {{was granted}} {{custody of the}} lordship of Glamorgan – part of the Despenser {{heritage}} held by Warwick until then – and open conflict broke out between the two men. Then, {{in the summer of}} that year, King Henry fell ill. Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret, and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> government. This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset, and drove him into collaboration with York. The political climate, influenced by the , then started turning against Somerset. On 27March 1454, a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York protector of the realm. York could now count on the support not only of Warwick, but also of Warwick's father Salisbury, who had become more deeply involved in disputes with the Percys in the north of England.|$|E
5|$|Offa was King of Mercia, {{a kingdom}} of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 {{until his death}} in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a {{descendant}} of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King Æthelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.|$|E
