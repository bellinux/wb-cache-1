Here, three potential pathways for evolutionary change are identified in linguistic categories: pruning of lines of inheritance, blending inheritance and natural selection. Simulations of each of these pathways are shown within a simple exemplar-based model of category production and perception, showing how consideration of evolutionary processes may contribute to our understanding of linguistic <b>category</b> <b>change</b> over time. 1...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The HIV {{epidemic}} {{has increased}} the proportion of patients with smear-negative and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnoses, with related higher rates of poor TB treatment outcomes. Unlike in smear-positive pulmonary TB, no interim markers of TB treatment progress are systematically used to identify individuals most at risk of mortality. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the association of body mass index (BMI) change at 1 month (± 15 days) from TB treatment start with mortality among HIV-positive individuals with smear-negative and extrapulmonary TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective cohort study of adult HIV-positive new TB patients in Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treatment programmes in Myanmar and Zimbabwe was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association between BMI <b>category</b> <b>change</b> and mortality. A cohort of 1090 TB patients (605 smear-negative and 485 extrapulmonary) was followed during TB treatment with mortality rate of 28. 9 per 100 person-years. In multivariable analyses, remaining severely underweight or moving to a lower BMI category increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 4. 05, 95 % confidence interval 2. 77 - 5. 91, p< 0. 001) compared with remaining in the same or moving to a higher BMI category. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong association between BMI <b>category</b> <b>change</b> during the first month of TB treatment and mortality.

40|$|The uncanny valley {{hypothesis}} (Mori, 1970) predicts differential {{experience of}} {{negative and positive}} affect {{as a function of}} human likeness. Affective experience of humanlike robots and computer-generated characters (avatars) dominates “uncanny” research, but findings are inconsistent. Importantly, it is unknown how objects are actually perceived along the hypothesis’ dimension of human likeness (DOH), defined in terms of human physical similarity. To examine whether the DOH can also be defined in terms of effects of categorical perception (CP), stimuli from morph continua with controlled differences in physical human likeness between avatar and human faces as endpoints were presented. Two behavioral studies found a sharp category boundary along the DOH and enhanced visual discrimination (i. e., CP) of fine-grained differences between pairs of faces at the category boundary. Discrimination was better for face pairs presenting <b>category</b> <b>change</b> in the human-to-avatar than avatar-to-human direction along the DOH. To investigate brain representation of physical change and <b>category</b> <b>change</b> along the DOH, an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study used the same stimuli in a pair-repetition priming paradigm. Bilateral mid-fusiform areas and a different right mid-fusiform area were sensitive to physical change within the human and avatar categories, respectively, whereas entirely different regions were sensitive to the human-to-avatar (caudate head, putamen, thalamus, red nucleus) and avatar-to-human (hippocampus, amygdala, mid-insula) direction of <b>category</b> <b>change.</b> These findings show that Mori’s DOH definition does not reflect subjective perception of human likeness and suggest that future “uncanny” studies consider CP and the DOH’s category structure in guiding experience of non-human objects...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of the lexicon into categories (in {{the sense of}} ‘word classes’ or ‘parts of speech’) has been a fundamental matter of concern in linguistics since ancient times and the criteria for defining and delimiting the different categories have shifted according to the trends in linguistic theory (Hopper & Thompson 1984). Building on the Neogrammarians’ view (among others, Paul 1891), recent studies, such as Ramat (1999) and Bauer (2005), claim that lexical categories should {{not be seen as}} monolithic unities but as (structured) bundles of (formal, functional and semantic) features. The mainstream of current investigation in functional-cognitive linguistics follows this viewpoint and two major implications may be drawn from it. On the one hand, certain lexical items may combine more prototypical features of a particular lexical category than others. On the other hand, lexical items may combine properties of different categories. Diachronically speaking, the latter statement implies that shifts from one category to another may readily occur. <b>Category</b> <b>change,</b> broadly defined as the shift from one word class to another, is inherent to different processes of change, yet it is usually not given much consideration. Since the 1980 s, language change and innovation have essentially been accounted for by processes of grammaticalization and lexicalization (cf. Lehmann 1995 [1982], Brinton & Traugott 2005), with <b>category</b> <b>change</b> mostly seen as an accidental side-effect of these processes. However, in spite of their considerable merits, recent studies have pointed out major shortcomings of these approaches and have started to admit the relevance of constructions and context to language and language change. The fact that Construction Grammar, a linguistic framework that considers language as a complex network of ‘constructions’ (i. e. form-function pairings), has recently gained a lot of interest (cf. Goldberg 1995, Croft 2001, Hoffmann & Trousdale 2013) should be interpreted in this context. Against this background, I will revisit the definition of (lexical) category and <b>category</b> <b>change.</b> The focus will be on <b>category</b> <b>change</b> processes with a lexical item as output. I will set out different criteria that underlie the distinction between the main processes of <b>category</b> <b>change</b> (derivation, conversion, transposition and reanalysis). At the same time, the benefits of a Construction Grammar approach to <b>category</b> <b>change</b> will be demonstrated. More particularly, I adopt the view that a lexical category {{can be seen as a}} matrix of formal (morphosyntactic) and functional (semantic) features. As a consequence, lexical categories can be understood as abstract instances of ‘constructions’ and <b>category</b> <b>change</b> will be shown to be closely connected to the process of ‘constructionalization’, i. e. the creation of new form-meaning pairings (Traugott & Trousdale 2013). Since the shift to another category in general involves prominent changes at the formal level because the item has to conform to the morphological and syntactic properties (in the sense of complement types or inflectional properties, for instance) of the new word-class it belongs to, and this is logically reflected at the functional-semantic level too, it mostly results in the creation of a new construction. It will, however, also be shown that constructionalization is not involved in all types of recategorization. Furthermore, I will advance that the constructionist approach offers the advantage of accounting for the variety of input categories (ranging from morphemes to multi-word units) as well as for some problematic characteristics related to certain types of <b>category</b> <b>change,</b> such as context-sensitivity, counterdirectionality and defectiveness.

The first change concerns the AC shifting from an adverbial subordinate construction to a quasi-coordinate construction paraphrasable by and + finite(2). This development involves a shift in clausal status (from subordinate to quasi-coordinate) and a shift from typically adverbial meanings to an elaboration/addition meaning. (2) The girl was pale and intense, her expression revealing nothing (= and her expression revealed nothing). (BNC) The second <b>category</b> <b>change</b> concerns the shift of AC-augmentor with (i. e. the item introducing the AC) from a preposition-like item indicating the specific relation of manner/accompanying circumstance (3) to a semantically bleached 'absolute marker'. This shift is argued to benefit from a constructionalization perspective (Trousdale 2012; Traugott & Trousdale 2013), in that it meets three criteria: generalization, syntactic productivity, and decrease in compositionality. By expanding its semantic range from a specific manner/accompanying circumstance meaning to a much vaguer and context-dependent meaning (4), with-ACs show an increase in semantic generality.

(BNC) Increasing syntactic productivity is observed in the growing set of complements of with (cf. Himmelmann’s 2004 host-class expansion) : from past & present participles to NPs, AdjPs, AdvPs and PPs. Finally, semantic bleaching of with has resulted in decreasing compositionality, as with’s semantic contribution to the AC has become increasingly difficult to identify (the fact that the set of AC-augmentors has, over time, narrowed to with may have contributed to its loss of identifiable meaning). This study, then, wishes to show that, while not all category changes are amenable to a constructionalization perspective, our understanding of <b>category</b> <b>change</b> may be considerably enhanced by a constructionalization view. status: publishe...|$|E
