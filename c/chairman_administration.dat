40|$|The formal {{dimension}} {{can greatly}} condition {{the operation of}} an organization. The present article aims to study the mobilization of organizations’ formal structures within educational institutions. To achieve this goal, I analyze the situations between 1858 and 1913 in which the bylaws and/or regulations of the Disadvantaged Children’s Shelter of Horta (Asilo de Infância Desvalida da Horta-AIDH), the Azores, Portugal, are explicitly noted with different <b>chairmen</b> and <b>administrations</b> through documents found in the organization’s archives. We find that these formal instruments are mobilized {{not only by the}} <b>chairman</b> and the <b>administration</b> but also by the governance, whether to justify the shelter’s operation, legitimize decisions already made, or refer to the importance of these formal official normative guidelines. As a result, we find that this formal dimension is of the utmost importance, not only as a potential guiding framework but also for legitimizing action, even though it does not necessarily reflect the operations of an organization. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
