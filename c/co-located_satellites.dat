50|$|<b>Co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> cannot {{actually}} be positioned {{at the same}} point on the geostationary satellite arc. In fact, they are just close enough together to appear to be at the same position so far as the beamwidth of the receiving dish is concerned. SES maintains its <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> within an imaginary 150 km cube in space, centred on the notional orbital position.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{the use of}} {{multiple}} <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> at more than one orbital position allows for an operator to vary the capacity allocation at each position by moving individual satellites between positions in orbit to reduce or increase the capacity at each position without the delays and costs associated with launching additional satellites.|$|E
50|$|All {{geostationary}} satellites {{are influenced}} by gravity of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun, and tend to drift from their initial orbital position. They are maintained on-station with on-board thrusters fired {{under the control of}} the operations centre on the ground. With a group of <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites,</b> the task is complex as each satellite must be maintained within the 150 km box but kept at a suitable distance (typically over 5 km) from the other satellites in the group to avoid collision or mutual interference, at the same time expending the least possible fuel to prolong the life of the satellite.|$|E
50|$|Astra 1A {{was joined}} at 19.2°East by Astra 1B in 1991 and {{subsequently}} by Astra 1C in 1993, establishing SES' principles of <b>co-locating</b> <b>satellites</b> for {{the provision of}} transparent backup by each satellite for the others in the group.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{benefit of}} <b>co-locating</b> <b>satellites</b> at one orbital slot {{is that the}} capacity for traffic at that orbital position can be built-up in commercially manageable stages as demand dictates. In this way, when SES first brought DTH satellite TV to Europe it was not known what the demand for the services would be and therefore how many transponders would be required. The first satellite, Astra 1A, had just 16 transponders (for 16 analogue TV channels) and this capacity was doubled {{with the arrival of}} Astra 1B without any requirement for changes to viewers' equipment.|$|R

40|$|Operators of {{traditional}} geostationary satellites are allocated well-defined orbital slots for their satellites. By breaking the uplink/downlink dependency, adapting onboard processing in the transponders to decode to baseband, co-locating multiple satellites supporting {{a variety of}} different uplink and downlink frequencies, and enabling interfaces with networked communication between the satellites using intersatellite links, the variety of services that the satellites can support can be increased. This permits more flexible use of all available satellite capacity. We call this concept the 'slot cloud'.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the use of}} multiple <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> to improve the spectral efficiency of broadcast transmissions. In particular, we assume that two satellites transmit on overlapping geographical coverage areas, with overlapping frequencies. We first describe the theoretical framework based on network information theory and, in particular, on the theory for multiple access channels. The application to different scenarios will be then considered, including the bandlimited additive white Gaussian noise channel with average power constraint and different models for the nonlinear satellite channel. The comparison with the adoption of frequency division multiplexing and with the Alamouti space-time block coding is also provided. The main conclusion is that a strategy based on overlapped signals is the most convenient in the case of no power unbalance, although it requires the adoption of a multiuser detection strategy at the receiver.

40|$|Aircraft {{measurements}} of NO 2 using a differential optical absorption spectrometer (DOAS) instrument over the South African Highveld region in August 2007 are presented. In-situ aerosol and trace-gas vertical profile measurements, along with aerosol optical thickness and single-scattering albedo from AERONET, {{are used to}} devise scenarios for a radiative-transfer modelling sensitivity study. Uncertainty in the air-mass factor due to variations in profile shape is constrained, and used to calculate vertical column densities, which are compared to <b>co-located</b> <b>satellite</b> measurements. The lower spatial resolution of the satellites cannot resolve the detailed plume structures revealed in the aircraft measurements. The airborne DOAS in general measured steeper horizontal gradients and higher peak NO 2 VCD. Spatially-averaged aircraft measurements close to major sources indicate NO 2 column densities more than twice those measured by the satellite. The agreement between the high-resolution aircraft instrument and the satellite instrument improves with distance from the source. Despite the low resolution, satellite images reveal point sources and plumes that retain their structure for several hundred kilometers downwind...|$|R

40|$|Co-location is a {{geostationary}} orbit formation strategy where {{two or more}} satellites reside within one station keeping box. As {{geostationary orbit}} continues to be populated, satellite operators are increasing usage of co-location techniques. Co-location causes the participants to move in relative motion ellipses about each other with typical separations varying from 1 to 100 kilometres. This paper focuses on correlation effectiveness on co-located geostationary satellites as their close proximity to one another is a challenge for ground-based space surveillance sensors. During {{the course of this}} study we identify two unique observational events where <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> ’ close proximity causes problems for ground based sensors. The satellites sometimes appear to conjunct which makes discrimination by automated space surveillance systems difficult. During these conjunctions, if one of the satellites is more optically reflective than the other, the possibility exists that it will glint-mask the fainter satellite under small phase angle conditions, further making its detection difficult...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} the sun noise interference on C/Ku band of two TV broadcasting signal. We performed measurement and simulation signal from <b>co-located</b> <b>satellites</b> THAICOM 2 and 3 were located at 78. 5 degrees east. The downlink station was at Maung, Khonkaen, longitude 102. 83 degrees east and latitude 16. 43 degrees north. The 4. 6 m and 4. 5 m diameter antennas {{were set up}} to record both frequency bands. There were total 7 times of sun noise interference for C band and 3 times for Ku-band during spring 2003. The maximum of C/N degradation were 18 dB and 7 dB for C and Ku-bands respectively. The measured threshold level of C-band analog is 22 dB and that of Ku-band digital is 8 dB. The experiment shows that Ku-band signal can avoid sun noise interference because both picture and sound were not disrupted by sun noise. Because the rise in sun noise temperature doesn’t significantly interfere with signals, it can be overcome by a modest amount of system margin equivalent to that normally provide against rain fade...|$|E

40|$|For {{years the}} use of {{remotely}} sensed data has been showing to be a suitable tool for detecting and monitoring forest fires thanks to the satellite possibility of surveying Earth surface at a global scale and supervising even inaccessible areas where traditional ground-based surveillance systems are not practicable. Anyway, a rapid and reliable satellite-based methodology for fire detection is {{required in order to}} provide an effective support to decision makers and local agencies in better managing ongoing events. Rapidity is desirable to assure that fire fighting teams could extinguish fires before they expand too much; reliability is necessary in order to guarantee that the solicited efforts are addressed to actual fires and not to false alarms. In this context, the combination of the Robust Satellite Technique (RST), able to identify such events with very high reliability, and satellite sensors with high temporal resolution seems to assure both a reliable and a timely detection of abrupt Middle Infrared (MIR) transients related to fires. The RST approach, based on a multi-temporal analysis of <b>co-located</b> <b>satellite</b> records, has already demonstrated good performances in many cases of applications. For the first time a Total Validation Approach (TVA) has been experimented in order to verify the actual presence and nature of thermal sources responsible for detected anomalies.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to give a {{consistent}} view of the low frequency sea level variability in the Adriatic Sea from both satellite altimetry and tide gauge records. We analyze 16 years of sea level observations from multi-satellite altimetry and tide gauge records in the time interval 1993 – 2008. First, the impact of the corrections applied to the altimetry-derived sea level variations and the consistency of the altimetric and the tide gauge sea level observations are evaluated. Both observations are then used to characterize sea level trends, interannual variability and land vertical motion in the Adriatic region. Eight tide gauges along the coast show very coherent interannual sea level variations, with an increase in sea level before 2001 and decrease afterwards. The average of the eight de-seasoned time-series agrees with the basin average of the altimeter data, with correlation coefficient 0. 84 and root mean square difference 12 mm. The linear change is higher for altimetry than for tide gauges and strongly depends on the length of the time-interval, being 3. 2 ± 0. 3 mm/yr and 1. 9 ± 0. 3 mm/yr in the interval 1993 – 2008. The steric contribution to sea level change correlates well with the sea level suggesting that the low frequency variability is likely related to oceanic and climatic processes and mainly due to temperature and salinity variations. The decadal sea level variability is correlated in Adriatic and Eastern Mediterranean, anti-correlated in Adriatic and Ionian Sea. At a given location, the trend of the differences of sea level observations by tide gauges and <b>co-located</b> <b>satellite</b> altimetry gives the vertical land motion, if we assume that the sea level signals are truly common. We find trends statistically significant at the 90...|$|R

Using this method, we find that the locations and seasonality of the UT CO maxima in the tropics were strongly correlated with the frequency of local convective transport during 2007. We also find that the "local convection" pathway (convective transport that occurred within a fire region) typically transported significantly more CO to the UT than the "LT advection → convection" pathway (advection of CO within the LT from a fire region to a convective region prior to convective transport). To leading order, the seasonality of CO concentrations in the tropical UT reflected the seasonality of the "local convection" transport pathway during 2007. The UT CO maxima occurred over Central Africa during boreal spring and over South America during austral spring. Occurrence of the "local convection" transport pathway in these two regions also peaked during these seasons. During boreal winter and summer, surface CO emission and convection were located in opposite hemispheres, which limited the effectiveness of transport to the UT. During these seasons, CO transport from the surface to the UT typically occurred via the "LT advection → convection" pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn Orbit Servicing (OOS) is a {{class of}} dual-use robotic space {{missions}} that could potentially {{extend the life of}} orbiting satellites by fuel replenishment, repair, inspection, orbital maintenance or satellite repurposing, and possibly reduce the rate of space debris generation. OOS performed in geostationary orbit poses a unique challenge for the optical space surveillance community. Both satellites would be performing proximity operations in tight formation flight with separations less than 500 m making atmospheric seeing (turbulence) a challenge to resolving a geostationary satellite pair when viewed from the ground. The two objects would appear merged in an image as the resolving power of the telescope and detector, coupled with atmospheric seeing, limits the ability to resolve the two objects. This poses an issue for obtaining orbital data for conjunction flight safety or, in matters pertaining to space security, inferring the intent and trajectory of an unexpected object perched very close to one׳s satellite asset on orbit. In order to overcome this problem speckle interferometry using a cross spectrum approach is examined as a means to optically resolve the client and servicer׳s relative positions to enable a means to perform relative orbit determination of the two spacecraft. This paper explores cases where client and servicing satellites are in unforced relative motion flight and examines the observability of the objects. Tools are described that exploit cross-spectrum speckle interferometry to (1) determine the presence of a secondary {{in the vicinity of the}} client satellite and (2) estimate the servicing satellite׳s motion relative to the client. Experimental observations performed with the Mont Mégantic 1. 6 m telescope on <b>co-located</b> geostationary <b>satellites</b> (acting as OOS proxy objects) are described. Apparent angular separations between Anik G 1 and Anik F 1 R from 5 to 1 arcsec were observed as the two satellites appeared to graze one another. Data reduction using differential angular measurements derived from speckle images collected by the 1. 6 m telescope produced relative orbit estimates with better than 90 m accuracy in the cross-track and in-track directions but exhibited highly variable behavior in the radial component from 50 to 1800 m. Simulations of synthetic tracking data indicated that the radial component requires approximately six hours of tracking data for an Extended Kalman Filter to converge on an relative orbit estimate with less than 100 m overall uncertainty. The cross-spectrum approach takes advantage of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) permitting near real-time estimation of the relative orbit of the two satellites. This also enables the use of relatively larger detector arrays (> 106 pixels) helping to ease acquisition process to acquire optical angular data...|$|R
40|$|The {{mesosphere}} is {{an altitude}} {{region of the}} atmosphere, covering altitudes between about 50 km to 100 km. Improved understanding of {{this area of the}} atmosphere offers possibilities of increasing the accuracy of weather forecast and climate models. Continuous measurements at these altitudes are difficult as neither balloon nor airplanes can reach such heights. However, by remotely measuring thermal emission emitted in the microwave region, properties such as the atmospheric temperature and the abundance of species such as water vapour and ozone, can be determined from instruments placed on the ground or on satellites. In this thesis microwave spectroscopy is used to measure carbon monoxide above the Onsala Space Observatory located south of Gothenburg, Sweden. The results of the measurements are compared to, and found in good agreement with, <b>co-located</b> data from <b>satellite</b> instruments. A new inversion technique is also demonstrated which integrates the temporal averaging of spectra directly into the retrieval. This shows that ground-based microwave instruments are well suited for mesospheric monitoring, which will become more important in the future as many of the satellite instruments used in the comparison are slated for retirement, with no immediate replacements planned. Microwave spectroscopy can also be used in studies related to polar mesospheric clouds. These are clouds that form in the uppermost part of the summer mesosphere and are extremely sensitive to temperature changes in the background atmosphere. In this thesis tomographic measurements from the sub-millimetre radiometer on-board the Odin satellite are used to retrieve 2 -D images of the background temperature and water vapour around these clouds. Combining these results with measurements of ice content and ice particle sizes in the clouds from Odin's other instrument OSIRIS, allows us to investigate the relationship between the horizontal and vertical features in the clouds and their background atmosphere with a hitherto unsurpassed resolution...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of river}} {{discharge}} and watershed runoff {{are essential to}} water resources management, efficient hydropower generation, accurate flood prediction, and improved quantitative understanding of the global water cycle. Previous work demonstrates that orbital remote sensing can measure daily river discharge variation in a manner closely analogous to its measurement at ground stations, using reach flow surface area, instead of stage, as the discharge estimator. For international measurements, global hydrological modeling {{can be used to}} provide the needed calibration of incoming sensor data to discharge: our study tests this approach and investigates the accuracy of the results. We analyze 6 sites within the U. S. where <b>co-located</b> gauging station, <b>satellite</b> measurements, and model results are all available. Knowledge is thereby gained concerning how accurately satellite sensors can measure discharge, if the signal is calibrated only from global modeling results without any ground-based information. Calibration (rating) equations for the remote sensing signal are closely similar whether based on gauging station or model information; r 2 correlation coefficients for least squares fits at one example site (# 524; White River, Indiana) are both. 66 (n = 144, monthly daily maxima, minima, and mean, 2003 - 2006). Space-based measurement of 4 -day mean discharge at this site when using the model calibration is accurate to within +/- 67 % on the average (n = 1824; largest percent error at low discharges), and annual total runoff is accurate to +/- 9 %, 2003 - 2008. Comparison of gauging station versus Water Balance Model (WBM) discharge indicates a small positive model bias; the observed errors of annual runoff values are also positive and are subject to improvement by bias removal. The results indicate that model-based rating curves can provide accurate calibration of remote sensing measurements of discharge. However, an analysis of an exceptional large flood event, along the Indus River in 2010, shows that WBM does not capture flood wave attenuation by overbank flow, and thus predicts faster flood wave celerity and higher peak discharge compared to remote sensing observations. Better modeling incorporating these and other processes will improve conversion of remote sensing measurements of rivers into accurate discharge, including for extreme events. JRC.

40|$|In {{order to}} exploit the full-earth viewing {{potential}} of satellite instruments to globally characterise aerosols, new algorithms are required to deduce key microphysical parameters like the particle size distribution and optical parameters associated with scattering and absorption from space remote sensing data. Here, a methodology based on neural networks is developed to retrieve such parameters from satellite inputs and to validate them with ground-based remote sensing data. For key combinations of input variables available from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the Ozone Measuring Instrument (OMI) Level 3 data sets, a grid of 100 feed-forward neural network architectures is produced, each having a different number of neurons and training proportion. The networks are trained with principal components accounting for 98 % of the variance of the inputs together with principal components formed from 38 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Level 2. 0 (Version 2) retrieved parameters as outputs. Daily averaged, co-located and synchronous data drawn from a cluster of AERONET sites centred on the peak of dust extinction in Northern Africa is used for network training and validation, and the optimal network architecture for each input parameter combination is identified {{with reference to the}} lowest mean squared error. The trained networks are then fed with unseen data at the coastal dust site Dakar to test their simulation performance. A neural network (NN), trained with <b>co-located</b> and synchronous <b>satellite</b> inputs comprising three aerosol optical depth measurements at 470, 550 and 660 nm, plus the columnar water vapour (from MODIS) and the modelled absorption aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (from OMI), was able to simultaneously retrieve the daily averaged size distribution, the coarse mode volume, the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, and the spectral single scattering albedo – with moderate precision: correlation coefficients in the range 0. 368 ≤ R ≤ 0. 514. The network failed to recover the spectral behaviour of the real part of the complex refractive index. This new methodological approach appears to offer some potential for moderately accurate daily retrieval of the total volume concentration of the coarse mode of aerosol at the Saharan dust peak in the area of Northern Africa...|$|R
