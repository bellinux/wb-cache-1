25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The labour exchange programme often managed to find people only part-time <b>casual</b> <b>work.</b> The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not enough to live on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a wage-earner, not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National Health Insurance scheme also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E
500|$|By 1899 {{telegraphy}} {{stretched from}} Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon, allowing instant international contact. In 1898, the White Pass and Yukon Route railway {{began to be}} built between Skagway {{and the head of}} navigation on the Yukon. When it was completed in 1900, the Chilkoot trail and its tramways were obsolete. Despite these improvements in communication and transport, the rush faltered from 1898 on. It began in summer 1898 when many of the prospectors arriving in Dawson City found themselves unable to make a living and left for home. For those who stayed, the wages of <b>casual</b> <b>work,</b> depressed by the number of men, fell to $100 ($2,700) a month by 1899. The world's newspapers began to turn against the Klondike gold rush as well. In the spring of 1898 the Spanish–American War removed Klondike from the headlines. [...] "Ah, go to the Klondike!" [...] became a popular phrase to express disgust with an idea. Unsold, Klondike-branded goods had to be disposed of at special rates in Seattle.|$|E

5|$|The {{composer}} Sergei Rachmaninoff {{produced a}} number of solo piano pieces that were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. He composed sixteen such pieces, and all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these <b>casual</b> <b>works,</b> he draws upon the influence of other composers, including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well-thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as a child or adult, these pieces cover {{a wide spectrum of}} forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style.|$|R

After he joined the San Francisco local of the ILA and participated in a Labor Day parade in 1924, he was blacklisted for several years.

2500|$|... "Thangata" [...] {{is a word}} {{deriving}} from the Chewa language of Malawi which has changed its meaning several times, although all meanings relate to agriculture. Its original, pre-colonial usage related to reciprocal help given in neighbours' fields or freely-given agricultural labour as thanks for a benefit. In colonial times, between 1891 and 1962, it generally meant agricultural labour given without pay, by a tenant on an estate owned by a European, {{in lieu of a}} cash rent. Thangata was exploited, and tenants could be forced to work on the owners' crops for four to six months when they could have cultivated their own crops. From the 1920s, the name thangata was extended to situations where tenants were given seeds to grow set quotas of designated crops instead of providing cash or labour. Both forms of thangata were abolished in 1962, but both before and after independence and up to the present, the term has been used for short-term rural <b>casual</b> <b>work,</b> often on tobacco estates, which is considered by workers to be exploitative.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell fell {{seriously ill}} in March 1929 and shortly {{afterwards}} had money {{stolen from the}} lodging house. The thief was probably not the young Italian described in Down and Out. In a later account, he said the theft {{was the work of}} a young trollop that he had picked up and brought back with him; it has been submitted that [...] "consideration for his parents' sensibilities would have required the suppression of this misadventure. Whoever reduced Orwell to destitution did him a good turn; his final ten weeks in Paris sowed the seed of his first published book." [...] Whether through necessity or just to collect material, and probably both, he undertook <b>casual</b> <b>work</b> as a dishwasher in restaurants. In August 1929 he sent a copy of [...] "The Spike" [...] to the Adelphi magazine in London, and it was accepted for publication. Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents' house in Southwold. Later he acted as a private tutor to a handicapped child there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931. After this adventure, he ended up in the Tooley Street kip, which he found so unpleasant that he wrote home for money and moved to more comfortable lodgings.|$|E
60|$|And indeed this is {{the last}} and not the least gracious of the <b>casual</b> <b>works</b> of magic wrought by rain: that while it {{decreases}} light, yet it doubles it. If it dims the sky, it brightens the earth. It gives the roads (to the sympathetic eye) something of the beauty of Venice. Shallow lakes of water reiterate every detail of earth and sky; we dwell in a double universe. Sometimes walking upon bare and lustrous pavements, wet under numerous lamps, a man seems a black blot on all that golden looking-glass, and could fancy he was flying in a yellow sky. But wherever trees and towns hang head downwards in a pigmy puddle, the sense of Celestial topsy-turvydom is the same. This bright, wet, dazzling confusion of shape and shadow, of reality and reflection, will appeal strongly to any one with the transcendental instinct about this dreamy and dual life of ours. It will always give a man the strange sense of looking down at the skies.|$|R
40|$|National and {{international}} studies have shown consistent upskilling trends in the labour market. While this claim is true at aggregate levels, when employment growth and total hours worked are disaggregated into permanent and casual full-time and part-time employment for men and women, upskilling trends are inconsistent. The analysis shows that permanent male and female full-time employment exhibited clear signs of upskilling {{both in terms of}} employment growth and hours worked but {{this was not the case}} in <b>casual</b> full-time <b>work</b> for men and women. Part-time <b>casual</b> and permanent <b>work</b> showed clear signs of polarisation and downskilling for men and women. These polarisation trends suggest that workers who do not possess high-level skills will face increasing levels of difficulty and uncertainty in the labour market, with an adverse impact on both household and individual inequality...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, {{politicians}} {{of the ruling}} Malawi Congress Party were involved in tobacco growing on the former European estates that the colonial government had bought, and which were sold or leased to the party elite after independence. Further elite-run estates were later created on previously communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 “squatters” lived on surplus land with no security, forming a pool of casual labour. Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow. The preferred term for short-term rural <b>casual</b> <b>work</b> paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term [...] "Ganyu" [...] is said to derive from the Portuguese [...] "ganho" [...] (sometimes spelled [...] "ganyao") meaning something gained or a bonus. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another’s fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary “Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi”.|$|E

60|$|I did {{not know}} why Strickland had {{suddenly}} offered to show them to me. I welcomed the opportunity. A man's work reveals him. In social intercourse he gives you the surface that he wishes the world to accept, and you can only gain a true knowledge of him by inferences from little actions, of which he is unconscious, and from fleeting expressions, which cross his face unknown to him. Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem. But in his book or his picture the real man delivers himself defenceless. His pretentiousness will only expose his vacuity. The lathe painted to look like iron is seen to be but a lathe. No affectation of peculiarity can conceal a commonplace mind. To the acute observer no one can produce the most <b>casual</b> <b>work</b> without disclosing the innermost secrets of his soul.|$|E
6000|$|Dumas' first play, an {{unimportant}} vaudeville, was {{acted in}} 1825. His first novels were also published then; he took {{part of the}} risk, and only four copies were sold. He afterward used the ideas in more mature works, as Mr. Sheridan Le Fanu employed {{three or four times}} (with perfect candour and fairness) the most curious incident in [...] "Uncle Silas." [...] Like Mr. Arthur Pendennis, Dumas at this time wrote poetry [...] "up to" [...] pictures and illustrations. It is easy, but seldom lucrative work. He translated a play of Schiller's into French verse, chiefly to gain command of that vehicle, for his heart was fixed on dramatic success. Then came the visit of Kean and other English actors to Paris. He saw the true Hamlet, and, {{for the first time on}} any stage, [...] "the play of real passions." [...] Emulation woke in him: a <b>casual</b> <b>work</b> of art led him to the story of Christina of Sweden, he wrote his play Christine (afterward reconstructed); he read it to Baron Taylor, who applauded; the Comedie Francaise accepted it, but a series of intrigues disappointed him, after all. His energy at this moment was extraordinary, for he was very poor, his mother had a stroke of paralysis, his bureau was always bullying and interfering with him. But nothing could snub this [...] "force of nature," [...] and he immediately produced his Henri Trois, the first romantic drama of France. This had an instant and noisy success, and the first night of the play he spent at the theatre, and at the bedside of his unconscious mother. The poor lady could not even understand whence the flowers came that he laid on her couch, the flowers thrown to the young man--yesterday unknown, and to-day the most famous of contemporary names. All this tale of triumph, checkered by enmities and diversified by duels, Dumas tells with the vigour and wit of his novels. He is his own hero, and loses nothing in the process; but the other characters--Taylor, Nodier, the Duc d'Orleans, the spiteful press-men, the crabbed old officials--all live like the best of the persons in his tales. They call Dumas vain: he had reason to be vain, and no candid or generous reader will be shocked by his pleasant, frank, and artless enjoyment of himself and of his adventures. Oddly enough, they are small-minded and small-hearted people who are most shocked by what they call [...] "vanity" [...] in the great. Dumas' delight in himself and his doings is only the flower of his vigorous existence, and in his [...] "Memoires," [...] at least, it is as happy and encouraging as his laugh, or the laugh of Porthos; it is a kind of radiance, in which others, too, may bask and enjoy themselves. And yet it is resented by tiny scribblers, frozen in their own chill self-conceit.|$|E
