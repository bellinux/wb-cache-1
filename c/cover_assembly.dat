50|$|Long {{established}} parts maker Valeo {{has developed}} a properly engineered 4-piece clutch kit to replace the DMF. The UK introduction {{was at the end}} of 2005. It is claimed to provide increased reliability for the expensive replacement operation (labour time cost and the part cost), of the dual-mass flywheel. The 4-piece kit is composed of a traditional rigid flywheel and long travel damper consisting of a <b>cover</b> <b>assembly,</b> a high performance drive plate and a release bearing. Rigorous R&D testing showed the 4-piece kit performs just as well in terms of overall clutch operation, transmission protection, comfort and improves heat dissipation and durability. The transmission protection provides full engine and gearbox safety; the 4-piece kit matches the DMF for mechanical vibration reduction and therefore limits premature wear within the gearbox. The long travel damper closely matches the damping performance of a DMF. Fitting times are also comparable.|$|E

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 Â°C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear <b>cover</b> <b>assembly</b> is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E

40|$|JumpSport, a major {{trampoline}} company, {{has requested}} Cal Poly {{to design a}} custom play-structure consisting of large diameter balls with two types of connectors-long rod connections and very close connectors (for a ball-to-ball type connection). By {{the end of the}} project, appropriate testing will be carried out on the connections and a full-scale model will be constructed. After an extensive design process, our team of three decided on a rod connection style for both the long and short connectors. These consist of a hook that latches into a loop protruding from the ball where the hook is attached by a power screw. The hook/power screw assembly is covered by a sleeve and plunger style <b>cover</b> <b>assembly.</b> The sleeve rides the threads of the power screw to tighten or loosen the fit of the plunger surface to the ball. Thus, the plunger acts to cover the hook while creating a suction to the ball so that the connection stays tight. For the short connector length is equal to approximately four inches so that adequate space is provided for a hand or foot to fit between the balls. The long connector is approximately four feet in length. This length is equal to the sum of one ball diameter and two short connectors so that at any time the created play-structure can be easily altered. The prototypes will be produced by the team-Gary Johnson, Rosalie Mangione, and Steve Rose. The initial parts will be machined and an at home molding process will be used to replicate parts. Purchased parts in conjunction with these self-made parts will be assembled by the team. Structural testing was conducted on both styles of connectors. The ball used to adequately measure the desired features are produced by Mondo. This Mondo product uses a plastic we intend to use except for a larger diameter. Testing on the Mondo products allows us to obtain the necessary test results without the need to produce a ball with the correct diameter. These tests include {{but are not limited to}} maximum weight capacity, tensile and shear tests on the loop alone, etc. This data was used to determine Youngâs Modulus for the Mondo ballâs plastic. This information was useful in relating our calculated data to our tested data. In the end, a full scale prototype was made and assembled using an alternative to the Mondo ball so as to meet the diameter requirements. The reason for a full scale prototype is to model the connection points also designed by the team. From this full scale prototype we learned that simply adhering loops to the balls is not an appropriate substitution because it cannot even handle the static loads of the structure simply supporting itself. However, this prototype did yield useful information about the ergonomic qualities of the structure. Connecting a ball that will be suspended in the air proved difficult for two adults and would be impossible for young children alone. Due to these problems, a decision cannot yet be made without further testing using more appropriate materials. However, as the project stands currently, it is not a viable product...|$|E
