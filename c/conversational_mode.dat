25|$|An {{example of}} the <b>conversational</b> <b>mode</b> of {{composition}} is Haydn's string quartet Op. 20, No. 4 in D major. In the first movement, after a statement of the main theme by all the instruments, the first violin breaks into a triplet figure, supported by the second violin, viola and cello. The cello answers with its own triplet figure, then the viola, while the other instruments play a secondary theme against this movement. Unlike counterpoint, where each part plays essentially the same melodic role as the others, here each instrument contributes its own character, its own comment on the music as it develops.|$|E

40|$|In {{studying}} {{young children}} learning in inclusive environments, we designed ways to enable children to explore scientific {{knowledge that is}} usually believed to require later didactic teaching. Aspects of this design under scrutiny here are, first, the capacity of natural learning to lead to effective scientific ideas, and second, further clarification of the rcle of context. We found that in <b>conversational</b> <b>modes,</b> children were able to generate ideas and theories, to test them (by extended discussion in which they examined the logical consequences of holding those ideas, and by subjecting them to critical tests), and then to generate further theories. In doing so, the role of analogical analysis was especially productive; the simile of moving objects bouncing from a surface helped the idea of light traveling to emerge naturally (a contrary finding {{to the belief that}} understanding the propagation of light should precede the study of reflection). In this environment children studied keenly and cooperatively, kept records and critiqued the topic. As a result of this learning our view on the ages at which children might begin to deal with scientific ideas have been revised downwards.

The thesis is comprised {{of a range of}} activity that represents a moment and way of writing practice. Three artworks that comprise part of the practical component of this thesis [...] - way from home, Take me to a place and Yodel Rodeo [...] each involved participation and contribution from particular audiences and social groups in spatial and <b>conversational</b> <b>modes</b> of performance executed through processes of wayfinding, mapping and walking. One of the primary contributions of knowledge of this research is the notion of homing tales and the knowledge derived from its deployment as a re-working of nostalgia and as a radical spatial narrative practice of home-making and orientation in specific contexts of migration. Another central contribution is the identification of a particular form of conversational ambulant practice within contemporary performance as conversive wayfinding, an artistic spatial practice where the performance event occurs in the conversational activity set in motion by the conditions of wayfinding. Among the questions raised are: How do contextually-based and participant-led performance mechanisms enable opportunities for participants to express strategies of home-making and enable participants to articulate their own critical perspectives and experiences of place, particularly in the experience of migration? How do people construct narratives and practices of home and identity in the experience of cultural and historical displacement? How do people meet, sense and make meaningful sense of places in and through spatial narrative practices? How do these practices become radical strategies to critique, resist and enable power and to create emergent forms of identity and belonging...|$|R

With an emphasis on “interpretation, investigative reporting on public affairs, the world of ideas and the arts,” in the words of programming head Bill Siemering, “All Things Considered” aimed to give voice to diverse segments of American society in a relaxed, <b>conversational</b> <b>mode.</b> The first broadcast, however, featuring recorded excerpts from a huge antiwar protest in the nation’s capital that took place the same day, was “raw, visceral, and took listeners to the heart of America’s agonies over the war in Vietnam,” remembered Susan Stamberg, an NPR staffer at the time, who became a co-host of the show the following year. While the inaugural program was broadcast to approximately 90 stations across the nation, reaching only a few hundred thousand listeners, “All Things Considered” has since become, according to NPR, “the most listened-to afternoon drive-time news radio program in the country.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} revaluation of Walter de la Mare's poetry; it counters two common critical misconceptions; escapism {{and lack of}} development. The overall pattern of imagery in the poetry reflects de la Mare's understanding of reality.

Key poems are closely read so the complexity beneath apparent simplicity is pointed up. The poetry divides into three chronological stages, with two peaks of maturity. In the early peak, The Listeners (1912) and Peacock Pie, (1913) a distinctive, dense symbolic mode is perfected. After a transitional period of formal experimentation, a late peak is achieved with Bells and Grass (1941) and The Burning-Glass (1945), where symbolic imagery forms the core for a quiet, reflective, <b>conversational</b> <b>mode.</b> Throughout, the children's and adult poetry are considered as a unit...|$|E

Responsiveness as a theme emerged from the practical experience of the author in an organization development project with a residential care provider for people with physical and sensory disabilities. While consulting strategy, stakeholder management and organizational learning literature acknowledges the relevance of responsiveness, none of the approaches proposes a comprehensive concept of responsiveness and its implications for communication with stakeholders. The implicit model of responsiveness in all three literatures consists in a reactive, behaviorist stimulus-response model.

30|$|Interesting {{findings}} {{were obtained by}} these studies, showing several differences between FFPR and CAPR {{in terms of the}} functions of feedback, focus areas of feedback, incorporation of peer feedback in writing, and other aspects related to roles of learners in interaction. For the functions of peer feedback, first, the number of negotiations in FFPR was higher than that of negotiations in the CAPR (Di Giovanni & Nagaswami, 2001). This is because of the <b>conversational</b> <b>mode</b> of communication in FFPR. Turn-taking in the FFPR mode was also found to be greater than that in the asynchronous CAPR as in the latter mode of peer review, it took longer time to type the comments (Sullivan & Pratt, 1996). Similarly, Song and Usaha (2009) found that the number of the language functions of learners’ feedback exchanges in the FFPR was higher than that of feedback in the CAPR mode. However, results of Liu and Sadler (2003) contradict this as the researchers reported that in terms of the patterns of language functions of comments, the number was higher for CAPR than that in the FFPR. Moreover, while suggestion was the highest in the FFPR mode, alteration was the highest in the CAPR.|$|E

40|$|The MCS/SEL/BAS program {{provides}} {{a method for}} group recognition, based on a criterion of homogeneity within the groups. The basic aim of this clustering method is not to 'force' data {{into a number of}} separate groups, as it allows the possibility that a given element in the data set can be assigned to more than one group. Moreover, a parsimonious path through the groups is sought by selecting groups on the basis of two suitably chosen, peak-ordered criteria. This selection continues until a covering of the data set is obtained (i. e., until each element in the data set is assigned to at least one group). Then relationships occurring among the set of selected groups are investigated by means of two coefficients, called overlapping and cohesion coefficient, respectively. The utility of this program has been demonstrated here in elaborating large sets of data derived from mating type interactions of ciliates, but it can be used also for analyzing data derived from a wide spectrum of compatibility phenomena exhibited by other living organisms.
