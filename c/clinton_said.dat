5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., {{to the point where he}} intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge {{across the}} Arkansas River, {{originally}} leading to Choctaw Station, {{has been converted}} into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of the library's opening, <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state. In 2009, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010. On September 30, 2011, Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge, which opened to the public on October 2, 2011.|$|E

25|$|In {{some areas}} such as Baja Verapaz, the Truth Commission found that the Guatemalan state engaged in an {{intentional}} policy of genocide against particular {{ethnic groups in the}} Civil War. In 1999, U.S. president Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that the United States had been wrong to have provided support to the Guatemalan military forces that took part in these brutal civilian killings.|$|E
25|$|Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} third round of SED aims at {{strengthening}} the bilateral understanding and trust, in particular understanding each other's strategic purpose and common interest, avoiding misunderstanding and wrong judgment. The way the US and China jointly address regional and international challenges will determine the future of US-China relations as well as prosperity and peace in the world. The two countries should join hands to push forward their cooperative partnership.|$|E
25|$|Later in November, Clinton {{traveled}} to Jersusalem, the West Bank, and Cairo, meeting with leaders Benjamin Netanyahu, Mahmoud Abbas and Mohamed Morsi respectively, {{in an effort}} to stop the 2012 Gaza conflict. On November 21, she participated in a joint appearance with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr to announce that a cease-fire agreement had been reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. When the 2012 Egyptian protests against Morsi broke out shortly thereafter, <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that it showed how a dialogue between both sides was immediately needed on how to reshape that nation's constitution.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, 2001, President Clinton {{commuted}} {{the sentences}} of the men; Berger's sentence became two years, {{and the other}} men each had 30 months. Federal prosecutors investigated the pardons {{to see if they}} were made in exchange for political support. A 2001 ABC News article stated that some people wondered whether the pardons occurred as a kind of favor because the Village of New Square had voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton for her first senate term (1359 out of 1369 votes – in contrast to two other Hasidic communities nearby who voted overwhelmingly republican) or if the pardons occurred as part of a quid pro quo swap for votes. Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that she was not involved in the pardons and that her husband pardoned the men out of clemency. In 2002 the prosecutors closed the investigation with no action.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptian protests {{became the}} most {{critical}} foreign policy crisis so far for the Obama administration, and Obama came to increasingly rely upon Clinton for advice and connections. Clinton had known Mubarak for some twenty years, and had formed {{a close relationship with}} Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak by supporting the latter's human rights work. Clinton originated the idea of sending Frank G. Wisner as an emissary to Cairo, to tell Mubarak not to seek another term as the country's leader. As Mubarak's response to the protests became violent in early February, Clinton strongly condemned the actions taking place, especially those against journalists covering the events, and urged new Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman to conduct an official investigation to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. When Wisner baldly stated that Mubarak's departure should be delayed to accommodate an orderly transition to another government, Clinton rebuked him, but shared a bit of the same sentiment. Mubarak did finally step down on February 11 as the protests became the 2011 Egyptian revolution. <b>Clinton</b> <b>said</b> that the U.S. realized that Egypt still had much work and some difficult times ahead of it. In mid-March, Clinton visited Egypt and indicated support for an Egyptian move towards democracy, but she avoided specific issues of U.S. aid and when elections should take place.|$|E
