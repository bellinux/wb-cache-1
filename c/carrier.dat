5|$|As of January 1945, the Third Fleet {{was built}} around the Fast <b>Carrier</b> Task Force, which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular {{intervals}} between the Third and Fifth Fleets (commanded by Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance respectively), with its designation also changing from Task Force 38 to Task Force 58. As Task Force 38 it was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. In January 1945 Task Force 38 was organized into three fast <b>carrier</b> task groups and a night <b>carrier</b> group. The fast <b>carrier</b> groups were Task Group 38.1 with four aircraft carriers, two battleships, six cruisers and 25 destroyers, Task Group 38.2 with four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers and Task Group 38.3 which comprised four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night <b>carrier</b> group, Task Group 38.5, had two carriers and six destroyers, and operated with Task Group 38.2 during the day. These <b>carrier</b> groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics element designated Task Group 30.8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several escort carriers which transported replacement aircraft for Task Force 38 {{and a large number}} of escorting destroyers. In addition, the fleet was assigned an anti-submarine hunter-killer force designated Task Group 30.7 which was equipped with an escort <b>carrier</b> and three destroyer escorts and typically operated in support of Task Group 30.8.|$|E

40|$|Low-cost <b>carriers</b> like easyJet, Buzz and Ryanair use {{catching}} slogans highlighting their sometimes {{very low}} fares to attract passengers. This paper analyses pricing behaviour in the London-Paris market where low-cost <b>carriers</b> and conventional <b>carriers</b> are active. The central {{question is whether}} <b>carriers</b> react to each other's price adjustment; if so, <b>carriers</b> are clear competitors, and {{one would expect that}} price developments of the various <b>carriers</b> are similar. It appears that easyJet closely follows the fares of British Midland. Conventional <b>carriers</b> do not follow the price movements of the low-cost <b>carriers.</b> Instead, some <b>carriers</b> seem to lower their fares when potential competitors raise their fares. This may be because they interpret the price movement of their potential competitor as a signal of market saturation. All <b>carriers</b> increase their fares as the departure date gets closer. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
