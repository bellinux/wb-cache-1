5000|$|Under the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC), [...] {{landfills}} {{are classified}} {{according to whether}} they can accept hazardous, non-hazardous or inert wastes and wastes can only be accepted at a landfill if they meet the waste acceptance criteria (WAC) for that <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>landfill.</b>|$|E
50|$|Permits are {{required}} for various <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>landfills.</b> <b>Class</b> 1 landfills include all municipal solid waste landfill units. These landfills can accept household wastes, commercial wastes, and approved industrial wastes. Class 3 landfills accept commercial, industrial, and special solid wastes, and Class 4 landfills accept construction and demolition debris and other nonputrescible wastes. The solid waste program permitting requirements for facilities accepting wastes are directed at protecting groundwater and surface water, while assuring the safe management and disposal of wastes. Permitting requirements for Class I landfills and most Class 3 landfills include liners and leachate-collection/treatment systems, groundwater-monitoring systems, and other environmental protection systems that protect groundwater. At a minimum, semiannual reports are submitted by facilities required to monitor groundwater. If constituents in groundwater around the landfill exceed the EPA MCLs for drinking-water supplies, corrective action is required to bring the facility into compliance. A Post-Closure Trust Fund pays for corrective action needed after closure <b>of</b> <b>landfills.</b> The SWMD currently (2013) evaluates environmental monitoring data for one closed landfill.|$|R

By the method of addition, {{it was determined that}} the natural leachate samples contained 29 [*]±[*] 2 [*]µg[*]L− 1 of dissolved As and 126 [*]±[*] 6 [*]µg[*]L− 1 of total As. The sorption capacity of Kemiron fell from 85 – 90 % of the initial 5 [*]mg[*]L− 1 As(V) concentration in DI water to 40 – 50 % of 1 [*]mg[*]L− 1 initial As(V) concentration in the real landfill leachate system. The age <b>of</b> the <b>landfill</b> leachate exerted no significant influence on the sorption density of As(V) onto Kemiron. There were however small changes in the sorption density of As(III) onto Kemiron. The presence of selenite Se(IV) was the main controlling component in terms of the sorption density of the adsorption of As in the synthetic landfill leachate. Ca 2 +, –N,, and ions exerted no significant impact on the sorption density of As onto Kemiron. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and pH were the most influencing elements besides Se(IV) in the sorption of As onto Kemiron. Changes of ORP also produced changes in pH of the solution systems. In the experiment, the maximum As(V) sorption density acquired was 47. 5 [*]mg[*]As[*]g− 1 Kemiron at the following: ORP of 320 – 350 [*]mV at pH of 7 – 8, ORP of 200 [*]mV at pH of 8, or at ORP of − 300 or 0 [*]mV and at pH of 11...|$|R

In order to dispose of waste that is free of environmental risk, the proper design <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> during their construction and/or closure is necessary. The first section of the paper presents the current state <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> in Serbia, the second deals with problems in project design <b>of</b> <b>landfills,</b> especially in regard to their: a) program of waste disposal; b) impermeable layer; c) leaching collection and treatment; and d) gas collection and treatment.

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) {{landfills}} in seismic zones {{are subjected to}} the seismic forces both in the horizontal and vertical directions. The stability <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> against these seismic forces was evaluated by computing the factor <b>of</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> with different modes of failure among which failures <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> due to translation are very common. Conventionally, the seismic stability <b>of</b> <b>landfill</b> is evaluated by using pseudo-static limit equilibrium method. In the present study, seismic stability <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> is evaluated by both the conventional pseudo-static and modern pseudo-dynamic method. The pseudo-dynamic method is superior as it {{takes into account the}} effect of duration and frequency of earthquake motion and corresponding body waves in addition to the variation of earthquake accelerations along depth and time. In the present study, the effects of cohesion and fill amplification on seismic stability <b>of</b> <b>landfill</b> are also taken into account. It was noticed that, neglecting cohesion of fill material as well as liner material, results in a lower factor of safety and, hence, a very conservative/uneconomic design. Also, fill amplification is found to reduce the factor of safety values computed only by using the pseudo-dynamic method, showing its advantage. Generalized expressions are developed for factor of safety and yield acceleration against translational failure, which can be used for evaluating the seismic stability <b>of</b> MSW <b>landfills.</b> Comparisons <b>of</b> results under static condition with existing, similar methodology show a very good agreement.

40|$|SUMMARY: The aerobic {{treatment}} {{of solid waste}} {{has been shown to}} be a viable means <b>of</b> rapidly stabilizing <b>landfills</b> through aerobically-enhanced waste degradation. Aerobic stabilization has an additional benefit <b>of</b> reducing <b>landfill</b> emissions <b>of</b> methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which normally occur during anaerobic decomposition <b>of</b> <b>landfilled</b> waste. However the value of reduced methane emissions from aerobic stabilization <b>of</b> <b>landfills</b> has not been realized due to the difficulty of verifying methane destruction during {{aerobic treatment}}. The authors propose a framework for monitoring methane destruction in an aerobic stabilization system for use in verifying greenhouse gas emission reductions based on comparing the initial composition <b>of</b> the <b>landfill</b> gas with the composition of the exhaust gas from an aerobic stabilization system. 1...|$|R
