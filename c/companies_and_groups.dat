2500|$|Some <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> [...] "rank" [...] spammers; spammers {{who make}} the news are {{sometimes}} referred to by these rankings. The secretive nature of spamming operations {{makes it difficult to}} determine how prolific an individual spammer is, thus making the spammer hard to track, block or avoid. Also, spammers may target different networks to different extents, depending on how successful they are at attacking the target. Thus considerable resources are employed to actually measure the amount of spam generated by a single person or group. [...] For example, victims that use common anti-spam hardware, software or services provide opportunities for such tracking. Nevertheless, such rankings should be taken with a grain of salt.|$|E
