5|$|The highway {{passes the}} American Real Estate School and a campus of Empire State College before {{intersecting}} NY454 (Veterans Highway). Not far from NY454, NY111 has a short concurrency with CR76 (Townline Road) along the Islip–Smithtown {{and then the}} names changes to Hauppauge Road town line before fully crossing into Smithtown. After forking from CR76, NY111 continues northeast through the hamlet of Hauppauge, crossing NY347 (Smithtown Bypass) at-grade as it runs across another residential stretch. The route soon enters Village of the Branch, where it bends northward into a large commercial area {{at the center of}} the community. Here, NY111 intersects with East Main Street, which enters the junction from the west as NY25 and NY25A.

The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place.

The city of Mabton is located just north of the highway, and is accessible by turning onto SR241. The highway leaves the reservation and turns southwest after passing the Sunnyside Wildlife Recreation Area, and crosses the Yakima–Benton county line, continuing through farmland until approaching the outskirts of Prosser, the county seat of Benton County. SR22 serves as a bypass of Prosser, turning north until intersecting Wine <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> and the Desert Wind Winery {{on the east side of}} Prosser before turning back southwest on Wine <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> and terminating at a folded diamond interchange, exit82, on I–82.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built {{throughout}} the United States, east–west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US40, the predecessor to I-68, was a two-lane <b>country</b> <b>road</b> with steep grades and hairpin turns. In Cumberland, the traffic situation was particularly problematic, as {{the usage of}} US40 exceeded {{the capacity of the}} city's narrow streets. Traffic following US40 through Cumberland entered through the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue. After the construction of I-68, this route through Cumberland became US40 Alternate (US40 Alt.).|$|E
5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the parkway is the section north of the Southern State Parkway. This portion carries an average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old <b>Country</b> <b>Road</b> serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the Southern State Parkway, the Meadowbrook Parkway sees only {{an average of about}} 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest part in this stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the Southern State Parkway, which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook Parkway, as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on a <b>country</b> <b>road</b> and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a <b>Country</b> <b>Road,</b> a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy <b>country</b> <b>road</b> on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the <b>country</b> <b>road,</b> and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E
