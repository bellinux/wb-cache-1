25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{closely related species}} {{are more likely to}} compete than are more distantly related species, and hence many {{researchers}} investigate character displacement among species in the same genus. While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely related species, evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly related species can result in character displacement. Finches and bees in the Galapagos provide support for this. Two finch species (Geospiza fuliginosa and G. difficilis) exploit more flower nectar on islands where the lager <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> (Xylocopa darwini) is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest nectar are smaller than members of the same species that do not.|$|E
2500|$|A few ants and {{bees are}} capable of {{producing}} diploid female offspring parthenogenetically. These include a honey bee subspecies from South Africa, Apis mellifera capensis, where [...] workers {{are capable of}} producing diploid eggs parthenogenetically, and replacing the queen if she dies; other examples include some species of small <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> (genus Ceratina). Many parasitic wasps {{are known to be}} parthenogenetic, sometimes due to infections by Wolbachia.|$|E
60|$|Some birds when {{breeding}} exhibit great anxiety at {{the approach}} of any animal to the nest; but even when most excited they behave very differently towards herbivorous mammals and those which they know to be at all times the enemies of their kind. The nest of a ground-breeding species may be endangered by the proximity of a goat, sheep, deer, or any grazing animal, but the birds do not winnow the air above it, scream, make threatening dashes at its head, and try to lead it away as they would do {{in the case of}} a dog or fox. When small birds dash at and violently attack large animals and man in defence of their nest, even though the nest may not have been touched, the action appears to be purely instinctive and involuntary, almost unconscious, in fact. Acts of this kind are more often seen in humming-birds than in birds of other families; and humming-birds do not appear to discriminate between rapacious and herbivorous mammals. When they see a large animal moving about they fly close to and examine it for a few moments, then dart away; if it comes too near the nest they will attack it, or threaten an attack. When examining their nests I have had humming-birds dash into my face. The action is similar to that of a stingless, solitary <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> common in La Plata: a round burly insect with a shining steel-blue body: when the tree or bush in which this bee has its nest is approached by a man it darts about in an eccentric manner, humming loudly, and at intervals remains suspended motionless for ten or fifteen seconds at a height of seven or eight yards above his head; suddenly it dashes quick as lightning into his face, inflicting a sharp blow. The bee falls, as if stunned, a space of a couple of feet, then rises again to repeat the action.|$|E
40|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are large, hairy bees in {{the genus}} Xylocopa and order Hymenoptera. There are over 500 species of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{distributed}} worldwide.

50|$|Non-professionals {{commonly}} confuse <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> with bumblebees; {{the simplest}} {{rule of thumb}} for telling them apart is that most <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have a shiny abdomen, whereas bumblebee abdomens are completely covered with dense hair. Males of some species of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have a white or yellow face, unlike bumblebees, while females lack the bare corbicula of bumblebees; the hind leg is entirely hairy.|$|R

Excellent pollinators, the <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are found all over the United States including valley and foothill areas.

50|$|In Malaysia, {{tropical}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> often choose useful structural woods as nesting sites, as {{they are}} able to burrow through it with their powerful mandibles.

50|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> mate on-the-wing.

5|$|Solitary {{bees are}} {{important}} pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it {{is mixed with}} nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees,</b> sweat bees, mason bees, polyester bees, squash <b>bees,</b> dwarf <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees,</b> leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.|$|R

50|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{pollinate}} passionflower both {{in their}} native habitats and in commercial settings. Interestingly, they provide better pollination than honey bees for the passionflower. For some species, their foraging activity led {{to an increase in}} tomato weight by 10% relative to a combination of wind and insect pollination. This efficiency of pollination by the <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> in pollinating tomatoes is drastically improved by their ability to buzz the anthers, which is unique to the <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees.</b> In a study done in Israel, honeydew melons pollinated by X. pubescens, relative of X. varipuncta, was three times higher compared to honey bee pollination. As a result, one can clearly see the importance these bees can have commercially in producing better fruits as well. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are important pollinators of cotton in Pakistan, India, and Egypt as well. X. varipuncta is compared favorably with honey bees as pollinators of cotton in field cages in the United States.|$|R
40|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are {{the main}} pollinators of passion fruit, a crop {{classified}} as vulnerable to pollinator decline because it is strictly self-incompatible. We investigated cost-effective management strategies to increase the presence of female <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> in passion fruit orchards by using trap-nests in bee shelters. Transfers of nests containing females of X. frontalis and X. grisescens between different sites were significantly more successful when the nests contained brood cells. Supplying a bee shelter {{with a combination of}} suitably sized empty bamboo stalks and active nests of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> can increase the population of actively nesting bees by > 200 % during the course of 23 mo, {{as a consequence of the}} emergence of brood from the introduced nests and the attraction of bees from the surroundings. In conclusion, our methods lead to improved success of introducing, increasing and maintaining <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> populations for the pollination of passion fruit crops. C. N. Junqueira, K.

50|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> ingest {{excess water}} during nectar {{foraging}} or robbing. Analysis of nectar consumed by a similar species, X. capitata, shows that water is very {{concentrated in the}} nectar obtained.
