5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} contains glassworts {{and common}} cord {{grass in the}} most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by <b>common</b> <b>reed,</b> and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands of}} geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>common</b> <b>reeds</b> are {{characteristic}} of reed beds, not all vegetation dominated by this species is characteristic of reed beds. It also commonly occurs in unmanaged, damp grassland and as an understorey in certain types of damp woodland.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the salt}} flats are colonies of saltworts, <b>common</b> <b>reeds</b> (Phragmites australis) and the glasswort (Salicornia fruticosa). In the coastal waters are {{extensive}} beds of seagrass (Posidonia oceanica), which is endemic to the Mediterranean, and 260 species of seaweed.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness can {{be divided}} into three {{different}} zones of riparian vegetation communities, which run parallel to each side of the river. Plants found closest to the water include cattails, <b>common</b> <b>reeds,</b> sedges, rushes, and horsetails.|$|R
5|$|The drier {{areas of}} the reserve contain {{maritime}} grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail and slender hare's-ear. The site is generally rich in plants, especially those that can cope with saline environments, but three species {{appear to have been}} lost: divided sedge was last recorded in 1999, grey hair-grass in 1982 and lax-flowered sea lavender in 1977. Lichens are not suited to the prevailing habitat, but the nationally rare soot lichen occurs on untreated wood. The locally rare bryophyte Heim's pottia occurs in the saltmarsh, and the coastal variety piliferum of cuspidate earth-moss is found at Salthouse.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few Mediterranean gulls in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously. The pastures contain breeding northern lapwings, and species such as sedge and reed warblers and bearded tits are found in patches of <b>common</b> <b>reed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and spiked water milfoil may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of branched bur-reed, <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> and reed sweetgrass.|$|E

25|$|Reed {{plants and}} {{floating}} reed islands (called plaur in Romania) {{are the most}} common and well known components of the Danube Delta. Vegetation of this ecosystem consists of the <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> (Phragmites communis) and, on near river banks, mace reed/cattail (Typha latifolia, Typha angustifolia), sedge (Carex dioica, Carex stricta), Dutch rush (Scirpus radicans, Schoenoplectus lacustris), and brook mint (Mentha aquatica), etc. They provide ideal spawning and nesting grounds. The plaur are a mixture of reed roots, grass and soil, usually floating or anchored to the riverbed. As a rule, the reed surrounds the lakes and ponds, and slowly invades the water surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} and notable species {{outside the}} core area include sea purslane (Halimione portulacoides), Salicornia spp., pea crabs that live inside mussels, lugworm, Hydrobia snails, and annual seablite (Suaeda maritima) in estuarine and saltmarsh habitats; <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> (Phragmites australis), creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), common rush (Juncus effusus), and fat duckweed (Lemna gibba) {{in the low}} and grazing marshland of the floodplains; and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), and creeping bentgrass in mixed farmland.

Along the upstream banks, where the river runs wild, one finds the <b>common</b> <b>reed,</b> oleander and Typha species. Since {{the waters of the}} Zarqa are highly contaminated, with high levels of organic matter and various chemical compounds (especially detergents and dyes), the use of Zarqa water for irrigation has significantly altered the biodiversity of the natural flora, and caused the disappearance of the majority of fresh water species.|$|E
500|$|Common cord-grass (Spartina anglica) {{was planted}} {{in the area in}} the 1990s. It can now be found on {{surrounding}} marshes where it has invaded the fronting mudflats. The Spartina is generally shorter in the bay than at other sites due to the high tides and the turbidity of the water, reaching around [...] as opposed to [...] elsewhere. On higher ground common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima) can be found along with sea aster (Aster tripolium). Where the land is ungrazed, <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> (Phragmites australis) often forms a zone above the sea aster. Where the upper marsh is grazed by cattle red fescue (Festuca rubra) and creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera) are found.

500|$|The {{canal and}} its environs are {{important}} for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron (Ardea cinerea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. <b>Common</b> <b>reed</b> (Phragmites australis) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole (Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis) habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new [...] "vole-friendly" [...] techniques of bank protection have been developed.|$|E
500|$|The corn crake {{is mainly}} a lowland species, but breeds up to [...] {{altitude}} in the Alps, [...] in China and [...] in Russia. When breeding in Eurasia, the corn crake's habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants including sedges and irises. It is now mainly found in cool moist grassland {{used for the}} production of hay, particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use. It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga, on coasts, or where created by fire. Moister areas like wetland edges may be used, but very wet habitats are avoided, as are open areas and those with vegetation more than [...] tall, or too dense to walk through. The odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post. Grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting, but locally crops such as cereals, peas, rape, clover or potatoes may be used. After breeding, adults move to taller vegetation such as <b>common</b> <b>reed,</b> iris, or nettles to moult, returning to the hay and silage meadows for the second brood. In China, flax is also used for nest sites. Although males often sing in intensively managed grass or cereal crops, successful breeding is uncommon, and nests in the field margins or nearby fallow ground are more likely to succeed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Usage of {{herbaceous}} biomass as a fuel significantly increases {{during recent}} years. The main resources for solid biofuel {{in rural areas}} of Latvia are wood, residues of cereal crops, peat and emergent vegetation in lakes as <b>common</b> <b>reeds</b> (Phragmites australis). The share of biomass as a fuel in Latvia is 30. 3 %, which is the highest percentage in the enlarged EU. Cereal grain is ready to use fuel which successfully can be applied for heat production in small scale boilers. The main problem of grain usage in furnaces is ash content and ash melting and slagging. The article describes grain burning properties for summer and winter cereal varieties grown in Stende State Cereal Breeding Institute. Energy production per hectare, ash content and ash melting temperature for different crop grain are described in the article...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen pilot-scale {{sludge drying}} reed bed (SDRB) units have been {{constructed}} and operated under various settings. The beds included a cobbles lower layer, where perforated PVC aeration tubes were placed, and two gravel layers on top. The setup included planted beds with <b>common</b> <b>reeds</b> and control units. Three sludge loading rates (SLR) were examined: 30, 60 and 75 kg dm/m 2 /yr. Heavy metal (HM) accumulation in the residual sludge layer was negligible or low, and was found to increase with sludge layer depth. Plant uptake was low; the belowground biomass accumulated significantly more HMs compared to the aboveground biomass. Less than 16 % of the influent HM left the bed through drainage. HM accumulation in the gravel layer was the major metal sink in the mass balance. On the whole, the HM content of the residual sludge was below the legal limits proposed by the EU for land application...|$|R
40|$|Orthophosphate {{removal from}} {{wastewater}} in a subsurface-flow constructed wetland (SFCW) was studied {{during the fall}} of 1995. The SFCW consisted of a cell with an impervious liner, filled with 1. 27 to 3. 81 cm river rock and planted with <b>common</b> <b>reeds</b> (Phragmites australis) and soft-stem bulrushes (Scirpus validus). Municipal wastewater was pumped through the wetland and comparisons were made between inlet and outlet orthophosphate concentrations. Comparisons were also made at locations within the cell. A mean orthophosphate reduction of 62 % {{with a range of}} 91 % to 32 % was observed {{for the duration of the}} study. An ANOVA test showed a significant reduction of orthophosphate in the wetland cell during the study.
