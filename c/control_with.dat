A number of record-breaking flights originated or ended at Lympne. During the 1920s Lympne was the venue for the Lympne light aircraft trials from which a number of aircraft types entered production. Air racing was also held at Lympne.|$|E

5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare {{a state of}} emergency. The request was denied on 15 March 1991, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević in the summer of 1991 as the Yugoslav federation started to fall apart. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the first fatalities of the war. The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia announced their intention to integrate the areas under their <b>control</b> <b>with</b> Serbia. The Government of Croatia considered this an act of secession.|$|E
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. <b>Control</b> <b>with</b> the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground <b>control,</b> <b>with</b> the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain <b>control</b> <b>with</b> their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit {{and set up}} its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion <b>control,</b> <b>with</b> the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{situation}} deteriorated, Hitler {{decided to}} form the Volkssturm, a Nazi Party local militia to defend communities within the Reich. On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary {{and head of the}} Reich Chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann {{to form the}} Volkssturm. Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger's attempts to take over the Volkssturm, and it remained largely under Bormann's <b>control,</b> <b>with</b> local recruiting conducted by the Gauleiters.|$|E
40|$|Many {{pneumonia}} etiology case-control studies exclude <b>controls</b> <b>with</b> {{respiratory illness}} from enrollment or analyses. Herein {{we argue that}} selecting controls regardless of respiratory symptoms provides the least biased estimates of pneumonia etiology. We review 3 reasons investigators may choose to exclude <b>controls</b> <b>with</b> respiratory symptoms in light of epidemiologic principles of control selection and present data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study where relevant to assess their validity. We conclude that exclusion of <b>controls</b> <b>with</b> respiratory symptoms will result in biased estimates of etiology. Randomly selected community <b>controls,</b> <b>with</b> or without respiratory symptoms, {{as long as they}} do not meet the criteria for case-defining pneumonia, are most representative of the general population from which cases arose and the least subject to selection bias. 2017 - 05 - 27 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 28575354 PMC 544785...|$|R

5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse <b>control.</b> <b>With</b> age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from {{effective}} Abbasid <b>control,</b> <b>with</b> local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was {{in the hands of a}} group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological <b>control,</b> <b>with</b> at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
