5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of <b>Chewing</b> Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any <b>chewing</b> gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any <b>chewing</b> gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase <b>chewing</b> gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar pattern on the occlusal (<b>chewing)</b> surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during <b>chewing,</b> and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as <b>chewing</b> its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the <b>chewing</b> was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow <b>chewing</b> its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cheW</b> gene from Escherichia coli {{has been}} cloned an {{inducible}} promoter, {{and the effects}} of the overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein on chemotactic behavior and receptor covalent modification have been examined. Plasmids that contain the <b>cheW</b> gene behind a regulatable promoter complement a <b>cheW</b> mutation when the <b>CheW</b> protein is produced at low levels. However, when the <b>CheW</b> protein is greatly overproduced in either a wild-type strain or a <b>cheW</b> mutant, chemotaxis is greatly inhibited, <b>cheW</b> null mutant cells swim smoothly as if they were constantly responding to an attractant. Surprisingly, cells in which the <b>CheW</b> protein is overproduced also swim smoothly. The behavioral defect produced by overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein does not require the presence of the cheR, cheB, or cheZ gene. Receptor demethylation is also inhibited by overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein, as it is by a mutation in the <b>cheW</b> gene or a response to an attractant. In all respects, therefore, overproduction of the <b>CheW</b> protein has the same consequences as does a mutation in the <b>cheW</b> gene or a response to an attractant. A model involving two states of the <b>CheW</b> protein is proposed to explain its role in bacterial chemotaxis...|$|R

5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's <b>chewing</b> teeth begin to wear down and their <b>chewing</b> efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E

5|$|While mandibles or 'jaws' (<b>chewing</b> mouthparts) {{are only}} {{present in the}} {{caterpillar}} stage, the mouthparts of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part {{is known as the}} proboscis or 'haustellum'.

5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when <b>chewing</b> on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time <b>chewing</b> its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The <b>chewing</b> teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first <b>chewing</b> tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of <b>chewing</b> teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the <b>chewing</b> muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the <b>chewing</b> edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the <b>chewing</b> edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E

40|$|Homology {{models of}} the E. coli and T. maritima {{chemotaxis}} protein <b>CheW</b> were constructed to assess the quality of structural predictions and their applicability in chemotaxis research: i) a model of E. coli <b>CheW</b> was constructed using the T. maritima <b>CheW</b> NMR structure as a template, and ii) a model of T. maritima <b>CheW</b> was constructed using the E. coli <b>CheW</b> NMR structure as a template. The conformational space accessible to the homology models and to the NMR structures was investigated using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.
