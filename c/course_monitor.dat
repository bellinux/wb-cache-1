40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to produce a learning management system that could provide teaching materials and assessment tools for studentsso that they could improve their abilities and assess themselves. Using the waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, the researchers divided the development into five phases. Those were analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Analysis phase was done by conducting interviews and observations. The designing phase used Unified Modelling Language (UML), and implementation phase used PHP language with Model View Controller (MVC) framework CodeIgniter. Then, testing used eight golden rules and questionnaire as user acceptance test. In the end, this research could produce a Learning Management System (LMS) namely Online Learning System. It can deliver materials to students in BinaNusantara University. In addition, it helps students to find additional learning materials for the programming <b>course,</b> <b>monitor,</b> and assess their learning progress through the quiz and member dashboard...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{suppress}} {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) patients' disease activity, {{it should be}} periodically measured and patients should be treated {{on the basis of}} the disease activity outcomes. Insight into the actual care, by using quality indicators, is the first step in achieving optimal care. The objective of this study was to develop a set of quality indicators to evaluate RA disease <b>course</b> <b>monitoring</b> of rheumatologists in daily clinical practice. METHODS: A RAND-modified Delphi method in a five-step procedure was applied: a literature search for quality indicators and recommendations about disease course monitoring; a first questionnaire round; a consensus meeting; a second questionnaire round and drawing up the final set. RESULTS: The systematic procedure resulted in the development of 18 quality indicators: 10 process, five structure and three outcome indicators that describe seven domains of disease course monitoring: schedule follow-up visits; measure disease activity; functional impairment; structural damage; change medication; preconditions for measuring disease activity and outcome measures in terms of disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: This quality indicator set can be used to assess the quality of disease <b>course</b> <b>monitoring</b> of rheumatologists in daily clinical practice, and to determine for which aspects of disease <b>course</b> <b>monitoring</b> rheumatologists perform well, or where there is room for improvement. This information can be used to improve the quality of disease <b>course</b> <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R

A <b>Course</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Tire (the standard tire that a test tire will be compared to) has a rating of [...] "100". If a manufacturer assigns a treadwear rating of 200 to a new tire, they are indicating that they expect the new tire to have a useful lifespan that is 200% {{of the life of}} a <b>Course</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Tire.

The testing is non-regulated and can vary greatly. Treadwear ratings are only useful for comparing Brand A's entire lineup against itself.Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface.

40|$|This work {{proposes that}} since the early eighties a {{specific}} strategy has gained increasing importance within official Education Programmes in Sao Paulo (Brazil) addressed {{to deal with the}} high rates of pupil repetition and dropout: the concentration on teachers professional development. We argue that this strategy is based on the idea of teacher's incompetence as the main explanation for educational problems. This idea pervades both the conceptions of the programmes and their proposed actions and practices. We discuss the idea of teacher's incompetence tracing its recent origins in the literature, and investigating its repercussions for the formulation and implementation of official Education Programmes, namely Basic Cycle, Basic Cycle in a Single Shift and Quality School undertaken by the Sao Paulo State Secretariat for Education. In order to develop our argument a programme for Teacher Professional Development (1 PD) carried out in the early 90 's was chosen as the empirical context. A systematic fieldwork based on a qualitative research method was carried out in which the perceptions, expectations, and interrelations of the involved teachers, <b>course</b> <b>monitors</b> and policy makers were extracted from a number of interviews and observations. Our analysis demonstrates the presence of what we identify as the "argument of incompetence". Having provided evidence of its presence in the educational literature and in the education policies we explore and demonstrate its presence and its significance in the perceptions of the three groups of professionals involved in teachers' professional development programmes we analyse. We show that the "argument of incompetence" takes on different forms according to the context. It tends to be more refined {{at the level of the}} educational literature and rather simplistic in the education policies. However, the core of the "argument of incompetence" follows a linear logic: "we do not have a good quality school only because we lack teachers of professional competence". We proceed to demonstrate that it not only undermines the relations among the main participating agents in teacher professional development, namely, policy makers, <b>course</b> <b>monitors</b> and teachers, but it also promotes a mistaken way of thinking about teacher professional development. Mistaken and simplistic as it promotes a conception of TPD that overestimates its possibilities of dealing with chronic and broader issues of low quality of Brazilian Basic Education without taking the necessary action regarding other vital elements such as suitable conditions of work in schools and teacher's career development...|$|R
