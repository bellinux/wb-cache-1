40|$|Abstract. Based on {{analysis}} of press working characteristics, {{some of the}} main kinematics requirements for working mechanisms of servo mechanical presses were put forward: fast in empty stroke, slow and uniform in working stroke and big force gain. <b>Crank</b> <b>link</b> and knuckle-straight link are the most common working mechanisms in mechanical presses. To meet the requirement of servo mechanical presses, another mechanism, knuckle-triangle link, was designed. The kinematics simulations of the three mechanisms for a 1600 kN press were conducted by dynamic software ADAMS. Knuckle-triangle link had the most uniform and lowest slide’s average velocity and biggest force gain within the working stroke. For the same nominal pressure of 1600 kN, the required input torque of knuckle-triangle link was 9108 Nm. In comparison with <b>crank</b> <b>link</b> and knuckle-straight link, the crank’s input torque was reduced by 84 % and 76 % respectively without considering the influence of friction and inertia. In conclusion, knuckle-triangle link mechanism is more suitable for large-tonnage servo presses...|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{has been}} funding {{university}} research into flexible, six-legged walking machines capable of exploring alien terrain. This research {{has led to}} a progressive new look at standard four bar mechanisms. Four bar mechanisms, by definition, consist of a <b>crank</b> <b>link,</b> coupler link, rocker link and fixed (ground) link. The passive role of the coupler link, in traditional four bar mechanisms, can be reversed so that the coupler becomes the transmission link. This is achieved by replacing the coupler with an oblique triangular link. The internal angles of the modified coupler can be varied to create an array of continuous, ovoid paths at the disjointed vertex of the triangle. Attaching a pantograph mechanism to the modified coupler's trace point amplifiers and translates the ovoid path. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a stable, one degree of freedom walking path which emulates that of humans. This mechanism can therefore be used as a robotic leg. A second degree of freedom is obtained by attaching an adjacent link to the pantograph mechanism which raises or lowers the walking path without effecting its shape or magnitude. This is used for climbing and maneuvering amidst rugged terrain...|$|E

For example, his results giveLater Ken Ono conjectured that the elusive crank also {{satisfies}} exactly {{the same types of}} general congruences.

In 1949, Tandon {{introduced}} the 122 cc Superglid featuring conventional foot gear-change {{and a new}} frame with swinging-arm rear suspension. However, the suspension itself was highly unusual with damper units being replaced by a bell <b>crank</b> <b>linked</b> to rubber bands for suspension and a hard rubber block for compression action, all located under the gearbox.|$|R

This consists of a brass rod, cross drilled with two holes at right angles to each other, a small distance apart. The outside end of the rod has a <b>crank,</b> <b>linked</b> to a <b>crank</b> on the engine crankshaft, so that it rocks back and forth by about 90 degrees. This causes the two holes to alternately line up with the steam and exhaust passages.|$|R

5000|$|The Agar Gun, {{otherwise}} known as a [...] "coffee-mill gun" [...] because of its resemblance to a coffee mill, was invented by Wilson Agar {{at the beginning of}} the US Civil War. The weapon featured mechanized loading using a hand <b>crank</b> <b>linked</b> to a hopper above the weapon. The weapon featured a single barrel and fired through the turning of the same crank; it operated using paper cartridges fitted with percussion caps and inserted into metal tubes which acted as chambers; it was therefore functionally similar to a revolver. The weapon was demonstrated to President Lincoln in 1861. He was so impressed with the weapon that he purchased 10 on the spot for $1,500 apiece. The Union Army eventually purchased a total of 54 of the weapons. However, due to antiquated views of the Ordnance Department the weapons, like its more famous counterpart the Gatling Gun, saw only limited use.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{possible}} solutions for interaction with virtual mechanical systems are presented. For {{the purpose of}} manipulating and interaction with mechanical systems in a realistic manner various haptic devices can be used. To assess the added value of the interaction the authors {{conducted a series of}} experiments involving multimodal interaction. Three possible cases and applications are presented: (i) when the user is interacting with a completely virtual mechanical system – for this a desktop virtual reality system was used including a PHANToM ® haptic device, (ii) when the user is manipulating one element of the mechanical system in a CAVE-like visualization system using the stringbased SPIDAR haptic device, and (iii) when the user is interacting with one part of a mechanism (the mechanical system being composed by one or more real and virtual elements and joints – using augmented reality techniques and see-through featured head mounted display) : a <b>crank</b> <b>linked</b> to a torque controlled electrical motor. The research showed the difficulties when trying to interact with a virtual mechanism using haptic feedback...|$|R
40|$|A key {{component}} of switch-mode hydraulic circuits is a high-speed two-position three-way valve with a variable duty cycle. This paper presents a new valve architecture that consists of two valve spools that are axially driven by crank-slider mechanisms. By phase shifting the two <b>crank</b> <b>links,</b> which are on a common crankshaft, the duty cycle of the valve is adjusted. The two spools split and re-combine flow such that two switching cycles occur per revolution of the crankshaft. Because the spools move in a near-sinusoidal trajectory, the peak spool velocities are achieved at mid-stroke where the valve land transitions across the ports, resulting in short valve transition times. The spool velocity is lower during {{the remainder of the}} cycle, reducing viscous friction losses. A dynamic model is constructed of this new valve operating at 120 Hz switching frequency in a switch-mode circuit. The model is used to illustrate design trade-offs and minimize energy losses in the valve. The resulting design solution transitions to the on-state in 5 % of the switching period and the combined leakage and viscous friction in the valve dissipate 1. 7 % of the total power at a pressure of 34. 5 MPa and volumetric flow rate of 22. 8 L/min...|$|R

30|$|The working {{principle}} of the beam pumping units is as follow: firstly, the motor converts the electrical energy into the rotational motion. Secondly, after twice reduction by the gearbox and the four-bar linkage, the rotary motion transforms into a linear reciprocating motion. At last, by the horse head, the beam hanger and the polished rod, the sucker rod drives the deep oil well pump. The core component of the beam pumping units is the four-bar linkage that is composed of the <b>crank,</b> the <b>link</b> bar, the rear arm, the connection line between the gearbox shaft and the shaft of the support. The four-bar linkage has the function that transforms the rotary motion of the gearbox into the reciprocating motion required to operate the downhole pump. The geometric parameters of the four-bar linkage have extremely important impact to the contour size and the working performance of the beam pumping units.|$|R
50|$|On {{conventional}} tandems, {{the front}} rider steers {{as well as}} pedals the bicycle and {{is known as the}} captain, pilot, or steersman; the rear rider only pedals and is known as the stoker, navigator or rear admiral. On most tandems the two sets of <b>cranks</b> are mechanically <b>linked</b> by a timing chain and turn at the same rate. As time has moved on so has the use of 'captain' and 'stoker' as terms for riders of a tandem. As both are seen as riders the use of the words 'front rider' and 'rear rider' are far more descriptive to modern tandem riders.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1934 and 1940 {{eight of}} the first fifteen locos had their Gresley gear removed and were {{converted}} to a [...] "double Walschaerts" [...] valve gear which utilized a double eccentric (return) <b>crank</b> and second <b>link</b> {{on the right side}} (similar to the gear Baldwin used on its 3-cylinder experimental compound 4-10-2 #60000), which operated the valve for the inside cylinder. Union Pacific referred to this system as the [...] "third link." [...] The 4-12-2's constructed from 1928 utilized roller bearings in the Gresley lever bearings, thus none of these engines were converted.

By changing the angle between two rest of trolley-cum-wheelchair the various stresses such as the maximum shear stress and bending stress and maximum principal stress and deformation on each link of four bar mechanism is determined.

5000|$|An in-line crank slider is {{oriented}} {{in a way}} {{in which}} the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke (...) of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the <b>crank</b> and follower <b>links</b> is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, {{the time it takes to}} perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a reverse stroke.|$|R

In fact, the demand for energy is expected to grow faster than the finding out of new available fossil resources in the near future. The sun or solar energy had been identified as the most powerful energetic power source in our planet and it is expected that the sun will become the main electricity production source. The solar energy distribution is more depended on the position of the panel and the sun location. This project is about designing and analyzing the manual sun tracking system that can follow the sun movement. The objectives for this project are to design and analyze the single axis sun tracking system for flat plate solar collector. This project involves designing five main part of the manual sun tracking system which is frame, base, <b>link,</b> <b>crank</b> and pin.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a functional scheme of a machine-tool for simultaneous abrasive machining of lenses with shallow high-accuracy executive surface. The machine-tools permits flexibly and within long range to control shape-formation process through changing such adjustment parameters as tool and rough workpiece frequency rotation, amplitude value of tool oscillatory motion, their diameters {{and number of}} double strokes per minute. While using the given machine-tool for machining process an operating force is directed along normal to the working surface and due to this {{there is a possibility}} to accelerate a shape-formation process of optical parts that leads to reduction of local errors on their executive surfaces. The paper considers a structure of the executive machine-tool mechanism which transfers translational motion to the tools and consists of rotational and rectilinear kinematic pairs forming a four-bar linkage and its crank is a guide link. A turning angle of the link is selected as a generalized coordinate of the executive mechanism. A relationship between the generalized coordinates and link positions of the executive machine-tool mechanism has been established in the paper and it permits to obtain analytical dependence between motions of input and output mechanism links with due account of its kinematic transfer function which represents in itself a ratio of angular output link speed to an angular velocity of the input link. An analysis of geometric parameters for backward-rotational motion of the top link in the proposed machine-tool has made it possible to obtain an expression to calculate a rod length of the executive mechanism which ensures symmetrical center position of the above-mentioned link relative to a symmetry axis of the bottom link. As an amplitude value of oscillatory motion for an out-put link in the executive mechanism is regulated in the machine-tool for two-sided lens machining while changing length of its input <b>link</b> (<b>crank)</b> an analytical relationship has been established between these geometric parameters and the rela- tionship provides a possibility purposefully to change a machining intensity in the central or edge zone of a part according to technological blank heredity in the context of allowance which is to be removed and which is distributed along its surface.  </p...|$|R
