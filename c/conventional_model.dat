5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the <b>conventional</b> <b>model</b> of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two primary}} types of cells. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, {{although}} they have circular DNA and ribosomes. Bacteria and Archaea are two domains of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the eukaryotes, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuoles. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are protist microorganisms. The <b>conventional</b> <b>model</b> is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through endosymbiosis between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.|$|E

[...] The hut urns show a <b>conventional</b> <b>model</b> with a single interior space. [...] They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the sloping roof, which cross at the central ridge and project some way in [...] "V"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated. [...] The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay. [...] There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.|$|E
2500|$|This {{category}} measures {{how many}} premium or upgraded features, called forced features, are included on a hybrid model as standard equipment {{in comparison to}} its sibling <b>conventional</b> <b>model.</b> UCS considers that these forced features make it less economical for consumers to buy a base hybrid model. UCS calculates the cost of forced features as the difference in MSRP between the base <b>conventional</b> <b>model,</b> with no upgrades, and the base hybrid model, and then the estimated cost of the hybrid technology is subtracted. This category is scored quantitatively from None to $$$$$. Vehicles with no forced features are assigned a rating of “None” meaning that the additional costs for the vehicle only {{cover the cost of}} the hybrid system.

2500|$|This {{category}} measures how cost-effectively {{a particular}} hybrid achieves its environmental performance, and the scores vary from [...] "Very Poor" [...] to [...] "Superior." [...] Each hybrid model is evaluated {{by dividing the}} estimated cost of hybrid technology used in the vehicle by its reduction in global warming emissions over the <b>conventional</b> <b>model</b> expressed as a percentage. The ratings are assigned to each model based on the resulting incremental cost according to the range values shown in {{the table in the}} right. When a hybrid achieves a better smog certification level than its conventional counterpart, the hybrid technology cost should include the cost of any additional emissions controls used in the hybrid model.|$|E

The composite panels are analyzed for damage initiation and propagation from initial loading to final failure using a {{progressive failure}} analysis capability that includes both geometric and material nonlinearities. Progressive failure analyses are performed on <b>conventional</b> <b>models</b> and interface technology models of the composite panels. Analytical results and the computational effort of the analyses are compared for the <b>conventional</b> <b>models</b> and interface technology models.

40|$|The {{duration}} {{dependence of}} stock market cycles {{has been investigated}} using the Markov switching model where the market conditions are unobservable. In <b>conventional</b> <b>modeling,</b> restrictions are imposed such that the transition probability is a monotonic function of duration, which is truncated at a certain value. This paper proposes a model that is free from these arbitrary restrictions and nests the <b>conventional</b> <b>models.</b> In the model, the parameters that characterize the transition probability are formulated in the state space. Empirical results from several stock markets show that the duration structures greatly differ depending on countries. These structures are not necessarily monotonic functions of duration and, therefore, cannot be described by the <b>conventional</b> <b>models.</b> duration, world stock markets, Markov switching model, non-parametric model, Gibbs sampling, marginal likelihood,...|$|R

2500|$|Tailpipe {{emissions}} are considered through EPA’s air pollution {{score for each}} hybrid vehicle and not relatively to the improvement over the similar <b>conventional</b> <b>model.</b> Even though EPA rates air pollution scores for both California and federal standards, the Hybrid Scorecard ratings use only the California emissions certification level in order to introduce the maximum potential to reduce tailpipe emissions [...] [...] The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating and 0 is the worst. Then, using the legal definitions established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), a zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) is assigned a 10, a partial zero emissions vehicle (PZEV) a 9, a super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV II) an 8, and so forth.|$|E
2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the <b>conventional</b> <b>model,</b> other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E
