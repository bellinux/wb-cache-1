5000|$|The main {{enemies of}} the larvae of either antlions or wormlions are ground-hunting birds such as hoopoes and gallinaceous birds that learn to {{recognise}} their pits and probe or scratch them from the sand. If alarmed by such activity, the wormlion larva retracts abruptly into an S-shape under the sand, and if dug out, it retains that shape, not having much option for an alternative strategy at its disposal. Actually, because its skin is coated with sand, {{and it is very}} small, it is very easy to overlook while it lies still. However, if it is sufficiently teased after being dug out, it may begin to lash about powerfully, flinging itself away with enough force to escape its tormentor. It does not, however, hook its mouthparts into its hinder end to achieve an efficient leap such as some fruit fly and <b>carrion</b> <b>fly</b> larvae do.|$|E

To evaluate its efficacy, we conducted metabarcoding surveys of carrion flies on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, which has a well-known mammal community, and compared our results against diurnal transect counts and camera trapping. We collected 1, 084 flies in 29 sampling days, conducted metabarcoding with mammal-specific (16 S) and vertebrate-specific (12 S) primers, and sequenced amplicons on Illumina MiSeq.

MethodsFive <b>carrion</b> <b>fly</b> species {{were collected from}} 12 cities and regions in China, including Musca domestica (M. domestica), Lucilia sericata (L. sericata), Chrysomya megacephala (C. megacephala), Helicophagella melanura (H. melanura), Boethcherisca peregrina, and they were studied using ISSR and SCAR markers. ResultsEight ISSR primers were used for amplification of 121 samples. 679 clear and stable bands were identified, of which 516 bands were polymorphic. Several species-specific ISSR fragment were cloned and sequenced as an initial effort to derive the SCAR markers. Using M. domestica SCAR specific primers, SCAR-PCR amplification was performed for 8 M. domestca population sample DNA from different regions in China as well as L. sericata, C. megacephala, H. melanura and Lucillia cupirina. The result showed only M. domestica produced specificalty 600 bp fragment, but L. sericata, C. megacephala, H. melanura and Lucillia cupirina did not produce the same specific fragment. Clustering analysis showed clustering of most flies of M. domestica, C. megacephala and L. sericata. M. domestica samples from different regions in China yielded different banding patterns.

40|$|Vectors of {{aggregation}} {{are well}} known for some arthropod species, but not for many others. We aimed to describe larval aggregation (experiment 1) in the <b>carrion</b> <b>fly,</b> Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and to investigate the effect of food and conspecifics on larval behaviour (experiment 2). In experiment 1, 40 larvae were placed in a petri dish with a homogeneous diet for 30. min, 1. h, 3. h, 5. h or 24. h. This experiment demonstrated {{for the first time}} under controlled conditions the active aggregation of L. sericata larvae. The results indicate that the aggregation took place quickly and was reinforced with time. After only 3. h, one main aggregate comprising a majority of individuals was observed. These results also highlight the likely use by necrophagous larvae of a signal left by conspecifics as an aggregation vector. In experiment 2, we used a video-tracking system to investigate whether such an aggregative signal exists. Fed and starved larvae were tracked for 5. min in a circular area with each half marked with a different signal combination. The time spent in the signal zones, the distance travelled, the velocity, the time at the stop and the number of stops in each zone were measured. The larvae were significantly retained by a signal (mark) left by conspecifics. Together, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate the existence of a contact and/or odour-mediated signal involved in the aggregative behaviour of necrophagous larvae. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Introduction : In Forensic Medicine, the {{existence}} of <b>carrion</b> <b>fly</b> larvaes {{can be used to}} support the time of death estimation on the dead body with unknown time of death. Due to the olfactory system, Chrysomya adult female fly may be attracted by decomposition odor, to lay eggs then hatch to larvaes. The rate of decomposition is affected by the condition of the dead body and the environment factors. Objective : The existence pattern of Chrysomya Larvaes among intact rabbit carrions (A), wounded rabbit carrions (B) and decomposed rabbit carrions (C) were examined daily. Material and Method : Observational descriptive method with quota and purposive sampling based on Larval Collected Evidence Technique (third stage of 30 Chrysomya larvaes on each carrions) were used in this study. The posterior part of 15 larvaes were sliced to identify the posterior spiracle and 15 larvaes were reared to identify the adult flies morphology. Result : The larvaes existence was found through the slicing­examination of C on fourth day, B on fifth day, A on sixth day. The adult flies were developed through the rearing­examination of C on 17 th day, B on 18 th day, A on 19 th day. Discussion : The different time existence of Chrysomya Larvaes on carrions was affected by the arrival time differentiation of Chrysomya adult female flies, was affected by the decomposition­ forming time. Conclusion : The existence pattern of Chrysomya Larvaes on decomposed carrions was found one day earlier (16 days) than wounded carrions (17 days) and the longest time was found on intact carrions (18 days).

40|$|Minimum postmortem {{interval}} (mPMI) estimations {{are critical}} to solving cases of equivocal death and the accuracy of these predictions can depend on the understanding of necrophagous fly successional patterns. In order {{to better understand the}} successional patterns of necrophagous flies, {{it is important to know}} the seasonality of forensically relevant fly species—that is, the baseline pattern of their presence and absence in relation to annually cyclic environmental factors. Since many environmental factors play a role in insect seasonality, it is possible that some of these factors can be summed to create an index that represents seasonality in a simpler form. This study seeks to determine whether or not temporal variations in the presence of particular fly species are directly related to changes in environmental conditions. Minimum and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity were the environmental factors of interest in this study and have been shown in previous studies to affect <b>carrion</b> <b>fly</b> assemblage. Specimens were passively collected in Northwestern Indiana using a fly trap with rotting chicken bait as an attractant, then pinned and morphologically identified. The presence and relative abundances of relevant fly species were compared to local environmental factor data to determine whether seasonality exists for carrion flies based predominantly on evaporative index or on other environmental variables. Data collected in the summer of 2015 shows that Dipteran community composition varies temporally within the summer season. The differences in relative species abundance and species presence throughout the sampling period can likely be attributed to environmental changes. However, the environmental variables exerting the greatest effects on fly presence and abundance are as of yet unidentified by this study. Because of this shortcoming, the work done this summer represents only a part of a multi-year project in attempting to identify any relationship between fly presence and environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Carrion flies, {{particularly}} blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) {{and flesh}} flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), {{play a vital}} role in the cycling of organic material by aiding in the decomposition of vertebrate cadavers in terrestrial ecosystems. Because of this close association with dead bodies, these flies also serve as the primary indicators of the postmortem interval for forensic entomologists based on the rapid nature of fly colonization. I addressed some of the assumptions made with regard to the colonization of terrestrial cadavers by carrion flies. This starting point was ideal because the whole of insect-driven decomposition begins with the colonization of the cadaver, usually by flies. ^ By first conducting experiments on the potential for blow flies to produce multiple generations on single cadavers, I was able to demonstrate through a choice/no choice scenario that blow flies do not in fact produce a second generation on carrion. This has confirmed assumptions in the literature which had previously not been tested. As a follow-up to this study, I examined the effects of decomposition on vitellogenic protein sources for blow flies to determine whether or not flies visiting decomposed bodies are indeed gaining dietary protein as has been assumed. My data show that flies successfully complete vitellogenesis on aged carrion at the same rate as they do on fresh liver. ^ Finally, I tested the assumption that flies do not colonize bodies at night, an assumption that has been tested several times before by various authors using inappropriate experimental procedures. By killing pigs (23 - 32 kg each) after dark, and placing them in field conditions of varying light intensities, I was unable to show any signs of <b>carrion</b> <b>fly</b> colonization. This reinforces the assumption that flies do not colonize bodies after dark, and indicates that the potential for nocturnal colonization of a body by flies has been overstated by some authors. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although {{pollination}} {{of plants}} that attract flies by resembling their carrion brood and food sites {{has been reported in}} several angiosperm families, there has been very little work done on the level of specificity in carrion mimicry systems and the importance of plant cues in mediating such specialization. Specificity may be expected, as carrion-frequenting flies often exploit different niches, which has been interpreted as avoidance of interspecific competition. Interactions between the orchid Satyrium pumilum and a local assemblage of <b>carrion</b> <b>flies</b> were investigated, and the functional significance of floral traits, especially scent, tested. Pollination success and the incidence of pollinator-mediated self-pollination were measured and these were compared with values for orchids with sexual- and food-deceptive pollination systems. METHODS AND KEY RESULTS: Observations of insect visitation to animal carcasses and to flowers showed that the local assemblage of <b>carrion</b> <b>flies</b> was dominated by blow flies (Calliphoridae), house flies (Muscidae) and flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), but flowers of the orchid were pollinated exclusively by flesh flies, with a strong bias towards females that sometimes deposited live larvae on flowers. A trend towards similar partitioning of fly taxa was found in an experiment that tested the effect of large versus small <b>carrion</b> quantities on <b>fly</b> attraction. GC-MS analysis showed that floral scent is dominated by oligosulfides, 2 -heptanone, p-cresol and indole, compounds that also dominate <b>carrion</b> scent. Flesh <b>flies</b> did not distinguish between floral and carrion scent in a choice experiment using olfactory cues only, which also showed that scent alone is responsible for fly attraction.

This study investigated these effects on meat bait colonization by Victorian Diptera of forensic importance. Bait treatments were: 2 ̆ 7 aged 2 ̆ 7 (aged for 4 days at 22 Â°C, allowing some decomposition); 2 ̆ 7 nutrient-depleted 2 ̆ 7 [aged for 4 days at 22 Â°C with feeding Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae]; 2 ̆ 7 extract 2 ̆ 7 (fresh bait mixed with liquid formed by feeding C. vicina larvae), and 2 ̆ 7 fresh 2 ̆ 7 (untreated control bait). Statistical analysis (Î± = 0. 05) revealed that colonization frequency differed significantly among treatments (Welch 2 ̆ 7 s F 3, 18. 83 = 4. 66, P < 0. 05). Post hoc tests showed that fresh and extract baits were colonized extensively throughout the experiment with no significant difference, whereas the colonization of nutrient-depleted baits was significantly lower. This suggests that larval digestive enzymes, larval excreta and cuticular hydrocarbons have less effect on colonizing Diptera than the nutritional content of meat. The colonization of aged baits did not differ significantly from that of fresh, extract or nutrient-depleted baits. A further experiment testing 2 ̆ 7 very aged 2 ̆ 7 (aged for 8 days at 28 Â°C), 2 ̆ 7 larvae-added 2 ̆ 7 (fresh bait with C. vicina larvae added before placement) and 2 ̆ 7 fresh 2 ̆ 7 (untreated control) baits revealed that very aged baits were colonized significantly less frequently than either fresh or larvae-added baits (Welch 2 ̆ 7 s F 2, 6. 17 = 17. 40, P < 0. 05) ...|$|E
