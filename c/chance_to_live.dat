Ultimately, he has become burdened by guilt because of his actions in causing the world to fall into its current state. Noel's belief in the prophecy is reinforced when Lightning appears as the savior. They briefly ally to rout an extremist sect of the Children of Etro, who have been killing women who resemble Lightning. They later fight at Noel's hideout. Lightning provokes Noel into fully expressing his rage and engaging him in battle.

GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented {{on the length of}} the songs, in that [...] "once you hit the three minute mark or so, things start to feel 'too long'".

500|$|As a character, Jasmine is both {{similar to}} and {{different}} from Disney heroines who proceeded her. She possesses many qualities associated with traditional Disney Princesses, grace and beauty among them. However, marketed by Disney as [...] "a heroine of the Nineties", Jasmine is [...] "born-before-her-time", and thus her intelligence and ambitions tend to more-so resemble contemporary incarnations, namely Belle. Brian Lowry of Variety likened Jasmine's strong-willed personality {{to that of}} Belle, describing her as an [...] "anachronistically liberated" [...] heroine. Meanwhile, The Hollywood News Rob Burch observed that the princess {{is very similar to}} Ariel, being [...] "independent, beautiful, and desperate for the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> her own life," [...] {{while at the same time}} concealing kindness beneath [...] "a shield of anger". Belonging to [...] "a series of spunky heroines" [...] inspired by both contemporary feminism and the girl power movement, Jasmine was recognized by Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies author Timothy B. Cargal as a member of Disney's [...] "continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age", in addition to providing young girls with strong female role models with whom they can identify. At only 15 years of age, Jasmine is already more resourceful than her two immediate predecessors, while sharing their same preference for assertiveness and empowerment over passiveness, traits echoed by several other Disney Princesses introduced throughout the decade. At the same time, Jasmine is depicted as being feistier than Belle and less naive than Ariel.|$|E

Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child.

500|$|Carpenter pleaded to the {{producers}} {{to let her}} cut her hair in the second season of Angel, but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a [...] "dark edge of Cordelia" [...] which wasn't as [...] "warm and effervescent as she usually is", so for the third season they wanted her to [...] "go shorter and blonder". Angels third season demonstrates Cordelia's development into a fully-fledged heroine. The episode [...] "Birthday" [...] saw her being offered the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a life where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries. In [...] "Billy", Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show's stunt co-ordinators both {{to learn how to}} fight and to handle weaponry. In the episode [...] "Waiting in the Wings", both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the [...] "point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds". She goes on to describe how Cordelia's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character. Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when [...] "the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit Angel, and as an overwhelmingly positive force" [...] where later Fred (Amy Acker), [...] "the character who is conflicted about her privilege" [...] in season five [...] "ends up being possessed by a millennia-old demon".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} a special five-minute {{extended}} [...] "Previously on NYPD Blue" [...] segment that retraces Simone's (Jimmy Smits) whole character history. The final portion of the prolog presents Lt. Arthur Fancy's (James McDaniel) prior episode persuasion of a police widow to directly donate her husband's heart to give Simone a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> [...] The regular portion of the episode begins after the completed heart transplant. The episode focuses on whether Simone's heart transplant was successful. [...] It starts ten days after the heart transplant with his anticipated hospital release. [...] Simone's [...] recovery is hampered by an internal chest infection, which leaves him weakened. [...] The doctors attempt diagnosis of the infection and weakness, which appear to be minor, with tests. Tensions run high in the department from almost {{the beginning of the}} episode. Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) has a scene where his verbal aggression with a citizen complainant provides a respite and represents the frustration and helplessness of Simone's friends and colleagues. [...] James Martinez' (Nicholas Turturro) generally good manners are also tested. Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) displays deep emotions to his wife ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). The doctors differ in their opinions of which treatment to use. One advises Simone and wife Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) to pursue surgery, while another advises natural progression. Sipowicz's ex-wife Katie (Debra Monk) catches him offguard by appearing at the station drunk and asking for his help. She is preparing a pro se defense against DWI charges, but when Sipowicz is about to respond with assistance, she slips away. The personal turmoil drags him away from his compassionate watch. When he is distracted, Simone's health deteriorates to the point where his demise seems imminent. Dr. Carreras suggests ending the suffering, while Dr. Swan disagrees, but Carreras believes his sentiment is masking office politics that govern how statistics are attributed to various departments. Russell is conflicted on which doctor to take advice from. Sipowicz manages his wife's crisis by negotiating agreed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After Simone receives his last rites, his colleagues say their goodbyes, while Simone dreams aloud of his mentor Patsy Ferrara. In Simone's waking dream, Patsy acts as a medium, helping Simone transition out of life. In the end, with his wife Russell by his side, Simone fades away, and the screen fades to white (as opposed to black).|$|E
