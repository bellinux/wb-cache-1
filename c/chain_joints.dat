Using flow cytometry, gene expression profiling, and Ig VH-D-JH sequencing, we monitor the initial 10 generations of development of sorted cord blood CD 34 highLineage− pluripotential progenitors growing in bone marrow S 17 stroma cocultures. We show that (i) multipotent progenitors (CD 34 +CD 45 RA+CD 10 −CD 19 −) directly generate an initial wave of Pax 5 +TdT− “unilineage” pre/pro-B cells and a later wave of “multilineage” CLP/early-B cells and (ii) the cells generated in these successive stages act as precursors for distinct pro-B cells through two independent layered pathways. Studies by others have tracked the origin of B-lineage leukemias in elderly mice to the mouse B- 1 a pre/pro-B lineage, which lacks the TdT activity that diversifies the VH-D-JH Ig heavy <b>chain</b> <b>joints</b> found in the early-B or B- 2 lineage.

40|$|Antibody {{diversity}} {{is created by}} imprecise joining of the variability (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments of the heavy and light chain loci. Analysis of rearrangements is complicated by somatic hypermutations and uncertainty concerning the sources of gene segments and the precise {{way in which they}} recombine. It has been suggested that D genes with irregular recombination signal sequences (DIR) and chromosome 15 open reading frames (OR 15) can replace conventional D genes, that two D genes or inverted D genes may be used and that the repertoire can be further diversified by heavy chain V gene (VH) replacement. Safe conclusions require large, well-defined sequence samples and algorithms minimizing stochastic assignment of segments. Two computer programs were developed for analysis of heavy <b>chain</b> <b>joints.</b> JointHMM is a profile hidden Markow model, while JointML is a maximum-likelihood-based method taking the lengths of the joint and the mutational status of the VH gene into account. The programs were applied to a set of 6329 clonally unrelated rearrangements. A conventional D gene was found in 80 % of unmutated sequences and 64 % of mutated sequences, while D-gene assignment was kept below 5 % in artificial (randomly permutated) rearrangements. No evidence for the use of DIR, OR 15, multiple D genes or VH replacements was found, while inverted D genes were used in less than 1 ‰ of the sequences. JointML was shown to have a higher predictive performance for D-gene assignment in mutated and unmutated sequences than four other publicly available programs.

40|$|Abstract — Considerable {{attention}} {{to coordinate the}} system between buyer and vendor has become an interesting issue to efficiently increase the performance of supply <b>chain</b> activities. <b>Joint</b> economic lot size model (JELS) has been introduced by many researchers as the spirit of coordinating the flow of material from the vendor to its downstream. As an inventory replenishment technique, JELS model is centered on reducing joint total cost of vendor and buyer by simultaneously deciding optimal delivery lot size, number of deliveries, and batch production lot. It is appropriate {{to take into account}} transportation costs as the function shipping weight and distance since delivery lot size has interrelated with shipping weight. Hence, this study constitutes an effort to develop the model of JELS by incorporating transportation cost. The solution procedure of the model is developed for solving two problems which are incapacitated and capacitated model. In addition, numerical examples were provided to illustrate the feasibility of the solution procedure in deriving optimal solution. The result presents central decision making which is useful for coordination and collaboration between vendor and buyer. Index Terms—Supply <b>chain,</b> <b>Joint</b> economic lot size...|$|R

Systematic observation and testing enable the practitioner to detect subtle static and dynamic abnormalities.

In a recent paper, our newly developed anchored triangle parameters were presented and shown to be well suited for the study of IK problems in many broad classes of linkages. The focus of that paper was the parameterization of non-singular solutions; among many specific types of IK problems, only one, that of a spatial <b>chain</b> with spherical <b>joints</b> imposing 5 dimensional constraints, was developed in detail. Here we present a unified approach to the solutions of that and two other types of IK problems. The critical concepts i...|$|R
