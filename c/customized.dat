40|$|We analyze a duopoly game {{in which}} {{products}} are initially differentiated in variety and quality. Each consumer has a most preferred variety and a quality valuation. Customization provides ideal varieties but {{has no effect on}} product qualities. The firms first choose whether to <b>customize</b> their products, then engage in price competition. We show that in equilibrium either both firms <b>customize,</b> only the higher quality firm <b>customizes,</b> or no firm <b>customizes.</b> Even if customization is costless, the firms might not <b>customize.</b> This happens when the quality difference between the firms is small. We explore how the total welfare changes with the fixed cost of customization. Interestingly, the relationship is not always monotonic. Contrasting with the situation when customization is not feasible, both consumer surplus and total welfare are higher when one or both firms <b>customize.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{motivations for}} <b>customizing</b> key {{bindings}} vary.

More advanced users may <b>customize</b> key bindings to better suit their workflow, adding shortcuts for their commonly used actions and possibly deleting or replacing bindings for less-used functions. Hardcore gamers often <b>customize</b> their key bindings in order to increase performance via faster reaction times.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The ability <b>customize</b> a players avatar (their {{graphical}} representa-tion) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular features of online games and graphical chat environments. Though <b>customizing</b> appearance is a common ability in most games, creating tools for <b>customizing</b> a character’s behaviour is still a diffi-cult problem. We propose a methodology, based on direct manipulation, that allows players to specify the type of behaviour they would like in a given context. This methodology is iterative, with the player performing a number of different customizations in different contexts. Players are also able to con-tinue <b>customizing</b> their character during play, with commands that can have long term and permanent effects. ...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. Using those points, the player is given the option of creating a racer with <b>customized</b> color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: Max Speed, Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer's ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points can be assigned {{to each of the}} five racing parameters. <b>Customized</b> racers can be used in all of the game's modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} <b>customized,</b> some elements were {{to be determined by}} the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded. Choosing a type {{at the beginning of the}} game affected several gameplay and story elements. Each character type had unique features that shaped the way the game was experienced, including how the environment and non-playable characters interacted with the player.|$|E
40|$|We study {{a market}} with {{customers}} who have heterogeneous preferences for product attributes. We consider {{two types of}} firms that compete on price and product variety: A traditional firm, which chooses a limited set of product configurations, and a <b>customizing</b> firm, which can produce any configuration to order. The traditional firm carries product inventories and experiences a lead-time delay. The <b>customizing</b> firm does not carry inventory, and its customers incur waiting costs until they receive their orders. We assume that the <b>customizing</b> firm has limited capacity {{in the short run}} (e. g., when it does not outsource production to high-volume manufacturers). We derive the equilibrium for a duopoly competition between the <b>customizing</b> firm and the traditional firm, study its characteristics, and compare it to a monopoly. We characterize conditions that favor customization under competition. We find that the <b>customizing</b> firm's profit is not monotone in the market size and its ease of customization. Similarly, a decline in the traditional firm's holding cost may increase or decrease its profit. We show that the unit cost differential between the firms crucially affects the <b>customizing</b> firm's ideal market size, its returns from expanding capacity, its product variety, and the way operational improvements affect its performance. mass customization, product strategy, pricing, operations-marketing interface...|$|R

5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters <b>customized</b> lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use <b>customized</b> high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A <b>customized</b> broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E

40|$|Personalized {{rendering}} of web pages gives the users greater control to view only what they prefer. The {{goal of this}} work {{is to provide a}} tool that will let users <b>customize</b> the content on the pages. Our proposed model architecture learns user preferences through interaction and eventually learns to block content that is not of interest, or is offensive, to the user. This learning from interaction is achieved through a combination of reinforcement learning and data mining techniques. In this paper we look at <b>customizing</b> the {{rendering of}} advertisements. We provide the user a tool that <b>customizes</b> itself to their preferences, and blocks irrelevant advertisements and allow only those that are of interest to the user. We also demonstrate empirically that our tool <b>customizes</b> itself to hypothetical hand crafted users. ...|$|R

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a <b>customized</b> Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and hair color, facial features, and skin tone <b>customized,</b> and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E
