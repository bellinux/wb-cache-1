I'm not asking you who she is. I'm not questioning you about your relations with her at all. I don't care who she was. The mere fact that you were at a public restaurant with a person of that kind is enough. No doubt you think I am making a great deal of fuss about a very ordinary thing. You consider that it is a man's privilege to do these things, if he can do them without being found out. But it ended everything so far as I am concerned. Am I unreasonable? I don't think so. You steal off to America, thinking I am in England, and behave like this. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if you really loved me? It's the deceit of it that hurts me.' ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{is another}} very pretty thing--the boys' sucker, only refined by the philosopher. We young ones {{have a perfect}} right to take toys, and make them into {{philosophy}}, inasmuch as now-a-days we are turning philosophy into toys. Here is a sucker, only it is made of india-rubber: if I clap it upon the table, you see at once it holds. Why does it hold? I can slip it about, and yet if I try to pull it up, {{it seems as if}} it would pull the table with it I can easily make it slip about from place to place; but only when I bring it {{to the edge of the}} table can I get it off. It is only kept down by the pressure of the atmosphere above. We have a couple of them; and if you take these two and press them together, you will see how firmly they stick. And, indeed, we may use them as they are proposed to be used, to stick against windows, or against walls, where they will adhere for an evening, and serve to hang anything on that you want. I think, however, that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at home; and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the pressure of the atmosphere. Here is a tumbler of water. Suppose I were to ask you to turn that tumbler upside-down, so that the water should not fall out, and yet not be kept in by your hand, but merely by using the pressure of the atmosphere. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Take a wine-glass, either quite full or half-full of water, and put a flat card on the top, turn it upside-down, and then see what becomes of the card and of the water. The air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the edge keeps it out.|$|E

This raised suspicions by fans whether or not the boy group were mocking the girl group. Regarding this connection to Girls' Generation, a rep of Mr.Mr told that Asia Economy that the rumours were true. Mr.Mr's new single included lyrics such as: [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> when I'm right here? / Girl, you come out so easily from behind the curtain / Not me, but another mistake, Mr.Mr / I bet you're amused by my embarrassment," [...] and, [...] "I become faint for a main like you / Am I loser and are you a winner? / We're going the same path / I must have looked small from your high perch / Is that why you did that to me?" ...|$|E

New York City, New York No. Africa November 25, 1943 Bryant Service Club 2 Young Orchard Avenue Providence, Rhode Island. U. S. A. Dear Friends, I want {{to thank}} you for your nice letter of Nov. 8 th, and I really enjoyed reading about Bryant. I did not know but a very few of the people you {{mentioned}} in your letter because I was in the class of ’ 36 and did not have the opportunity to get back to Bryant and meet the new people that came in. I hope that I will soon be home and when I do, you can bet I will be up to Bryant to see the gang. I would appreciate it, if you could find out what some of my pals in the class of ’ 36 are now doing, and write and tell me. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Well so much for that: I am fine and doing my work in the best way I know how and feel sure the war will be over shortly. I have been overseas a year now and have seen some very interesting sights here. The cold weather and rainy season is just about to begin and if anyone had ever told me before I came overhere [sic] that it got cold in Africa, I would have said “your crazy[”]. But believe it, it does get cold here. I did not know that Miss Krupa had got married but I was very glad to find out. I don not have much time to write these days and so I think you will all forgive [me] for not writing any oftener than I do. I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas too and hope next year I will be home. So far I haven’t run into any of myclass [sic] mates overhere [sic] but perhaps before it is over, I will. I do however hear from Laura Simmonds quite often and she keeps me posted pretty well on what is going on at Bryant and Little Rhodey. most of the people overhere [sic] treat the American Soldiers very well, but like anyplace in the world there are a few who don’t. So long for now and write again when you can. I sure enjoy reading about the old Alma Mater. Again a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. You are doing a swell job at home and keep it up. Youre’s [sic] in victory. Sincerely, Sgt. Gardiner W. Congdon [Transcription ends...|$|E
