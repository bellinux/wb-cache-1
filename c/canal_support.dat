50|$|During puberty, {{the hormone}} {{estrogen}} begins {{to be produced}} by the ovaries. Even {{before the beginning of}} menses (up to 12 months before menarche, typically {{at the same time as}} the development of breast buds,) vaginal discharge increases in amount and changes in composition. Estrogen matures vaginal tissues and causes increased production of glycogen by epithelial cells of the vagina. These higher levels of glycogen in the vaginal <b>canal</b> <b>support</b> the growth of lactobacilli over other bacterial species. When lactobacilli use glycogen as a food source, they convert it to lactic acid. Therefore, the predominance of lactobacilli in the vaginal canal creates a more acidic environment. In fact, the pH of the vagina and vaginal discharge after puberty ranges between 3.5 and 4.7.|$|E
40|$|THE site of {{obstruction}} to aqueous outflow in {{chronic simple glaucoma}} must lie between the anterior chamber and episcleral plexus, yet opinion remains divided between {{those who believe that}} the obstruction occurs while aqueous passes through the trabecular meshwork before entering Schlemm's canal and those who believe that it occurs in the scleral plexus beyond the <b>canal.</b> <b>Support</b> is given to the latter view by the vascular changes associated with diurnal variations in intra-ocular pressure (Duke-Elder, 1955), by the infre-quent appearance of blood in Schlemm's canal on gonioscopy in glaucoma-tous eyes, and by the direct measurement of pressures within the canal of Schlemm in the eyes of normal monkeys (Perkins, 1955). The altered blood flow in laminated aqueous veins following compression of episcleral vessels in glaucomatous eyes (Goldmann, 1949), and the direct measurement of resist-ance to outflow in normal eyes after removal of the trabecular meshwork (Grant, 1958), support the former view.
