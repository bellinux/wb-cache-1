50|$|A {{synthetic}} lethal {{approach to}} cancer therapy {{is currently being}} explored {{as a means of}} developing therapies that reduce off-target effects of chemotherapies and chemopreventative drugs. Cancer cells are marked by genetic instability, errors in DNA repair, and uncontrolled transcription, which create new synthetic lethal partners in cancer cells. Because a drug effect targeting a specific gene product resembles the phenotype caused by a mutation in that gene, a <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics that target its synthetic lethal partner. Consequently, drugs that target synthetic lethal partners of mutations in cancer cells may not be toxic to normal cells, which could avoid off-target side effects of chemotherapeutics.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} language preferences {{to describe}} a <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> in three groups: 253 members of the general community, 20 clinicians working in cancer genetics, and 269 individuals at increased risk of carrying a <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> (including 198 women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, and 71 individuals with {{a family history of}} hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). In the community sample, `faulty gene' was the preferred term {{to describe a}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation,</b> although females, those affected by cancer and those who felt cancer had a large impact on their lives were more likely to prefer the terms `gene change' or `altered gene'. In contrast, the clinicians' preference ratings for `faulty gene' and `gene change' were equal. When forced to choose between `faulty gene' and `altered gene', the high-risk patient group reported preferring `faulty gene', although over 40 % were happy with either term. Further research investigating individuals' understanding of the different terms {{that can be used to}} describe a <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation,</b> and the functional impact of these terms on patients' thoughts and feelings about their condition and on their health-related behavior after genetic counseling would be worthwhile...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe human DNA {{polymerase}} lambda (Polλ) is a DNA repair polymerase, {{which is}} believed {{not only to}} play a role in base excision repair but also to contribute to DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining. We described here that cellular expression of the recently described natural polymorphic variant of Polλ, Polλ(R 438 W), affects the homologous recombination (HR) pathway and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) events. We show that the HR defect provoked by this polymorphism enhances cellular sensitivity to the anticancer agent camptothecin (CPT), most of whose DNA damage is repaired by HR. All these effects were dependent on the DNA polymerase activity of Polλ(R 438 W) as the expression of a catalytically inactive Polλ(R 438 W) did not affect either the HR and SCE frequencies or the cellular sensitivity to CPT. These results suggest that sensitivity to CPT could result from <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> in specialized DNA repair polymerases...|$|E
40|$|Shotgun {{proteomics}} {{data analysis}} usually relies on database search. However, commonly used protein sequence databases {{do not contain}} information on protein variants and thus prevent variant peptides and proteins from been identified. Including known coding variations into protein sequence databases could help alleviate this problem. Based on our recently published human Cancer Proteome Variation Database, we have created a protein sequence database that comprehensively annotates thousands of cancer-related coding variants collected in the Cancer Proteome Variation Database as well as noncancer-specific ones from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). Using this database, we then developed a data analysis workflow for variant peptide identification in shotgun proteomics. The high risk of false positive variant identifications was addressed by a modified false discovery rate estimation method. Analysis of colorectal cancer cell lines SW 480, RKO, and HCT- 116 revealed a total of 81 peptides that contain either noncancer-specific or cancer-related variations. Twenty-three out of 26 variants randomly selected from the 81 were confirmed by genomic sequencing. We further applied the workflow on data sets from three individual colorectal tumor specimens. A total of 204 distinct variant peptides were detected, and five carried known <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations.</b> Each individual showed a specific pattern of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations,</b> suggesting potential use {{of this type of}} information for personalized medicine. Compatibility of the workflow has been tested with four popular database search engines including Sequest, Mascot, X!Tandem, and MyriMatch. In summary, we have developed a workflow that effectively uses existing genomic data to enable variant peptide detection in proteomics...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotypic}} {{consequences of}} numerous single-nucleotide variants in human mismatch repair genes are mostly undetermined. We examined 27 reported single-nucleotide variants, rarely or ambiguously verified in a population-based study, to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes, and the genotype-phenotype association in Korean populations of 330 healthy individuals, 107 sporadic colorectal cancer patients, and 107 of their first-degree relatives. Real-time PCR 5 '-nuclease assays (TaqMan) MGB assay) {{were used to}} determine 24 single-nucleotide variants, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays {{were used to determine}} 3 variants. Of these 27 variants, 4 (hMSH 2 gIVS 12 - 6, hMLH 1 655, hMLH 1 1151, and hMSH 2 1168, in descending order) were identified as SNPs occurring in 4. 5 to 53. 1 % of healthy individuals, with polymorphism levels of 0. 023 - 0. 3 (mean, 0. 092). East Asian populations had an ethnic predilection for the hMLH 1 1151 SNP. The genotype distribution for all four SNPs showed no association with sporadic colorectal cancer. Twenty-three variants were not identified in the Korean population, suggesting that fifteen of these variants are colorectal <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> and eight are SNPs. Two haplotype patterns existed exclusively, but with rare frequency, in sporadic colorectal cancer patients. The hMLH 1 655 allele was closely correlated with hMLH 1 protein expression (P = 0. 02), but none of the four SNPs was associated with clinicopathologic variables. Among the 27 single nucleotide variants of mismatch repair genes, 12 were suggestive of nonfunctional SNPs and 15 may be colorectal <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations.</b> Further verification in other ethnic groups may provide the genotypic and phenotypic significance of single nucleotide variants found in mismatch repair genes...|$|R

Here we employ an integrative analysis of high-throughput long and short read transcriptome sequencing of cancer cells to discover novel gene fusions. As a proof of concept we successfully utilized integrative transcriptome sequencing to “re-discover ” the BCR-ABL 1 10 gene fusion in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line and the TMPRSS 2 -ERG 2, 3 gene fusion in a prostate cancer cell line and tissues. Additionally, we nominated, and experimentally validated, novel gene fusions resulting in chimeric transcripts in cancer cell lines and tumors. Taken together, this study establishes a robust pipeline for the discovery of novel gene chimeras using high throughput sequencing, opening up an important class of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> for comprehensive characterization...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} whole-exome sequencing {{data from}} 97 Japanese lung adenocarcinoma patients and identified several putative cancer-related genes and pathways. Particularly, we observed that <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> patterns {{were significantly different}} between different ethnic groups. As previously reported, mutations in the EGFR gene were characteristic to Japanese, while those in the KRAS gene were more frequent in Caucasians. Furthermore, {{during the course of}} this analysis, we found that cancer-specific somatic mutations can be detected without sequencing normal tissue counterparts. 64 % of the germline variants could be excluded using a total of 217 external Japanese exome datasets. We also show that a similar approach may be used for other three ethnic groups, although the discriminative power depends on the ethnic group. We demonstrate that the ATM gene and the PAPPA 2 gene could be identified as cancer prognosis related genes. By bypassing the sequencing of normal tissue counterparts, this approach provides a useful means of not only reducing the time and cost of sequencing but also analyzing archive samples, for which normal tissue counterparts are not available...|$|E

Hereditary cancer distress (assessed by the Impact of Event Scale) and cancer worry (assessed by the Cancer Worry Scale) were assessed before, 1 week after, and 6 months after test result disclosure. Participants reporting more cancer-related distress over the study period more frequently perceived the communication about hereditary cancer with relatives as inhibited, the nuclear family functioning as disengaged-rigid or enmeshed-chaotic, the support from partner as less than adequate and the relationship to mother as less differentiated. Especially, open communication regarding hereditary cancer and partner support may be important buffers against hereditary cancer distress. Identifying individuals with insufficient sources of support and addressing the family communication concerning hereditary cancer in genetic counseling may help the counselee to adjust better to genetic testin...|$|E

Herein, a process is outlined for determining the lower limit of detection (LoD) of two droplet-based digital PCR assays for point mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Hydrolysis probe mutation-detection assays for EGFR p. L 858 R and p. T 790 M mutations were characterized in detail. Furthermore, sixteen additional <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation</b> assays were explored by the same approach. For the EGFR L 8585 R assay, the assay sensitivity is extremely good, and thus, the LoD {{is limited by the}} amount of amplifiable DNA that is analyzed. With 95 % confidence limits, the LoD is one mutant in 180, 000 wild-type molecules for the evaluation of 3. 3 μg of genomic DNA, and detection of one mutant molecule in over 4 million wild-type molecules was achieved when 70 million copies of DNA were processed. The measured false-positive rate for the EGFR L 8585 R assay is one in 14 million, which indicates the theoretical LoD if an unlimited amount of DNA is evaluated. For the EFGR T 790 M assay, the LoD is one mutant in 13, 000 for analysis of a 3. 3 μg sample of genomic DNA, and the dPCR assay limit sensitivity approaches one mutant in 22, 000 wild-type molecules...|$|E
40|$|Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1 (BRCA 1) is a tumor {{suppressor}} gene for breast and ovarian cancers. The gene locates at chromosome 17 q 21 and encodes for 1863 amino acids protein.

More than 800 mutations {{have been found in}} the population with an increased risk of cancer incidence in their families. Germ-line mutation of BRCA 1 accounts for 5 - 10 percent of all breast cancer cases. Epigenetic modifications also reduce the function of normal BRCA 1 gene.

40|$|Most cancer DNA {{sequencing}} {{studies have}} prioritized recurrent non-synonymous coding mutations {{in order to}} identify novel <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations.</b> Although attention is increasingly being paid to mutations in non-coding regions, standard approaches to identifying significant mutations may not be appropriate and there has been limited analysis of mutational clusters in functionally annotated non-coding regions. We sought to identify clustered somatic mutations (hotspot regions across samples) in functionally annotated regions in melanoma and other cutaneous malignancies (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma). Sliding window analyses revealed numerous recurrent clustered hotspot mutations in proximal promoters, with some specific clusters present in up to 25 % of cases. Mutations in melanoma were clustered within ETS and Sp 1 transcription factor binding motifs, had a UV signature and were identified in other cutaneous malignancies. Clinicopathologic correlation and mutation analysis support a causal role for chronic UV irradiation generating somatic mutations in transcription factor binding motifs of proximal promoters.

40|$|Normal sun-exposed skin {{contains}} numerous epidermal patches that stain {{positive for}} p 53 protein (p 53 immunopositive patches; PIPs), which are considered potential early precursors of skin cancer. Whilst the TP 53 gene is mutated in many PIPs, {{it is unclear}} whether PIPs contain any other <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations.</b> Here we report that PIPs, predominantly < 3, 000 p 53 immunopositive cells in size, within normal chronically exposed skin contain mutations in multiple genes which are mutated in cutaneous squamous cell cancers. These mutations in the PIPs were not detected within the non-PIP epidermis of corresponding normal chronically exposed skin. Although some of these genetic alterations are clonal in the PIPs, many of the mutations are subclonal within these lesions. Similar mutations are seen in later precancers (actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease). Our results demonstrate that PIPs in chronically exposed skin contain multiple <b>mutations</b> in <b>cancer-related</b> genes. In addition, the results indicate that the clonal evolution of mutations which are seen within later precancerous lesions and in established malignancy can also occur in PIPs within normal human skin...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the effect}} of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) {{is one of the most}} ambitious challenges in computational biology. SNPs account for about 90 % of genetic variations in human population. Recent investigations are focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs that are responsible of protein single point mutation, since mutations occurring in coding regions may affect gene functionality. Gene Ontology (GO) provides a curated vocabulary to describe gene's functionality. We propose a GO log-odd based score to discriminate functionally relevant genes. In this work we present a machine learning-based method to predict the effect of a given mutation on human health. In particular the relationship between SNPs and the insurgence of cancer has been studied using a support vector machine (SVM). Hence, we developed a SVM-based predictor (PhD-SNP-C) that put together in a unique input vector various features derived from protein sequence, profile, and a GO-based score. The predictor here proposed reaches the overall accuracy of 75 % and a correlation coefficient of 0. 50 on a set of 1087 cancer-related mutations and 1100 random selected mutation annotated as neutral in the Swiss-Prot dataset. On the same set of proteins a similar SVM-based method that does not take in to account the GO log-odd score scores 66 % of accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0. 32. Our results indicate that the inclusion of the information derived from the GO annotations improves the {{prediction of}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutation.</b> Overall, the prediction values computed by the PhD-SNP-C method are 9 % more accurate than those obtained on our previous SVM-based method with a gain of the correlation coefficient value of 0. 18.

This review will present recent advances in the study of how autosomal mutations form in somatic cells by focusing on the mouse Aprt and Tk model systems that have been developed to examine the formation of autosomal mutations in vivo. These loci can detect the entire spectrum of mutations known to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Studies with these models have provided novel information on the frequencies and types of spontaneous autosomal mutations that occur in different cell types. They also show great promise for the screening of genotoxic effects resulting from environmental exposures and for the study of mutation when DNA repair pathways are compromised.

40|$|AbstractA {{wide range}} of {{invasive}} pathological outcomes originate {{from the loss of}} epithelial phenotype and involve either loss of function or downregulation of transmembrane adhesive receptor complexes, including Ecadherin (Ecad) and binding partners β-catenin and α-catenin at adherens junctions. Cellular pathways regulating wild-type β-catenin level, or direct mutations in β-catenin that affect the turnover of the protein have been shown to contribute to cancer development, through induction of uncontrolled proliferation of transformed tumor cells, particularly in colon cancer. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that depletion of β-catenin or the prominent cancer-related S 45 deletion mutation in β-catenin present in human colon cancers both weaken tumor intercellular Ecad/Ecad bond strength and diminishes the capacity of specific extracellular matrix proteins—including collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin V—to modulate intercellular Ecad/Ecad bond strength through α-catenin and the kinase activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK- 3 β). Thus, in addition to regulating tumor cell proliferation, <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> in β-catenin can influence tumor progression by weakening the adhesion of tumor cells to one another through reduced individual Ecad/Ecad bond strength and cellular adhesion to specific components of the extracellular matrix and the basement membrane...|$|R

For such individuals, it is risk itself that constitutes the raison d'être of medical intervention. Using data from interviews with 58 users of a UK cancer genetics service together with data derived from clinical consultations, we consider the way such patients or clients make sense of a cancer genetic risk estimate and how they integrate genetic risk information into their lifeworld. In particular, we note that patient-clients who are 'at risk' tend to see themselves in a liminal position betwixt the healthy and the sick, and that such individuals consequently seek recourse to systems of medical surveillance that can continuously monitor their state of health. Our analysis also revealed {{the fact that many}} of those deemed by professionals to be at low risk of inheriting <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> subsequently strove to be re-categorised as being at moderate or high risk of an adverse outcome.

40|$|The {{process of}} natural {{selection}} acts both on individual organisms within a population and on individual cells within an organism as they develop into cancer. In this work, we have taken {{a first step toward}} understanding the differences in selection pressures exerted on the human genome under these disparate circumstances. Focusing on single amino acid substitutions, we have found that <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> (CRMs) are frequent in evolutionarily conserved sites, whereas single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) tend to appear in sites having a more relaxed evolutionary pressure. Those CRMs classed as cancer driver mutations show greater enrichment for conserved sites than passenger mutations. Consistent with this, driver mutations are enriched for sites annotated as key functional residues and their neighbors, {{and are more likely to}} be located on the surface of proteins than expected by chance. Overall the pattern of CRM and polymorphism is remarkably similar, but we do see a clear signal indicative of diversifying selection for disruptive amino acid substitutions in the cancer driver mutations. The ultimate consequence of the appearance of those mutations must be advantageous for the tumor cell, leading to cell population-growth and migration events similar to those seen in natural ecosystems.

40|$|Somatic mosaicism occurs {{throughout}} normal {{development and}} contributes to numerous disease etiologies, including tumorigenesis and neurological disorders. Intratumor genetic heterogeneity is inherent to many cancers, creating challenges for effective treatments. Unfortunately, analysis of bulk DNA masks subclonal phylogenetic architectures created by the acquisition and distribution of somatic mutations amongst cells. As a result, single-cell genetic analysis is becoming recognized as vital for accurately characterizing cancers. Despite this, methods for single-cell genetics are lacking. Here we present an automated microfluidic workflow enabling efficient cell capture, lysis, and whole genome amplification (WGA). We find that ~ 90 % of the genome is accessible in single cells with improved uniformity relative to current single-cell WGA methods. Allelic dropout (ADO) rates were limited to 13. 75 % and variant false discovery rates (SNV FDR) were 4. 11 x 10 (- 6), on average. Application to ER-/PR-/HER 2 + breast cancer cells and matched normal controls identified novel mutations that arose in a subpopulation of cells and effectively resolved the segregation of known <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> with single-cell resolution. Finally, we demonstrate effective cell classification using mutation profiles with 10 X average exome coverage depth per cell.

40|$|Phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinases are {{a family}} of enzymes which are {{involved}} in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation via signalling pathways. This, in turn, means they are linked with cancer development through mutations borne by the genes which encode them. One of these oncogenes, PIK 3 CA, encodes the catalytic subunit of p 110 a. This study will focus on p 110 a’s interaction with a phospholipid bilayer, using computational techniques, in an effort to better understand this protein and the effect the <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> have on its activity. In order to model the phospholipid bilayer in a biologically and physiologically accurate manner, with all key components present in their correct proportions, model parameters for the components had to be produced and tested in small binary systems. The components of the membrane used include the phospholipids POPC, POPE, POPS and PIP 2, as well as sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Using these new parameters for the components of a phospholipid bilayer, molecular dynamics simulations were run of the activated p 110 a subunit and two of its oncogenic mutants (E 545 K, H 1047 R) {{in the presence of a}} realistic brain lipid membrane.

40|$|Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK 3) is an {{atypical}} {{member of}} the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Recent {{studies have shown that}} ERK 3 is highly upregulated in multiple cancers, such as lung cancer and colon cancer. Importantly, ERK 3 promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by phosphorylating steroid receptor activator 3 (SRC- 3), hence upregulating pro-invasive matrix metalloproteinase genes. While the link between ERK 3 and cancers has been recognized, little is known about ERK 3 mutations in cancer progression. In this study, we have investigated ERK 3 mutations on arginine 64 (arginine 64 mutated to cysteine or histidine, R 64 C or R 64 H) and leucine 290 (leucine 290 mutated to proline or valine, L 290 P or L 290 V) that are found in cancers of lung, large intestine and skin (COSMIC database). Interestingly, both R 64 and L 290 residues are located in the kinase domain of ERK 3 and are conserved in all ERK isoforms (ERKs 1 - 4). In order to characterize these mutations, we generated expression vectors coating plasmids of ERK 3 and each ERK 3 constructs containing point mutation, and then overexpressed them in HeLa cells and lung cancer cell lines with or without stable knockdown of endogenous ERK 3. Notably, we found that all of these <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> lead to reduction of ERK 3 phosphorylation at S 189 within the activation loop. To study the functional impact of these ERK 3 mutations on cancer cell invasiveness, we expressed each of these mutants or the wild type (WT) ERK 3 in HeLa cells and lung cancer cell lines with or without stable knockdown of endogenous ERK 3 and performed trans-well migration and invasion assays. Interestingly, we found that in comparison with WT ERK 3, both L 290 P and L 290 V mutations significantly increased ERK 3 ’s ability in promoting cell migration and invasion, whereas R 64 C and R 64 H mutations resulted in a decrease in cell migration. Given that all these <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> led to reduction of ERK 3 phosphorylation at S 189, these results suggest that S 189 phosphorylation within the activation loop is not associated with ERK 3 ’s function in promoting cancer cell motility. To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which ERK 3 L 290 mutants increase cancer cell invasiveness, we examined the kinase activity of WT and mutant ERK 3 in vitro by assessing the phosphorylation of SRC- 3, a substrate for ERK 3. We found that ERK 3 L 290 P and L 290 V mutants have similar kinase activity to that of WT ERK 3. ERK 3 protein is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which may alter its function. Interestingly, by immunofluorescent staining, we found that both L 290 P and L 290 V mutations greatly increased the cytoplasmic localization of ERK 3 proteins, whereas WT ERK 3 is mostly nuclear. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cancer-related L 290 P and L 290 V mutations lead to increased ability of ERK 3 to promote cancer cell migration and invasion, possibly through their increased cytoplasmic localization...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to screen Finnish NSCLC tumor samples for common <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations</b> by {{targeted}} next generation sequencing and to determine their concurrences and associations with clinical features. Materials and methods: Sequencing libraries were prepared from DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor material of 425 patients using the AmpliSeq Colon and Lung panel covering mutational hot spot regions of 22 cancer genes. Sequencing was performed with the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Results: Data analysis of the hot spot mutations revealed mutations in 77 % of the patients, with 7 % having 3 or more mutations reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Two of the most frequently mutated genes were TP 53 (46 %) and KRAS (25 %). KRAS codon 12 mutations were the most recurrently occurring mutations. EGFR mutations were significantly associated with adenocarcinoma, female gender and never/light-smoking history; CTNNB 1 mutations with light ex-smokers, PlIC 3 CA and TP 53 mutations with squamous cell carcinoma, and KRAS with adenocarcinoma. TP 53 mutations were most prevalent in current smokers and ERBB 2, ERBB 4, PIK 3 CA, NRAS, NOTCH 1, FBWX 7, PTEN and STK 11 mutations occurred exclusively in a group of ever-smokers, however the association was not statistically significant. No mutation was found that associated with asbestos exposure. Conclusion: Finnish NSCLC patients have a similar mutation profile as other Western patients, however with a higher frequency of BRAF mutations but a lower frequency of STK 11 and ERBB 2 mutations. Moreover, TP 53 mutations occurred frequently with other gene mutations, most commonly with KRAS, MET, EGFR and PIK 3 CA mutations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Most {{sporadic}} colorectal tumors carry truncation {{mutations in}} the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The APC protein {{is involved in}} many processes that govern gut tissue. In addition to its involvement in the regulation of β-catenin, APC is a cytoskeletal regulator with direct and indirect effects on microtubules. <b>Cancer-related</b> truncation <b>mutations</b> lack direct and indirect binding sites for microtubules in APC, suggesting that loss of this function contributes to defects in APC-mutant cells. In this study, we show that loss of APC results in disappearance of cellular protrusions and decreased cell migration. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in overall microtubule stability and also by a decrease in posttranslationally modified microtubules in the cell periphery particularly the migrating edge. Consistent with the ability of APC to affect cell shape, the overexpression of APC in cells can induce cellular protrusions. These data demonstrate that cell migration and microtubule stability are linked to APC status, thereby revealing a weakness in APC-deficient cells with potential therapeutic implications...|$|R

Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators was largely intact in Aim 2 -deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM 2. Susceptibility of Aim 2 -deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with healthy wild-type mice.

40|$|Summary Mutations in the adenomatous {{polyposis}} coli (APC) tumor {{suppressor gene}} strongly predispose to development of gastro-intestinal tumors. Central to the tumorigenic events in APC mutant cells is the uncontrolled stabilization and transcriptional activation of the protein β-catenin. Many questions remain as to how APC controls β-catenin degradation. Remarkably, the large C-terminal region of APC, which spans over 2000 amino acids and includes critical regions in downregulating β-catenin, is predicted to be natively unfolded. Here we discuss how this uncommonly large disordered region may help to coordinate the multiple cellular functions of APC. Recently, {{a significant number of}} germline and somatic missense mutations in the central region of APC were linked to tumorigenesis in the colon as well as extra-intestinal tissues. We classify and localize all currently known missense mutations in the APC structure. The molecular basis by which these mutations interfere with the function of APC remains unresolved. We propose several mechanisms by which <b>cancer-related</b> missense <b>mutations</b> in the large disordered domain of APC may interfere with tumor suppressor activity. Insight in the underlying molecular events will be invaluable in the development of novel strategies to counter dysregulated Wnt signaling by APC mutations in cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Proteins of the Ras {{family are}} central {{regulators}} of crucial cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Their importance is emphasized in cancer, {{in which the}} isoforms H-ras, N-ras and K-ras are misregulated by mutations in approximately 20 – 30 % of cases. Thus, they represent major cancer oncogenes {{and one of the}} most important targets for cancer drug development. Ras proteins are small GTPases, which cycle between the GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive state. Despite the tremendous research conducted in the last three decades, many fundamental properties of Ras proteins remain poorly understood. For instance, although new concepts have recently emerged, the understanding of Ras behavior in its native environment, the membrane, is still largely missing. On the membrane Ras organizes into nanoscale clusters, also called nanoclusters. They differ between isoforms, but also between activation states of Ras. It is considered that nanoclusters represent the basic Ras signaling units. Recently, it was demonstrated that on the membrane Ras adopts distinct conformations, the so-called orientations, which are dependent on the Ras activations state. The membrane-orientation of H-ras is stabilized by the helix α 4 and the C-terminal hypervariable region (hvr). The novel switch III region was proposed to be involved in mediating the change between different H-ras orientations. When the regions involved in this mechanism are mutated, H-ras activity is changed by an unknown mechanism. This thesis has explained the connection between the change of Ras orientation on the membrane and Ras activity. We demonstrated that H-ras orientation mutants exhibit altered diffusion properties on the membrane, which reflect the changes in their nanoclustering. The altered nanoclustering consequently rules the activity of the mutants. Moreover, we demonstrated that specific <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations,</b> affecting the switch III region of different Ras isoforms, exhibit increased nanoclustering, which consequently leads to stronger Ras signaling and tumorigenicity. Thus, we have discovered nanoclustering increase as a novel mechanism of Ras activity modulation in cancer. The molecular architecture of complexes formed on the membrane upon Ras activation is another poorly understood property of Ras. The following work has provided novel details on the regulation of Ras nanoclustering by a known H-ras-GTP nanoclustering stabilizer galectin- 1 (Gal- 1). Our study demonstrated that Gal- 1 is not able to bind Ras directly, as it was previously proposed. Instead, its effect on H-ras-GTP nanoclustering is indirect, through binding of the effector proteins. Collectively, our findings represent valuable novel insights in the behavior of Ras, which will help the future research to eventually develop new strategies to successfully target Ras in cancer...|$|R

We aimed here to detect <b>cancer-related</b> gene <b>mutations</b> in routine fecal specimen; dried feces spots (DFS) on a filter paper especially designated for an automated fecal occult blood (FOB) test. DNA was simply extracted from a 3 mm disc of DFS (including around 10 mg feces) with a boiling procedure followed by a cationic surfactant extraction. K-ras common mutations, as the typical cancer-related gene alterations, were detected with a nested allele specific PCR with microfluorometry (ASP/MFL). Adequate DNA was recovered from 363 / 451 (80. 5 %) DFS specimens tested. The K-ras mutations were detected in 2 / 24 (8. 3 %) from patients with colorectal cancer and 13 / 315 (4. 1 %) from screening participants with positive FOB. No mutations were detected in 24 DFS specimens with negative FOB. The results of K-ras mutation frequency were not encouraging to achieve practically a specific dreliable method for colorectal cancer screening. However this report, identifying for the first time a cancer related gene alteration in feces using identical samples with routine FOB test, will be a step to realize a molecular genetic testing for the cancer screening...|$|R
40|$|The BRCA 1 tumor {{suppressor}} gene is found mutated in familial breast cancer. Although many of the mutations are clearly pathological because they give rise to truncated proteins, several missense variants of uncertain pathological consequences have been identified. A novel functional assay to screen for BRCA 1 missense variants in a simple genetic system could be very useful for the identification of potentially deleterious mutations. By using two prediction computer programs, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen), seven nonsynonymous missense BRCA 1 variants likely disrupting the gene function were selected as potentially deleterious. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) {{was used to test}} these <b>cancer-related</b> missense <b>mutations</b> for their ability to affect cell growth and homologous recombination (HR) at the HIS 3 and ADE 2 loci. The variants localized in the BRCA 1 C-Terminus (BRCT) domain did not show any growth inhibition when overexpressed in agreement with previous results. Overexpression of either wild-type BRCA 1 or two neutral missense variants did not increase yeast HR but when cancer-related variants were overexpressed a significant increase in recombination was observed. Results clearly showed that this genetic system can be useful to discriminate between neutral and deleterious BRCA 1 missense variants...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and follow-up {{of patients with}} bladder cancer rely on invasive procedures (cystoscopy with biopsy). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based technologies may allow the sensitive detection of <b>cancer-related</b> genetic <b>mutations</b> in exfoliated tumour material, potentially allowing the development of less invasive techniques. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of detecting mutations in exons 5 – 8 of the p 53 gene using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in bladder-washing specimens from patients with bladder cancer. Bladder-washing samples (31) were collected from patients (27) with bladder cancer. An abnormal additional SSCP band was detected in five samples from five different patients suggesting {{the presence of a}} p 53 mutation. In all five cases the same abnormal SSCP pattern was demonstrated in samples of the corresponding bladder tumour. In one case bladder washings were available from the same patient on two separate occasions with one washing demonstrating a mutation and the other not. In two further cases a mutation was demonstrated in the bladder tumour but not in the corresponding washing. It is concluded {{that it is possible to}} detect and characterize p 53 mutations in bladder-washing samples from patients with bladder cancer. Improved sensitivity in detecting mutations in a sample containing a mixture of normal and malignant cells may lead to the clinical applicability of molecular methods of disease monitoring. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Background: Identification {{of genes}} that are causally implicated in {{oncogenesis}} {{is a major}} goal in cancer research. An estimated 10 - 20 % of <b>cancer-related</b> gene <b>mutations</b> result in skipping {{of one or more}} exons in the encoded transcripts. Here we report on a strategy to screen in a global fashion for such exon-skipping events using PAttern based Correlation (PAC). The PAC algorithm has been used previously to identify differentially expressed splice variants between two predefined subgroups. As genetic changes in cancer are sample specific, we tested the ability of PAC to identify aberrantly expressed exons in single samples. Principal Findings: As a proof-of-principle, we tested the PAC strategy on human cancer samples of which the complete coding sequence of eight cancer genes had been screened for mutations. PAC detected all seven exon-skipping mutants among 12 cancer cell lines. PAC also identified exon-skipping mutants in clinical cancer specimens although detection was compromised due to heterogeneous (wild-type) transcript expression. PAC reduced the number candidate genes/exons for subsequent mutational analysis by two to three orders of magnitude and had a substantial true positive rate. Importantly, of 112 randomly selected outlier exons, sequence analysis identified two novel exon skipping events, two novel base changes and 21 previously reported base changes (SNPs). Conclusions: The ability of PAC to enrich for mutated transcripts and to identify known and novel genetic changes confirms its suitability as a strategy to identify candidate cancer genes...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput genomic {{technologies}} (HGTs), including next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), microarray, and serial {{analysis of}} gene expression (SAGE), have become effective experimental tools for cancer genomics to identify cancer-associated somatic genomic alterations and genes. The main hurdle in cancer genomics {{is to identify}} the real causative mutations or genes out of many candidates from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis. One useful approach is to refer to known cancer genes and associated information. The list of known cancer genes {{can be used to}} determine candidates of cancer driver mutations, while cancer gene-related information, including gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and pathways, can be useful for scoring novel candidates. Some cancer gene or mutation databases exist for this purpose, but few specialized tools exist for an automated analysis of a long gene list from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis. This report presents a new web-accessible bioinformatic tool, called CaGe, a cancer genome annotation system for the assessment of candidates of cancer genes from HGT-based cancer genomics. The tool provides users with information on <b>cancer-related</b> genes, <b>mutations,</b> pathways, and associated annotations through annotation and browsing functions. With this tool, researchers can classify their candidate genes from cancer genome studies into either previously reported or novel categories of cancer genes and gain insight into underlying carcinogenic mechanisms through a pathway analysis. We show the usefulness of CaGe by assessing its performance in annotating somatic mutations from a published small cell lung cancer study...|$|R
40|$|Ewing sarcoma (ES) is {{the second}} most common {{malignant}} bone and soft tissue tumor in children and adolescents. Despite advances in comprehensive treatment, patients with ES metastases still suffer poor outcomes, thus, emphasizing the need for detailed genetic profiles of ES patients to identify suitable molecular biomarkers for improved prognosis and development of effective and targeted therapies. In this study, the next generation sequencing Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v 2 was used to identify <b>cancer-related</b> gene <b>mutations</b> in the tissue samples from 20 ES patients. This platform targeted 207 amplicons of 2800 loci in 50 cancer-related genes. Among the 20 tissue specimens, 62 nonsynonymous hotspot mutations were identified in 26 cancer-related genes, revealing the molecular heterogeneity of ES. Among these, five novel <b>mutations</b> in <b>cancer-related</b> genes (KDR, STK 11, MLH 1, KRAS, and PTPN 11) were detected in ES, and these mutations were confirmed with traditional Sanger sequencing. ES patients with KDR, STK 11, and MLH 1 mutations had higher Ki- 67 proliferation indices than the ES patients lacking such mutations. Notably, {{more than half of the}} ES patients harbored one or two possible 'druggable' mutations that have been previously linked to a clinical cancer treatment option. Our results provided the foundation to not only elucidate possible mechanisms involved in ES pathogenesis but also indicated the utility of Ion Torrent sequencing as a sensitive and cost-effective tool to screen key oncogenes and tumor suppressors in order to develop personalized therapy for ES patients...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{affecting}} European women and the leading cause of cancer-related death. A total of 15 - 20 % of women who develop breast cancer have a family history and 5 - 10 % a true genetic predisposition. The identification and screening of women at increased risk may allow early detection of breast cancer and improve prognosis. We established a family risk assessment clinic in May 2005 to assess and counsel women with a family history of breast cancer, to initiate surveillance, and to offer risk-reducing strategies for selected high-risk patients. Patients at medium or high risk of developing breast cancer according to NICE guidelines were accepted. Family history was determined by structured questionnaire and interview. Lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was calculated using Claus and Tyrer-Cuzick scoring. Risk of carrying a breast <b>cancer-related</b> gene <b>mutation</b> was calculated using the Manchester system. One thousand two hundred and forty-three patients have been referred. Ninety-two percent were at medium or high risk of developing breast cancer. Formal assessment of risk has been performed in 368 patients, 73 % have a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and 72 % a Manchester score >or= 16. BRCA 1 / 2 mutations have been identified in 14 patients and breast cancer diagnosed in two. Our initial experience of family risk assessment has shown there to be a significant demand for this service. Identification of patients at increased risk of developing breast cancer allows us to provide individuals with accurate risk profiles, and enables patients to make informed choices regarding their follow-up and management...|$|R
40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} gene p 53 {{has been identified as}} the most frequent target of genetic alterations in human cancers. A considerable number of environmentally induced, <b>cancer-related</b> p 53 <b>mutations</b> in human tumors have been found in a highly conserved proline-rich sequence of the p 53 protein encompassed by amino acid residues 147 - 158. Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energy for Peptides Program), we have determined the low-energy three-dimensional structures for this dodecapeptide sequence for the human wild-type p 53 protein and three environmentally induced, cancer-related mutant p 53 proteins with His- 151, Ser- 152, and Val- 154, respectively. The results suggest that the wild-type sequence adopts a well-defined low-energy conformation and that the mutant peptides adopt well-defined conformations that are distinctly different from the conformation of the wild-type peptide. These results are consistent with experimental conformational studies demonstrating altered detectability of antigenic epitopes in wild-type and mutant p 53 proteins. These results suggest that the oncogenic effects of these environmentally induced, cancer-related, mutant p 53 proteins may be mediated by distinct local conformational changes in the protein...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the major health {{problems}} worldwide and it is the second cause of cancer-related in women. Patients often develop resistance to the current therapies. For this reason, the identification of new specific clinical molecular markers and pharmacologic targets in cancer research is an ongoing challenge. Over the last years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have become one of the main subjects of study in the area of cancer genomics. They negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptional by inhibiting translation and causing degradation of target mRNA. More than a thousand miRNAs exist in the human genome and each one can potentially regulate hundreds of mRNAs. By regulating the expression of target genes, miRNAs can have a tumor suppressor or oncogenic role. Therefore, miRNAs can play an important role in all the phases of cancer, like as initiation, progression, growth, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. In a previous study based on miRNA profiling, in different solid tumors, comprised breast cancer, and normal tissues, several miRNA were reported to be over- or down-regulated in solid tumors in comparison to normal tissues (Volinia et al. Genome Res. 2010). In other scientific reports other miRNAs were positively or negatively correlated with tumor progression (Volinia S. and Croce CM. PNAS 2013). Starting from these literature data, we decided to analyze the in vitro effect of the administration of this tumor-related miRNAs in order to verify their effect on the viability and transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cell line, in order to gain experimental evidences on their actual involvement in the tumor illness. Firstly, we have chosen 10 different cell lines of breast cancer origin (MCF- 7, MDA-MB- 231, MDA-MB- 468, MDA-MB- 361, SKBR 3, T 47 D, BT 474, ZR 75. 1, MDA-MB- 453, HBL- 100) and on 2 cell lines of breast normal epithelium (MCF 10 A and 184 A 1). Genomic analysis revealed presence of a complex panel of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>mutations,</b> and the cell lines were different in term of cell growth. We checked also the miRNA levels inside cell lines. Two groups of primary solid tumor-related (23 miRNAs: hsa-miR- 126 *, hsa-let- 7 d*, hsa-miR- 326, hsa-miR- 320 c, hsa-miR- 302 a, hsa-miR- 222, hsa-miR- 218, hsa-miR- 210, hsa-miR- 206, hsa-miR- 203, hsa-miR- 202, hsa-miR- 181 a, hsa-miR- 142, hsa-miR- 145, hsa-miR- 143, hsa-miR- 138, hsa-miR- 130 b, hsa-miR- 126, hsa-miR- 99 a, hsa-miR- 28 - 5 p, hsa-miR- 33 b, hsa-miR- 26 b, hsa-miR- 21) or progression-related (15 miRNAs: hsa-miR- 9, hsa-miR- 10 a, hsa-miR- 25, hsa-miR- 27, hsa-miR- 30 a, hsa-miR- 93, hsa-miR- 103, hsa-miR- 148 b, hsa-miR- 151, hsa-miR- 301 a, hsa-miR- 328, hsa-miR- 484, hsa-miR- 615, hsa-miR- 874, hsa-miR- 1307) miRNAs were transiently transfected into cells, and viability was assessed. We were able to experimentally identify two groups of miRNAs which were able to significantly increase or decrease cell viability. The miRNAs that showed to increase cellular viability in five out twelve cell lines were: miR- 130 b, miR- 138, miR- 210, miR- 148 b and miR- 1307. On the other hand, miR- 93, miR- 126 and miR- 145 displayed a significant inhibitory effect on cell viability in five out twelve cell lines. These miRNAs were further investigated for their capacity to affect cell migration, cell invasion, and genome profiling. The main outcome of our work has been the identification from a wide list of cancer-related miRNAs of few of them involved in the in vitro regulation of cell growth and invasion. As a first attempt to identify target genes commonly regulated in vivo and in vitro, we have bioinformatically identified, in a first not exhaustive screening, PTEN and DICER 1 genes, which in vivo and in vitro negatively correlated with miR- 210 and miR- 130 b, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{silencing}} of {{gene expression}} {{has become an}} intensively studied topic regarding breast cancer during the last years. Previous investigations have shown that hypermethylation in gene promoters is an alternative to <b>mutations</b> <b>cancer-related</b> mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor gene function. The present study was designed for evaluation of promoter methylation in p 53 and ATM tumor suppressor genes in Bulgarian patients with sporadic breast cancer. Sodium bisulfite conversion and methylation-specific PCR were performed on tumor DNA isolated from 55 patients with sporadic breast cancer. The data showed normal profile of methylation in the promoter region of p 53 and ATM genes in all studied patients. Cases with hypermethylation were not observed. Our results {{did not support the}} involvement of p 53 and ATM promoter hypermethylation in the neoplastic pathways of sporadic breast cancer. The lack of promoter hypermethylation in p 53 and ATM is suggestive of a greater share of genetic aberrations in loss of tumor suppressor function of these genes and presumes the involvement of other epigenetic cancer mechanisms. To our knowledge this study provides the first data on promoter hypermethylation status of p 53 and ATM genes in Bulgarian patients...|$|R
