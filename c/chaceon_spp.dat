40|$|Operations {{of foreign}} fishing vessels in Brazilian waters {{chartered}} {{to operate on}} unexploited fishing grounds within the Brazilian EEZ, {{have contributed to the}} development of the national fishing industry, as it incremented total fish production as well has allowed the transference of new technologies and other benefits. Nevertheless, it is important to identify, among the information gathered, those of economic nature, which would guide inversions in a national and oceanic deep-sea fishing activity that is both economically viable and sustainable in the long term. We assessed recent Brazilian exports of deep-sea crabs (<b>Chaceon</b> <b>spp.)</b> caught by chartered pot vessels off southern Brazil in 2002. Foreign markets consumption patterns were established through the analysis of exported volumes reported by each State, main harbors used by pot vessels and processing technologies employed. These patterns may contribute to future actions of the national fishing industry, as their awareness tend to reduce risks and uncertainties about the exploitations of new products and markets.
