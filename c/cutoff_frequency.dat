5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency)</b> applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E

50|$|A {{bandpass}} filter passes frequencies between its two <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies,</b> while attenuating {{those outside the}} range. A band-reject filter, attenuates frequencies between its two <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies,</b> while passing those outside the 'reject' range.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} calculating the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{of modes in}} optical fibers with arbitrary refractive index profile is presented. Using a variational technique, the cutoff problem {{is transformed into a}} generalized eigenvalue problem whose eigenvalues are the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A similar variational technique has already been used for determining both the propagation constants and fields of guided modes of matched-clad optical fibers. In this technique, a series expansion of Laguerre-Gauss functions and a modified Bessel function have been used for describing the field in the fiber core and in the uniform cladding respectively. Here we adapt this technique for computing the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> using the limiting form for small argument of the modified Bessel function. <b>Cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> have been calculated for optical fibers with power-law refractive index profiles for which either exact or approximate reference solutions are available. A comparison with other published data is also reported...|$|R

25|$|The <b>cutoff</b> <b>{{frequency}}</b> is {{the frequency}} below which a radio wave fails to penetrate {{a layer of}} the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by refraction from the layer.|$|E
25|$|This scheme {{therefore}} cannot directly handle {{low frequency}} (or DC) modulating signals {{but this is}} not a problem in the many AC-coupled video and audio FM transmitters that use this method. Such signals may also be placed on a subcarrier above the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> of the PLL loop filter.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{with the}} lowest <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> is termed the {{dominant}} mode of the guide. It is common to choose {{the size of the}} guide such that only this one mode can exist in the frequency band of operation. In rectangular and circular (hollow pipe) waveguides, the dominant modes are designated the TE1,0 mode and TE1,1 modes respectively.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the various modes it is {{sufficient}} to set kz=0 in the determinant and solve the equation, which is now strongly simplified, with reference to frequency. A similar simplification does not occur when using the transverse resonance method since kz only implicitly appears; then the equations to be solved in {{order to obtain}} the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> are formally the same.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple, accurate, and fast {{numerical}} method for calculating the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> of optical planar dielectric guiding structures. From Maxwell's equations we derive a transmission-line equivalent circuit for any mode of the guiding structure. The problem {{of finding the}} <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> is transformed into finding the resonance frequency of the equivalent circuit. The algorithm uses no Bessel or other complicated functions and could be implemented on small microcomputers. The technique {{can also be used}} with data from measurements...|$|R
25|$|Many PLL {{frequency}} synthesizers {{can also}} generate frequency modulation (FM). The modulating signal {{is added to}} the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the modulating signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with opposite polarity to the modulating signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.|$|E
25|$|RO is {{a simple}} and {{convenient}} tool for tuning the frequency of oscillators, filters and amplifiers in analog synthesizers. Particularly simple is their implementation in the voltage-controlled RC filters in a Sallen-Key topology, where the RO provides a nearly exponential dependence of the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> on the controlling current, without using feedback by the modulation signal. However, due to the slow response of ROs, most synthesizer developers of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ARP, Korg, Moog and Roland, preferred other elements. As of August 2013 RO-based synthesizers are produced by Doepfer (Germany). A still popular use for ROs are Lowpass Gates like the 292 by Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments or the Makenoise MMG.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of horn loudspeakers {{is they are}} more efficient; they can typically produce 10 times (10 dB) more sound power than a cone speaker from a given amplifier output. Therefore horns are widely used in public address systems, megaphones, and sound systems for large venues like theaters, auditoriums, and sports stadiums. Their disadvantage is that their frequency response is more uneven because of resonance peaks, and horns have a <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> below which their response drops off. To achieve adequate response at bass frequencies horn speakers must be very large and cumbersome, so they are more often used for midrange and high frequencies. The first practical loudspeakers, introduced {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, were horn speakers. Due to the development in recent decades of cone loudspeakers which have a flatter frequency response, and the availability of inexpensive amplifier power, the use of horn speakers in high fidelity audio systems over the last decades has declined.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> of a {{conducting}} {{circular waveguide}} loaded eccentrically by a cylinder are calculated. Analytical formulations are developed {{based on the}} boundary value method. The cutoff wavenumbers are then calculated as roots of the resulting characteristic determinant. Even and odd hybrid modes are considered and the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> calculated for both cases. Several examples for special cases are introduced for comparison followed by other general examples. The case of a dielectric-filled circular waveguide with an eccentric air core is also examine...|$|R
30|$|FigureÂ  3 {{shows the}} {{variation}} of the upper and the lower <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the channel of Hall thruster, which indicates that there is negligible difference between the lower and upper <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> toward the anode, which means the frequency band carries negligible width this side. However, after the middle (x[*]=[*] 0) of the chamber, the frequency band is found to increase toward the exit. This implies that oscillations with comparatively higher frequency or smaller wavelength will be unstable toward the exit plane of the channel.|$|R

25|$|Finite bandwidth: All {{amplifiers}} have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has {{the frequency}} response of an integrator with gain. That is, the gain {{of a typical}} op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its gainâbandwidth product(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it {{the characteristics of a}} first-order low-pass filter with very high DC gain and low <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a current-feedback operational amplifier is often used.|$|E
500|$|Another feature {{peculiar}} to waveguide filters {{is that there}} is a definite frequency, the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency,</b> below which no transmission can take place. [...] This means that in theory low-pass filters cannot be made in waveguides. [...] However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. [...] The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> is below any frequency of interest to the application. [...] The waveguide <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. [...] Likewise, the guide wavelength (Î»g) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.|$|E

40|$|The Debye {{model is}} {{modified}} for {{the calculation of}} the lattice thermal conductivity and used to gain insight into the anisotropy of Bi 2 Te 3. In this work, the Debye temperature is not used to estimate the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the phonons that carry heat. The <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> are defined by setting an upper limit to the energy of acoustic phonons using the complete dispersion relations. The anisotropy of the thermal conductivity {{is found to be}} unrelated to the anisotropy of the sound velocities. It is found that the sound velocity is almost isotropic when the longitudinal and two transversal waves are added together. In addition the relaxation time must be a function of the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> and counterbalances the anisotropy arising from the variation of the number of acoustic phonons traveling in various directions. It is concluded that the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity is mostly related to the GrÃ¼neisen's constant...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersion}} relation determining guided TE and TM modes {{are found}} for the slab hyperbolic waveguide. The waveguide is consisting of an isotropic dielectric slab bounded by hyperbolic media. Some differences between {{the features of the}} waveguide under consideration and conventional ones are obtained. In particular, in the case of hyperbolic waveguide TM modes have two <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As a result the number of modes is limited. Both TE and TM modes have nonzero <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies,</b> even though waveguide is symmetric one. For the TE and TM modes the Poynting vector component along the waveâs propagation axis could be equal to zero...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{and modes}} of a cylindrical- rectangular waveguide containing an off-axis inner dielectric cylinder with electrically small radius are derived, for both TM and TE modes. The walls of the waveguide {{as well as the}} dielectric cylinder are both lossless. Cylindrical-rectangular wave functions and related addition theorems-expansion in terms of cylindrical ones, are used. The results are useful for waveguides containing inhomogeneities of small radius, {{as well as for the}} determination of the permittivity or magnetic permeability of various materials, by measuring the shifts of the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> caused by the introduction of cylindrical samples of them, inside waveguides. The results for a conducting inner cylinder are a special case of the present ones. Graphical results giving the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> for some of the lower order modes are given, for various values of the parameters and for both kinds of modes. For several values of the parameters the presence of the inner cylinder increases the bandwidth of the dominant mode in comparison to that of the unperturbed waveguide. Â© 1994...|$|R
500|$|Evanescent modes are modes {{below the}} <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency.</b> [...] They cannot {{propagate}} down the waveguide for any distance, dying away exponentially. [...] However, {{they are important}} in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts, described later, because energy is stored in the evanescent wave fields.|$|E
500|$|Waffle-iron filters are, in essence, {{low-pass}} filters {{but like all}} waveguide devices will not transmit anything below the waveguide <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency.</b> [...] Waffle-iron filters are used where both a wide passband with low insertion loss, and a wide (sometimes very wide) stopband are needed.

500|$|The {{range of}} {{frequencies}} over which waveguide filters are useful is largely {{determined by the}} waveguide size needed. [...] At lower frequencies the waveguide needs to be impractically large {{in order to keep}} the <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> below the operational frequency. [...] On the other hand, filters whose operating frequencies are so high that the wavelengths are sub-millimetre cannot be manufactured with normal machine shop processes. [...] At frequencies this high, fibre-optic technology starts to become an option.|$|E
500|$|According to Cauer, {{there are}} three major tasks that network {{synthesis}} has to address. [...] The first {{is the ability to}} determine whether a given transfer function is realisable as an impedance network. [...] The second is to find the canonical (minimal) forms of these functions and the relationships (transforms) between different forms representing the same transfer function. [...] Finally, it is not, in general, possible to find an exact finite-element solution to an ideal transfer function - such as zero attenuation at all frequencies below a given <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency</b> and infinite attenuation above. [...] The third task is therefore to find approximation techniques for achieving the desired responses.|$|E
500|$|Like {{transmission}} line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple passbands, {{replicas of the}} lumped element prototype. [...] In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two {{in the case of}} band-stop filters) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. [...] This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. [...] Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function. [...] For this reason, true low-pass and high-pass filters cannot exist in waveguide. [...] At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. [...] But, similar to the situation with waveguide <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequency,</b> the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.|$|E
30|$|Method I {{utilizes}} notch and left-hand <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> as {{filter design}} constraints, which {{is suitable for}} the case of very narrow interference bandwidths and symmetrical magnitude responses about the notch frequencies. Method I is adopted in [1].|$|R
30|$|Method III employs {{left-hand}} and right-hand <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> as {{the constraints}} for filter design.

30|$|Method II, in {{contrast}} to method I, utilizes notch and right-hand <b>cutoff</b> <b>frequencies</b> for filter design. Roughly, {{it has the same}} applicability and limitations as method I, but the results of method II are slightly different from those of method I.|$|R
