25|$|The {{biological}} production of hydrogen fuel {{has been a}} topic of research {{since at least the}} 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, <b>consumer</b> <b>waste</b> and other specific agricultural crops. Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called gasification, where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by pyrolysis, a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control. Another source for {{biological production}} of hydrogen fuel is algae. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Experimental algae farms are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.|$|E

40|$|Background Although <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste</b> has {{increasingly}} received attention {{in both the}} public and the scientific domain, its complex nature is far from unravelled. Scope and approach This study aimed to contribute to an integral understanding of possible causal pathways of <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste,</b> by means of a configurative systematic literature review of potential factors of <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste.</b> Insights from 59 scientific articles have been systematically analysed and synthesised. Key findings and conclusions <b>Consumer</b> food <b>waste</b> research is characterised by fragmentation, lack of differentiation, and a relative scarcity of explanatory research into causal mechanisms. Potential factors of <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste</b> have been identified and categorised into behavioural, personal, product and societal factors and subclusters of these categories. On the basis of a synthesised overview of 116 factors, a framework has been developed that conceptualises the generation of <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste</b> in relation to stages of the household food chain. This review sheds light on the context-dependent ways in which proposed factors may be related to food waste and the possibility of parallel causal routes. Food waste factors might exert their influence in unexpected, indirect or multiple ways, possibly explaining contradictory findings. They might interact with other factors or form a condition for other factors to play a role, or might be correlated with food waste without playing a causal role. The framework may facilitate an integral and context-sensitive systems perspective, thereby promoting studies that account for the complexity of <b>consumer</b> food <b>waste</b> and intervention programmes that are better targeted...|$|R

In this paper, we recall briefly the principles underlying the reasoning process, and we detail the main functionalities and the architecture of the argumentation tool.

40|$|One-third of all edible food {{products}} {{for human consumption}} is wasted or lost in the supply chain, with negative social, economic and environmental consequences. Although consumers are the single largest contributors to food waste in industrialized countries, food waste has not received much attention in the literature, and it remains unknown why <b>consumers</b> <b>waste</b> so much. We propose that food waste is driven by inconsistencies between planned decisions on what to eat and decisions on what is actually consumed. Based on Temporal Construal Level Theory, we propose that with larger temporal distance between choice and consumption moment, such as when consumers buy their groceries for several days in advance, the share of chosen virtuous products increases, which {{at the moment of}} consumption may be replaced by more attractive vice products, ultimately leading to waste. While we do not find evidence that the temporal distance between choice and consumption moment affects the share of chosen virtue products, our study shows that food waste is larger when consumers have initially chosen more virtuous products. In particular consumers with a high controlled health motivation waste more if they have initially chosen many virtuous products...|$|R
