30|$|Within the Jasper Fire region, we {{established}} six study sites of 300 ha to 400 ha. Saab et al. (2002) noted that pre-fire canopy cover might reflect post-fire woodpecker use and, therefore, we selected sites based on pre-fire canopy cover (Vierling et al. 2008). Two {{of the six}} study sites had a pre-fire canopy cover of > 70 %, two study sites had a pre-fire canopy cover of 40 % to 70 %, and two study sites had a pre-fire canopy cover of < 40 %. We used the Black Hills National Forest Resource Information System (RIS) database (Lentile et al. 2006) to identify our sites within the burned landscape and randomly selected the sites within each pre-fire <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class.</b> We established one study site {{within each of the}} two old burn sites that were of similar size to the recent burn study sites.|$|E
40|$|Modifications in {{vegetation}} cover {{can have an}} impact on the climate through changes in biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes. In this paper, the tree canopy cover percentage of a savannah-like ecosystem (montado/dehesa) was estimated at Landsat pixel level for 2011, and the role of different canopy cover percentages on land surface albedo (LSA) and land surface temperature (LST) were analysed. A modelling procedure using a SGB machine-learning algorithm and Landsat 5 -TM spectral bands and derived vegetation indices as explanatory variables, showed that the estimation of montado canopy cover was obtained with good agreement (R 2 = 78. 4 %). Overall, montado canopy cover estimations showed that low <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class</b> (MT_ 1) is the most representative with 50. 63 % of total montado area. MODIS LSA and LST products were used to investigate the magnitude of differences in mean annual LSA and LST values between contrasting montado canopy cover percentages. As a result, it was found a significant statistical relationship between montado canopy cover percentage and mean annual surface albedo (R 2 = 0. 866, p < 0. 001) and surface temperature (R 2 = 0. 942, p < 0. 001). The comparisons between the four contrasting montado canopy cover classes showed marked differences in LSA (χ 2 = 192. 17, df = 3, p < 0. 001) and LST (χ 2 = 318. 18, df = 3, p < 0. 001). The highest montado canopy cover percentage (MT_ 4) generally had lower albedo than lowest <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class,</b> presenting a difference of − 11. 2 % in mean annual albedo values. It was also showed that MT_ 4 and MT_ 3 are the cooler canopy cover classes, and MT_ 2 and MT_ 1 the warmer, where MT_ 1 class had a difference of 3. 42 °C compared with MT_ 4 class. Overall, this research highlighted the role that potential changes in montado canopy cover may play in local land surface albedo and temperature variations, as an increase in these two biogeophysical parameters may potentially bring about, in the long term, local/regional climatic changes moving towards greater aridity...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of the pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla Tort. & Frem. -Juniperus osteosperma Tort.) woodland type in the Great Basin has been widely documented, but little is known concerning how. topographic heterogeneity influences the temporal development of such vegetation changes. The goals {{of this study were}} to quantify the overall rates of pinyon-juniper expansion over the past 3 decades, and determine the landscape factors influencing patterns of expansion in central Nevada. Aerial panchromatic photos (1966 - 1995) were used,to quantify changing distribution of pinyon-juniper woodland, over multiple spatial scales (0. 002 -, 0. 02 -, and 0. 4 -ha median patch sizes), and for discrete categories of elevation, slope aspect, slope steepness, hillslope position, and prior <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class.</b> An object-oriented multiscale segmentation and classification scheme, based on attributes of brightness, shape, homogeneity, and texture, was applied to classify vegetation. Over the 30 -year period, the area of woodland has increased by 11 % over coarse, ecotonal scales (0. 4 -ha scale) but by 33 % over single-tree scales (20 -m(2) scale). Woodland expansion has been dominated by infilling processes Where small tree patches have established in openings between larger, denser patches. Infilling rates have been greatest at lower elevations, whereas migration of the woodland belt over coarser scales has proceeded in both upslope and downslope directions. Increases in woodland area were several times greater where terrain variables indicated more mesic conditions. Management treatments involving removal of trees should be viewed in a long-term context, because tree invasion is likely to proceed rapidly on productive sites...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInvasive {{woody plant}} {{expansion}} {{is a primary}} threat driving fragmentation and loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and prairie habitats across the central and western United States. Expansion of native woody plants, including conifer (primarily Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.), {{over the past century}} is primarily attributable to wildfire suppression, historic periods of intensive livestock grazing, and changes in climate. To guide successful conservation programs aimed at reducing top-down stressors, we mapped invasive woody plants at regional scales to evaluate landscape level impacts, target restoration actions, and monitor restoration outcomes. Our overarching goal was to produce seamless regional products across sociopolitical boundaries with resolution fine enough to depict the spatial extent and degree of woody plant invasion relevant to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) conservation efforts. We mapped tree <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> at 1 -m spatial resolution across an 11 -state region (508 265 km 2). Greater than 90 % of occupied lesser prairie-chicken habitat was largely treeless for conifers (67 % was treeless for mesquite.

40|$|AbstractIn {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems, encroachment of pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.; hereafter, “pinyon-juniper”) trees {{has increased}} dramatically since European settlement. Understanding the impacts of this encroachment on behavioral decisions, distributions, and population dynamics of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other sagebrush obligate species could help benefit sagebrush ecosystem management actions. We employed a novel two-stage Bayesian model that linked avoidance across different levels of pinyon-juniper cover to sage-grouse survival. Our analysis relied on extensive telemetry data collected across 6 yr and seven subpopulations within the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment (DPS), {{on the border of}} Nevada and California. The first model stage indicated avoidance behavior for all <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>classes</b> on average, but individual grouse exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity in avoidance behavior of the lowest <b>cover</b> <b>class</b> (e. g., scattered isolated trees). The second stage modeled survival as a function of estimated avoidance parameters and indicated increased survival rates for individuals that exhibited avoidance of the lowest <b>cover</b> <b>class.</b> A post hoc frailty analysis revealed the greatest increase in hazard (i. e., mortality risk) occurred in areas with scattered isolated trees consisting of relatively high primary plant productivity. Collectively, these results provide clear evidence that local sage-grouse distributions and demographic rates are influenced by pinyon-juniper, especially in habitats with higher primary productivity but relatively low and seemingly benign tree cover. Such areas may function as ecological traps that convey attractive resources but adversely affect population vital rates. To increase sage-grouse survival, our model predictions support reducing actual pinyon-juniper cover as low as 1. 5 %, which is lower than the published target of 4. 0 %. These results may represent effects of pinyon-juniper cover in areas with similar ecological conditions to those of the Bi-State DPS, where populations occur at relatively high elevations and pinyon-juniper is abundant and widespread...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} development and testing of a method for estimating cattle carrying capacities. A series of studies were conducted in developing this method. Range site and vegetation production data were grouped by topographic position and multiple linear regression equations were calculated for predicting vegetation production as a site deviated from the average case of a given range site. Overstory-understory relationships from the literature were adapted into overstory <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>classes</b> for predicting understory production and tested on a variety of range sites. Use of these classes produced understory biomass estimates within 13 % of measured biomass. Range condition class and understory aspect dominance by forage vs. non-forage species were investigated as estimators of forage value of the understory vegetation. Both were significantly related to amount of forage in the understory. However, understory aspect proved to be a better estimator when individual comparisons were examined. The previous findings, along with Soil Conservation Service range site guides, were used to calculate resource value ratings. Adjustment factors to be applied to the resource value ratings were calculated, using data from the literature, to account for the effects of slope and distance from water on forage utilization by cattle. These resource value ratings and adjustment factors form the basis of the carrying capacity estimation method. Pastures identified as properly utilized were used in testing the method developed. Pastures were mapped for range site, vegetation, slope and water location. Maps were converted to digital form and analyzed using the Map Analysis Package (MAP) computer program (Tomlin, 1975). Construction of a final range site-vegetation-slope-distance from water map, assigning of resource value ratings and adjustment factors, and computation of final carrying capacity estimates were accomplished using MAP. Carrying capacity estimates from the developed method were well correlated to estimates from ocular reconnaissance and area allowable use methods, r =. 87 and. 97, respectively, and with the actual use (perceived proper use), r =. 95. These estimates were accomplished without intensive field sampling.

CNES, the French national space agency, launched {{a program in}} 2013, ‘SPOT 4 take 5 ’, to simulate such a dataflow using the SPOT HRV sensor, which has similar spectral characteristics to the Sentinel sensor, but lower (20 m) spatial resolution. Such data flow enables {{the analysis of the}} satellite images using temporal analysis, an approach previously restricted to lower spatial resolution sensors. We acquired 23 such images over Tanzania for the period from February to June 2013. The data were analysed with aim of discriminating between different forest cover percentages for landscape units of 0. 5 ha over a site characterised by deciduous intact and degraded forests. The SPOT data were processed by one extracting temporal vegetation indices. We assessed the impact of the high acquisition rate with respect to the current rate of one image every 16 days. Validation data, giving the percentage of forest canopy cover in each land unit were provided by very high resolution satellite data. Results show that using the full temporal series it is possible to discriminate between forest units with differences of more than 40 % tree cover or more. Classification errors fell exclusively into the adjacent forest <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class</b> of 20 % or less.

40|$|Advances {{in animal}} {{tracking}} technologies have reduced but not eliminated positional error. While aware of such inherent error, scientists often proceed with analyses that assume exact locations. The results of such analyses then represent one realization in a distribution of possible outcomes. Evaluating results {{within the context}} of that distribution can strengthen or weaken our confidence in conclusions drawn from the analysis in question. We evaluated the habitat-specific positional error of stationary GPS collars placed under a range of vegetation conditions that produced a gradient of canopy cover. We explored how variation of positional error in different vegetation cover types affects a researcher’s ability to discern scales of movement in analyses of first-passage time for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We placed 11 GPS collars in 4 different vegetative canopy cover types classified as the proportion of cover above the collar (0 – 25 %, 26 – 50 %, 51 – 75 %, and 76 – 100 %). We simulated the effect of positional error on individual movement paths using cover-specific error distributions at each location. The different cover classes did not introduce any directional bias in positional observations (1 m#mean# 6. 51 m, 0. 24 #p# 0. 47), but the standard deviation of positional error of fixes increased significantly with increasing <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>class</b> for the 0 – 25 %, 26 – 50 %, 51 – 75 % classes (SD = 2. 18 m, 3. 07 m, and 4. 61 m, respectively) and then leveled off in the 76 – 100 % cover class (SD = 4. 43 m).

40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} the robust performance of the ensemble machine learning classifier, random forests, for remote sensing land cover classification, particularly across complex landscapes. This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) {{in the context of}} large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>classes)</b> classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78. 3 % Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70. 1 % with 25 % mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82. 3 % and 78. 3 % for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Tallgrass prairie is an {{endangered}} ecosystem and encroachment by woody species threatens many remnants. Insights are needed into {{the differences in}} diversity and species and functional group composition along a gradient of woody encroachment to help gauge restoration potential and gain insights into patterns of disassembly in grassland communities. The study site is a 65 ha (160 acre) tallgrass prairie and old field mosaic in Lake County, Illinois. The three main objectives {{in this study are}} to: (1) analyze and classify plant communities, (2) explore seed bank dynamics and its contribution to old field colonization, and (3) determine the patterns of species and functional group richness and cover in a tallgrass prairie:old field mosaic with varying levels of shrub invasion and assess whether there are ordered patterns of loss in richness and cover with increasing shrub <b>canopy</b> <b>cover.</b> Ground layer and shrub layer data were collected from 45 sample plots including 37 located on stratified transects and eight located randomly in high-quality reference prairie habitat. Two community types were identified through field observation and reinforced by cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS). The communities differed significantly in species density, species richness, ground layer cover, floristic quality indices, shrub <b>canopy</b> <b>cover,</b> and percent bare ground. To assess whether germination from the seed bank was limited by the lack of fire at the site, soil samples were heat treated prior to placement in greenhouse flats and germination rates were compared to a control. Heat shock had a variable effect on germination, and the species germinating from the seed bank were dependant upon the treatment. S??rensen Similarity Index indicated that there was very little similarity between the species present in the seed bank and the standing vegetation. To determine if prairie remnants were responsible for the recolonization of the site after agricultural disturbance, species data were examined on a distance gradient to the nearest remnant. Overall species richness, proportion of prairie species, and Floristic Quality Index had no relationship with distance to remnants. Results suggests that many areas of the site are seed limited, further complicating the restoration of plant communities. Possible causes of seed bank failure as a refugium could be attributed to the past history of rigorous cultivation at the site and the recent history of shrub encroachment. Species composition data were converted to plant functional groups based on species traits to assess whether increasing shrub <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> leads to loss or decline in richness and cover in species with shared traits. The relationships between functional group richness and ground layer <b>cover</b> to shrub <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> were examined with linear regression, discriminant analysis, ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc tests, and NMS. Cover of C 4 grass, perennial legume, perennial forb, perennial sedge, C 3 grass and annual forb functional groups and richness of C 4 grass, perennial legume, and perennial forb functional groups follow ordered decline with increasing shrub <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> and differences among <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>classes</b> were significant. NMS provides a graphical summary indicating functional groups representative of prairie communities are associated with low <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> plots compared with closed canopy plots.

40|$|Using the 16 day MODIS (aboard the EOS Terra satellite) 250 m NDVI {{and ground}} biophysical and {{spectral}} measurements we established simple relationships between these parameters and the <b>canopy</b> <b>cover.</b> The <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> {{is used in}} water erosion models to estimate the amount of soil loss under precipitation events and specific geographic conditions. Two transects, in the grassland part of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) located {{near the town of}} Tombstone in Arizona, were established for ground data collection. Ground measurements were performed every 16 days, to coincide with the Terra Satellite overpass. Erosion, in desert environment is a contributing factor to soil degradation and subsequently desertification. Erosion is strongly related with <b>canopy</b> <b>cover,</b> soil parameters, topography, and climate variables. Although ground point estimates of <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> are usually used in erosion models, their temporal and spatial variability need to be accounted for. Using MODIS NDVI data, calibrated with field measurements, we were able to estimate the <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> using regression analysis.

We measured basal area, <b>canopy</b> <b>cover,</b> Ozalid percent full light, PAR, and overstory LAI in thinned and unthinned plots within oak and pine stands with the objectives of: (1) determining the relationships between these variables in two common forest types, (2) investigating the feasibility of using basal area to estimate and achieve recommended levels of <b>canopy</b> <b>cover,</b> PAR, and LAI in the field, and (3) examining the possibility of using direct <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> and Ozalid light measurements for estimating PAR and LAI.

40|$|By field {{manipulations}} of nutrients, propagules, and <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> {{in a shallow}} rocky subtidal, we show that dominance by a leathery macrophyte (Fucus vesiculosus) controls net production and the propagation of nutrient effects on understory algal species richness. On substrates with propagules, <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> prevented a significant loss of diversity from nutrient enrichment demonstrated outside <b>canopy</b> <b>cover.</b> On sterile substrates, negative canopy effects on diversity were counteracted by nutrient enrichment. Experimental manipulations produced a significant hump-shaped relationship between species richness and log net production, with low richness at low or high biomass production and highest richness at intermediate biomass production. By strong control of net primary production, <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> changed the algal understory community to an alternative production state and thereby generated a switch {{in the relationship between}} net primary production and species richness from negative outside <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> to positive inside.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} role of <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> in influencing above ground biomass (AGB) dynamics of an open canopied forest and evaluates the efficacy of individual-based and plot-scale height metrics in predicting AGB variation in the tropical forests of Angkor Thom, Cambodia. The AGB was modeled by including <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> from aerial imagery alongside with the two different canopy vertical height metrics derived from LiDAR; the plot average of maximum tree height (Max_CH) of individual trees, {{and the top of}} the canopy height (TCH). Two different statistical approaches, log-log ordinary least squares (OLS) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to model AGB variation in the study area. Ten different AGB models were developed using different combinations of airborne predictor variables. It was discovered that the inclusion of <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> estimates considerably improved the performance of AGB models for our study area. The most robust model was log-log OLS model comprising of <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> only (r = 0. 87; RMSE = 42. 8 Mg/ha). Other models that approximated field AGB closely included both Max_CH and <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> (r = 0. 86, RMSE = 44. 2 Mg/ha for SVR; and, r = 0. 84, RMSE = 47. 7 Mg/ha for log-log OLS). Hence, <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> should be included when modeling the AGB of open-canopied tropical forests...|$|R

40|$|Variation in {{the effects}} of {{disturbance}} across three differently aged glacial terraces in a terrace rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) forest were investigated. Disturbance histories were reconstructed and associated patterns of stand development, differences in stand composition and stand structure determined. This forest variation was related to environmental variation between the differently aged terraces. Forest stand composition was investigated across the three terraces using Indicator Species Analysis and Detrended Correspondence Analysis for data collected from ninety stands. This data was used to categorise forest community composition. Analysis of stand structure focused on the dominant stand type {{on each of the}} three terraces for which disturbance histories and patterns of stand development were determined. Disturbance histories were reconstructed form size and age-class frequency distributions, and the spatial distribution of tree ages to identify even-aged groups of trees that had established in response to past disturbance. Soil drainage and stage of soil development were determined for the dominant stands. Differences in stand structure between the three main stands reflected differences in disturbance history which were associated with different soil profile and soil drainage characteristics. For stand S 1 on the oldest terrace the spatial distribution of tree ages showed that catastrophic disturbance had occurred on the most poorly drained and deepest soils. For stand S 2 on the middle aged terrace sporadic gap formation had occurred on less poorly drained and shallower soils. For stand S 3 on the youngest terrace progressive canopy mortality had occurred on the shallowest soils, of a similar drainage to those in stand S 2. Variation in the soil characteristics between terraces reflected a secular trend in soil development towards increased depth and poorer drainage. Stand composition was primarily influenced by disturbance history. The effects of different disturbance histories on stand composition was inferred from species regeneration patterns, the distribution of seedlings beneath different <b>canopy</b> <b>cover</b> <b>classes,</b> and gap regeneration characteristics. The least shade tolerant species, Dacrydium cupressinum, Lagarostrobos colensoi and Phyllocladus alpinus favoured regeneration after infrequent catastrophic disturbance. While the more shade tolerant Prumnopitys ferruginea, Weinmannia racemosa and Quintinia acutifolia favoured establishment following more frequent canopy gap formation. Differences in stand composition also reflected differences in soil drainage, interspecific competition, and stand structure. The association of species with differently drained soils within stands and between stands suggested Lagarostrobos colensoi and Phyllocladus alpinus favoured the most poorly drained soils, while Prumnopitys ferruginea favoured less poorly drained soils. Interspecific competition accounted for ongoing compositional changes where Dacrydium cupressinum appeared to be competing out Phyllocladus alpinus and Lagarostrobos colensoi on account of its greater stature and longevity. Stand structure affected species richness. The least number of species was associated with the most uniform stands while the highest number of species was associated with the least uniform stands. Uniform stands were presumed to reduce the chance of colonisation by differentially adapted species. Variation in {{the effects of}} disturbance explained changes in stand structure and composition across the terraces. A secular change in the stand dynamics of terrace rimu forest is envisaged over millennia reflecting soil development, where changes in forest composition and stand structure reflect the interaction of disturbance and soil drainage...|$|R
