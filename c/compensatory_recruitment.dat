In contrast to the homogeneous single-peak distribution of rabbit and duck reticulocyte free mRNPs, mouse free mRNP particles were heterogeneously dispersed on the sucrose density gradient into two major domains called region I and region II. Region I appeared enriched with α-globin mRNP and region II with β-globin mRNP. mRNP from both regions was translationally active.

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{proliferation}} of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies that interpret between-group or within-group differences in brain response patterns as evidence for <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment.</b> However, it is currently a challenge to determine whether these observed differences are truly attributable to <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment</b> or whether they are indicative of some other cognitive or physiological process.

40|$|Age-related {{deficits in}} visual {{selective}} attention {{suggest that the}} efficiency of inhibitory processes is particularly affected by aging. To investigate whether processing inefficiencies observed in visual attention are similar in auditory attention and when shifting attention across modalities, we conducted an fMRI study with healthy young and older adults using a task that required sustained auditory and visual selective attention and cross-modal attention shifts. Older adults in this study performed {{as well as the}} younger adults, but showed age-related differences in BOLD responses. The most striking of these differences were bilateral frontal and parietal regions of significantly increased activation in older adults during both focused and shifting attention. Our data suggest that this increased activation did not reflect new recruitment, but reliance on brain regions typically used by younger adults when task demands are greater. Older adults' activation patterns suggested that even during focused attention conditions they were "shifting" attention to stimuli in the unattended modality. Increased activation during processing of both task-relevant and task-irrelevant information implies age-related loss of processing selectivity. These patterns may reflect both task-specific <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment</b> and degradation of sensory inhibition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} older adults fail to show adaptation in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) to the same face presented repeatedly, despite accurate detection of the previously presented face. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to investigate whether this phenomenon is associated with age-related reductions in face specificity in brain activity and whether older adults compensate for these face-processing deficiencies by increasing activity in other areas within the face-processing network, or outside this network. A comparison of brain activity across multiple stimulus categories showed that, unlike young adults who engaged a number of brain regions specific to face processing, older adults generalized these patterns of activity to objects and houses. Also, young adults showed functional connectivity between the right FG and its homologous region during face processing, whereas older adults did not engage the left FG but showed a functional connection between the right FG and left orbitofrontal cortex. Finally, this frontotemporal functional connection was activated more strongly in older adults who performed better on a face-matching task (done outside of the scanner), suggesting increased involvement of this functional link for successful face recognition with increasing age. These findings suggest that 2 neural mechanisms, dedifferentiation and <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment,</b> underlie age differences in face processing. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} question for neuropsychology is how complex brain networks react to damage. Here, we address this {{question for the}} well-known executive control or multiple-demand (MD) system, a fronto-parietal network showing increased activity with {{many different kinds of}} cognitive demand, including standard tests of fluid intelligence. Using fMRI, we ask how focal frontal lobe damage affects MD activity during a standard fluid intelligence task. Despite poor behavioral performance, frontal patients showed increased fronto-parietal activity relative to controls. The activation difference was not accounted for by difference in IQ. Moreover, rather than specific focus on perilesional or contralesional cortex, additional recruitment was distributed throughout the MD regions and surrounding cortex and included parietal MD regions distant from the injury.

Using long-term {{data on a}} badger (Meles meles Linnaeus, 1758) population naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis, we built an integrated population model to quantify impacts of disease, density and environmental drivers on survival and recruitment. Badgers exhibit a slow life-history strategy, having high rates of adult survival with low variance, and low but variable rates of recruitment. Recruitment exhibited strong negative density-dependence, but was not influenced by disease, while adult survival was density independent but declined with increasing prevalence of diseased individuals. Given that reproductive success is not depressed by disease prevalence, density-dependent recruitment of cubs is likely to compensate for disease-induced mortality.

The mountain hare Lepus timidus is a traditional game species, which is hunted in Scotland for sport and population control. However, information about how population parameters respond to changes in {{population density}} is lacking. To assess how reproduction and juvenile recruitment change in response to population density, we sampled 189 hares (88 females and 101 males) from 10 independent private hunting estates. We found a significant negative correlation between population density {{and the proportion of}} juveniles recruited into the breeding population, along with a significant interaction between population density and sex, which revealed that the proportion of juvenile females recruited decreases more rapidly with population density compared to the proportion of male juveniles. However, we found no evidence of density-dependent fecundity. Our results suggest density-dependent compensation in this species, acting on recruitment, not fecundity, with rates of juvenile recruitment differing between the sexes.

40|$|This article {{considers}} two nontraditional {{approaches for}} developing interventions to improve cognition in older adults. Neither {{of these approaches}} relies on traditional explicit training of specific abilities in the laboratory. The first technique involves the activation of automatic processes through the formation of implementation intentions that enhance {{the probability that a}} desired action will be completed, such as remembering to take medications. The second involves experimentally studying the role of active social and cognitive engagement in improving cognition. We then consider methodological issues {{associated with the use of}} these novel techniques. F OR the past two decades, researchers have carefullydocumented the decline in basic cognitive processes that occurs with age, as well as the stability or growth of knowledge. As a result of this work we have an excellent understanding of age-related changes in basic processes such as sensory function, speed of processing, and working memory, as well as the interrelationships among these processes and how they predict higher order cognitive function (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997; Park et al., 2002; Salthouse, 1996). Moreover, recent advances have led to an understanding of the neural underpinnings of age-related differences in cognitive function.

In view of the current demographic evolution of society with an increasing proportion of elderly persons, major socio-economic benefits are associated with maintaining and/or increasing their functional independence and comfort of living. This requires {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes of neural aging associated with control of movement. With the increasing availability of brain imaging technologies, such as blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI), aging research has primarily focused on the relationship between changes in behaviour and brain function. In the present doctoral project, fMRI was used to investigate age-related changes in the neural basis of cyclical isolated and coordinated hand- and/or foot movements. Overall, the findings suggest that older adults utilize a more elaborate brain network during motor performance than young adults, evenwhen performing the same motor task with the same behavioural outcome. This suggests that spared motor performance may be related to the ability of older adults to increase activation and/or to recruit new areas within motor and cognitive networks, and/or exhibit altered interactions among brain areas that form a specific network. In view of the positive correlation between increased brain activation and motor performance, it is contended that an age-related <b>compensatory</b> brain <b>recruitment</b> mechanismis at work.

From 1970 to 1995, the length of juvenile (age- 1) haddock on the SWSS was negatively correlated with the abundance of adults (age- 4 +). Within year-classes temporal trends in juvenile length persisted through to the adult stage such that yearclasses that were small(large) at age- 1 were small(large) at age- 4. These two results were combined with the positive correlation observed between recruitment and the body size characteristics of haddock on the SWSS in a conceptual model of <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> regulation. In the model high adult abundance decreases growth of juveniles leading to smaller-sized adults and subsequently lower recruitment. Conversely, low adult abundance results in increased growth of juveniles leading to larger adults and higher recruitment.

40|$|The latest {{progress}} in understanding remediation of dyslexia underlines how {{some changes in}} brain are a necessary mechanism of improvement. We wanted to determine whether high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hf-rTMS) over areas that are underactive during reading in dyslexics, would improve reading of dyslexic adults. We applied 5 Hz-TMS over both left and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) prior to word, non-word and text reading aloud. Results show that hf-rTMS stimulation over the left IPL improves non-word reading accuracy and hf-rTMS stimulation over the left STG increases word reading speed and text reading accuracy. Moreover after right IPL stimulation, non-word reading accuracy also improves. These findings indicate that in dyslexics, L-STG and L-IPL have a differential role in word, non-word and text reading. Even if we would normally expect left-lateralized improvements only, the finding of a right IPL involvement {{suggests that there is}} additional <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of this region in dyslexics. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that distinctive facilitation of neural pathways known to be underactive in dyslexics transitorily improves their reading performance.

40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of evidence}} supports the notion that cerebellar lesions lead to neuropsychological deficits, including impairments in working-memory, executive tasks and verbal fluency. Studies employing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and anatomical tracing in primates provide evidence for a cortico-cerebellar circuitry as the functional substrate of working-memory. The present fMRI study explores the activation pattern during an n-back working-memory task in patients with an isolated cerebellar infarct. To determine each patient’s cognitive impairment, neuropsychological tests of working-memory and attention were carried out. We conducted fMRI in nine patients and nine healthy age-matched controls while they performed a 2 -back task in a blocked-design. In both groups we found bilateral activations in a widespread cortico-cerebellar network, consisting of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 44, 45), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9, 46), parietal cortex (BA 7, 40), pre-supplementary motor area (BA 6) anterior cingulate (BA 32). Relative to healthy controls, patients with isolated cerebellar infarcts demonstrated significantly more pronounced BOLD-activations in the precuneus and the angular gyrus during the 2 -back task. The significant increase in activation in the posterior parietal areas of the cerebellar patients could be attributed to a <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> to maintain task performance.

Materials and Methods: A total of 12 male, clinically stable stroke patients with left side somatosensory deficits, and 12 age-matched male control subjects were studied. fMRI was performed with two different paradigms; namely, tactile stimuli and electrical stimulation at acupuncture points LI 4 and LI 11 on the affected {{side of the}} body. fMRI {{data were analyzed using}} SPM 99. Results: Tactile stimulation in both patients and controls produced significant activation in primary and secondary sensory and motor cortical areas and cerebellum.

Activation was greater during the tactile task than the acupuncture stimulation in patients and normal controls.

Existing approaches for early detection of AD vary {{in terms of their}} efficacy, invasiveness, and ease of implementation. Several non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging strategies have been developed for predicting decline in cognitively healthy older adults. This review will survey a number of studies, beginning with the development of a famous name discrimination task used to identify neural regions that participate in semantic memory retrieval and to test predictions of several key theories {{of the role of the}} hippocampus in memory. This task has revealed medial temporal and neocortical contributions to recent and remote memory retrieval, and it has been used to demonstrate <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment</b> in older adults, apolipoprotein E ε 4 carriers, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients. Recently, we have also found that the famous name discrimination task provides predictive value for forecasting episodic memory decline among asymptomatic older adults.

We suggest several advantages associated with the use of semantic processing tasks, particularly those based on person identification, in comparison to episodic memory tasks to study AD risk. Future directions for research and potential clinical uses of semantic memory paradigms are also discussed.

40|$|Functional {{integrity}} of prefrontal cortico-striatal circuits underlying executive functioning may be compromised by basal ganglia degeneration during Huntington's disease (HD). This study investigated challenged inhibitory attentional control with a shifting response-set (SRS) task whilst assessing neural response via functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in 35 healthy controls, 35 matched pre-symptomatic (pre-HD) and 30 symptomatic (symp-HD) participants. A ≥ 70 % performance accuracy threshold allowed confident identification of neural activity associated with SRS performance in a sub-set of 33 healthy controls, 32 pre-HD and 20 symp-HD participants. SRS activated dorsolateral prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, premotor, parietal, and basal ganglia regions and deactivated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Symp-HD participants showed greater prefrontal functional responses relative to controls and pre-HD, including larger activations and larger deactivations in response to cognitive challenge, consistent with <b>compensatory</b> neural <b>recruitment.</b> We then investigated associations between prefrontal BOLD responses, SRS performance accuracy and neuropsychiatric disturbance in all participants, including those below SRS performance accuracy threshold. We observed that reduced prefrontal responsivity in symp-HD was associated with reduced accuracy in SRS performance, and with increased neuropsychiatric disturbance within domains including executive dysfunction, pathological impulses, disinhibition, and depression. These findings demonstrate prefrontal response during inhibitory attentional control usefully characterises cognitive and neuropsychiatric status in symp-HD.

These changes may also give rise to alterations in cognitive flexibility. However, conclusive evidence for altered cognitive flexibility in patients with GTS is still lacking.

Results revealed medium-sized GTS-related performance deficits, which were significantly modulated by age: Whilst being substantial {{in children and adolescents}} with GTS, WCST deficits seem to dissolve in adult patients with GTS. This age-related normalization of WCST performance might result from the <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of cognitive control in adult patients with GTS. We addressed this possibility by examining neural correlates of proactive and reactive cognitive control in an event-related potential (ERP) study. We analyzed cue- and target-locked ERPs from 23 adult patients with GTS and 26 matched controls who completed a computerized version of the WCST. Compared to controls, patients with GTS showed a marked increase in parietal cue-locked P 3 activity, indicating enhanced proactive cognitive control.

Methods: Four neglect patients were investigated both behaviourally and by fMRI at an acute (18 +/- 5 days) {{and at a}} chronic stage (123 +/- 18 days) post stroke. Results: At the second assessment all patients showed substantial behavioural improvements.

40|$|Reading is {{a complex}} {{cognitive}} skill subserved by a distributed network of visual and language-related regions. Disruptions of connectivity within this network {{have been associated with}} developmental dyslexia but their relation to individual differences in the severity of reading problems remains unclear. Here we investigate whether dysfunctional connectivity scales with the level of reading dysfluency by examining EEG recordings during visual word and false font processing in 9 -year-old typically reading children (TR) and two groups of dyslexic children: severely dysfluent (SDD) and moderately dysfluent (MDD) dyslexics. Results indicated weaker occipital to inferior-temporal connectivity for words in both dyslexic groups relative to TRs. Furthermore, SDDs exhibited stronger connectivity from left central to right inferior-temporal and occipital sites for words relative to TRs, and for false fonts relative to both MDDs and TRs. Importantly, reading fluency was positively related with forward and negatively with backward connectivity. Our results suggest disrupted visual processing of words in both dyslexic groups, together with a <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of right posterior brain regions especially in the SDDs during word and false font processing. Functional connectivity in the brain’s reading network may thus depend on the level of reading dysfluency beyond group differences between dyslexic and typical readers...|$|E
40|$|Functional neuroimaging {{studies of}} {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) have demonstrated altered neural recruitment, specifically within prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is manifest typically as increased recruitment of homologous regions of PFC (e. g. right ventrolateral PFC during performance of a verbal working memory task, possibly in response to damage involving the left PFC). The behavioural correlates of these functional changes are poorly understood. We used fMR imaging and multivariate analytic methods to investigate changes in spatially distributed activity patterns and their behavioural correlates {{in a sample of}} TBI patients with diffuse axonal injury (DAI, but without focal injury) and matched healthy controls. Participants performed working memory tasks with varying memory load and executive demand. We identified networks within left and right PFC that uniquely and positively correlated with performance in our control and TBI samples respectively, providing evidence of <b>compensatory</b> functional <b>recruitment.</b> Next we combined brain-behaviour and functional connectivity analyses to investigate whether compensatory brain changes were facilitated by functional reorganization (i. e. recruitment of brain regions not engaged by our control sample) or altered functional engagement (i. e. differential recruitment of similar brain regions between the two groups based on task demands). In other words, does altered recruitment represent the instantiation of novel neural networks to support working memory performance after injury or the unmasking of extant, but behaviourally latent, functional connectivity? Our results support an altered functional engagement hypothesis. Areas within PFC that are normally coactivated during working memory are behaviorally-relevant at an earlier stage of difficulty for TBI patients as compared to controls. This altered functional engagement, also evident in the aging literature, is attributable to distributed changes owing to significant DAI...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether the {{presence}} of the Apolipoprotein E ε 4 allele modulates hippocampal connectivity networks in abnormal ageing has yet to be fully clarified. OBJECTIVE: Allele-dependent differences in this pattern of functional connectivity were investigated in patients with very mild neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer's type, carriers and non-carriers of the ε 4 allele. METHOD: A seed-based connectivity approach was used. The two groups were similar in demographics, volumetric measures of brain-structure, and cognitive profiles. RESULTS: ε 4 non-carriers had increased connectivity between the seed area in the left hippocampus and 1) a left insular/lateral prefrontal region and 2) the contralateral right parietal cortex. Moreover, hippocampus-to-parietal connectivity in the group of ε 4 carriers was positively associated with memory performance, indicating that the between-group difference reflects compensatory processes. Retrospective analyses of functional connectivity based on patients from the ADNI initiative confirmed this pattern. CONCLUSION: We suggest that increased connectivity with extra-DMN areas reflects both <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of additional areas, and pathological interwining between the DMN and the salience network as part of a global ε 4 -dependent circuital disruption. These differences indicate that the ε 4 allele is associated with a more profound degree of DMN network breakdown even in the prodromal stage of neurodegeneration...|$|E

Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) data acquired during a working memory task in 13 childhood-onset GH-deficient patients were compared with 13 age, sex and education level matched healthy controls. Results demonstrated that there is no difference in the quality of the performance in the working memory task between GH-deficient patients and control subjects. However, memory speed was found to be subnormal in patients. Concerning mood, patients reported more complaints of fatigue, and less vigor. Imaging data showed that patients had increased activity in dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, supplementary motor and motor cortex, {{as well as in the}} thalamus and precuneus area. Increasing task load was also associated with an increase in brain activity in similar areas in patients compared to control subjects. In conclusion, this fMRI study shows that GH-deficient patients have a subnormal memory speed, but no impaired quality of memory performance, which may be due to <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of dorsal prefrontal brain regions.

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between pressure and age-related changes in decision-making using a task for which currently available rewards depend on the participant’s previous history of choices. Optimal responding in this task requires the participant to learn how his or her current choices affect changes in the future rewards given for each option. Building on the scaffolding theory of aging and cognition, we predicted that when additional frontal resources are available, <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> leads to increased monitoring and increased use of heuristic-based strategies, ultimately leading to better perfor-mance. Specifically, we predicted that scaffolding would result in an age-related performance advantage under no pressure conditions. We also predicted that, although younger adults would engage in scaffolding under pressure, older adults would not have additional resources available for increased scaffolding under pressure-packed conditions, leading to an age-related performance deficit. Both predictions were supported by the data. In addition, computational models were used to evaluate decision-making strategies employed by each participant group. As expected, older adults under no pressure conditions and younger adults under pressure conditions showed increased use of heuristic-based strategies relative to older adults under pressure and younger adults under no pressure, respec-tively. These results are consistent with the notion that scaffolding can occur across the life span {{in the face of an}} environmental challenge...|$|E

Although {{recent studies have}} {{shed some light on}} their neural correlates, their modulation by dopaminergic treatment remains quite unknown. Specifically, the influence of levodopa on the networks involved in motor imagery (MI) of parkinsonian gait has not been directly studied, comparing the off and on medication states in the same patients. We therefore conducted an [H 2 (15) 0] Positron emission tomography study in eight advanced parkinsonian patients (mean disease duration: 12. 3 +/- 3. 8 years) presenting with levodopa-responsive gait disorders and FoG, and eight age-matched healthy subjects. All participants performed three tasks (MI of gait, visual imagery and a control task). Patients were tested off, after an overnight withdrawal of all antiparkinsonian treatment, and on medication, during consecutive mornings. The order of conditions was counterbalanced between subjects and sessions. Results showed that imagined gait elicited activations within motor and frontal associative areas, thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum in controls. Off medication, patients mainly activated premotor-parietal and pontomesencephalic regions. Levodopa increased activation in motor regions, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, and reduced premotor-parietal and brainstem involvement. Areas activated when patients are off medication may represent <b>compensatory</b> mechanisms. The <b>recruitment</b> of these accessory circuits has also been reported for upper-limb movements in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a partly overlapping pathophysiology between imagined levodopa-responsive gait disorders and appendicular signs.

In this study, we investigated the association between WM tract density and cognitive flexibility in patients with AD (n[*]=[*] 26) and HCs (n[*]=[*] 22). In order to assess the influence of AD severity, we also included a group of problematic drinkers (PrDs; n[*]=[*] 23) who did not meet the AD criteria. Behavioral responses and brain activity during a cognitive flexibility task were measured during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Probabilistic fiber tracking was performed between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia; two crucial regions for task switching. Finally, the task-related functional connectivity between these areas was assessed. There were no significant group differences in the task performance. However, compared with HCs, AD patients and PrDs showed decreased WM integrity and increased prefrontal brain activation during task switching. Evidence is presented for a <b>compensatory</b> mechanism, involving <b>recruitment</b> of additional prefrontal resources in order to compensate for WM and neural function impairments in AD patients and PrDs. Although present in both alcohol groups, the PrDs were more successful in invoking this compensatory mechanism when compared to the AD patients. We propose that this may therefore serve as a protective factor, precluding transition from problematic drinking into alcohol dependenc...|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the influence of childhood experiences on social development. We aim to chart how the dynamic interplay of biological, social, and emotional influences shapes developmental trajectories. Specifically, we investigated the influence of childhood protracted conditions of maltreatment and neglect on the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions, along with, Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions - as physiological measures of humans’ empathic resonance and self-regulation in social context, respectively. In four successive experiments, Sierra Leonean street-children and street-boys, exposed to high and protracted conditions of maltreatment and neglect, were compared to age-matched controls. In the first three experiments we revealed, both in children and adolescents, a significant influence of childhood maltreatment and neglect on explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions, on Facial Mimicry and on vagal regulation. Trauma exposure induced a response bias for angry facial expressions recognition both in street-boys and street-children populations. Street-boys were also characterized for a significant suppression of overall Facial Mimicry responses, as well as, for a reduced and incoherent vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions. Differently, street-children showed alterations of lower entities. Hence, instead of a general Facial Mimicry suppression, they presented an impaired Facial Mimicry modulation between positive and negative facial expressions of emotions. Moreover, street-children manifested an earlier development of the functional synchronization between vagal regulation and threatening stimuli in external environment with respect to age-matched controls. These different patterns of results showed by street-boys and street-children, suggested a possible and differentiated additive effect of trauma exposure. This last point was specifically addressed in the last experiment in which we evaluated the impact trajectories of prolonged experiences of maltreatment and neglect on the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotion, Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation. We demonstrated that prolonged conditions of maltreatment and neglect not progressively influence the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions which appeared independent from the duration of trauma exposure. Moreover, we demonstrated that protracted trauma exposure induces specific alterations in Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation to others’ facial expressions of emotions, which follow different impact trajectories. Longer trauma exposure accentuated an incoherent Facial Mimicry and a lower vagal regulation, particularly in response to angry facial expression of emotions. Differently, a <b>compensatory</b> vagal <b>recruitment</b> during the first years of trauma exposure was found, giving important suggestions about temporal windows in which rehabilitative interventions can likely contrast the occurrence of chronic outcomes. In conclusion, the present dissertation provides new and further evidence of the influence of childhood experiences on social development by confirming and better described the huge impact of prolonged experiences of maltreatment and neglect on the understanding of emotions, empathic resonance, and self-regulation in social contexts. It clearly appears that if, as Aristotle wrote, “Man is by nature a social animal” and, as recent neuroscientific evidence suggested the human mind is ontogenetically interpersonal and wired to be social, the early traumatic experiences negatively influence physiological mechanisms supporting our social nature...|$|R
40|$|Seabird populations contain {{large numbers}} of immatures––in some {{instances}} comprising > 50 % of the fully grown adults in the population. These birds are significant components of marine food webs and may contribute to <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> and dispersal, but remain severely understudied. Here, we use GPS-PTTs, radio-tracking and analysis of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes to investigate the movements and foraging ecology of immature seabirds. Our study focussed on immature northern gannets Morus bassanus aged 2 – 4 attending non-breeding aggregations alongside a large breeding colony. GPS-PTT tracking of five birds revealed that immatures {{have the ability to}} disperse widely during the breeding season, with some individuals potentially prospecting at other colonies. Overall, however, immatures were faithful to the colony of capture. During returns to the focal colony, immatures acted as central place foragers, conducted looping and commuting flights, and analysis of the variance in first-passage time revealed evidence of area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. In addition, stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope analyses indicate that immatures were isotopically segregated from breeders. Our findings provide insights into the foraging, prospecting and dispersal behaviour of immature seabirds, which may have important implications for understanding seabird ecology and co...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{find out}} whether {{children}} with epilepsy did show different event-related potentials (ERP) compared to healthy children during performance in a visuo-spatial working memory (WM) task. MethodsMultichannel ERPs were measured during a visuo-spatial backmatching task. A quantitative analysis technique, based on Statistical Parametric Mapping, was {{used to analyze the}} ERP data. 62 children were tested (6 – 16 years old) : 31 children with well-controlled epilepsy and 31 age- and intelligence-matched healthy children. One-backmatching (BM 1) and two-backmatching (BM 2) tasks were performed. Behavioral performance and target and nontarget ERPs were compared across groups in both tasks. ResultsNo behavioral differences were found between groups in the easy BM 1 task. In the difficult BM 2 task, children with epilepsy made significantly more omission errors. ERP analysis showed significantly higher amplitudes over frontal and central regions between 300 and 500 ms poststimulus in the epilepsy group compared to the control group. This effect was most pronounced in BM 2. DiscussionThis study shows that children with well-controlled epilepsy and normal intelligence demonstrate <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of their WM network during a visuo-spatial working memory task. Increasing the difficulty of the task (BM 2) enhances this general neurophysiological finding and parallels the behavioral performance. SignificanceOur results illustrate that epilepsy induces different cortical activity during working memory tasks, even when behavioral performance is normal...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{was performed in}} normal volunteers during a serial recall task {{under the influence of}} irrelevant speech comprising both single item repetition and multi-item sequences. An interaction approach was used to identify brain areas specifically related to the irrelevant speech effect. We interpreted activations as <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of complementary working memory processing, and decreased activity in terms of suppression of task relevant areas invoked by the irrelevant speech. The interaction between the distractors and working memory revealed a significant effect in the left, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the right, superior temporal region, indicating that initial phonological processing was relatively suppressed. Additional areas of decreased activity were observed in an a priori defined cortical network related to verbalworking memory, incorporating the bilateral superior temporal and inferior/middle frontal corticesn extending into Broca’s area on the left. We also observed a weak activation in the left inferior parietal cortex, a region suggested to reflect the phonological store, the subcomponent where the interference is assumed to take place. The results suggest that the irrelevant speech effect is correlated with and thus tentatively may be explained in terms of a suppression of components of the verbal working memory network as outlined. The results can be interpreted in terms of inhibitory top–down attentional mechanisms attenuating the influence of the irrelevant speech, although additional studies are clearly necessary to more fully characterize the nature of this phenomenon and its theoretical implications for existing short-term memory model...|$|E
40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is characterised by disturbances in concentration and memory, symptoms {{which are a}} source of further distress for patients. Related to this, abnormalities in underlying working memory (WM) systems have been identified [Clark, C. R., McFarlane, A. C., Morris, P., Weber, D. L., Sonkkilla, C., Shaw, M. E., Marcina, J., Tochon-Danguy, H. J., Egan, G. F., 2003. Cerebral function in posttraumatic {{stress disorder}} during verbal working memory updating: a positron emission tomography study. Biological Psychiatry 53, 474 – 481. ], indicating dysfunction in left hemisphere brain regions. In this study, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 13 patients with severe PTSD and matched non-traumatized Controls, during performance of visuo-verbal tasks that involved either maintenance or continual updating of word stimuli in WM. The PTSD group failed to show differential activation during WM updating, and instead appeared to show abnormal recruitment of WM updating network regions during WM maintenance. These regions included the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Several other regions were significantly more activated in Controls than in PTSD during WM updating, including the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate (AC), and the brainstem pons, key regions that are consistently implicated in the neurobiology of PTSD. These findings suggest <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of networks in PTSD normally only deployed during updating of WM and may reflect PTSD patients 2 ̆ 7 difficulty engaging with their day-to-day environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{clumping}} growth form {{of tropical}} bamboos suggests a consolidator {{strategy in the}} face of intense competition rather than an ability to exploit disturbance. We investigated the annual growth and culm demographic responses to disturbance by fire and flood of vegetatively mature clumps of a riparian stand of Bambusa arnhemica. Linear-mixed models were employed to control for the non-independence of culm fates within clumps and clump growth among years. As the stand was monodominant and the species is gregariously monocarpic, responses can be interpreted independently of interspecific competition and trade-offs with sexual reproduction. Disturbance depressed clump growth but the culm demographic responses to fire and flood were quite different. Few culms were destroyed during the fire but damage depressed their subsequent survival, leading to declines in clump basal area. Fire also triggered the release of ramet buds, but the additional recruits were small and short-lived. Prolonged and early flooding in one of the study years depressed culm recruitment in clumps low on the lagoon bank but there was possible <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> in the following year. There was no convincing evidence that sparse clumps recruited culms better than dense clumps, though culm recruitment was negatively correlated with culm survival. Fire and prolonged flooding are inevitable elements of the environment occupied by B. arnhemica, but we interpret the species 2 ̆ 7 response as persisting {{in the face of}} disturbance rather than exploiting the opportunities created by it...|$|E
40|$|A ‘sense of self’ is {{essentially}} the ability to distinguish between self-generated and external stimuli. It consists {{of at least two}} very basic senses: a sense of agency and a sense of ownership. Disturbances seem to provide a basic deficit in many psychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to manipulate those qualities separately in 28 patients with schizophrenia (14 auditory hallucinators and 14 non-hallucinators) and 28 healthy controls (HC) and to investigate the effects on the topographies {{and the power of the}} event-related potential (ERP). We performed a 76 -channel EEG while the participants performed the task as in our previous paper. We computed ERPs and difference maps for the conditions and compared the amount of agency and ownership between the HC and the patients. Furthermore, we compared the global field power and the topographies of these effects. Our data showed effects of agency and ownership in the healthy controls and the hallucinator group and to a lesser degree in the non-hallucinator group. We found a reduction of the N 100 during the presence of agency, and a bilateral temporal negativity related to the presence of ownership. For the agency effects, we found significant differences between HC and the patients. Contrary to the expectations, our findings were more pronounced in non-hallucinators, suggesting a more profoundly disturbed sense of agency compared to hallucinators. A contemporary increase of global field power in both patient groups indicates a <b>compensatory</b> <b>recruitment</b> of other mechanisms not normally associated with the processing of agency and ownership...|$|E
