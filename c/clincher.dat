5000|$|Tubeless {{tires are}} {{primarily}} used on mountain bikes {{due to their}} ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats. Tubeless tires work similarly to <b>clinchers</b> in that the bead of the tire is specifically designed to interlock into a corresponding tubeless rim, but without an inner tube. Air is inflated directly into the tire, and once [...] "locked" [...] into the rim, the system is airtight. Liquid sealants are often injected into tubeless tires to prevent punctures. Pinch flats are impossible in a tubeless setup because there is no tube to pinch; however, air can escape if the bead lock is compromised from too much lateral force on the tire or deformation of the rim/tire due to hard impact with an object. Tubeless technology has progressed significantly over the last few years, and road-specific tubeless technologies for narrow tires are now gaining popularity.|$|R
25|$|Hot {{shoes are}} placed in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the hoof wall at the white line of the hoof. The nails are shaped {{in such a way}} that they bend outward as they are driven in, {{avoiding}} the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the sharp points and uses a <b>clincher</b> (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching block with hammer to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the hoof wall. This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.|$|E
25|$|The Padres {{suffered}} a 10-game losing streak going into September {{and on the}} 5th, the Giants beat the Dodgers 3–0 to move to within a game of first place. Despite being shut out four times in ten games, the Giants recorded an September 18–8 to move into first by three games as the pitching staff achieved a team ERA of 1.78, {{the lowest in the}} National League in a September stretch run since the 1965 Dodgers. During their September run, the Giants' pitching staff allowed no more than 3 runs for 18 straight games, the longest single-season streak since 1920. The division title came down to the final three games of the year in October at home against San Diego, with the Giants clinching in the last regular season game, 3–0. Jonathan Sánchez, who had been ridiculed in August when he failed to make good a boast that the Giants would sweep the Padres, led the September charge with a 3–1 record and 1.17 ERA, and took the win in the <b>clincher.</b> Closer Brian Wilson finished the game for his franchise record-tying and major league-leading 48th save.

25|$|Clemens made an {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} Yankees' staff, anchoring {{the top of the}} rotation as the team went on to win a pair of World Series titles in 1999 and 2000. During the 1999 regular season, Clemens posted a 14–10 record with a 4.60 ERA. He logged a pair of wins in the postseason, where he pitched 7.2 innings of 1-run baseball during the Yankees' game 4 <b>clincher</b> over the Atlanta Braves. Clemens followed up 1999 with a strong 2000 season, in which he finished with a 13–8 record with a 3.70 ERA for the regular season. During the 2000 MLB postseason, he helped the Yankees win their third championship in as many years. He pitched a shutout against the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS that year and also pitched eight scoreless innings against the New York Mets in the World Series. Clemens set the ALCS record for strikeouts in a game when he fanned 15 batters in a one-hit shutout of the Mariners in Game 4 of the ALCS. A seventh inning lead-off double by Seattle's Al Martin was all that prevented Clemens from throwing what was, at the time, only the second no-hitter in postseason history (Yankee Don Larsen threw a perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series and Roy Halladay would later throw a no-hitter in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series).

For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo [...] "very nearly make it all worthwhile."

50|$|Meanwhile, Captain Modesti and his aide {{meet with}} Francesco (George Wilson), an {{eccentric}} old hermit {{living in a}} tumbledown stone hut in the hills overlooking the town, who practices black magic and offers charms and potions to the superstitious. He claims to the police that he has passed his knowledge of black magic to his disciple, Magiara, and also shares time with the causal thrill-seeking Patrizia. He is also rumored to have had (and then disposed of) a baby from a tryst with Magiara. Angered by Francesco's unwillingness to co-operate with the investigation, the police proceed to hunt down and arrest Magiara. Under interrogation, the fevered woman gleefully confesses to the murders. However, it transpires to Modesti and the Commissioner that she believes her voodoo dolls and incantations have merely brought about {{the deaths of the}} three interfering boys, and she profess to have no interest or awareness of the physical methods used. An alibi provided by a policeman sighting Magiara miles away from the latest murder scene <b>clinchers</b> her legal innocence and she is released the following day. Nonetheless, the hostile and superstitious villagers are not convinced. Magiara is attacked in a local graveyard by a small group of men who savagely beat her with heavy chains and then leave her for dead. The following day, another young boy is found murdered, drowned in a local stream, which further increases police frustration to the case.|$|R
