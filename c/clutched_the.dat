500|$|The duel {{occurred}} as Goebel {{and two of}} his acquaintances went to cash a check in Covington. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could cross the street to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, <b>clutched</b> <b>the</b> revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, [...] "I understand that you assume authorship of that article?"; [...] "I do", replied Goebel. Witnesses agree that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers; Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later. Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the incident would haunt his political career. The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold any public office.|$|E
2500|$|A freak catch by wicketkeeper Grout {{dismissed}} Sheppard. McKenzie had bowled {{the opening}} {{over from the}} river end; then Sheppard played forward to Mackay's first ball and edged it to second slip. There Benaud went into contortions; he knocked the ball forward, knocked it a second time as Simpson, from first slip, poised to spring at it. Simpson then plunged to the ground, out of the way, he thought. Grout sprawled over Simpson and <b>clutched</b> <b>the</b> ball as it fell. A circus performance! ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{reversed}} the throttle {{and slammed the}} airbrakes into emergency stop, but [...] "Ole 382" [...] quickly plowed through a wooden caboose, a car load of hay, another of corn, and halfway through a car of timber before leaving the track. He had reduced his speed from about [...] to about [...] when he hit. Because Jones stayed on board to slow the train, he was believed to have saved the passengers from serious injury and death – Jones was the only fatality of the collision. His watch stopped {{at the time of}} impact: 3:52 am on April 30, 1900. Popular legend holds that when his body was pulled from the wreckage, his hands still <b>clutched</b> <b>the</b> whistle cord and brake. A stretcher was brought from the baggage car on No. 1, and crewmen of the other trains carried his body to the depot, a half-mile (0.80km) away.|$|E

The mean values for yolk cholesterol decreased as <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> length {{and intensity of}} egg production increased. There {{were no significant differences}} in yolk cholesterol values for the eggs laid on the first, median or last days of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> plasma cholesterol the day no egg was laid was similar to that for the plasma cholesterol obtained the day of the first egg of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> plasma cholesterol values were significantly increased on the day of the last egg of <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> when there was no ovulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} a mechanical combustion-engine-driven fluid pump (10) comprising an input shaft (20) which is directly driven by the combustion engine (12), a pumping unit (18) with a pump rotor (19), and a <b>clutch</b> (16) between <b>the</b> input shaft and the pump rotor, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> comprises an input clutch body (24) and an output clutch body (22) and transfers the rotation of <b>the</b> input <b>clutch</b> body to <b>the</b> output <b>clutch</b> body in <b>the</b> engaged <b>clutch</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is a combined magneto-rheological eddy-current <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> comprises a closed clutch liquid gap (26) between <b>the</b> two <b>clutch</b> bodies, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> liquid gap being filled with a magneto-rheological clutch liquid (28), an electroconductive element (50) co-rotating with <b>the</b> output <b>clutch</b> body, and a shiftable permanent magnet element (30) being provided co-rotating with <b>the</b> input <b>clutch</b> body. <b>The</b> shiftable permanent magnet element is shiftable between an engaged position wherein the permanent magnet element's magnetic field penetrates <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> liquid gap with high magnetic flux and the permanent magnet element {{is close to the}} electroconductive element, and a disengaged position wherein the magnet element's magnetic field penetration flux in <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> liquid gap is less than in the engaged position and the permanent magnet element is remote from the electroconductive element.
