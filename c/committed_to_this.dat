5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E

While there were several other movements on the Christian side in Lebanon that cooperated with Israel during the war, the LNR was the only organization openly and ideologically <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> regarding a Lebanese-Israeli axis as the best protection against Arabism and the Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|Feminist {{legal theory}} {{is based on}} the feminist view that law's {{treatment}} of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be <b>committed</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.|$|E

Throughout the year, Apple released a number of mock-ups to various magazines showing what the new system would look like, and commented continually that the company was fully <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> project.

25|$|In {{a bid to}} {{maintain}} Israel's technological gap ahead of Arab states, the F-35 deal was pushed through instead of upgrading the air force's F-15s and F-16s. This approach sticks to the principle that Israel is the first country in the Middle East to receive the newest fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal was damaging them. The package also got by opposition {{from a number of}} members of the General Staff who criticized the high price of the deal, which does not allow for investment into weapons for the land forces and navy.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2007, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} its MoveOntario 2020 plan, {{that calls for}} a major overhaul and expansion of the Greater Toronto Area's transit systems, including the Transit City proposal, that will cost an estimated $17.5 billion in provincial and federal funding over a 12-year period. The provincial government proposes to provide two-thirds of the funds ($11.5 billion), and will ask {{the federal government to}} pay the remaining one-third ($6 billion). However, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government is currently not <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> spending plan.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the group {{received}} {{a large sum}} of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income. This capital was used to rent houses, initially in Denver and later in Dallas. Applewhite and Nettles had about 40followers then and lived {{in two or three}} houses: the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a [...] "craft", they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute. Students who were not <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted [...] "quality over quantity" [...] in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in South Africa, Haggard {{developed}} an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus. However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary Victorian politics and philosophy, such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: [...] "the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European... can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes." [...] The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them {{the object of a}} civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ideology. He believed that the British [...] "alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty".|$|E
500|$|In 1996, {{both the}} Conservative and Labour Parties {{committed}} {{to the idea that}} they would require a referendum on any proposed economic and monetary union with the EU; the Liberal Democrats had already <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> idea. It is difficult to quantify what role the Referendum Party had on the adoption of this position. Goldsmith condemned the Conservatives' pledge as an [...] "empty gesture". Concerned that they would lose votes to the Referendum Party, many in the Conservative Party were pressing Major to enter talks with Goldsmith, although the Prime Minister refused to engage in any formal dialogue. The electoral threat posed by Goldsmith's party was taken seriously among the Conservatives, with senior party figures like Major, Ken Clarke, Douglas Hurd, Brian Mawhinney and Michael Heseltine launching vitriolic and often personal criticisms of Goldsmith and his group. Hurd declared that [...] "the government's policy must not be put at the mercy of millionaires who play with British politics as a hobby or as a boost to newspaper sales".|$|E

500|$|As {{the tide}} in the New Guinea {{campaign}} {{began to turn}} in favour of the Allies, the Japanese, having reached the zenith of their advance in New Guinea, were forced to withdraw back towards Buna and Gona. Fierce fighting subsequently followed as Australian and US troops fought to reduce the Japanese beachhead. After taking part in defeating the Japanese at Milne Bay, the 18th Brigade was transferred to Buna. The 2/9th arrived at Oro Bay aboard HMAS Broome on 14 December. It was the first battalion of the brigade <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> battle. Leading the attack of 18 December, with support of M3 Stuart tanks from the 2/6th Armoured Regiment, it made significant gains. The 18th Brigade (and the 2/9th) continued to fight, attached to the US 32nd Division until the fall of Buna {{at the start of}} January 1943. [...] It was returned to command of the Australian 7th Division in time to participate in an attack on 12 January against Japanese positions on the Sanananda Track that had been holding up the Australian advance there. The battalion continued fighting in the Sanananda area until it concluded with an Allied victory on 22 January. By this time its strength had fallen from over 600 to just under 100 men due to the effects of tropical diseases and heavy fighting; [...] combat losses were recorded as 95 killed in action or died of wounds, 32 missing, and 247 wounded. These losses were offset by the arrival of 300 reinforcements during the battle, but nevertheless losses were so heavy, particularly from disease, that in February the 2/9th Battalion was transported back to Port Moresby, before returning to Australia the next month.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2‚Äì0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3‚Äì0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that."
