50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>call-on</b> signal (position and color). Both lights are {{normally}} off, and only lit if required. Position lights use two diagonal white lights; color lights are yellow.|$|E
50|$|A <b>call-on</b> {{signal is}} {{installed}} under {{a home or}} shunting signal. The train guided by a <b>call-on</b> signal can proceed under 15 kph mph—25 kph mph on some lines—until it reached the forward train. In stations where two trains use the same track simultaneously—for example, the Yosan Line Matsuyama Station (Ehime) and the Nankai Kōya Line Hashimoto Station (Wakayama)—call-on signals are required to allow two trains on a single block section. However, this is unnecessary if the platform track {{is divided into two}} block sections (for example, the Keihan Main Line Yodoyabashi Station of the Keihan Electric Railway).|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{only one}} train can enter a block section for safety; however, with this rule a train cannot be coupled with another train. A <b>call-on</b> signal (誘導信号機, yūdō shingōki) permits {{a train to}} enter a section already {{occupied}} by another train to enable coupling.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} written in Delphi 6, a dialect of Object Pascal, by Geoff Mayo {{and has been in}} {{development}} since the late 1990s. Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes. It simulates overlaps, approach locking, time-of-operation point locking, shunt routes, warner routes, <b>call-on</b> routes, and more.|$|E
50|$|Train {{motion is}} {{simulated}} according to train type and loading, and is controlled via {{the use of}} timetables. With a keyboard and mouse, the player sets routes and operates level crossings as necessary as well as simulations/timetable specific tasks such as operating ground frames. Solid State Interlockings (SSIs), the main electronic technology in use at present on British railways, along with approach locking, swinging overlaps, shunt routes, warner routes and <b>call-on</b> routes are all available. The simulations may be played in real time or sped up. The aim of play is to achieve a good score by overcoming problems and ensuring on-time train running. Points are accumulated for good operation and deducted for errors or late running.|$|E
