25|$|In mathematics, Jensen's inequality, {{named after}} the Danish {{mathematician}} Johan Jensen, relates {{the value of a}} <b>convex</b> <b>function</b> of an integral to the integral of the <b>convex</b> <b>function.</b> It was proven by Jensen in 1906. Given its generality, the inequality appears in many forms depending on the context, some of which are presented below. In its simplest form the inequality states that the convex transformation of a mean is {{less than or equal to}} the mean applied after convex transformation; it is a simple corollary that the opposite is true of concave transformations.|$|E
25|$|Geometrically, {{the linear}} {{constraints}} define the feasible region, {{which is a}} convex polyhedron. A linear function is a <b>convex</b> <b>function,</b> which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum; similarly, a linear function is a concave function, which implies that every local maximum is a global maximum.|$|E

25|$|If σ is real, then μ(σ) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} infimum of all real numbers a such that ζ(σ+iT) = O(T'a). It is trivial to check that μ(σ)=0 for σ>1, and the {{functional}} equation of the zeta function implies that μ(σ) = μ(1σ)σ+1/2. The Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem implies that μ is a <b>convex</b> <b>function.</b> The Lindelöf hypothesis states μ(1/2)=0, which together with the above properties of μ implies that μ(σ) is 0 for σ≥1/2 and 1/2σ for σ≤1/2.|$|E
500|$|A {{point where}} the second {{derivative}} of a function changes sign is called an inflection point. At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, {{as in the case}} of the inflection point [...] of the function , or it may fail to exist, {{as in the case of}} the inflection point [...] of the function [...] At an inflection point, a function switches from being a <b>convex</b> <b>function</b> to being a concave function or vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{some new}} {{concepts}} of geometrically relative convex sets and relative <b>convex</b> <b>functions</b> are defined. These new classes of geometrically relative <b>convex</b> <b>functions</b> unify several known and new classes of relative <b>convex</b> <b>functions</b> such as exponential <b>convex</b> <b>functions.</b> New Hermite-Hadamard type integral inequalities are derived for these new classes of geometrically relative <b>convex</b> <b>functions</b> and their variant forms. Some special cases, {{which can be}} obtained from our results, are discussed. Results proved in this paper represent significant improvements of the previously known results.
