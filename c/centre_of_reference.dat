6000|$|This {{had opened}} a new phase {{in the lives of}} Bailey and herself. The two {{supplemented}} each other to an extraordinary extent. Their subsequent career was, I think, almost entirely her invention. She was aggressive, imaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas, while he was almost destitute of initiative, and could do nothing with ideas except remember and discuss them. She was, if not exact, at least indolent, with a strong disposition to save energy by sketching--even her handwriting showed that--while he was inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless invariable calligraphy that grew larger and clearer as the years passed by. She had a considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice to people--and incidentally just as nasty--as she wanted to be. He was always just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly rude and egoistic in an undignified way. She had considerable social experience, good social connections, and considerable social ambition, while he had none of these things. She saw in a flash her opportunity to redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large, novel, rather startling things. She ran him. Her marriage, which shocked her friends and relations beyond measure--for a time they would only speak of Bailey as [...] "that gnome"--was a stroke of genius, and forthwith they proceeded to make themselves the most formidable and distinguished couple conceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was engraved inside their wedding rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant it to be no idle threat. She had discovered very early that the last thing influential people will do is to work. Everything in their lives tends to make them dependent upon a supply of confidently administered detail. Their business is with the window and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon the stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that the fact that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an invincible power over detail. She saw that if two people took the necessary pains to know the facts of government and administration with precision, to gather together knowledge that was dispersed and confused, {{to be able to say}} precisely what had to be done and what avoided in this eventuality or that, they would necessarily become a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> for all sorts of legislative proposals and political expedients, and she went unhesitatingly upon that.|$|E

This formula, and the definition of the universal primacy contained in it, have been aptly analyzed by Fr Afanassieff and we need not repeat his argument here. Neither can we quote here all testimonies of the fathers and the councils unanimously acknowledging Rome as the senior church and the center of ecumenical agreement.

40|$|In {{renewable}} resource harvesting, whether involving forests, fish, rangeland or wildlife, decisions concerning ‘investments ’ involve two {{different forms of}} capital: natural capital (the specific natural resource under consideration) and physical capital (inherent in the industrial activity, such as fishing vessels or tree-harvesting machinery). Investment in the natural capital typically involves determining a desired rate of resource use (or resource growth), while investment in physical capital typically exhibits strong irreversibility, due to the often non-malleable nature of such capital. This leads to a complex dual investment problem, with investments in the resource itself and in the physical capital involved in harvesting the resource – a problem that provided {{the focus of a}} seminal paper by Clark, Clarke and Munro (Econometrica, 1979).

The nasal mucosa is usually traumatized by most conventional surgical treatment leading {{to changes in}} nasal mucosal (atrophia,crusting [...] .). ObjectiveThe aim of this work was to confirm {{the place of a}} new surgical method in the treatment of hypertrophic rhinitis in a tropical environment. PATIENTS AND MÉTHODSIt's a study in the ENT department of the health <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> (from district IV Bamako) havinginvolved 65 patients (35 male and 30 female with an average age of 28 years) with hypertrophicrhinitis not cured by medical treatment between February 2011 and January 2012. This new method, the submucosal vasotomy was carried out after an application with 2 % lidocain(local anesthesia) by a detachment under mucosa followed from a lightweight curettage of the bonepart of the hypertrophied turbinate. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe method allowed making more permeable the nasal cavity in 80 % of cases. This technique helpedno formation of crusts and adhesions in the nasal cavity. Regular monitoring of patients allowed toconfirm the place of this technique in the management of patients with hypertrophic obstructive rhinitis. CONCLUSIONThe submucous vasotomy represents for us a useful method for addressing the problems related tosupport for the chronic hypertrophic rhinitis not cured by medical treatment in a tropical environment. ...|$|E

It is the arrival and meeting point of travelers, merchants, caravans – and goods – from Anatolia, central-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. A network of land and sea routes linked al-Bahrayn with – to the north-west – Baghdad and Aleppo, and Alexandria of Egypt, and, to the east, with the island of Jarun and its Arab and non-Arab territories.

In conclusion, the article aims to shed light on how Venetian interests intertwined actively and positively with the new dynamic role gained by al-Bahrayn at the time, and with its projection in an ever complex trade network.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundFibrodysplasia {{ossificans}} progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling, and life-shortening {{genetic disorder}} {{that causes the}} formation of heterotopic bone within soft connective tissue. Previous studies found that the FOP prevalence was about one in every two million lives. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the FOP prevalence in France by probabilistic record-linkage of 2 national databases: 1) the PMSI (Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d’information), an administrative database that records all hospitalization activities in France and 2) CEMARA, a registry database developed by the French <b>Centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>Reference</b> for Rare Diseases. ResultsUsing a capture-recapture methodology to adjust the crude number of patients identified in both data sources, 89 FOP patients were identified, which results in a prevalence of 1. 36 per million inhabitants (CI 95 % = [1. 10; 1. 68]). FOP patients’ mean age was 25  years, only 14. 9 % were above 40  years, and 53 % of them were males. The first symptoms – beside toe malformations- occurred after birth for 97. 3 % of them. Mean age at identified symptoms was 7  years and above 18  years for only 6. 9 % of patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 10  years, and above 18  years for 14. 9 % of the patients. FOP patients were distributed across France. ConclusionsDespite the challenge of ascertaining patients with rare diseases, we report a much higher prevalence of FOP in France than in previous studies elsewhere. We suggest that efforts to identify patients and confirm the diagnosis of FOP should be reinforced and extended at both national and European level...|$|R

It was clear from the information collected that there was no European or global consensus either on a curriculum for the training of the paediatric diabetes multidisciplinary team (MDT) or individual professions in paediatric diabetes. A minority of countries had well-established training but, for the majority, there was little standardisation or accreditation. Moreover, most countries did not have available courses for training the diabetes MDT and training was not mandatory. Of the courses that were available more were accredited for doctors and nurses but fewer for the other professions. As a consequence, the majority of HCP posts in paediatric diabetes do not demand prior experience in the specialty. Standardised accredited training and continuous professional development (CPD) opportunities are severely limited. The SWEET Project supports a standardised, accredited approach to training and CPD of the MDT and for individual professions. As a consequence, a curriculum for the training of the MDT was developed, and this is now ready for implementation...|$|R
