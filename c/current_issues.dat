5|$|Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{lays the}} {{juridical}} foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations. In July 2014, {{in the beginning}} of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tasked Antonio Tajani, then Vice-president, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17. In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on <b>current</b> <b>issues</b> and in relation with parliamentary works.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2012, <b>current</b> <b>issues</b> do {{not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E

5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect <b>current</b> <b>issues</b> and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament {{periodically}} commissions {{opinion polls}} and studies on public opinion trends in Member States to survey perceptions {{and expectations of}} citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union.

5|$|Young Bosnia's activists {{regarded}} {{literature as}} indispensable to revolution, {{and most of}} them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques. Stojanović wrote poems, and read the works of Petar Kočić, Aleksa Šantić, Vladislav Petković Dis, Sima Pandurović, Milan Rakić, and later the works of Russian authors. In his final years at the gymnasium, he read Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Bakunin, Nietzsche, Jaurès, Le Bon, Ibsen, and Marinetti. National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed <b>current</b> <b>issues</b> concerning the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All members of the association were Serbs. Generally, Stojanović's lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanović travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages. One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the backwardness of their country.|$|E
