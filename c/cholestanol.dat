Cyclic alkanes constitute a large fraction of aliphatic hydrocarbon emissions originating from incomplete combustion of diesel fuel and motor oil. In the present study, cholestane (C 27 H 48) {{is used as a}} model system to examine the OH-initiated heterogeneous oxidation pathways of cyclic alkanes in a photochemical flow tube reactor. Oxidation products are collected on filters and analyzed by a novel soft ionization two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique. The analysis reveals that the first-generation functionalization products (cholestanones, cholestanals, and <b>cholestanols)</b> are the dominant reaction products that account for up to 70 % by mass of the total speciated compounds. The ratio of first-generation carbonyls to alcohols is near unity at every oxidation level. Among the cholestanones/cholestanals, 55 % are found to have the carbonyl group on the rings of the androstane skeleton, while 74 % of <b>cholestanols</b> have the hydroxyl group on the rings.

Genetic defect in CYP 27 A 1 leads to a deficiency in sterol 27 -hydroxylase and reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) formation from cholesterol. The lack of negative feedback of CDCA on bile acid synthesis leads to increased production of <b>cholestanol.</b> Cholesterol production is also increased in CTX, but the role of statin therapy in these subjects is unclear. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The records of all adult Chinese CTX patients managed at our center were retrieved from our computerized record system. Clinical and biochemical parameters and drug history were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven adult CTX patients (5 males, 2 females) from 4 unrelated, non-consanguineous families were identified. The mean age was 31. 0 +/- 9. 4 years at first symptoms, 36. 0 +/- 10. 9 years at diagnosis and 48. 9 +/- 7. 0 years {{at the time of}} study. Reported first symptoms were xanthomata (n= 5) and motor abnormalities (n= 2). At presentation, all patients had bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata, 4 patients had cerebellar sign and 3 patients had subnormal intelligence. Pre-treatment <b>cholestanol</b> level was 147. 9 +/- 70. 5 umol/l (reference range < 13. 0 umol/l), low-density cholesterol (LDL) level was 2. 2 +/- 0. 3 mmol/l, high-density cholesterol (HDL) level was 1. 4 +/- 0. 3 mmol/l and triglyceride (TG) level was 1. 1 +/- 0. 4 mmol/l. CDCA, at 750 mg daily in 3 divided doses, was started at diagnosis in 4 patients and at 4 years post-diagnosis in 3 patients. After 1 year of treatment, mean <b>cholestanol</b> level was reduced to 13. 0 +/- 11. 6 umol/l (p< 0. 05), while no significant changes were noted in LDL (2. 8 +/- 0. 5 mmol/l), HDL (1. 4 +/- 0. 2 mmol/l) or TG (1. 2 +/- 0. 7 mmol/l). Simvastatin 10 mg nocte in addition to CDCA in 3 of the 7 patients at 3. 3 +/- 2. 2 years after diagnosis did not lead to any change in <b>cholestanol,</b> LDL, HDL or TG levels at 5 and 10 years post-treatment commencement. Six patients had stable intelligence and were engaged in meaningful employment. No improvement in demyelinating changes in the brain on MRI was observed with treatment (assessed serially in 3 patients). Xanthoma regressed partially in 3 patients, was excised with no recurrence in 2 patients and remained stable in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Our series {{is one of the largest}} of Chinese CTX patients, and possibly one of the longest longitudinally followed series of CTX patients, reported in the literature. Our data suggests that CDCA is effective in lowering <b>cholestanol</b> starting in the first year of treatment. Simvastatin at 10 mg nocte seems to have no effect on circulating levels of <b>cholestanol,</b> LDL, HDL or TG at 5 and 10 years of follow-up.

40|$|Intimal sterol {{synthesis}} {{was examined}} in isolated human arterial segments obtained at surgery or at postmortem examination. The tissues were incubated with acetate- 1 - 14 C and mevalonate- 2 - 14 C and {{the incorporation of}} these precursors into sterols was determined. Intimal sterols were isolated by multiple chromatographic techniques and purified by bromination and oxidation procedures. The {{results indicate that the}} arterial intima can incorporate acetate and mevalonate into cholesterol, <b>cholestanol,</b> and squalene. <b>Cholestanol</b> was the major sterol synthesized by the arterial wall, but cholesterol production was also consistently observed.

40|$|A Saccharomyces cerevisiae sterol auxotroph, SPK 14 (a hem 1 erg 6 erg 7 ura), was {{constructed}} {{to test the}} ability of selected C- 5, 6 unsaturated sterols at growth-limiting concentrations to spark growth on bulk <b>cholestanol.</b> The native sterol, ergosterol, initiated growth faster and allowed a greater cell yield than did other sterols selectively altered {{in one or more}} features of the sterol. Although the C- 5, 6 unsaturation is required for the sparking function, the presence of the C- 22 unsaturation was found to facilitate sparking far better than did the C- 7 unsaturation, whereas the C- 24 methyl was the least important group. The addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid to the medium allowed the sparking of FY 3 (hem 1 erg 7 ura) on bulk <b>cholestanol</b> due to the derepression of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and the production of endogenous ergosterol. The optimal concentration of delta-aminolevulinic acid to spark growth was 800 ng/ml, whereas higher concentrations caused a growth inhibition. The growth yield of FY 3 reached a plateau maximum at about 5 micrograms/ml when the bulk <b>cholestanol</b> was varied in the presence of 10 ng of sparking erogosterol per ml...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{levels of}} the {{surrogate}} markers of cholesterol absorption (<b>cholestanol</b> and plant sterols) and synthesis (cholesterol precursors) in serum have suggested that in adult type 1 diabetes, cholesterol absorption is high and synthesis is low compared with type 2 diabetic or control subjects. Accordingly, these findings were further studied in children with type 1 dia-betes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Forty-eight children with diabetes were compared with 79 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The serum ratios of cholesterol absorption and synthesis markers were measured with gas-liquid chromatography. The study population was divided into triads (combining the two lowest triads) by serum <b>cholestanol</b> ratios of the control subjects indicating low to high cholesterol absorption efficiency. RESULTS — The ratios of the absorption and synthesis markers were similar in case and control subjects, and they were negatively {{related to each other}} in control subjects, being less consistent in diabetic patients. Thus, high cholesterol absorption was associated with low syn-thesis. Plant sterol ratios increased significantly with increasing <b>cholestanol</b> triads in both groups, but the values in the lowest triads were higher in case versus control subjects...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols (beta-sitosterol, <b>cholestanol</b> and campesterol) and {{cholesterol}} precursors (desmosterol and lathosterol), {{have been suggested}} as important biochemical markers of intestinal cholesterol absorption and liver biosynthesis, respectively, and as useful clinical parameters {{in the study of}} hypercholesterolemia, beta-sitosterolemia, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, including pharmacological response to hypolipidemic agents. We developed an optimised analytical method for the simultaneous analysis,of <b>cholestanol,</b> desmosterol, lathosterol, campesterol and beta-sitosterol in plasma using capillary gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with multiple selected ion monitoring (SIM). This method is based on the alkaline hydrolysis of sterol esters, extraction of free sterols and derivatization. The recovery of all sterols was in the range 76 - 101 %. Within-day relative standard deviations (R. S. Ds.) and the between-day R. S. Ds. of <b>cholestanol,</b> desmosterol, lathosterol, campesterol and beta-sitosterol were less than 8 %, and their plasma levels in 161 normal subjects were (mean +/- S.

40|$|Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an {{inherited}} autosomal recessive disease {{caused by a}} mutation in the gene for the sterol 27 -hydroxylase enzyme, which determines the accumulation of plasmatic <b>cholestanol</b> in various tissues. The natural history of this disease is characterized by chronic diarrhea beginning in childhood, cataract in youth, tendinous xanthomas in adulthood and later progressive neurological dysfunction manifested as dementia, psychiatric disorders, cerebellar, pyramidal or extra pyramidal signs or seizures. We report a 39 year-old male {{with a history of}} diarrhea during childhood and bilateral cataracts requiring surgery at 20 years of age, who evolves later with psychiatric disorders and bilateral increased volume in Achules tendons. High levels of plasmatic <b>cholestanol</b> and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The sterol {{content of}} {{cellular}} lipids of Treponema hyodysenteriae, {{the agent of}} swine dysentery, was determined. When cultured in lipid-depleted brain heart infusion broth containing vesicles made from [4 - 14 C]cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, T. hyodysenteriae cells incorporated radioactive label. Most (95 %) of this radioactivity was associated with bacterial membrane preparations. Lipids were extracted from radiolabeled cells and fractionated by silicic acid column chromatography. Components of the neutral lipid fraction were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and were detected by monitoring both radioactivity and UV absorption (210 nm) of the column effluent. Cholesterol represented only about 5 % of the total radioactivity in the bacterial neutral lipids. The remaining radioactivity {{was associated with a}} compound that did not absorb light at 210 nm. This lipid was purified and, on the basis of results from thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry, was identified as cholesterol (5 alpha-cholestan- 3 beta-ol), a sterol lacking the unsaturated bond of cholesterol. <b>Cholestanol</b> was also present in cell-free culture broth, but only after growth of the spirochete. These results are evidence that cholesterol is used by T. hyodysenteriae for membrane synthesis. Cholesterol is converted to <b>cholestanol</b> in T. hyodysenteriae cultures and <b>cholestanol</b> is a major component (approximately 9 % by weight) of T. hyodysenteriae cell lipids...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether parameters of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) associate with cholesterol metabolism {{before and after}} weight reduction, 42 middle-aged overweight subjects with mild OSA were randomised to intensive lifestyle intervention (N= 23) or to control group (N= 18) with routine lifestyle counselling only. Cholesterol metabolism was evaluated with serum noncholesterol sterol ratios to cholesterol, surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption (<b>cholestanol</b> and plant sterols) and synthesis (cholestenol, desmosterol, and lathosterol) at baseline and after 1 -year intervention. At baseline, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) was associated with serum campesterol (P< 0. 05) and inversely with desmosterol ratios (P< 0. 001) independently of gender, BMI, and homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) {{was not associated with}} cholesterol metabolism. Weight reduction significantly increased SaO 2 and serum <b>cholestanol</b> and decreased AHI and serum cholestenol ratios. In the groups combined, the changes in AHI were inversely associated with changes of <b>cholestanol</b> and positively with cholestenol ratios independent of gender and the changes of BMI and HOMA-IR (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, mild OSA seemed to be associated with cholesterol metabolism independent of BMI and HOMA-IR.
