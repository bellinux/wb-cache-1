40|$|The {{environment}} {{is a dynamic}} system, subject to change resulting {{from a variety of}} physicochemical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, redox potential and human activity. The quantity and variety of these determinants cause the inflow of substances into individual environmental elements to vary in both time and space, as well as in terms of substance types and quantities. The energy and matter flow in the environment determines its integrity, which means that the processes occurring in one element of the environment affect the others. A certain measure of the energy and matter flow is the migration of chemical substances in various forms from one place to another. In a particular geographical space, under natural conditions, a specific level of balance between individual processes appears; in areas subject to anthropopressure, the correlations are different. In small areas, varying deposition volumes and chemism of precipitation waters which reach the substratum directly can both be observed. The study area is similar in terms of geological origins as well as morphological, structural and physico-chemical properties, and is typical of European low mountain regions. A qualitative and quantitative study of wet atmospheric precipitation was conducted between February 2009 and May 2011 in the Bobrza river catchment in the Holy Cross (Świętokrzyskie) Mountains (Poland), at three sampling sites of varying land development and distance from sources of various acidic-alkaline emissions. Field and laboratory work was conducted over 29 months, from February 2009 to May 2011. Atmospheric precipitation measurements were carried out in a continuous manner by means of a Hellman rain gauge (200 cm 2). The collecting surface was placed at ground level (0 m AGL). The application of a <b>collecting</b> <b>funnel</b> and an adequately prepared polyethylene collecting can in the rain gauge enabled the measurement of precipitation volume and water sampling for chemical analyses. In order to prevent mineral soil particles and organic matter from entering the rain gauge, the device was placed in a pit, which was – for safety reasons – covered with a grid of appropriate single net-mesh diameter. The study covered metals of Fe, Cd, Cr, Al and Mn, ions of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, NH 4 +, Cl-, F-, NO 3 -, SO 42 - and PO 43 - as well as the pH and conductivity. Basing on the conducted analyses, a characteristics of ion deposition on soil surface were developed. In order to interpret the obtained results, the neutralising potential (NP), the acidifying potential (AP) and the acid neutralising capacity (ANCaq) indices were used, together with molar or mass proportions of the ions. The study results show a clear boundary between the northern and southern parts of the study area. Both regularities and disorders in inter-ion relationships, originating from the introduction into the air of pollution due to human activity (acidification or alkalisation), were observed...|$|E

The herbicides detected in the highest amounts (in order) were: 2, 4 -D, MCPA, bromoxynil, dicamba and mecoprop. Detections were quite consistent between years. Herbicide amounts over the season were lowest at the remote locations (21 – 96 µg/m 2 2, 4 -D), intermediate in the City of Lethbridge (82 – 109 µg/m 2 2, 4 -D) and highest in the farming areas (44 – 315 µg/m 2 2, 4 -D).

The prolongation was sharply constricted, showed suc cessive thickened rings, and terminated in an expanded rim; it was, in fact, an exaggeration of the constriction {{at the end of}} a normal tube. The tube current in such a preparation, as is well known, enters the tube anteriorly and leaves posteriorly, maintained by the rhythmic beat ing of the fans on segments 14, 15, and 16. It is weak ventral to the animal, but strong dorsally, and is directed under the arch formed by the long parapodia of segment 12. This main tube current provides the food supply, the nature of which has been described by Enders (1909). The collecting mechanism has been described by several authors as follows: the broad ciliated buccal <b>funnel</b> <b>collects</b> directly from an extensive antero-ventral field; in addition, ciliated grooves on the dorsal side of the thorax collect froni the tube current. To demonstrate this when the animal is removed from its tube, food particles must be supplied by dropping them onto the thorax from a pipette. Such particles are collected in a niucoid stream into grooves along the inner edge of the arch formed by the parapodia of segment 12, and pass from this anteriorly in a median groove. Particles which happen to fall on the ventral face of the thorax are passed in laterally moving streams dorsally, between some of the posterior parapodiaâ€”being thus brought into the dorsal collecting field. The median dorsal groove does not lead directly into the mouth, but ends blindly in a dilatation posterior to the dorsal lip overhanging the mouth (Fig. 1).

There were 2 sampling periods; the first from 29 April to 7 May 1996 {{and the second}} from 1 to 4 August 1996. Combined samples of bat guano comprised 4, 430 individuals of 32 families of the following : 13 orders (2 classes; Arachnida and Hexapoda) Araneae, Acari, Pseudoscorpiones, Collembola, Blattaria, Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Psocoptera, Neuroptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. The relationships between arthropods and physical factors such as cave temperature, relative humi-dity of the cave, moisture in guano, pH of guano, total nitrogen in guano and organic matters in guano were explored. The {{results showed that the}} number of individuals of Leptonetidae (P< 0. 05), Araneae (P< 0. 05) and Psocoptera (P< 0. 05) positively correlated with total nitrogen in guano but numbers of Blattellidae (P< 0. 05) and Blattaria (P< 0. 05) negatively correlated with total nitrogen in guano. The total numbers of families of arthropods (P< 0. 05) and the number of individuals of Leptonetidae (P< 0. 05), Sphaeropsocidae (P< 0. 05), Liposcelidae (P< 0. 05), Alleculidae (P< 0. 01), Chironomidae (P< 0. 05), Formicidae (P< 0. 05), Araneae (P< 0. 05), Psocoptera (P< 0. 01) and Hymenoptera (P< 0. 05) positively correlated with organic matters in guano. None of all arthropods correlated with cave temperature, relative humidity of the cave, moisture in guano and pH of guano. Study on the effect of type of bat guano (insectivore or frugivore bat guano) and the light factor (light or dark zone) on arthropods showed that type of bat guano has an effect on total numbers of families (P< 0. 05) and the number of individuals of Leptonetidae (P< 0. 01), Laelapidae (P< 0. 05), Blattellidae (P< 0. 05), Sphaeropsocidae (P< 0. 01), Liposcelidae (P< 0. 05), Dermestidae (P< 0. 01), Staphylinidae (P< 0. 01), Tineidae (P< 0. 05), Araneae (P< 0. 01), Blattaria (P< 0. 05), Psocoptera (P< 0. 01), Coleoptera (P< 0. 01), Lepidoptera (P< 0. 05) and Diptera (P< 0. 05). The light factor has an effect on the number of individuals of Carabidae (P< 0. 05) and Psocoptera (P< 0. 05). Interaction between type of bat guano and light affects only the number of individuals of Psocoptera (P< 0. 05). This study concludes {{that at least one of}} these physical factors is important in determining the number of families and the number of individuals in each family, particularly the scavenger or detritivore arthropods, and that bat guano is the food source and larva nursery for arthropods in tropical limestone caves...|$|R
40|$|Six {{palms of}} the species Attalea phalerata Mart. (Arecaceae) were sampled during the high water season of the Mato Grosso Pantanal (February 2001), in order to analyse their {{composition}} and diversity, estimate the biomass of the arthropod community associated with the canopies of this plant species, and to investigate {{the influence of the}} flood pulse on this community. This study was carried out in the region of Pirizal, in the municipality of Nossa Senhora do Livramento, at the Retiro Novo Ranch in the Pantanal of Poconé, Mato Grosso, in areas where this plant species grows together in what are know locally as “acurizais”. The method of collection employed, canopy fogging, involves the application of an insecticide which is sprayed on the canopies using a non-residual, synthetic pyrethroid, Lambdacialotrina (1 %), associated with the synergist DDVP (0, 1 %) and applied from the ground over the whole of the canopy {{with the aid of a}} thermobilizer SWINGFOG SN 50. The spray was applied at 6. 00 am and the arthropods were <b>collected</b> in nylon <b>funnels</b> of a diameter of 1 m positioned under the canopy and which contained plastic sample collectors containig 92 % alcohol. Each tree was sprayed once, followed by three consecutive collections. The first, two hours after spraying, the second, two hours after the canopy had been shaken vigorously and the third, after cutting off all the leaves and washing off any arthropods still stuck on the leaves. In the laboratory all the specimens collected were identified according to the level of the taxonomic order, species of Coleoptera by the level of the family and morphospecies (recognisable taxonomic units). Also, samples of Formicidae and Araneae were sent to specialists for identification of the family and species. A total of 63638 arthropods (642, 8 ± 259, 7 ind/m 2), distributed between the Classes Insecta, Arachnida, Diplopoda and Crustacea and 25 orders, the most dominant groups being those of Acari, Coleoptera, Psocoptera, Diptera, Collembola and Hymenoptera the majority being Formicidae. From the Coleoptera group a total of 7670 specimens obtained, including larvae, of wich there were 48 families and 467 morphospecies. Endomychidae, Nitidulidae, Tenebrionidae, Staphylinidae and Phalacridae were the most dominant families. Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, Tenebrionidae and Chrysomelidae had the largest groups of morphospecies. In relation to the Formicidae, a total of 6 subfamilies, 13 tribes and 29 species were obtained. The Araneae consisted of 20 families with Salticidae and Araneidae being the most abundant. The biomass corresponded to 8. 86 g of dry weight and 0. 18 mg/m 2. Coleoptera, Blattodea, Orthoptera, Araneae and Hymenoptera were the most representative groups and Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae, Alleculidae, Nitidulidae and Curculionidae were the families of Coleoptera with the greatest biomassSUMÁRIO LISTA DE FIGURAS [...] x LISTA DE TABELAS [...] xiii RESUMO [...] . xvii ABSTRACT [...] xviii 1 - INTRODUÇÃO [...] 1 2 - ÁREA DE ESTUDO [...] 5 3 - MATERIAL E MÉTODOS [...] 8 3. 1 - MATERIAL [...] 8 3. 2 - METODOLOGIA [...] 10 3. 2. 1 - PROCEDIMENTOS EM CAMPO [...] . 10 3. 2. 2 - PROCEDIMENTOS EM LABORATÓRIO [...] . 13 3. 3 - BIOMASSA [...] . 13 3. 4 - ANÁLISE ESTATÍSTICA [...] 15 4 - RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO [...] . 16 4. 1 - COMPOSIÇÃO TAXONÔMICA DA COMUNIDADE DE ARTRÓPODES [...] 16 4. 2 - GRUPOS DOMINANTES DE ARTRÓPODES E ANÁLISE DE FREQÜÊNCIA [...] 16 4. 3 - EVENTOS DE COLETA DA ARTROPODOFAUNA [...] 20 4. 4 - ANÁLISE DO POSICIONAMENTO DOS FUNIS COLETORES [...] 21 4. 5 - MATÉRIA ORGÂNICA ASSOCIADA À COPA DE A. phalerata MART.
