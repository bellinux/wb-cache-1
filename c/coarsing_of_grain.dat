For the lowest order approximation with two domain wall states, it realizes the idea <b>of</b> <b>coarse</b> <b>graining</b> <b>of</b> domain walls.

40|$|For {{multilevel}} spin systems, robustness of {{the quantum}} mechanical (QM) violation of macrorealism (MR) {{with respect to}} coarse grained measurements is investigated using three different necessary conditions of MR, namely, the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), Wigner's form of the Leggett-Garg inequality (WLGI) and the condition of no-signalling in time (NSIT). It is shown that for dichotomic sharp measurements, in the asymptotic limit of spin, the algebraic maxima of the QM violations of all these three necessary conditions of MR are attained. Importantly, the QM violations of all these persist in that limit even for arbitrary unsharp measurements, i. e. for any non zero value of the sharpness parameter characterizing the degree of fuzziness of the relevant measurements. We also find that when different measurement outcomes are clubbed into two groups {{for the sake of}} dichotomising the outcomes, the asymmetry/symmetry in the number of outcomes in the two groups, signifying the degree <b>of</b> <b>coarse</b> <b>graining</b> <b>of</b> measurements, has a crucial role in discerning quantum violation of MR.
