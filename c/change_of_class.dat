50|$|Almost all kura {{started as}} a full primary school. Kura Arongatahi teach from Years 1 to Years 13. The age of {{children}} ranges from 5 years old to 18 years old, although in New Zealand the compulsory leaving age is 16. Students enrolled from Year 11 to Year 13 undertake NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement). However, before a composite school can award NCEA qualifications, the school must be an accredited provider with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. A kura can only become a composite once the Minister of Education has approved its <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> application. Approval to become a kura arongatahi can take many years, usually at least two years. Funding and staffing of these kura is {{different from those of}} kura tuatahi. In 2008 there were 15 Kura Kaupapa Māori Te Aho Matua composite schools. A composite school in New Zealand can also be classified as an Area school. In recognition of becoming an area school or composite school, Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Mangere, in Mangere, Auckland, changed its name to Te Kura Kaupapa Māori a rohe o Mangere. Sometimes the Minister of Education will not approve a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> application to become a full composite school, instead the minister will approve the application so that the kura can become a restricted composite school. A restricted composite school usually allows a kura to teach children from Years 1 to 10. Gaining restricted composite school status does not limit a kura from eventually gaining full composite status in the future, whereby the kura is able to teach up to Year 15.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{hypotheses}} of {{this study}} stated the following: Interaction with the computer game will significantly increase the class means in: (1) mathematical achievement, (2) attitudes toward mathematics, and (3) graphing ability in high school advanced algebra. ALGEBRA ARCADE is a computerized simulation game played on a coordinate grid. One can play against one's self or another player. Greater knowledge of graphing functions results in a higher score. The game closely resembles commercially marketed videogames. Eleven teachers, at seven high schools, each taught a control and an experimental class. Four hundred twenty-three students took both attitude tests and four hundred twenty-five students took both achievement tests. Students were pretested and posttested with selected scales from the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics attitudes Scales and equivalent forms of the Intermediate Algebra portion of the Descriptive Tests of Mathematics Skills (College Board) to measure mathematical achievement. Graphing ability {{was measured by the}} score on the Coordinate Plane and Graphing part of the Intermediate Algebra test. The experiment lasted four weeks and centered around the Quadratic Functions unit. The experimental group played ALGEBRA ARCADE in lieu of the in-class assignment during the 15 - 20 minutes at the end of class. The out-of-class assignment was the same. Analysis revealed: (1) a significant difference, at the. 08 level, in- <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> means on mathematical achievement favoring use of the computer game, (2) very little difference (p=. 38) in the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> means on attitudes toward mathematics, and (3) a significant difference, at the. 005 level, in <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> means on graphing ability favoring the use of the computer game.

40|$|Topographic {{databases}} normally contain {{areas of}} different land cover classes, commonly defining a planar partition, that is, gaps and overlaps are not allowed. When reducing {{the scale of}} such a database, some areas become too small for representation {{and need to be}} aggregated. This unintentionally but unavoidably results in <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes.</b> In this article we present an optimisation method for the aggregation problem. This method aims to minimise <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> and to create compact shapes, subject to hard constraints ensuring aggregates of sufficient size for the target scale. To quantify class changes we apply a semantic distance measure. We give a graph theoretical problem formulation and prove that the problem is NP-hard, meaning that we cannot hope to find an efficient algorithm. Instead, we present a solution by mixed-integer programming {{that can be used to}} optimally solve small instances with existing optimisation software. In order to process large datasets, we introduce specialised heuristics that allow certain variables to be eliminated in advance and a problem instance to be decomposed into independent subinstances. We tested our method for a dataset of the official German topographic database ATKIS with input scale 1 : 50, 000 and output scale 1 : 250, 000. For small instances, we compare results of this approach with optimal solutions that were obtained without heuristics. We compare results for large instances with those of an existing iterative algorithm and an alternative optimisation approach by simulated annealing. These tests allow us to conclude that, with the defined heuristics, our optimisation method yields high-quality results for large datasets in modest time...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the morphology and progression pattern of brain mets in melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) compared with patients who did not receive targeted therapy (BRAFi group and control group). The number and size of brain mets were compared between a baseline and a comparative MRI at progression. The number of brain mets was grouped into seven number classes (N= 1 - 4, N= 5 - 10, N= 11 - 20, N= 21 - 30, N= 31 - 40, N= 41 - 50, and N> 50) and its difference was reported as the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> that occurred. The mean size of the newly developed lesions was determined by representative measurements and the evolution of three persisting target lesions was assessed on the basis of modified RECIST criteria. Of 96 patients studied, 42 were in the BRAFi group and 54 were in the control group. Patients under BRAFi treatment had a significantly greater increase in the number of brain mets, where the median <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> for the BRAFi compared with the control group was 2 versus 0 (P< 0. 01). The mean size of the new lesions was smaller in the BRAFi group. Pre-existing target lesions did not show any prominent or different patterns of how they evolved in either group. Brain mets in patients treated with BRAFi showed a progression pattern characterized by a high propensity to disseminate, which might reflect an in-vivo manifestation of phenotype switching in response to targeted therapy, with a predominance of the invasive/migratory tumor cell phenotype. Drivers of invasiveness may present promising targets for therapeutic interventions...|$|E
