2500|$|In addition, animal {{agriculture}} {{is a large}} source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO2 equivalents. [...] Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. [...] This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parties</b> of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.|$|E
2500|$|Some sources {{disagree}} {{with some of}} the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic methane emissions are attributable to the livestock sector, and a NASA summary indicates about 30 percent. Because of the GWP multiplier used, such a difference between estimates will have a large effect on an estimate of GHG CO2 equivalents contributed by the livestock sector. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents. This estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parties</b> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Article 4(1)(a) {{requires}} all Parties to [...] "develop, periodically update, publish {{and make}} {{available to the}} Conference of the Parties" [...] as well as [...] "national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources" [...] "removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol." [...] Under the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, human-induced greenhouse emissions must be reported in six sectors: energy (including stationary energy and transport); industrial processes; solvent and other product use; agriculture; waste; and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The rules governing accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol are contained in several decisions of the <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parties</b> under the UNFCCC and LULUCF {{has been the subject}} of two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Kyoto Protocol article 3.3 thus requires mandatory LULUCF accounting for afforestation (no forest for last 50 years), reforestation (no forest on 31 December 1989) and deforestation, as well as (in the first commitment period) under article 3.4 voluntary accounting for cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation and forest management (if not already accounted under article 3.3).|$|E
