40|$|Water quality {{degradation}} {{is often}} a severe consequence of rapid economic expansion in developing countries. Methods to assess spatial-temporal patterns and trends in water quality are essential for guiding adaptive management efforts aimed at water quality remediation. Temporal and spatial patterns of surface water quality were investigated for 54 monitoring sites in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China to identify such patterns in water quality occurring across a rural-suburban-urban interface. Twenty physical and chemical water quality parameters were analyzed in surface waters collected once every 4 - 8 weeks from 2000 to 2010. Temporal and spatial variations among water quality parameters were assessed between seasons (wet/dry) and among major land use zones (urban/suburban/rural). Factor {{analysis was used to}} identify parameters that were important in assessing seasonal and spatial variations in water quality. Results revealed that parameters related to organic pollutants (dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (manganese) (<b>COD</b> <b>Mn),</b> and 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5)), nutrients (ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 + -N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP)), and salt concentration (electrical conductivity (EC)) were the most important parameters contributing to water quality variation. Collectively, they explained 70. 9 % of the total variance. A trend study using the seasonal Kendall test revealed reductions in <b>COD</b> <b>Mn,</b> BOD 5, NH 4 + -N, petrol, V-phen, and EC concentrations over the 11 -year study period. Cluster analysis was employed to evaluate variation among 14 sampling sites representative of dominant land use categories and indicated three, three, and four clusters based on organic, nutrient, and salt water quality characteristics, respectively. Factors that are typically responsible for water quality degradation (including population, topography, and land use) showed no strong correlation with water quality trends implying considerable point source inputs in the watershed. The results of this study help inform ongoing water quality remediation efforts by documenting trends in water quality across various land use zones. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of precipitation are mainly determined by solid, liquid and gaseous substances {{that exist in}} suspended or dissolved form. These substances come from many complex interactions between the atmosphere – hydrosphere – lithosphere – biota. The analytical characterization of precipitation {{has been based on}} the analysis of several chemical parameters: pH, conductivity, chloride, fluoride and ammonium ions, total hardness, alkalinity, H 2 S and sulphides, <b>COD</b> (<b>Mn),</b> nitrites, phosphorous, metallic ions (total iron, copper and chromium). In this purpose were collected rainwater, ice and snow from different areas (cities Năvodari, Constanţa, Buzău and Mihail Kogălniceanu) during November 2007 till February 2008. This study shows that chemical characteristics of the analyzed water samples vary from one region to another depending on the mineralogical composition of zones crossed, the contact time, temperature, weather conditions, the sampling period (day or night) and the nature of sample (rain, snow, ice) ...|$|E
40|$|Water quality {{evaluation}} entails both randomness and fuzziness. Considering that water eutrophication evaluation in volves many ind ic es, different classifications and interval values, fuzzy variable sets theory {{was developed to}} Lake Baiyangdian as a study case. Taking reference to eutrophication standard of Chinese lakes and local characteristic of Lake Baiyangdian, eutrophication degree of lake was divided into 8 level s. Total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and <b>COD</b> <b>Mn</b> were selected as evaluation ind ic es in this research. Based on the measured data, index feature value matrix of sample was built. Index weights were determined by means of pure threshold value method. Relative membership de gree of each index to each classification was calculated with relative difference function model. Then the stability of feature value of classification corresponding was received by the comprehensive calculation with the relative membership degree and index weights. The {{results show that the}} proposed models are effective tools for generating a set of realistic and flexible optimal solutions for complicated water {{quality evaluation}} issues. It concluded that the model was reasonable and practical. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the kinetic parameters of manganese (Mn) removal for the biofilm from two different sources; which were from drain and soil. There are four kinetic parameters needed to be determined which were yield coefficient (Y), decay rate constant (kd), microbial growth rate (µ), and substrate concentration (Ks); the calculation was based on Monod kinetic model. The process for determining kinetic parameters of each biofilm included the acclimatization of biofilm, total suspended solids tests (TSS), Mn tests and chemical oxygen demand (COD) tests. Sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBR) is used in this study and two parameters are tested in the experiment; <b>Mn</b> and <b>COD</b> concentration. Results showed that the kinetic value for drain biofilm of Mn concentration parameter were Y = 2. 9912 mg TSS/mg Mn, kd - 1 = 1. 214 day, µmax - 1 = 1. 374 daymax, and Ks = 0. 4262 mg/L Mn. The soil biofilm for Mn concentration parameter showed the value of kinetic as Y = 0. 1317 mg TSS/mg Mn, k d - 1 = 1. 836 day, µmax - 1 = 1. 846 day, and Ks = 0. 0433 mg/L Mn. For the research on the COD concentration parameter, the values of kinetic for drain biofilm are Y = 0. 0078 mg TSS/mg COD, kd - 1 = 1. 0519 day, µ = 1. 136 daymax- 1, and Ks = 4. 403 mg/L COD. Soil biofilm showed the kinetic values of Y = 0. 0117 mg TSS/mg COD, k= 1. 8348 day- 1, µmax - 1 = 1. 844 dayd, and Ks = 0. 0433 mg/L COD. By the evaluation of <b>COD</b> and <b>Mn</b> removal from wastewater, from the way of kinetic parameter estimation provide knowledge for future planning, designing and modelling of wastewater treatment plant...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed to measure the chemical constituents associated with the settling velocity fractions that comprise a wastewater settling velocity profile (SVP). 31 wastewater samples were collected from fifteen different catchments in England and Wales. For each catchment, settling velocity and associated chemical constituent profiles were determined. The results are mainly for Suspended Solids (SS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Phosphorus (P) and Total Kjeadahl Nitrogen (TKN), however these are supplemented by the results from 5 events for a suite of heavy metals. <b>COD,</b> P, Hg, <b>Mn</b> and Pb {{were found to be}} predominantly associated with the solid phase and TKN, Al, Cu and Fe with the liquor phase of the wastewater samples. The results in the thesis are expressed as mass of pollutant (g) per mass total SS (kg). COD and P were found to be mainly associated with the sinkers and had a particular affinity for solids with settling velocities in the range 0. 9 - 9. 03 mm/sec. TKN was mainly associated with the soluble phase, however of the solids that did settle, a peak was found to be associated within the settling velocity range 0. 9 - 9. 03 mm/sec. The relationships identified for COD and P were generally found to be unaffected by flow conditions and catchment characteristics. However, TKN was found to be affected by catchment type. Data on the distribution of heavy metals was limited, and no specific relationships with solids were identified. 16 mean pollutant profiles are presented in the thesis. Presentation of the data in this form will enable the results to be of use in the design of sedimentation devices to predict removal efficiencies for solids and associated pollutants. The findings of the research may also be applied to modelling tools to provide further characteristics on the solids that are modelled than is currently used. This would enhance the overall performance of tools used in integrated catchment modelling...|$|R
40|$|For {{water color}} remote sensing study of inland water body, {{terrestrial}} satellite {{is often a}} good data source, because it has high spatial resolution. However, the precision of water color remote sensing inversion limits its application to water environmental monitoring and pollution analysis. This paper firstly studied traditional regression arithmetic {{and found that it}} was difficult to extract a good combination to construct the regression model. In order to acquire good inversion results, the paper introduced an advanced nonlinear science, artificial neural network technology. On the basis of satellite synchronous monitoring experiment, a BP neural network model was constructed to inverse SS, <b>COD</b> <b>Mn,</b> DO, T-N, T-P and chl-a from Landsat TM data. The accuracy was acceptable and the relative error could be controlled below 25 %. Moreover, the reasons of simulating error, ways of improving model and applications of the model were also analyzed in details. The result of this research showed that based on a small-scale of satellite synchronous experiment, the model could be applied successfully in investigation, analysis and estimation of water quality. It comes through long time that water quality data collection often depends on traditional monitoring, which needs much time and labor. So it is impossible to realize real-time and quick data acquiring. Along with continuous development of environmental information technology, water color remote sensing is applied more and more widely in the water qualit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Water {{pollution}} {{is a key}} environmental problem affecting modern day China. Increased human population, agricultural and advanced industrial activities present a complex multiple problems impacting water resource across China. This situation is more pronounced in Tianjing Lake, Tiacang City. Engineered in April 2012, the lake exemplifies severe eutrophication problems. Constructed for recreational uses, the lake plays {{a vital role in}} the economic and sociopolitical development of Tiacang City. As a result, the Tianjing Lake water transfer project was carried out in order to improve water quality and alleviate eutrophication. The project considered major field observations that monitored the lake’s nutrients concentrations (TN, TP, NH 4, <b>COD</b> <b>Mn)</b> before and after water diversions. Results showed that the effects of water transfer on the overall water quality improvement in the lake seemed heterogeneous. The observed heterogeneity is {{as a result of the}} lake’s hydrodynamic conditions influenced by inflow tributaries. However, poor water movement resulting from the lack of outlet to actively expel pollutants may be a key factor compounding the lake’s internal nutrients management. This, however, dictates the engineering of additional flow directions in order to ensure better exchanges and additional nutrients removal through the expulsion via the outlet to improve water quality and sustain ecosystem health. Hence, this study provides useful information necessary to better understand the complex hydrodynamic and mass transport processes in the Tianjing Lake and present a road-map for future management decision-making...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, I {{report on the}} results of a system using tanks filled with {{limestone}} rocks followed by vegetative tank (water hyacinth) to treat sewerage treatment plant (STP) located at Kampung Melayu, Gambang. Removal of heavy metals, ammonia nitrogen, TSS, BOD 5, COD, turbidity from municipal wastewater has been studied. Based on the results, it shows pH, BOD 5, Cu, Zn, Fe and Pb tested comply with Standard B in Environmental Quality Act, 1979 but <b>COD,</b> <b>Mn</b> and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) were greater than Standard B. It was indicated that the concentrations of five heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn) in the wastewater were rather low. After the treatment with limestone and water hyacinth, all these stated parameters comply with Standard B with overall percentage removal were ranged from 30. 43 %, to 99. 39 %. The result demonstrates that limestone was more effective in contaminant removal in STP but if it was combined together it is such a good combination. i [Jhilik organic pollutants, met al do not undergo • 4 egadation arid generally need to be removed through highly expensive clean-up methods. The effectiveness of heavy metals removal from municipal wastewater was high, except for manganese with removal of 6718 %. The other metals undergo removals ranged from 7. 25 % to 99. 39 %. The most effective parameter treated was zinc with the fastest optimum contact time which is 3 days with 87. 44 % for limestone and 94. 22 for water hyacinth tank. Analysis of effectiveness of metals removal during wastewater treatment processes undoubtedly indicates the fundamental role of limestone and constructed wetland with vegetative (water hyacinth) in metals removal...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} and define the processes that affect the variability of the chemical composition of Supraśl river water at selected measuring points. One of the recognized multivariate statistical methods was used for identification. The research area covered the Suprasl river. Four measuring points were selected on the river – Michałowo, Gródek, Nowodworce, Dzikie. The measuring points were selected in such a way to take into account the impact of the most intense interaction located along the river. Changes in concentration were determined on the basis of monthly analyzes of water samples collected from the Supraśl river in 2003 – 2012 by the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection (RIEP) in Białystok. The analyses were performed in the RIEP laboratory in Bialystok, which has implemented and maintained a management system that meets the requirements of the norm PN-EN ISO/IEC  17025 + Ap. 1 : 2007 approved by the certificate AB 165. The water samples were subject to determinations of dissolved oxygen concentration, BOD 5, <b>COD</b> <b>Mn,</b> COD Cr, NH 3, N-NH 4 +, N Kieldahl, NO 3 -, N-NO 3 -, NO 2 -, N-NO 2 -, N tot., PO 4 3 -, P tot and electrical conductivity value. The monthly sum of precipitation was read based on data from the Weather Service “IMGW-PIB Monitor”. The research and analysis results allowed to identify the self-cleaning, nitrification, and de-nitrification processes, as well as enrichment affecting the variability of the chemical composition of the Supraśl river water. The results from the factor analysis showed some prevailing of enrichment processes over internal changes in the aquatic environment of the Supraśl river...|$|E
