500|$|... 150 people protested at the Church of Scientology {{building}} in Sydney, Australia, carrying signs and wearing costumes. Participants were masked {{to maintain their}} anonymity and avoid possible retaliation from the Church of Scientology. Protesters chanted [...] "Church on the left, cult on the right" [...] (in reference to the Church that was beside the Church of Scientology building), [...] "Religion is free" [...] and [...] "We want Xenu". Scientology staff locked down the building {{and set up a}} camera to record the event. After the protest in Sydney, a surge in online Internet traffic due to individuals attempting to view pictures from the protest crashed hundreds of websites when a server was overloaded. The Sydney protest {{was one of the first}} worldwide, and after the first images of the protest went online a surge in traffic drove the hosting company's bandwidth usage up by 900 percent. The hosting company Digitalis temporarily prevented access to hundreds of its clients' sites, and <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representative</b> Denis Kukic said the surge was unexpected: [...] "We had no advance notice that there was going to be a sudden surge of traffic or that there would be more than 100 times the average traffic that this customer's website normally consumes." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Live Chat Support a web visitor seeks assistance, a text {{chat session}} is started by {{clicking}} on a link on the provider's website. The <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representative</b> {{interacts with the}} web visitor, understands the requirements, resolves the query and closes the interaction. Alternatively, based on the requirements the <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representative</b> could also trigger a chat session with the web visitor. Livechat support assists with language barriers as both parties involved in the chat session {{may be able to}} use an online translation service to communicate. It is also considered less intrusive than phone support. Livechat support is often used for lead generation and fulfillment, campaign management, pre-sales and post-sales enquiries, complaint registration, tech support etc.|$|E

Steiner begins his study of algorithms on Wall Street in the 1980s [...] but also provides examples from other industries. For example, he explains the history of Pandora Radio {{and the use of}} algorithms in music identification. He expresses concern that such use of algorithms may lead to the homogenization of music over time. Steiner also discusses the algorithms that eLoyalty (now owned by Mattersight Corporation following divestiture of the technology) was created by dissecting 2 million speech patterns and can now identify a caller's personality style and direct the caller with a compatible <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representative.</b>|$|E

40|$|Athough {{firms have}} {{invested}} significant resources in implementing enterprise software systems (ESS) to modernize and integrate their business process infrastructure, customer satisfaction with ESS has remained an understudied phenomenon. In this exploratory research study, we investigate <b>customer</b> satisfaction for <b>support</b> services of ESS {{and focus on}} employee skills and customer heterogeneity. We analyze archival customer satisfaction data from 170 real-world customer service encounters of a leading ESS vendor. Our analysis indicates that the technical and behavioral skills of <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representatives</b> {{play a major role}} in influencing overall customer satisfaction with ESS support services. We find that the effect of technical skills on customer satisfaction is moderated by behavioral skills. We also find that the technical skills of the support personnel are valued more by repeat customers than by new customers. We discuss the implications of these findings for managing customer heterogeneity in ESS support services and for the allocation and training of ESS support personnel...|$|R
5000|$|Most private {{companies}} in Ireland have no Irish language provision. Tesco Ireland and some SuperValu stores have in-store Irish signage with Tesco rolling out bilingual aisle signage {{in all of}} their stores. Top Oil garages have some Irish language signage in their garages and O'Briens sandwich cafés have Irish language [...] "Fáilte" [...] ("Welcome") signs in their cafés [...] Bank of Ireland ATMs in many places and Samsung phones have an Irish Language option and Meteor has also begun to offer an Irish language voicemail option to its customers. People corresponding with state bodies can send and receive correspondence in Irish or English although this provision is not complete in some semi-state companies yet. The ESB, Irish Rail/Iarnród Éireann and Irish Water/Uisce Éireann have Irish-speaking <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representatives</b> and offer both Irish and English language options on their phone lines, along with written communication in both languages. The Emergency response number 112 or 999 also have agents who deal with emergency calls in both languages.

5000|$|Although Lean IT {{typically}} entails particular {{principles and}} methods such as value streams and value-stream mapping, Lean IT is, on a higher level, a philosophy rather than a prescribed metric or process methodology. In this way, Lean IT is pragmatic and agnostic. It seeks incremental waste reduction and value enhancement, {{but it does not}} require a grand overhaul of an existing process, and is complementary rather than alternative to other methodologies. Typically a grand overhaul is not recommended because of the previously mentioned fragmentation issues. Companies that choose to internally source their developers, reassigning them to software support functions can run into many waste causing scenarios. For example, this can lead to highly skilled employees effectively becoming <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> <b>representatives.</b> The employees previous salary requirements would still need to be met, potentially accumulating millions of dollars in waste. A side effect may be overloading AD teams who need to handle the same amount of development work. Also, since these employees are not usually cross trained with business and/or other specialized IT areas there is a steep learning curve and adjustment period. This can be a primary contributing factor to fragmentation. This can lead to <b>customer</b> <b>support</b> issues actually taking longer to resolve and becoming less efficient, due to constantly searching for or transferring issues to a support team's [...] "expert" [...] in a particular field. Another downside is employee resistance. For example, an employee trained in Java programming who is now <b>supporting</b> <b>customer</b> issues will likely start searching for another job in his/her field. Especially if they are no longer being asked to use their perceived primary skill set.|$|R

However, over the past 14 years most of these positions have faded away due {{to the evolution of}} cloud based services and technology such as Dragon Dictate that have revolutionized transcription. Now, the greatest opportunity to employ individuals with disabilities in at home positions exists within the fields of Customer Service, Sales, and Technology Services; such as Tier I and Tier II <b>support.</b> <b>Customer</b> Service <b>Representatives</b> (CSRs) handling the inbound customer service calls within over 30,000 call centers throughout the country.|$|R
40|$|Technology is a {{critical}} component of modern-day success. Advancements in technology have improved communication between individuals and companies. Technological advancements have allowed students to earn college degrees online. People who habitually use technology expect a high level of performance and support. As new technologies are implemented, such as complex web services or new operating systems, the dependence for information technology (IT) support grows in demand. Even learning curves can be cumbersome without proper assistance from IT professionals. Companies and institutions must accommodate user needs by implementing fast, efficient, and friendly support. In order to offer optimal <b>customer</b> <b>support,</b> <b>representatives</b> must be knowledgeable of the products and services that are supported. At Western Kentucky University’s (WKU) IT Helpdesk, a training program called Consultant Accelerated Development and Education in Technology (CADET) focuses on software, hardware, customer service, and procedures mandated by the IT Division. Prior to CADET, the Student Certification program was used to train student consultants. The Student Certification program was developed to satisfy training needs that allowed consultants to support end-user technical issues. CADET was developed in 2008 to replace the Student Certification program. This study explored the question if CADET training is more effective in preparing consultants to do their jobs than the Student Certification program. The study investigated the effectiveness of CADET training compared to the Student Certification program by surveying IT Helpdesk student consultants. The survey results indicated which program was more adequate. Both programs contained the same training content, but training delivery methods differed. A t-test was used to compare both programs and determine the outcome of the study’s hypotheses. The Student Certification program did not accommodate different learning styles. The teaching methods only included traditional classroom-style delivery. CADET training did accommodate different learning styles, delivering training through a wide variety of formats including video, audio, assessment, assignment, and face-to-face training. The research focused on the importance of addressing different learning behaviors. The study suggested that CADET is more adequate in preparing students to do their job duties. When both Student Certification survey and the CADET survey were compared, CADET training is more adequate in 26 out of the 27 training sessions. The results suggested that learning style accommodation is directly related in the success in the CADET training program over the Student Certification program...|$|R

40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>support</b> is an {{essential}} element in the successful marketing of many products – from domestic appliances to high-tech computer networks.

40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>support,</b> such as {{equipment}} maintenance and repair, {{is an essential}} element in the successful marketing {{of a wide range}} of products, from computer systems to domestic appliances.
