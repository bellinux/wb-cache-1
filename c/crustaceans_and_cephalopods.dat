5|$|The winghead shark usually hunts {{close to}} the sea floor. Its diet {{consists}} mainly of small bony fishes, followed by <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus blochii, Heteronybelinia heteromorphi, Otobothrium carcharidis, O. mugilis, Phoreiobothrium puriensis, and Phyllobothrium blochii, the nematodes Hysterothylacium ganeshi, Pseudanisakis sp., Raphidascaroides blochii, and Terranova sp., the copepod Caligus furcisetifer, and the protozoan Eimeria zygaenae.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{the shallow}} coastal {{waters of the}} central and western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> It gives birth to live young, with the {{developing}} embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6 to 25 pups; depending on region, birthing may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8–11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Endangered in 2016, as it {{is thought to have}} declined in some parts of its range due to overfishing.|$|E

50|$|The diet of {{the grey}} {{sharpnose}} shark consists of <b>crustaceans,</b> fishes, <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The diet {{includes}} fish, polychaetes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>cephalopods,</b> often {{members of}} its own species.|$|R
5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. <b>Crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods</b> are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods,</b> although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopod</b> molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|R

40|$|Based on four {{bottom trawl}} surveys (2006 – 2007) in the Taiwan Strait, nekton species composition, biomass and density distribution, {{dominant}} species, and community characteristics were analyzed. We recorded 373 nektonic species including 273 fish species, 81 <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> 19 <b>cephalopods.</b> The mean biomass density {{index of the}} study area was estimated to be 24. 91 kg/h with fish species, <b>crustacean</b> species <b>and</b> <b>cephalopod</b> species accounting for 65. 6 %, 21. 1 % and 13. 3 % of the total, respectively. Dominant species includedTrichiurus japonicus, Portunus haanii, Parargyrops edita, Harpadon nehereus, Trachurus japonicus and Loligo beka. Shannon-Wiener diversity indices (H') ranged from 1. 45 to 3. 21, with an average of 2. 47 and were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Compared with historical data, nekton resources are obviously declining, with species richness decreasing especially in the Minnan-Taiwan Bank area. Dominant species also exhibited a preponderance of smaller size and age classes compared to historical data...|$|R
25|$|Colour change permits {{camouflage}} against different backgrounds. In {{the context}} of deception, this {{can be used as}} a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and mating. Colour change is made possible by chromatophores; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> Inside the chromatophore cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.|$|E
25|$|Carangoides is a genus of {{tropical}} to subtropical marine fishes in the jack family, Carangidae. They are small- to large-sized, deep-bodied fish characterised {{by a certain}} gill raker and jaw morphology, often appearing very similar to jacks in the genus Caranx. They inhabit the subtropical and tropical regions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, often occupying coastal areas, including reefs, bays, and estuaries, rarely venturing far offshore. They are all predatory fishes, taking a variety of smaller fishes, <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods</b> as prey. The genus was first erected in 1851 by Pieter Bleeker for an unknown taxon and currently contains 21 species. Many make up significant proportions of various fisheries, although a number of ciguatera cases {{have been attributed to}} them.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} (Caranx ruber) (also {{known as the}} carbonero, red jack, blue-striped cavalla and passing jack) is a common species of inshore marine fish {{classified}} in the jack family, Carangidae. The bar jack is distributed through the western Atlantic Ocean from New Jersey and Bermuda in the north to Venezuela and possibly Brazil in the south, with the largest population in the Gulf of Mexico and West Indies. The bar jack is most simply distinguished from similar jacks by its dark horizontal bar which runs along the back and down the caudal fin, often accompanied by an electric blue stripe immediately below it. Other more detailed differences include dentition and soft ray counts. The bar jack is a moderately large species, growing to a recorded maximum of 65cm and a weight of 6.8kg. The species inhabits clear shallow waters, often over coral reefs where it lives either solitarily or in large schools, taking various fishes, <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods</b> as prey. Studies in Cuba indicate spawning occurs between March and August, with sexual maturity reached at 26cm. It is a relatively popular sport fish and can be caught on light tackle {{with a variety of}} lures and baits. It {{is considered to be a}} good food fish, however many recorded ciguatera cases are attributed to the species, with most cases reported on the island of St. Thomas traced to this single species.|$|E
50|$|The duskyshoulder {{trevally}} {{is poorly}} studied in most aspects of its biology {{with the exception}} of its diet. It is a benthic predator, with studies in the Gulf of Carpentaria indicating it preys mostly on various species of small teleost fishes <b>and</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> with particular preference for brachyurans. Other less commonly taken prey include penaeid prawns, other <b>crustaceans,</b> molluscs, <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> Nothing is known of the movements or reproduction in the species.|$|R
50|$|Like other hammerheads, the {{scalloped}} bonnethead is viviparous, with presumably 2 pups per litter. The {{young are}} born at 23 cm or above; an adolescent male {{has been recorded}} at 51 cm long, and an adult at 67 cm. It may be taken by local inshore fisheries, but data is lacking. It feeds {{on or near the}} bottom, on mobile <b>crustaceans</b> <b>and</b> molluscs, <b>cephalopods,</b> echinoderms, <b>and</b> bony fishes.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of total mercury in fish, <b>crustacean</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopod</b> from Adriatic Sea, was investigated. The highest concentrations {{were observed in}} decreasing order in: Norway lobster (0. 97 +/- 0. 24 mg/kg; mean +/- SE), European hake (0. 59 +/- 0. 14 mg/kg), red mullet (0. 48 +/- 0. 09 mg/kg), blue whiting (0. 38 +/- 0. 09 mg/kg), Atlantic mackerel (0. 36 +/- 0. 08 mg/kg) and European flying squid (0. 25 +/- 0. 03 mg/kg). A significant difference (p < 0. 01) {{was found between the}} levels of total mercury in Norway lobster and those detected in all other species. The 25 % of all samples exceeded the maximum limit fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881 / 2006. The results show that fish and fishery products can exceed the maximum levels and stress the need of more information for consumers in particular for people that eat large amount of fish.

500|$|Nursehounds have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{generally}} hide inside small holes during the day, often associating {{with other members}} of its species. A benthic predator, it feeds on a range of bony fishes, smaller sharks, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> Like other catsharks, the nursehound is oviparous in reproduction. Females deposit large, thick-walled egg cases, two at a time, from March to October, securing them to bunches of seaweed. The eggs take 712 months to hatch. Nursehounds are marketed as food in several European countries under various names, including [...] "flake", [...] "catfish", [...] "rock eel", and [...] "rock salmon". It was once also valued for its rough skin (called [...] "rubskin"), which was used as an abrasive. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the nursehound as Near Threatened, as its population in the Mediterranean Sea seems to have declined substantially from overfishing.|$|E
500|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} feeds on bony and cartilaginous fishes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods.</b> Its capacious mouth allows sizeable prey to be swallowed, with one documented {{case of a}} [...] long individual consuming a [...] long brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum). During daytime, this species is an opportunistic ambush predator. It preys upon schooling nocturnal fishes such as squirrelfishes, soldierfishes, and sweepers that often shelter in the same cave. Tiny fishes and crustaceans have been seen settling atop the resting wobbegong's head, attracting larger fishes that are in turn attacked by the wobbegong. Observations in captivity have further revealed that this species seems to engage in active luring behavior. When it perceives food nearby, it begins to slowly wave its tail back and forth; its caudal fin resembles a small fish, complete with a dark eyespot at the base. The shark typically rests with its head elevated, which places it {{within striking distance of}} any prey drawn by its tail.|$|E

[...] Similarities between decapod and vertebrate stress systems and behavioral responses to noxious stimuli were given as additional evidence for the capacity of decapods to experience pain.|$|E
2500|$|Figaro is a genus of catshark, {{and part}} of the family Scyliorhinidae. Until 2008, Figaro was {{generally}} considered to be a subgenus of Galeus (sawtail catsharks). The two known species are found off Australia, inhabiting deep, offshore waters on or near the bottom. Figaro contains small, slender, firm-bodied sharks that bear distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny dermal denticles along the dorsal and ventral edges of their short caudal fins. The caudal peduncle is relatively long, such as that the anal and caudal fins are some distance apart. In adult males, the inner margins of the pelvic fins are fused together to form a subtle [...] "apron" [...] over the claspers. F. boardmani is a predator of fishes, <b>crustaceans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cephalopods,</b> and is oviparous; less is known about the F. striatus.
