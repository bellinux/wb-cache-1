Microscopic stress {{distributions}} at an interlaminar {{area in a}} CFRP <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminate</b> {{are analyzed}} three-dimensionally using a homogenization theory in order to investigate microscopic interaction between 0 ˚- and 90 ˚-plies.

Unidirectional composites with bridging matrix cracks and <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> with tunneling cracks in transverse layers and bridging cracks in longitudinal layers are considered. It is shown that bridging matrix cracks dramatically increase damping in unidirectional CMC due to a dissipation of energy along damaged sections of the fiber–matrix interface (interfacial friction). Such friction is absent {{in the case of}} tunneling cracks in transverse layers of <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> where the changes in damping due to a degradation of the stiffness remain small.

40|$|A very {{important}} aspect of a composite manufacturing process is the appearance of residual strains and stresses during the curing cycle.

This paper presents the thermoelastic degradation of general <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates,</b> containing transverse ply cracks, subjected to biaxial extension, bending and thermal loading. The stress and displacement fields are calculated by using the state space equation method [Zhang D, Ye JQ, Sheng HY. Free-edge and ply cracking effect in <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminated</b> composites under uniform extension and thermal loading. Compos Struct [in press]. ]. By this approach, a laminated plate may be composed of an arbitrary number of orthotropic layers, each of which may have different material properties and thickness. The method takes into account all independent material constants and guarantees continuous fields of all interlaminar stresses across interfaces between material layers. After introducing the concept of the effective thermoelastic properties of a laminate, the degradations of axial elastic moduli, Poisson¿s ratios, thermal expansion coefficients and flexural moduli are predicted and compared with numerical results from other methods or available test results. It is found that the theory provides good predictions of the stiffness degradation in both symmetric and antisymmetric <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates.</b> The predictions of stiffness reduction in nonsymmetric <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> can be used as benchmark test for other methods...|$|R

30|$|From the {{literature}} survey, {{it appears that}} the failure of structural components because of bending loads much more often than the in-plane loads; little work effort has been dedicated so far for development of the theoretical or numerical models for predicting boundary layer effects of bending of structural laminates. For this reason, the present study deals with the analytical solution of interlaminar stresses near free edges of a general cross-ply composite laminate subjected to a bending moment. Beginning from the general form of the displacement field for long laminates and making logical hypotheses in joining with physical behavior of a <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminate,</b> the displacement field is significantly decreased. A LWT is utilizing to analyze the bending problem of a <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminate</b> with free edges by employing the simplified displacement field. The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is then employed to determine the unknown coefficients in the reduced displacement field. To show the accuracy of the LWT results, the elasticity solution of this problem is developed for a special set of boundary conditions.|$|E

Three independent glass fibre/epoxy laminate configurations, namely cross, quasi-isotropic, and woven, plies were investigated.

The addition of urethane to the matrix in the transverse plies alone increased the applied strains necessary for the initiation and development of transverse cracking during the extension of <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates.</b> This resulted in a smaller reduction in laminate stiffness (due to damage) at a prescribed level of strain. Damage resistance was similar to that in <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> with urethane additions to the matrix in both the transverse and longitudinal plies (a uniform matrix laminate). It was found that urethane additions lead to improved damage resistance in <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates</b> because they lower the transverse ply modulus and increase the matrix toughness in the transverse ply. During the extension of <b>cross-ply</b> <b>laminates,</b> stable (constrained) transverse cracking was observed in thin transverse plies and unstable (brittle) transverse cracking in thick transverse plies.

The ultimate properties of hybrid matrix laminates, having improved damage resistance, were expected to be better than uniform matrix laminates with a similar urethane content in the matrix.
