40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a leading}} cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The recurrence of HCC after curative treatments is currently a major hurdle. Identification of subsets of patients with distinct prognosis provides an opportunity to tailor therapeutic approaches as well as to select the patients with specific sub-phenotypes for targeted therapy. Thus, the development of gene expression profiles to improve the prediction of HCC prognosis is important for HCC management. Although several gene signatures have been evaluated for the prediction of HCC prognosis, there is no consensus on the predictive power of these signatures. Using systematic approaches to evaluate these signatures and combine them with clinicopathologic information may provide more accurate prediction of HCC prognosis.

Certain large-scale forecast-errors were found to persist from day-to-day in fairly localized geographical areas. In general, the numerical prognoses exhibited a tendency to forecast excessively high values off the southeastern coasts and excessively low values off the northwestern coasts of the continents. Little forecast-error was observed in the continental interiors. A Fourier analysis revealed that the forecast-errors were largely due to incorrect phase fore-casts for wave numbers I through 4. The forecast-errors associated with wave number I usually "positioned " the large-scale systematic forecast-errors near Japan and Scandinavia and contributed materially to their intensities.

5000|$|The {{ensemble}} forecast {{is usually}} evaluated {{by comparing the}} average of the individual forecasts for one forecast variable to the observed value of that variable (the [...] "error").

The total extent of thoracic injury, Penetrating Thoracic Trauma Index (PTTI), was measured. When associated abdominal injury was present, it was assessed by the Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI) of Moore et al. The severity of total injury sustained by the patient, represented by the Penetrating Trauma Index (PTI), {{was determined by the}} sum total of these scores. The extent of physiologic abnormality induced by cardiac penetration, (Physiologic Index or PI), was graded on a scale of increasing severity from 5 - 20 based on the vital signs of patients on admission. Analysis of 112 patients with penetrating cardiac injuries (1973 - 1983) revealed that the indices, PCTI and PI, showed an excellent correlation with survival (R 2 = 0. 827 and 0. 928, respectively) as did the total extent of trauma (PTI).

The authors of this study used clinical and pathological data recorded on 1483 patients in the Fabry Outcome Survey, a large international registry, to develop a prognostic severity score. Methods Parameters relevant to disease progression or outcome were initially selected, using variables that are readily available in clinical practice. Individual end points for renal, cardiac, neurological disease, and death were selected, and a composite end point developed. Potential prognostic variables were correlated with each end point, before multivariate analysis. Variables retaining significance were then used to construct organ specific and <b>composite</b> <b>prognostic</b> scores. KaplaneMeier (KM) analysis, according to score, was performed for each end point.

We developed a prediction model for 1 -year change in the six minute walk distance (6 MWD) among DMD patients, and compared its predictive value to that of commonly used prognostic factors (age, baseline 6 MWD, and steroid use). Natural history {{data were collected from}} DMD patients at routine follow up visits approximately every 6 months over the course of 2 - 5 years. Assessments included ambulatory function and steroid use. The annualized change in 6 MWD (Δ 6 MWD) was studied between all pairs of visits separated by 8 - 16 months. Prediction models were developed using multivariable regression for repeated measures, and evaluated using cross-validation. Among n = 191 follow-up intervals (n = 39 boys), mean starting age was 9. 4 years, mean starting 6 MWD was 351. 8 meters, and 75 % had received steroids for at least one year. Over the subsequent 8 - 16 months, mean Δ 6 MWD was - 37. 0 meters with a standard deviation (SD) of 93. 7 meters. Predictions based on a composite of age, baseline 6 MWD, and steroid use explained 28 % of variation in Δ 6 MWD (R 2 = 0. 28, residual SD = 79. 4 meters). A broadened prognostic model, adding timed 10 -meter walk/run, 4 -stair climb, and rise from supine, as well as height and weight, significantly improved prediction, explaining 59 % of variation in Δ 6 MWD after cross-validation (R 2 = 0. 59, residual SD = 59. 7 meters).

The theoretical development of the so-called "geostrophic model" used, the research procedure, {{and a number of}} illustrative charts are all discussed and a table of chart verification scores is presented to assist in the reader's evaluation of the method. It is concluded that this method does provide a simple prognostic procedure which includes some intensity change for systems. The results showed an average of 24. 9 per cent improvement over persistence for the charts analyzed using a height-gradient verification scheme. Appendix I outlines the specific procedure for utilizing the method on a practical basis and is included as such for the convenience of potential users.
