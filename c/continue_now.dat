6000|$|But will {{immigration}} <b>continue</b> <b>now</b> {{that the}} Jew of the Pale {{has been turned}} at a stroke into the free citizen of a democratic country? Probably it will actually increase, for the Pale has been ravaged as well as liberated during the war, and the Jews of Germany have based an ingenious policy on this prospect, which is expounded thus by Dr. Davis-Trietsch of Berlin[45]: ...|$|E

60|$|Moreover, to a man--not {{excluding}} Jeremy Pitt himself, {{in whose}} blood {{the call of}} the sea was insistent and imperative--those who had escaped with Peter Blood from the Barbados plantations, and who, consequently, like himself, knew not whither to turn, were all resolved upon joining the great Brotherhood of the Coast, as those rovers called themselves.

6000|$|... "Now, Betty, don't get excited. We {{are getting}} from the question. Why are you not civil to Clarke?" [...] asked Col. Zane. She did not answer {{and after a moment}} he continued. [...] "If there is {{anything}} about Clarke that I do not know and that I should know I want you to tell me. Personally I like the fellow. I am not saying that to make you think you ought to like him because I do. You might not care for him at all, but that would be no good reason for your actions. Betty, in these frontier settlements a man is soon known for his real worth. Every one at the Fort liked Clarke. The youngsters adored him. Jessie liked him very much. You know he and Isaac became good friends. I think he acted like a man to-day. I saw the look Miller gave him. I don't like this fellow Miller, anyway. Now, I am taking the trouble to tell you my side of the argument. It {{is not a question of}} your liking Clarke--that is none of my affair.
