40|$|Objective The authors {{aimed to}} analyze and compare treat-ments of {{schizophrenia}} in Poznan and Lviv to present the potential differences between Poland and Ukraine in pharma-cotherapy and economic availability of medicines, to empha-size the role of academic centers in the effective treatment of schizophrenia, and to raise the awareness of residents about economics {{and the cost of}} inpatient care. Methods The analysis was based on 307 hospital records of patients treated in 2010 and 2011 and data from the hospital accounting department. Per the inclusion criteria, 108 adult patients (50 in Poznan and 58 in Lviv) were enrolled in the study. Monetary values were <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> euros (<b>EUR)</b> at the rate published by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) o...|$|R

[...] L-tyrosine in turn is <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> L-DOPA, which is further <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> dopamine, {{norepinephrine}} (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline).

The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> N-methylphenethylamine. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin.|$|R
