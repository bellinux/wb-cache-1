This {{has led to}} the development of modular multifunctional 3 -D electronic packages. The reported research work (funded by the European Commission) involves the investigation of thermal solutions to a proposed 3 D package design. As a first step preceding the integration of mini heat pipes to the package, thermal characterization of a three layer 3 D package (aluminum substrate representative for AlSiC- Metal Matrix Composite) is done employing liquid <b>circulation</b> <b>cooling.</b> In the second step, thermal response of a 1 mm single substrate layer integrated with mini copper-water cylindrical heat pipes (OD: 3 mm) is investigated. The experimental results are successfully compared with appropriate mathematical simulations. System simulation of the entire 3 D structure for liquid circulation as well as integrated heat pipes is done using Fluent/Icepack software. Safe operation is possible up to 30 W heating power input (10 W per layer). While thermal diffusion through the substrate is sufficient for heat transfer from chip to the substrate, mini heat pipes or liquid <b>circulation</b> <b>cooling</b> are essential to cool the substrate itself. Interlayer thermal interactions also affect the response of stacked 3 D packages.

Recent studies of the wellconstrained Nankai margin of Japan show that hydrothermal circulation in the subducting crust cools the subduction zone and widens the area of the plate boundary fault that is between the key temperatures of 150 and 350 °C. Here, I present new thermal models for the Cascadia subduction zone that include the effects of fluid flow in the subducting crust. This fluid <b>circulation</b> <b>cools</b> the subduction zone and widens the thermally-defined seismogenic zone by shifting the intersection of the 350 °C isotherm within the plate boundary fault ~ 30 – 55 km landward. In contrast to the Nankai margin, the observed surface heat flux pattern for the thickly sedimented Cascadia margin provides only a weak constraint on subduction zone temperature. The tomographically-determined basalt-to-eclogite transition in the subducting slab is an additional constraint on the Cascadia subduction zone thermal models. The model...|$|R

Due to its passive nature the reliability of these systems is very high. That is the reason natural <b>circulation</b> <b>cooling</b> has been considered in advanced reactor core cooling and in engineered safety systems. Natural <b>circulation</b> <b>cooling</b> has been proposed to remove reactor decay heat by external vessel cooling for in-vessel core retention and for external core catcher cooling during sever accident scenario. First a scaling analysis was carried out for natural circulation flow in a closed loop. Based on the scaling analyses simulation of steam-water natural circulation is carried out with air-water flow in an inclined rectangular channel. The heat flux corresponding to the decay heat is simulated with air flux to the test section to produce equivalent flow quality. Design calculations were carried out for typical core catcher design to estimate the expected natural circulation rates. The natural circulation flow rate {{of the water and}} two-phase pressure drop were obtained for different air injection rate expressed as void fraction for a select downcomer pipe size.

40|$|Investigation on non {{uniform flow}} {{behavior}} among U-tube in steam generator during natural <b>circulation</b> <b>cooling</b> {{has been conducted}} using RELAP 5. The investigation is performed by modeling the steam generator into multi channel models, i. e. 9 -tubes model. Two situations are implemented, high pressure and low pressure cases. Using partial model, the calculation simulates situation similar to the natural circulation test performed in LSTF. The imposed boundary conditions are flow rate, quality, pressure of the primary side, feed water temperature, steam generator liquid level, and pressure in the secondary side. Calculation result shows that simulation using model with nine tubes is capable to capture important non-uniform phenomena such as reverse flow, fill-and-dump, and stagnant vertical stratification. As a result of appropriate simulation of non uniform flow, the calculated steam generator outlet flow in the primary loop is stable as observed in the experiments. The results also clearly indicate the importance of simulation of non-uniform flow in predicting both the flow stability and heat transfer between the primary and secondary side.

A {{steady-state}} {{model of the}} thermo-hydraulic behavior of a simplified natural <b>circulation</b> <b>cooled</b> BWR setup has been derived. An asymmetric power distribution in the core leads to asymmetric boifing boundaries in the core and small differences in flow-rate in the core-channels. However, the natural circulation is mainly driven by density differences between the riser section and the downcomer section, keeping the differences in flow-rate small. The time dependent flow-rate in the core-channels has been measured by means of LDA during unstable conditions of the CIRCUS facility, a steam-water simulator op-erating at 1. 2 bar. Various asymmetric power distributions (leading to a difference in specific energy at the core exit up to 1 M J / k g) have been studied under several core inlet temperatures, ranging from 98 °C- 102 °C. Increasing inlet temperature and total power leads to a destabilizing of CIRCUS at the particular points measured.
