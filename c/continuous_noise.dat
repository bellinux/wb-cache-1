5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and <b>continuous</b> <b>noise,</b> so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E

Outside, all round, the wide open country--grass and tilled land and hedges and hedgerow elms--is spread out before them.

60|$|In two {{families}} of the Homoptera and {{in three of the}} Orthoptera, the males alone possess sound-producing organs in an efficient state. These are used incessantly during the breeding-season, not only for calling the females, but apparently for charming or exciting them in rivalry with other males. No one who admits the agency of selection of any kind, will, after reading the above discussion, dispute that these musical instruments have been acquired through sexual selection. In four other Orders the members of one sex, or more commonly of both sexes, are provided with organs for producing various sounds, which apparently serve merely as call-notes. When both sexes are thus provided, the individuals which were able to make the loudest or most <b>continuous</b> <b>noise</b> would gain partners before those which were less noisy, so that their organs have probably been gained through sexual selection. It is instructive to reflect on the wonderful diversity of the means for producing sound, possessed by the males alone, or by both sexes, in no less than six Orders. We thus learn how effectual sexual selection has been in leading to modifications which sometimes, as with the Homoptera, relate to important parts of the organisation.|$|E

6000|$|Three lasses {{came from}} the palace to do our washing and racket with Ah Fu. They were of the lowest class, hangers-on kept for the {{convenience}} of merchant skippers, probably low-born, perhaps out- islanders, with little refinement whether of manner or appearance, but likely and jolly enough wenches in their way. We called one Guttersnipe, for you may find her image in the slums of any city; the same lean, dark-eyed, eager, vulgar face, the same sudden, hoarse guffaws, the same forward and yet anxious manner, as with a tail of an eye on the policeman: only the policeman here was a live king, and his truncheon a rifle. I doubt if you could find anywhere out of the islands, or often there, the parallel of Fatty, a mountain of a girl, who must have weighed near as many stones as she counted summers, could have given a good account of a life- guardsman, had the face of a baby, and applied her vast mechanical forces almost exclusively to play. But they were all three of the same merry spirit. Our washing was conducted in a game of romps; and they fled and pursued, and splashed, and pelted, and rolled each other in the sand, and kept up a <b>continuous</b> <b>noise</b> of cries and laughter like holiday children. Indeed, and however strange their own function in that austere establishment, were they not escaped for the day from the largest and strictest Ladies' School in the South Seas? ...|$|E
60|$|For ten minutes, perhaps, I {{had heard}} from somewhere before me in the wood a strange, <b>continuous</b> <b>noise,</b> as of clucking, cooing, and gobbling, now and again {{interrupted}} by a harsh scream. As I advanced towards this noise, it began to grow lighter about me, and I caught sight, through the trees, of sundry gables and enclosure walls, and something like the tops of a rickyard. And sure enough, a rickyard it proved to be, and a neat little farm-steading, with the beech-woods growing almost {{to the door of}} it. Just before me, however, as I came up the path, the trees drew back and let in a wide flood of daylight on to a circular lawn. It was here that the noises had their origin. More than a score of peacocks (there are altogether thirty at the farm), a proper contingent of peahens, and a great multitude that I could not number of more ordinary barn-door fowls, were all feeding together on this little open lawn among the beeches. They fed in a dense crowd, which swayed to and fro, and came hither and thither as by a sort of tide, and of which the surface was agitated like the surface of a sea as each bird guzzled his head along the ground after the scattered corn. The clucking, cooing noise that had led me thither was formed by the blending together of countless expressions of individual contentment into one collective expression of contentment, or general grace during meat. Every now and again a big peacock would separate himself from the mob and take a stately turn or two about the lawn, or perhaps mount for a moment upon the rail, and there shrilly publish to the world his satisfaction with himself and what he had to eat. It happened, for my sins, that none of these admirable birds had anything beyond the merest rudiment of a tail. Tails, it seemed, were out of season just then. But they had their necks for all that; and by their necks alone they do as much surpass all the other birds of our grey climate as they fall in quality of song below the blackbird or the lark. Surely the peacock, with its incomparable parade of glorious colour and the scrannel voice of it issuing forth, as in mockery, from its painted throat, must, like my landlady's butterflies at Great Missenden, have been invented by some skilful fabulist for the consolation and support of homely virtue: or rather, perhaps, by a fabulist not quite so skilful, who made points for the moment without having a studious enough eye to the complete effect; for I thought these melting greens and blues so beautiful that afternoon, that I would have given them my vote just then before the sweetest pipe in all the spring woods. For indeed there is no piece of colour of the same extent in nature, that will so flatter and satisfy the lust of a man's eyes; and to come upon so many of them, after these acres of stone-coloured heavens and russet woods, and grey-brown ploughlands and white roads, was like going three whole days' journey to the southward, or a month back into the summer.|$|E

50|$|OAEs are {{considered}} {{to be related to the}} amplification function of the cochlea. In the absence of external stimulation, the activity of the cochlear amplifier increases, leading to the production of sound.

The hearing thresholds of the groups were measured by a puretone audiometer three times in two workdays. None of the groups showed {{significant differences between the}} hearing thresholds measured in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. Group 1 with the shortest duration of exposure and group 2 with the intermediate duration of exposure to impulse noise had the highest thresholds at 6000 Hz in both ears.

40|$|Abstract â This paper {{represents}} {{our recent}} experimental measurement {{study of the}} complex noise in industrial fields, using a novel acoustic detection system and wavelet transform algorithms. Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) continues {{to be one of}} the most prevalent occupational hazards in the United States. Number of research on NIHL showed a complex noise could produce more hearing loss than an energy-equivalent <b>continuous</b> or impulsive <b>noise</b> alone. Many workplaces in varied industries are subjected to the high level complex noise (i. e., high-level impulsive <b>noise</b> mixed with <b>continuous</b> Gaussian <b>noise).</b> The current noise measurement guidelines and devices (e. g., conventional sound level meters) are based on the equal energy hypothesis (EEH), which states that loss of hearing by exposure to noise is proportional to the total acoustic energy of the exposure. However, the EEH does not accurately rate the impulsive noise and the complex noise. Therefore, th...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{measurement}} of the temporal resolution factor (TRF). The major merits of this measurement are that it is simple enough to be used clinically and that the results are, within certain limits, independent of presentation level. Addition of a <b>continuous</b> background <b>noise</b> has been suggested to enhance the discriminative power of TRF between normal-hearing listeners and listeners with poor temporal resolution. However, we showed through a simple model that this background noise may introduce a strong dependence on presentation level, which {{must be taken into}} consideration. To test our model we developed a new measurement protocol. This protocol was applied in measurements of 5 normal-hearing and 9 sensorineurally hearing-impaired listeners. Their results could reasonably well be fitted by the model. The model predicts large measurement errors for TRF values determined with background noise. We found the standard deviations of TRF values, calculated from test and retest measurements, to be smaller in conditions without a <b>continuous</b> background <b>noise.</b> In addition, our results did not show the predicted enhancement in discriminative power between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Therefore, the primary conclusion is that the determination of the TRF is not improved by adding a background nois...|$|R
