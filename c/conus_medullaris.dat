500|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{results from}} a lesion below {{the level at which}} the spinal cord splits into the cauda equina, at levels L2–S5 below the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. Unlike in <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor. [...] Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.|$|E
500|$|<b>Conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> {{syndrome}} is {{an injury to}} the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults. This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury. [...] In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted. Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> (Latin for [...] "medullary cone") or conus terminalis is the tapered, {{lower end}} of the spinal cord. It occurs near lumbar {{vertebral}} levels 1 (L1) and 2 (L2), occasionally lower. The upper end of the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> is usually not well defined.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} spine-related injury cauda equina syndrome. [...] It is also seen in <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> {{the difference is that}} it is symmetrical in <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> and asymmetric in cauda equina.It may also occur as a temporary side-effect of a sacral extra-dural injection: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{pia mater}} that {{surrounds}} the spinal cord, however, projects directly downward, forming a slender filament called the filum terminale, which connects the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> {{to the back of}} the coccyx. The filum terminale provides a connection between the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> and the coccyx which stabilizes the entire spinal cord.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a collection}} of signs and symptoms associated with injury to the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> [...] It typically causes back pain and bowel and bladder dysfunction but weakness and sensory loss is uncommon. Comparatively, cauda equina syndrome may cause radicular pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia and lower extremity weakness {{at the level of the}} lumbar and sacral roots.|$|E
50|$|The most {{inferior}} of {{the spinal}} nerves, the coccygeal nerve leaves {{the spinal cord}} {{at the level of}} the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> superior to the filum terminale. However, adhering to the outer surface of the filum terminale are a few strands of nerve fibres which probably represent rudimentary second and third coccygeal nerves. Furthermore, the central canal of the spinal cord extends 5 to 6 cm beyond the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> downward into the filum terminale.|$|E

The <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> (bottom of the spinal cord) terminates at the level of L1 in adults, but may range in term {{neonates}} (newly born babies) from L1-L3 levels. It is important to insert the spinal needle below the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> at the L3/L4 or L4/L5 interspinous levels. With growth of the spine, the conus typically reaches the adult level (L1) by 2 years of age.|$|E

50|$|The {{spinal cord}} proper terminates {{in a region}} called the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> while the pia mater {{continues}} as an extension called the filum terminale, which anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx. The cauda equina ("horse's tail") {{is a collection of}} nerves inferior to the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> that continue to travel through the vertebral column to the coccyx. The cauda equina forms because the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in sacral spinal nerves originating in the upper lumbar region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminal}} ventricle (ventriculus terminalis, fifth ventricle or ampulla caudalis) is {{the widest}} {{part of the}} central canal of the spinal cord that is located {{at or near the}} <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> [...] It was described by Stilling in 1859 and Krause in 1875. [...] Krause introduced the term fifth ventricle after observation of normal ependymal cells. [...] The central canal expands as a fusiform terminal ventricle, and approximately 8-10 mm in length in the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> (or conus terminalis). Although the terminal ventricle is visible in the fetus and children, it is usually absent in adults.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cauda equina}} (Latin for [...] "horse's tail") is {{a bundle of}} spinal nerves and spinal nerve roots, {{consisting}} of the second through fifth lumbar nerve pairs, the first through fifth sacral nerve pairs, and the coccygeal nerve, all of which arise from the lumbar enlargement and the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> of the spinal cord. The cauda equina occupies the lumbar cistern, a subarachnoid space inferior to the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> The nerves that compose the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips, knees, ankles, feet, internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. In addition, the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and, partially, parasympathetic innervation of the bladder.|$|E
5000|$|Lumbar cistern. It {{extends from}} the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> (L1-L2) to {{about the level of}} the second sacral vertebra. It {{contains}} the filum terminale and the nerve roots of the cauda equina. It is from the cistern that CSF is withdrawn during lumbar puncture.|$|E
50|$|Spinal abnormalities, e.g. {{intramedullary}} dermoid cysts {{may arise}} {{more frequently in}} the lumbosacral region (quite often {{at the level of}} the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris)</b> and may be seen with other congenital anomalies of the spine including posterior spina bifida occulta as identified by the neuroradiological analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{coccygeal}} nerve is the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It {{arises from}} the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> and its anterior root helps form the coccygeal plexus. It does not divide into a medial and lateral branch. It is distributed to the skin {{over the back of}} the coccyx.|$|E
50|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) is {{a serious}} neurologic condition in which damage to the cauda equina causes loss of function of the lumbar plexus (nerve roots) of the spinal canal below the termination (<b>conus</b> <b>medullaris)</b> of the spinal cord. CES is a lower motor neuron lesion.|$|E
5000|$|The filum terminale ("terminal thread"), is a {{delicate}} strand of fibrous tissue, about 20 cm in length, proceeding downward from {{the apex of the}} <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> It is one of the modifications of pia mater. It gives longitudinal support to the spinal cord and consists of two parts: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{is the main}} pathway for {{information}} connecting the brain and peripheral nervous system. Much shorter than its protecting spinal column, the human spinal cord originates in the brainstem, passes through the foramen magnum, and continues through to the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> near the second lumbar vertebra before terminating in a fibrous extension known as the filum terminale.|$|E
50|$|<b>Conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> {{syndrome}} is {{an injury to}} the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12-L2 vertebrae in adults. This region contains the S4-S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury. In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted. Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} part of the {{vertebral}} column, spinal nerves exit directly from the spinal cord, whereas in the lower part of the vertebral column nerves pass further down the column before exiting. The terminal portion of the spinal cord is called the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> The pia mater continues as an extension called the filum terminale, which anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx. The cauda equina (“horse’s tail”) is the name for the collection of nerves in the vertebral column that continue to travel through the vertebral column below the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> The cauda equina forms as a result of the fact that the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in the fact that sacral spinal nerves actually originate in the upper lumbar region. The spinal cord can be anatomically divided into 31 spinal segments based on the origins of the spinal nerves.|$|E
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{is the main}} pathway for {{information}} connecting the brain and peripheral nervous system. The length of the spinal cord is much shorter than {{the length of the}} bony spinal column. The human spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum and continues through to the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> near the second lumbar vertebra, terminating in a fibrous extension known as the filum terminale.|$|E
5000|$|The test {{involves}} monitoring internal/external anal sphincter contraction {{in response}} to squeezing the glans penis or clitoris, or tugging on an indwelling Foley catheter. [...] This reflex can also be tested electrophysiologically, by stimulating the penis or vulva and recording from the anal sphincter. This test modality is used in intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring to verify function of sensory and motor sacral roots {{as well as the}} <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the fetus, {{vertebral}} segments {{correspond with}} spinal cord segments. However, because the vertebral column grows {{longer than the}} spinal cord, spinal cord segments do not correspond to vertebral segments in the adult, particularly in the lower spinal cord. For example, lumbar and sacral spinal cord segments are found between vertebral levels T9 and L2, and the spinal cord ends around the L1/L2 vertebral level, forming a structure known as the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris,</b> {{the canal}} {{contains}} {{a mass of}} nerves (the cauda equina or [...] "horse-tail") that branches off {{the lower end of}} the spinal cord and contains the nerve roots from L1-5 and S1-5. The nerve roots from L4-S4 join in the sacral plexus which affects the sciatic nerve, which travels caudally (toward the feet). Compression, trauma or other damage to this region of the spinal canal can result in cauda equina syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> is {{situated}} below the L2 level {{in more than}} 75% of these diastematomyelia patients. Thickening of the filum terminale is seen in {{over half of the}} cases. While the level of the cleft is variable, it is most commonly found in the lumbar region. The two hemicords usually reunite caudally to the cleft. Occasionally, however, the cleft will extend unusually low and the cord will end with two separate coni medullarae and two fila terminale ("Diplomyelia").|$|E
5000|$|A {{tethered}} cord {{is often}} diagnosed as a [...] "low conus." [...] The <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> (or lower {{termination of the}} spinal cord) normally terminates {{at or above the}} L1-2 disk space (where L1 is the first, or topmost lumbar vertebra). After about 3 months of age, a conus below the L1-2 disk space may indicate a tethered cord and termination below L3-4 is unmistakably tethered. [...] "Cord tethering is often assumed when the conus is below the normal L2-3 level.|$|E
50|$|The reflex is spinal {{mediated}} {{and involves}} S2-S4. The {{absence of the}} reflex in a person with acute paralysis from trauma indicates spinal shock whereas {{the presence of the}} reflex would indicate spinal cord severance. Typically {{this is one of the}} first reflexes to return after spinal shock. Lack of motor and sensory function after the reflex has returned indicates complete SCI. Absence of this reflex in instances where spinal shock is not suspected could indicate a lesion or injury of the <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris</b> or sacral nerve roots.|$|E
50|$|The uterus-like mass (ULM) is a tumorlike {{anatomical}} entity originally {{described in}} the ovary in 1981 and thereafter reported in several locations of the pelvis and abdominal cavity including broad ligament, greater omentum, cervix, small intestine, mesentery and <b>conus</b> <b>medullaris.</b> Basically, it is represented by a miniature uterus comprising a smooth muscle wall lined by endometrium thus outlining a uterus anatomical structure. Some of the reported cases have been associated to urinary tract and internal genitalia malformations whereas others appeared as a solitary finding. The term endomyometriosis has also been applied to this lesion.|$|E
