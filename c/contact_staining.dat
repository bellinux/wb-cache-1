Broad knowledge {{on the relative}} contribution of DNA left behind by different users overtime is of paramount importance. Such information might help crime investigators to robustly evaluate the possibility of detecting a specific (or known) individual's DNA profile based on the type and history of an object. To address this issue, a <b>contact</b> <b>stain</b> simulation-based protocol was designed. Fourteen volunteers either acting as first or second object's users were recruited. The first user was required to regularly handle/wear 9 different items during an 8 - 10 -day period, whilst the second user for 5, 30 and 120 min, in three independent simulation sessions producing a total of 231 stains. Subsequently, the relative DNA profile contribution of each individual pair was investigated. Preliminary results showed a progressive increase of the percentage contribution of the second user compared to the first. Interestingly, the second user generally became the major DNA contributor when most objects were handled/worn for 120 min, Furthermore, the observation of unexpected additional alleles will then prompt the investigation of indirect DNA transfer events...|$|R

Triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed numerous axosomatic, axodendritic, and axoaxonic <b>contacts</b> <b>stained</b> for CCK, PV, and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. The existence of mutual CCK and PV synapses was supported by dual EM immunolabeling. Paired whole-cell recordings detected unitary GABA Aergic synaptic transmission between identified CCK and PV cells, and single CCK cells could transiently inhibit action potential firing of synaptically coupled PV cells. We conclude that the major hippocampal perisomatic-targeting interneurons communicate synaptically. This communication should affect neuronal network activity, including neuronal oscillations, in which the CCK and PV cells have well established roles. The prevalence of CCK and PV networks in other brain regions suggests that internetwork interactions could be generally important...|$|R

Genetic and acquired diseases affecting expression or function of nephrin lead to severe proteinuria and distortion or absence of the slit diaphragm. Here, we showed by using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor that soluble recombinant variants of nephrin, containing the extracellular part of the protein, interact with each other in a specific and concentration-dependent manner. This molecular interaction was increased by twofold in the presence of physiological Ca 2 +concentration, indicating that the binding is not dependent on, but rather promoted by Ca 2 +. Furthermore, transfected HEK 293 cells and an immortalized mouse podocyte cell line overexpressing full-length human nephrin formed cellular aggregates, with cell-cell <b>contacts</b> <b>staining</b> strongly for nephrin. The distance between plasma membranes at the nephrin-containing contact sites was shown by electron microscopy to be 40 to 50 nm, similar to the width of glomerular slit diaphragm. The cell contacts could be dissociated with antibodies reacting with the first two extracellular Ig-like domains of nephrin. Wild-type HEK 293 cells were shown to express slit diaphragm components CD 2 AP, P-cadherin, FAT, and NEPH 1. The results show that nephrin molecules exhibit homophilic interactions that could promote cellular contacts through direct nephrin-nephrin interactions, and that the other slit diaphragm components expressed could contribute to that interaction...|$|R

40|$|Casework samples {{collected}} for forensic DNA analysis can produce genomic mixtures {{in which the}} DNA of the alleged offender is masked by high quantities of DNA coming from the victim. DIP-STRs are novel genetic markers specifically developed to enable the target analysis of a DNA {{of interest in the}} presence of exceeding quantities of a second DNA (up to 1000 -fold). The genotyping system, which is based on allele-specific amplifications of haplotypes formed by a deletion/insertion polymorphism (DIP) and a short tandem repeat (STR), combines the capacity of targeting the DNA of an individual with a strong identification power. Finally, DIP-STRs are autosomal markers therefore they can be applied to any combination of major and minor DNA. In this study we aimed to assess the ability of DIP-STRs to detect the minor contributor on challenging "touch" DNA samples simulated with representative crime-associated substrates and to compare their performance to commonly used male-specific markers (Y-STRs). As part of a comprehensive study on the relative DNA contribution of two persons handling the same object, we selected 71 unbalanced contact traces of which 14 comprised a male minor DNA contributor mixed to a female major DNA contributor. Using a set of six DIP-STRs, one to four markers were found to be informative for the minor DNA detection across traces. When compared to Y-STRs (14 traces), the DIP-STRs showed similar sensitivity in detecting the minor DNA across substrate materials with a similar occurrence of allele drop-out. Conversely, because of the sex combination of the two users of the object, 57 remaining traces could only be investigated by DIP-STRs. Of these, 30 minor DNA contributors could be detected by all informative markers while 12 traces showed events of allele drop-out. Finally, 15 traces showed no amplification of the minor DNA. These last 15 samples were mostly characterized by a combination of short handling time of the object, low DNA recovery and/or one single informative DIP-STR. In conclusion, the DIP-STRs represent alternative markers to help solving unbalanced two-source DNA mixtures, and also those produced from <b>contact</b> <b>stains.</b> These markers, in addition to a novel set of 10 DIP-STRs specifically developed according to forensic technical standards, will offer a valuable tool complementary to Y-STR markers...|$|R

40|$|The ease of {{cleaning}} the fibers depends, among other characteristics, on their hydrophilicity. Hydrophilic fibers are easy-wash materials but hydrophobic fibers {{are difficult to}} clean due to their higher water-repellent surfaces. This type of surfaces, like polyester (PET), produce an accumulation of electrostatic charges that adsorbs and retain dirt. Thus, the polyester soil-release properties can be increased by finishing processes that improve fiber hydrophilicity [1, 2]. In present study, PET fabric modification was described by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dimetilol dihidroxy ethylene urea chemically modified resin. Briefly, the modification process {{was carried out in}} two steps, one to hydrolyse the polyester and create hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on surface and the other to crosslink the PEG chains. The resulting materials were characterized by contact angle, DSC and FTIR- ATR methods. Additionally, the soil release behavior and mechanical properties of modified PET were evaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT We used {{antibodies}} raised against individual desmosomal {{components to}} study calcium-induced desmosome formation in human keratinocytes. When keratinocytes {{are forced to}} grow as a monolayer by reducing the level of calcium ions in the culture medium, there is little contact between adjacent cells. Raising the level of calcium ions rapidly induces desmosome formation, and stratification occurs within 24 h. We found that before addition of calcium the 115, 000 - and 100, 000 -mol-wt core glycoproteins were distributed over the entire cell surface, whereas the plaque proteins (205, 000 and 230, 000 mol wt), the 82, 000 and 86, 000 -mol-wt proteins, and the 150, 000 -mol-wt glycoprotein were located throughout the cytoplasm. 15 min after increasing the calcium ion concentration, all of these molecules appeared at the cell margins.

Specifically, the antibacterial activity of several copolymers based on 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphorylcholine [MPC] and 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) toward Staphylococcus aureus was examined. Both block and graft copolymers were synthesized using either atom transfer radical polymerization or reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and characterized via (1) H NMR, gel permeation chromatography, rheology, and surface tensiometry. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using a range of well-known assays, including direct <b>contact,</b> live/dead <b>staining,</b> and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while transmission electron microscopy was used to study the morphology of the bacteria before and after the addition of various copolymers. As expected, PMPC homopolymer was biocompatible but possessed no discernible antimicrobial activity. PMPC-based graft copolymers comprising PHPMA side chains (i. e. PMPC-g-PHPMA) significantly reduced both bacterial growth and viability. In contrast, a PMPC-PHPMA diblock copolymer comprising a PMPC stabilizer block and a hydrophobic core-forming PHPMA block did not exhibit any antimicrobial activity, although it did form a biocompatible worm gel. Surface tensiometry studies and LDH release assays suggest that the PMPC-g-PHPMA graft copolymer exhibits surfactant-like activity. Thus, the observed antimicrobial activity is likely to be the result of the weakly hydrophobic PHPMA chains penetrating (and hence rupturing) the bacterial membrane...|$|R

Using in situ proximal biotinylation by the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA tagged to α-catenin and a substrate stretch cell chamber, we sought to identify force-dependent molecular interactions surrounding α-catenin, an actin regulator at the sites of cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion. While E-cadherin, β-catenin, vinculin and actin localize with α-catenin at cell-cell <b>contacts</b> in immuno-fluorescent <b>staining,</b> only β-catenin and plakoglobin were biotinylated, suggesting that this proximal biotinylation is limited to the molecules that are in the immediate vicinity of α-catenin.

Cell-free filtrates of donor cultures did not transmit the plasmid, and plating of the donor on lawns of recipients did not result in plaque formation, suggesting that the transfer was not mediated by a virus. Rapid formation of cell-to-cell <b>contacts</b> between differently <b>stained</b> donor and recipient partners was demonstrated after the two strains were mixed. Electron microscopic analysis of mating mixtures revealed many cell aggregates made up of 2 to 30 cells and intercellular cytoplasmic bridges connecting two or more cells. Cells that had been transformed with purified plasmid DNA as well as transcipients isolated from mating mixtures were shown to serve as donors for further transmission of pNOB 8. The plasmid undergoes extensive genetic variations, since deletions and insertions were frequently observed in plasmid preparations from the donor strain and from mating mixtures...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of β 4 integrins in adult and fetal human skin {{as well as}} in cultured keratinocytes was studied by immunodetection with monoclonal antibodies and compared with that of β 1 integrins. The distribution of the β 1 and β 4 integrin epitopes was entirely different in the adult epidermis. As reported previously by us (J Clin Invest 84 : 19 16, 1989), the β 1 epitopes were present most prominently at lateral cell-cell <b>contact</b> points, whereas <b>staining</b> with the β 4 antibody demonstrated a linear staining pattern polarizing to the basal surface juxtaposed to the dermal-epidermal basement membrane. In contrast, in fetal skin, the staining patterns both with β 1 and β 4 antibodies were similar and demonstrated the presence of epitopes surrounding the entire cell surface of both basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. Distinct polarization of β 4 integrin epitopes was noted in cultured keratinocytes maintained in low-calcium (0. 15 mM) medium and the {{expression of}} these integrins was also noted in human papilloma virus-transformed keratinocytes. Switch of the cultures to high-calcium (1. 2 mM) medium resulted in redistribution of the epitopes to a pattern suggesting their location at undersurface of the cells adjacent to the substratum. This Ca++- induced redistribution of β 4 integrin epitopes could be counteracted by 10 - 7 M vitamin D 3. Finally, incubation with anti-β 4 integrin antibody reduced the capacity of keratinocytes to attach to plastic substratum. The results provide further evidence for the role of β 4 integrins in cell-matrix interactions...|$|R
40|$|Cultures of {{embryonic}} mouse spinal cord explants, {{alone or in}} combination with rat myotubes, were stained by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against three structural proteins to: (a) reveal the distribution of these proteins among different cell types, and (b) test the usefulness of antibody staining to reveal the gross morphology of the neurite network in complex cultures. Affinity column purified antibodies were used against chicken gizzard actin, porcine brain tubulin, and skeletal muscle alpha-actinin. Neurites were stained intensely by anti-actin as was the stress fiber pattern of underlying fibroblasts. With anti-tubulin, the staining of neurites was {{an order of magnitude}} more intense than the staining of the microtubule pattern of background fibroblasts. Neurite cell bodies and astrocyte- like glia cells were stained with anti-tubulin and their nuclei remained unstained. Anti-tubulin could thus be used to trace even the finest extensions of nerve processes in spinal cord and spinal cord- muscle cultures. Furthermore, it could be combined with the histochemical reaction for acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3. 1. 1. 7) to demonstrate AChE-positive neurons and specialized nerve-muscle <b>contact</b> sites. The <b>staining</b> of neural elements with anti-alpha-actinin was generally much weaker than with anti-actin and anti-tubulin. Neurites were stained only moderately in comparison to myotube Z lines in the same culture. However, a distinct staining of the periphery of dorsal root ganglion cells was observed. Thus, a protein immunologically related to muscle alpha-actinin is present in the nervous system. In myotubes, Z lines were stained intensely with anti-alpha-actinin while I bands were only faintly stained with anti-actin. In isolated myofibrils, both structures were stained intensely with the same antibody preparations...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the expression and function of the VLA- 4 heterodimer α 4 β 1, {{a member of the}} β 1 integrin subfamily, on human thymic epithelial cells (TEC) derived from cortical epithelium. The expression of the α 4 integrin chain was studied in four different cloned TEC lines derived from either fetal or post-natal human thymus by both flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation techniques with anti-α 4 MoAbs. All different cell lines assayed expressed significant levels of α 4, as revealed by their reactivity with MoAbs specific for distinct α 4 epitopes. The α 4 subunit expressed by TEC was associated to β 1 but not to β 7 chain, and displayed the characteristic 80 / 70 kD pattern of proteolytic cleavage. The VLA- 4 integrin in these cells was constitutively active in terms of adhesiveness to both fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1). In addition, this heterodimer localized to punctate regions of the cell in the area of contact with the substratum, named point <b>contacts</b> assessed by <b>staining</b> with the anti-β 1 activation epitope 15 / 7 MoAb. According to the cortical origin of the TEC lines expressing VLA- 4, human thymus sections stained with different anti-α 4 antibodies revealed the presence of cortical, and in smaller numbers medullary epithelial cells bearing α 4 integrin. The expression of α 4 in the thymus was also found in both adult and fetal rats, in which epithelial cells were also specifically stained. Altogether, our data show that VLA- 4 is an additional component of the integrin repertoire of TEC, and suggest that it could have an important role in thymus epithelial cell–thymocyte interactions...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{interactions}} between neurons and glia dissociated from early postnatal mouse cerebellar tissue were studied in vitro by indirect immunocytochemical staining with antisera raised against purified glial filament protein, galactocerebroside, and the NILE glycoprotein. Two forms of cells were stained with antisera raised against purified glial filament protein. The first, {{characterized by a}} cell body 9 microns diam and processes 130 - 150 microns long, usually had two to three neurons associated with them and resembled Bergmann glia. The second had a slightly larger cell body with markedly shorter arms among which were nestled several dozen neuronal cells, and resembled astrocytes of the granular layer. Staining with monoclonal antisera raised against purified galactocerebroside revealed the presence of immature oligodendroglia in the cultures. These glial cells constituted approximately 2 % of the total cell population in the cultures and, in contrast to astroglia, did not form specific <b>contacts</b> with neurons. <b>Staining</b> with two neuronal markers, antisera raised against purified NILE glycoprotein and tetanus toxin, revealed that most cells associated with presumed astroglia were small neurons (5 - 8 microns). After 1 - 2 d in culture, some stained neurons had very fine, short processes. Nearly all of the processes greater than 10 - 20 micron long were glial in origin. Electron microscopy also demonstrated the presence of two forms of astroglia in the cultures, each with a different organizing influence on cerebellar neurons. Most neurons associated with astroglia were granule neurons, although a few larger neurons sometimes associated with them. Time-lapse video microscopy revealed extensive cell migration (approximately 10 microns/h) along the arms of Bergmann-like astroglia. In contrast, cells did not migrate along the arms of astrocyte-like astroglia, but remained stationary at or near branch points. Growth cone activity, pulsating movements of cell perikarya, and ruffling of the membranes of glial and neuronal processes were also seen...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a novel stain free {{detection}} system for slab gel electrophoresis is examined. Currently, stained techniques {{are used to}} identify electrophoretic bands in gels. The stains utilized in these methods involve health risks since they are mutagenic. Also stains like EtBr are intercalating agents meaning they wedge themselves into the grooves of DNA and stay there. Since this includes a physical <b>contact</b> the <b>stains</b> remain in the DNA {{at the end of}} the experiment. This makes further use DNA very difficult. The stains need to be removed by chemical techniques which are timewise very costly. Also these operations are very inefficient, retrieve rates are very low which leads to waste of most of the analyte. The specific method we addressed aims to eliminate the use of any kind of stains and therefore inherently increase the end product efficiency. The method introduces the absorption method as the means of detection. The physical law governing the absorption technique is the Beer-Lambert Law. The Beer-Lambert Law defines the linear relation, which correlates absorption value to the analyte concentration, path length of the light and wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient. Although the proposed method is intended to apply to all kind of different analytes, to achieve primary goals and prove the feasibility of the method, as the first step detection of DNA molecules are targeted. Hence absorption pattern at a wavelength of 254 nm (which is characteristic absorption peak for DNA) is examined. After the method is proven to work robustly, it will be extended to all kind of different analytes. The unique approach used in the proposed {{detection system}} is the use of a scanning technique incorporated with absorption technique utilizing a high QE (Quantum efficiency) CCD camera as the detector. Experiments have been performed to determine the only unknown parameter -wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient a([gamma]) - in the Beer-Lambert Law. The value of a([gamma]) is dependent on the wavelength and also on the transmission media. In our case wavelength of interest is 254 nm and the specific transmission media is agarose gel with 0. 8 % concentration. Each lane in the agarose gel is scanned under UV light and transmittance values at 254 nm are recorded as a function of position. The recorded data are processed to see the absorption pattern along the lane. The drop in the signal indicates the existence of a DNA band. Experiments have been performed on three different agarose gels, which are 4 mm thick, and with 0. 8 % concentration. The value of wavelength-dependent absorptivity coefficient a([gamma]) was determined within an error margin. The resolution of the method was found to be 4 ng/[mu]l. by Namik Kemal Yilmaz. Thesis (S.

40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} delivers droplets with picolitre volumes onto a substrate. This thesis {{focuses on}} {{improving the quality}} of inkjet prints by controlling the particle distribution in the deposit. To this end, the internal flows in evaporating droplets were compared on purpose-built imaging rigs. Formulations were developed for deposit control {{based on the results of}} this analysis. Initial studies of pure solvents determined the influence of the substrate wettability and thermal conductivity on evaporation. It was demonstrated that an isothermal model accurately predicted the drying times of picolitre droplets, provided that evaporative cooling was insignificant. Evaporation of simplified model inks (two solvents + latex particles) was then considered. Marangoni flows transported particles along streamlines, with a circulating region that switched from the droplet centre to the edge on reversing the flow direction. Particles also migrated across streamlines towards the centre of the droplet, independent of the Marangoni flow direction. Large particles migrated faster than smaller particles, forming a tighter central group. Migration mechanisms were considered: Thermophoresis was ruled out due to particle migration in droplets with negligible thermal effects. Chemophoresis was not consistent with all observations of particle migration, though chemophoretic velocities are large enough to contribute. Shear-induced migration to regions of low shear rate is a promising potential migration mechanism. The deposit macro/microstructures were investigated for pure and binary mixtures. In pure solvents, evaporation-driven radial flow built up a ring <b>stain</b> at the <b>contact</b> line. This <b>stain</b> was inhibited for some binary solvent mixtures. However, in most cases, a ring stain developed after the Marangoni flow period ended. Hence, alternative routes of deposit control were investigated. Two strategies were developed to control the deposit structure: i) a sol-gel transition in a suspension of a nano-particulate clay (laponite), or ii) depletion flocculation induced by a free polymer (PSS). The latter strategy was the most successful for ethanol/water mixtures, producing a printed dot smaller than the droplet contact area. In water droplets, the sol-gel transition proved a successful method for obtaining a uniform particle distribution in the deposit...|$|R
