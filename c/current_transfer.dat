5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
25|$|TT Pro League {{clubs have}} almost {{complete}} freedom to sign whatever number and category of players they wish. There is no team or individual salary cap, no age restrictions {{other than those}} applied by general employment law, and no restrictions on {{the overall number of}} foreign players or nationalities. However, players can only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the TT Pro League. The two <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> windows run from {{the last day of the}} season to 15 September and between 15 December and 15 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence, usually on an emergency basis. In addition, Pro League clubs cannot sign free agents at any stage of the Pro League season outside of transfer windows.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{long before}} the <b>current</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> window system had come to English football, {{there was still a}} transfer deadline {{a few weeks before the}} end of the season. Arsenal, who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal's keeper John Lukic heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager George Graham came back for Seaman, with £1.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper) being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} {{influence}} net <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> {{have on a}} country's trade balance. We develop a simple overlapping generations model of a small open economy that is a net creditor in the initial equilibrium and that provides regular <b>current</b> <b>transfers.</b> We show that transfers have a 1 : 1 direct and a weaker indirect effect on the economy's export surplus. Applying this model to Germany, using macro data for the period from 1970 to 2000, we show that almost 87 % of the German trade balance's surplus {{is due to the}} provision of <b>current</b> <b>transfers.</b> Accordingly, the main part of Germany's well-known strong export position is determined by factors underlying political decisions and not economic factors...|$|R

40|$|NEWLY DEVELOPED {{estimates}} {{have been}} introduced in the U. S. international transactions accounts (ITAs) of fines and penalties paid by foreign corporations to the U. S. government and U. S. private purchasers, and of fines and penalties paid by U. S. corporations to foreign governments. The new estimates are a component of unilateral <b>current</b> <b>transfers.</b> Fines and penalties imposed by the U. S. government on foreign corporations are recorded as inward <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> (credits), reflecting receipts of funds by the U. S. Department of the Treasury {{as a result of}} judgments rendered by the U. S. Department of Justice and other agencies of the U. S. government (ITA table 1, line 37). Receipts from U. S. private class action settlements against foreign corporations are recorded as inward <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> (credits) in ITA table 1, line 38. Fines and penalties imposed by foreign governments, including the European Commission, are recorded as outward <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> (debits), reflecting the payment of funds by U. S. corporations to foreign governments (ITA table 1, line 38). A large share of these outward and inward transfers result from the prosecution of international cartels, which are voluntary associations of two or more legal entities—usually large multinational corporations—that conspire to restrict international or domestic trade, fix prices, or allocate market shares with the aim of increasing the profits of their members. International cartels are those with members located in two or more countries. “International cartels tend to be larger, better publicized, more injurious to markets, and geographically more widespread than the many more numerous local cartels. Many international cartels are virtually global in their operations. ”...|$|R

50|$|In his licentiate thesis in 1976, Eriksson {{discussed}} the general design principles of superconducting electric motors and presented {{a solution to}} a key problem, namely the transfer of high electric currents between the stator and rotor, and a tentative design for a superconducting motor. The design was implemented in a joint project by TKK and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland between the years 1977-1979. The 100-kilowatt motor SUMO was Finland’s first and fourth in the world.

In the fourth chapter,accumulated growth in real disposable income per capita since 1970 is decomposed into the following components: 1) productivity in oil and gas extraction 2) productivity in non-petroleum industries 3) labour reallocation gains 4) terms of trade effects from petroleum products 5) terms of trade effects from non-petroleum products 6) balance of income and <b>current</b> <b>transfers</b> and 7) hours worked per capita.
