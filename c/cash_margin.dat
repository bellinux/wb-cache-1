40|$|This {{research}} report {{is one of}} a series that looks at the cash flow performance of Corporate America. Our primary focus is on free <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> or free cash flow measured as a percent of revenue. In the current study we look at the non-financials of the S&P 500. During the twelve months ended September 2008, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> for the S&P 500 nonfinancials declined to 6. 70 % from 7. 13 % for the twelve months ended September 2007. Interestingly, operating <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> improved slightly during the same period, helped by improvements in operating cushion and the operating cycle. It appears that increased capital spending pushed net <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> lower even as operating <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> improved. As a point of reference, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> troughed at 4. 36 % in the 2001 recession. Thus, by all indications, we can expect a significant decline in free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> from current levels. While {{we do not know how}} far free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> might decline, at the present, with a median $ 666. 7 million on hand, these firms had ample cash and short-term investments to help them weather the financial storm...|$|E
40|$|Background: Financial stress {{may have}} adverse health effects. The main {{aim of this}} study was to {{investigate}} whether having a <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> and living alone or cohabiting is associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. Methods: Representative population-based prospective cohort study of 60 -year-old women (n = 2065) and men (n = 1939) in Stockholm County, Sweden. National registers were used to identify cases of incident CVD (n = 375) and all-cause mortality (n = 385). The presence of a <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> was determined in the questionnaire with the following question: Would you, if an unexpected situation occurred, be able to raise 10 000 SEK within a week? (This was equivalent to US$ 1250 in 1998). Results: Compared with cohabiting women with a <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> the risk of all-cause mortality was higher among cohabiting women without a <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1. 97 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 - 3. 66). Using cohabiting men with <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> as referent, single men without a <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> were at an increased risk of both incident CVD and all-cause mortality: HR 2. 84 (95 % CI 1. 61 - 4. 99) and 2. 78 (95 % CI 1. 69 - 4. 56), respectively. Single men with cash margins still had an increased risk of all-cause mortality when compared with cohabiting men with a cash margin: HR 1. 67 (95 % CI 1. 22 - 2. 28). Conclusions: Financial stress may increase the risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, especially among men. Furthermore these risks are likely to be greater in men living in single households and in women without cash margins. Living with a partner seems to protect men, but not women, from ill-health associated with financial stress due to the lack of a <b>cash</b> <b>margin...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} report {{is one of}} a series that looks at the cash flow performance of Corporate America. Our primary focus is on free <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> or free cash flow measured as a percent of revenue. We also look at the drivers or components of free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> in an effort to determine factors behind observed changes. In the current study we conduct a comprehensive review of 20 four-digit GICS non-financial industries and their 61 six-digit GICS sub-industries for a series of rolling twelve-month periods from the first quarter of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2008. Recession notwithstanding, due to declining capital expenditures and reduced working capital requirements, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> held up reasonably well during the twelve months ended December 2008. The metric declined to 4. 12 %, down from a high of 5. 14 % reached in June 2004, and more recently, the 4. 93 % level reached in December 2007 and 4. 44 % in September 2008. With free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> at 4. 12 %, corporate America is generating 4. 12 cents of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue generated. The number of industries experiencing declining free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> increased from our last report. For our sample as a whole, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> last bottomed at 2. 43 % during the 2001 recession. We continue to believe that during the current recession, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> will likely decline to levels that are at or below those found in the 2001 recession, suggesting a continuing contraction of free cash flow of 50 % or more from current levels. However, a continuing focus on maintaining low working capital levels and reduced capital expenditures may leave companies better off on a cash flow basis than they were in 2001...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the financial}} risk faced by representative mixed-enterprise farm businesses in four regions of south-eastern Australia. It uses discrete stochastic programming to optimise the ten-year <b>cash</b> flow <b>margins</b> produced by these farms operating three different farming systems. Monte Carlo analysis {{is used to}} produce a risk profile for each scenario, derived from multiple runs of this optimised model, randomised for commodity prices and decadal growing season rainfall since 1920. This analysis shows that {{the performance of the}} enterprise mixes at each site is characterised more by the level of variability of possible outcomes than by the mean values of financial outputs. It demonstrates that relying on mean values for climate and prices disguises the considerable risks involved with cropping in this area. Diversification into a Merino sheep enterprise marginally reduced the probability of financial loss at all sites. This study emphasises the fact that the variability, or risk, associated with all scenarios far exceeds the likely change in <b>cash</b> <b>margins</b> due to innovation and good management. It further shows that farm managers should give a higher priority to adopting innovations which reduce costs, rather than increase productivity, in order to reduce risk. Further analysis shows that the current static measures of financial performance (gross <b>margins,</b> profit and <b>cash</b> <b>margins)</b> do not characterise the risk-adjusted performance of the various farming systems and almost certainly result in a flawed specification of best-practice farm management in south-eastern Australia.

40|$|In this {{research}} report we provide a “flash” measure of free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> for all non-financial companies measured through March, 2009. We {{found that for}} the twelve months ended March, 2009, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> improved to 4. 60 %, up from the recession low of 4. 12 % reached in December 2008, but down slightly from the 4. 72 % registered during the twelve months ended March, 2008. This is a particularly striking development {{in that it is}} the first twelve-month period since December 2007 that we have seen improvement in free <b>cash</b> <b>margin.</b> The implication is that the firms in our sample {{are in the process of}} turning the corner in terms of financial performance. It also provides support for the improvement in stock prices we have seen since early March 2009. In the March 2009 reporting period, free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> improved even as profitability, as measured by operating cushion, declined. Driving the improvement in free <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> was a small reduction in capital spending and a more sizable decrease in the cash cycle. Firms are truly becoming “lean and mean” and dealing well with a noted decline in profitability. We look forward to reviewing the data for the June 2009 quarter to see if the improvements noted in March are continuing. Confirmation of the end of the recession on a cash flow basis will require an improving <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> driven more by improving profitability, as evidenced by improving operating cushion, and less through reductions in capital spending and the cash cycle...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} four chapters, in two parts. The {{first part}} examines {{the result of}} a Swedish payroll tax reduction; first {{from the perspective of the}} worker, then from that of the employer. The second half of the thesis concerns subjective well-being, both from an individual and from an aggregate viewpoint. Payroll Taxes and Youth Labor Demand. In 2007, the Swedish payroll tax was reduced substantially for young workers. This paper examines whether targeted payroll tax reductions are effective in raising youth employment. We estimate a small impact, both on employment and on wages. However, the effect differs markedly across ages, with 4 – 5 times higher impact on 22 – 23 year-olds compared to 25 -year-olds. Additionally, the employment effects are strongly procyclical, approaching zero in the deep recession. We calculate that the estimated cost per created job is more than four times that of directly hiring workers at the average wage. Payroll Taxes and Firm Performance. The Swedish payroll tax reform of 2007 had the effect that firms' average social fees came to depend on the age structure of their employees. This makes it possible to estimate how firms respond to shocks in labor costs. We find a significant, but very small effect on gross investments, and a negative, but not statistically significant, impact on labor productivity. There are no effects on exit rates or profitability. Beyond Income: The Importance for Life Satisfaction of Having Access to a <b>Cash</b> <b>Margin.</b> We study how life satisfaction among adult Swedes is influenced by having access to a <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> i. e. a moderate amount of money that could be acquired on short notice either through own savings, by loan from family or friends, or by other means. We find that <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> is a strong and robust predictor of life satisfaction, also when controlling for individual fixed-effects and socio-economic conditions, including income. This suggests that cash margin captures something beyond wealth. On Aggregating Subjective Well-Being. This paper discusses the assumptions underlying the aggregation of individually measured well-being. Any aggregation method is associated with measurability assumptions regarding the underlying well-being measure, as well as moral philosophical assumptions with respect to how individual well-being is weighted into a composite metric. I compare welfare across a set of countries, under alternative aggregation methods, and find that countries often can be ranked under comparatively weak measurement assumptions, and, equally important, that aggregation methods can be chosen so as to refrain from strong ethical preconceptions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} self-rated oral health and dental attendance habits among Swedish adults, with special reference to the role of social inequalities, after the Swedish dental care reform in 2008. METHODS: The study is based on a survey questionnaire, sent to 12, 235 residents of a Swedish county, in 2012. The age group was 16 - 84 years: 5, 999 (49 %) responded. Using chi-square statistics, differences in prevalence of self-rated oral health and regular dental attendance were analysed with respect to gender, age, educational level, family status, employment status and country of birth. Self-rated poor oral health was analysed by multivarite logistic regression adjusting for the different socio-demographic factors, financial security and having refrained from dental treatment for financial reasons. RESULTS: Three out of four respondents (75 %) reported fairly good or very good oral health. Almost 90 % claimed to be regular dental attenders. Those who were financially secure reported better oral health. The differences in oral health between those with a <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> and those without were large whereas the differences between age groups were rather small. About 8 % reported that they had refrained from dental treatment for financial reasons during the last three months. Self-rated poor oral health was most common among the unemployed, those on disability pension or on long-term sick leave, those born outside the Nordic countries and those with no <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> (odds ratios ranging from 2. 4 to 4. 4). The most important factor contributing to these differences was having refrained from dental treatment for financial reasons. CONCLUSION: The results are relevant to strategies intended to reduce social inequalities in oral health, affirming the importance of the provision of equitable access to dental care...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained essays in economics, all concerned with different aspects of subjective well-being. The abstracts of the four studies are as follows. Beyond Income: The Importance for Life Satisfaction of Having Access to a <b>Cash</b> <b>Margin.</b> We study how life satisfaction among adult Swedes is influenced by having access to a <b>cash</b> <b>margin,</b> i. e. a moderate {{amount of money that}} could be acquired on short notice either through own savings, by loan from family or friends, or by other means. We find that <b>cash</b> <b>margin</b> is a strong and robust predictor of life satisfaction, also when controlling for individual fixed effects and socio-economic conditions, including income. Decomposing Variation in Daily Feelings: The Role of Time Use and Individual Characteristics. I explore the potential of using time-use data for understanding variation in affective well-being. Using the Princeton Affect and Time Survey, I decompose variation in daily affect into explained and unexplained within- and between person variation. Time use is found to mostly account for within-variation. Hence, its explanatory power is largely additive to that of individual characteristics. The explanatory power of time use is small, however. Activities only account for 1 – 7 % of the total variation and this is not increased much by adding contextual variables. The Association Between Life Satisfaction and Affective Well-Being. We estimate the correlation between life satisfaction and affect — two conceptually distinct dimensions of subjective well-being. We propose a simple model that distinguishes between a stable and a transitory component of affect, and which also accounts for measurement error in self-reports of both variables, including current-mood bias effects on life satisfaction judgments. The model is estimated using momentarily measured well-being data, from an experience sampling survey that we conducted on a population sample of Swedes aged 18 – 50 (n= 252). Our main estimates of the correlation between life satisfaction and long-run affective well-being range between 0. 78 and 0. 91, indicating a stronger convergence between these variables than many previous studies that do not account for measurement issues. Do OLS and Ordinal Happiness Regressions Yield Different Results? A Quantitative Assessment. Self-reported subjective well-being scores are often viewed as ordinal variables, but the conventional wisdom has it that OLS and ordered regression models (e. g. ordered probit) produce similar results when applied to such data. This claim has rarely been assessed formally, however, in particular with respect to quantifying the differences. I shed light on this issue by comparing the results from OLS and different ordered regression models, in terms of both statistical and economic significance, and across data sets with different response scales for measuring life satisfaction. The results are mixed. The differences between OLS, probit and logit estimates are typically small when the response scale has few categories, but larger, though not huge, when an 11 -point scale is used. Moreover, when the error term is assumed to follow a skewed distribution, larger discrepancies are found throughout. I find a similar pattern in simulations, in which I assess how different methods perform with respect to the true parameters of interest, rather than to each other...|$|E

This article offers an empirical investigation into this issue. We apply panel data methods on longitudinal data from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey 2000 and 2010 (n = 3089) to study whether poverty affects four social outcomes—close social relations (social support), other social relations (friends and relatives), political participation, and activity in organizations. We also compare these effects across five different poverty indicators. Our main conclusion is that poverty in general has negative effects on social life. It has more harmful effects for relations with friends and relatives than for social support; and more for political participation than organizational activity. The poverty indicator that shows the greatest impact is material deprivation (lack of <b>cash</b> <b>margin),</b> while the most prevalent poverty indicators—absolute income poverty, and especially relative income poverty—appear to have the least effect on social outcomes...|$|E

Note that the marginal {{cost of capital}} for using capital as a funding source for variation margin is nil, because when one posts <b>cash</b> against variation <b>margin,</b> the valuation of the collateralized hedge is reset to zero and the total capital amount does not change. If, instead, the bank were to post capital as initial margin, then the bank would record a “margin receivable” entry on its balance sheet, which however cannot contribute to capital since this asset is too illiquid and impossible to unwind without unwinding all underlying derivatives. Hence, capital can only be used as VM, while it seems that IM must be borrowed entirely.|$|R

40|$|Excess <b>Cash</b> <b>Margin,</b> ECM, {{calculated}} by dividing by revenue {{the difference between}} adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted operating earnings, provides useful insight into the relationship between cash flow and earnings. When ECM declines in a consistent manner it indicates that earnings are growing faster or declining more slowly than cash flow. As a result, relative to the scale of operations, increasing levels of non-cash accounts are accumulating on the balance sheet. Earnings generated in this manner, that is, with declining cash flow confirmation, are not sustainable and {{are at risk for}} decline. When ECM increases consistently it indicates that operating cash flow is either growing faster or falling more slowly than earnings. As a result, relative to the scale of operations, the balance sheet is being liquidated. Operating cash flow generated in this manner, that is, without consistent earnings support, is not sustainable and is at risk for decline. The better, more sustainable relationship between operating cash flow and earnings is when the two measures grow at consistent rates, resulting in a constant ECM through time. This study calculates ECM for the non-financial firms of the S&P 100 for the years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 and provides commentary on the results. Insights are provided into firms with a declining ECM, an increasing ECM and a stable ECM...|$|E
40|$|Heap leach {{operations}} typically employ {{some form}} of modelling and forecasting tools to predict <b>cash</b> flow <b>margins</b> and project viability. However, these vary from simple spreadsheets to phenomenological models, with more complex models not commonly employed as they require {{the greatest amount of}} time and effort. Yet, accurate production modelling and forecasting are essential for managing production and potentially critical for successful operation of a complex heap, time and effort spent in setting up modelling tools initially may increase profitability in the long term. A brief overview of various modelling approaches is presented, but this paper focuses on the capabilities of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Advances in computational capability allow for complex CFD models, coupled with leach kinetic models, to be applied to complex ore bodies. In this paper a comprehensive hydrodynamic CFD model is described and applied to chalcopyrite dissolution under heap operating conditions. The model is parameterized against experimental data and validated against a range of experimental leach tests under different thermal conditions. A three-dimensional ‘virtual’ heap, under fluctuating meteorological conditions, is simulated. Continuous and intermittent irrigation is investigated, showing copper recovery per unit volume of applied leach solution to be slightly increased for pulse irrigation...|$|R

Value {{can be defined as}} the ratio of benefit to cost, where customers expect a rate of return equal or exceed the costs they incurred to obtain the products they bought. From the case studies conducted on PT XYZ, then, in getting the project tender delivery of goods geophysical equipment for the Brunei Loon project, it has been implemented value selling creation, which includes three main components, ie customer portraits, the proposed value, and benefits to customers or total value of ownership.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} {{factors that affect}} the choice of capital structure by analysing a panel of 150 listed UK companies for the period from 1999 to 2008, giving a total 1500 firm-year observations. Pooled regression estimation was first applied to the study, under the assumptions {{that there was no}} effect from firms or time. However, by running the Fixed Effect Model with industry dummy variables, {{it can be seen that}} some of the coefficient signs for the industries are significant. This indicated that the effect of industry is significant. Thus, Fixed Effect Model is adopted for the analysis in this study. Nine explanatory variables have been selected to measure their effect on leverage ratio. Five out of the nine variables are significantly related to leverage ratio while the rest four variables show that there are not very strong relationships between neither of them and the debt ratio. Mainly, the results support the prediction of trade-off theory in term of Tangibility variable and the Non-debt Tax Shield variable, but the earning volatility variables fail to confirm to trade-off theory. Moreover, profitability (measured by <b>cash</b> flow <b>margin)</b> failed to validate the predictions of pecking order theory whereas the growth opportunities variable rejects the agency theory hypothesis. In addition, the significant positive result of Tangibility proves the prediction of agency theory. Size variable confirms to both the prediction of trade-off theory and to information asymmetry theory...|$|R
