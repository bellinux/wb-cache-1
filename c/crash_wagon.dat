50|$|On 22 April 1907, the Walsh Street {{railway bridge}} was the {{location}} of a railway incident that became known as the 'Cow Hill Accident' involving a dozen privately owned wagons drawn by Platt Brothers locomotives. The siding along which the train was running descended steeply towards a stop-block adjacent to Walsh Street. Running out of control, the train continued through the stop-block and <b>crashed,</b> <b>wagon</b> after wagon into the street below.|$|R

50|$|About 3 {{years later}} the now Mr Brown, his wife and {{daughter}} are living in the bush. There is a fire and they have to flee the area. As they flee they <b>crash</b> their <b>wagon.</b> Mr & Mrs Brown die in the accident but their daughter Winnie survives and is found by two boys, Glen O'Brien (Jimmy McMahon) and his aboriginal friend Moori (Reg Quartley). Winnie is taken back to Glen's house and because her parents are dead {{and there is no way}} of tracing any other family she lives with them.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 November 1964, {{a driver}} {{lost control of}} his goods train as it left from Laisterdyke and rolled down the hill towards Adolphus Street. The engine and its <b>wagons</b> <b>crashed</b> through the {{retaining}} wall {{and ended up in}} the street below. The crew jumped clear of the locomotive before the crash.|$|R
60|$|But I was too late. The horses {{could not}} hold back the heavily laden wagon, and they broke into a gallop. I saw Doyle's face turn white--heard him yell. Then I spurred my horse to the side. Romer was slow or frightened. I screamed at him {{to get off the}} road. My heart sank sick within me! Surely he would be run down. As his pony Rye jumped out of the way the {{shoulder}} of the black horse, on the off side, struck him a glancing blow. Then the big team hurdled the log, the tongue struck with a <b>crash,</b> the <b>wagon</b> stopped with a lurch, and Doyle was thrown from his seat.|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes</b> into a ravine, {{prospector}} Ben Rumson finds two {{adult male}} occupants, brothers, {{one of whom}} is dead and the other of whom has a broken arm and leg. As the first man is about to be buried, gold dust is discovered at the grave site. Ben stakes a claim on the land and adopts the surviving brother as his [...] "Pardner" [...] while he recuperates.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the American Civil War, two rebel Texans are seen fleeing toward the Mexican border in a wagon, having made off with a huge sum of money stolen from the United States government. Just before reaching the safety of foreign soil they are intercepted by a U.S. army patrol. As the mounted soldiers close in, the men draw cards to decide who will stay on the wagon and draw the pursuit, and who will jump off with the loot and escape, keeping the other man's share safe until he can claim it. Ken Seagull (Nando Gazzolo) wins the draw, jumps off and successfully hides. Jerry Brewster (Thomas Hunter) <b>crashes</b> the <b>wagon,</b> is apprehended by the troopers, and is sent to a military prison.|$|R
60|$|Ben's {{experienced}} ear {{had told}} him at the first <b>crash</b> that his <b>wagon</b> was breaking down, and, without having time to warn Toby of his peril, he had leaped clear of the wreck, keeping his horses under perfect control and thus averting more trouble. It was the breaking {{of one of the}} axles which Toby had heard just before he was thrown from his seat and when the body of the wagon came down upon the hard road.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the last}} sheaves were stacked, the days were growing cool. The fresh western breezes had died away, and a faint {{ethereal}} haze {{and a deep}} stillness had fallen upon the prairie. It was rudely broken when the thrashers arrived and from early morning the clatter of the engine filled the air with sound. Loaded <b>wagons</b> <b>crashed</b> through the stubble, the voices of dusty men mingled with the rustle of the sheaves, and a long trail of sooty smoke stained the soft blue of the sky.|$|R
50|$|In the stories, James {{crashed into}} a field on his first day. The {{accident}} was blamed on his wooden brake blocks, which were thereafter replaced with metal ones. James {{has a reputation for}} being naughty. Some of his incidents include breaking a coach brake pipe and needing a passenger's bootlace and a newspaper to fix it, <b>crashing</b> into tar <b>wagons,</b> and spinning on the turntable although that was due to the wind rather than him. Despite his behavior, James is an engine proud of his red paint and shining brass dome, hard-working, and reliable and is generally considered to be a really useful engine.|$|R
50|$|Freight train No. 50325 from Trecate to Gricignano, hauled by Class E655 {{locomotive}} E 655 175 with 14 tank wagons was derailed at Viareggio at 23:48 {{local time}} (21:48 UTC) on 29 June 2009. Of the 14 wagons, the first wagon was registered by Polskie Koleje Pa≈Ñstwowe, the other 13 wagons by Deutsche Bahn (DB) The first DB-registered wagon, No. 338078182106, which {{was owned by}} GATX Rail Austria GmbH derailed on plain track in Viareggio station. The wagon hit the platform of the station and overturned to the left. The next four wagons also overturned and the two following were derailed but remained upright. The last seven wagons were not derailed, remaining intact on the track. The derailed <b>wagons</b> <b>crashed</b> into houses alongside the railway line.|$|R
5000|$|Things do {{not quite}} work out as planned. Pierce dies in a shootout {{with one of}} his own men trying to escape from the war <b>wagon.</b> The <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes</b> into a ravine, Lomax opens the safe, and the men move the gold into a {{separate}} wagon. Before they can haul it away, however, a group of Kiowas try to take it from them. During the ensuing gunfight, the horses are spooked and run away with the wagon, and most of the gold is lost as a result. Nevertheless, Taw manages to recover a portion of it, and they agree to meet in six months to divide it, since [...] "it wouldn't be very smart to flash gold around after a robbery".|$|R
5000|$|The {{sport has}} faced {{opposition}} from animal welfare groups, who contend {{that it is}} unnecessarily cruel to the horses (which occasionally suffer injuries requiring them to be euthanized), and want the sport banned. For instance, four horses died following chuckwagon races at the 2009 Calgary Stampede, and a <b>wagon</b> <b>crash</b> during the 2007 Stampede in which three horses were killed and a driver hospitalized led officials in Calgary to review {{the safety of the}} sport. [...] Six horses died in 2010, two from heart attacks. [...] Approximately fifty horses have died in chuckwagon races at that event between 1986 and 2013. In 2013, a 12-year-old thoroughbred ridden by an outrider collapsed with a burst lung artery and died shortly afterwards, a death atrributed to Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH).|$|R

5000|$|Bill Hawks {{suggests}} {{letting the}} thirsty horses loose and, as they stampede {{to the nearest}} river (in still another scene from Wagon Master), Bill follows them {{and is able to}} pinpoint the shortest, but hilly and barely passable, route to water. Footage of Mormon travelers is shown, as they walk alongside their wagons in Monument Valley. The terrain is very rough and the Major's <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes</b> and breaks apart. Extended excerpts from Wagon Master show the wagons moving through uneven rocky pathways, while horses are whipped and men are shouting. Finally, the river is reached and the Mormons drink and splash while their horses stand in water. The Major tells Charlie that the subject of his Sunday sermon will be [...] "Cleanliness is next to Godliness" [...] is pushes him off his horse into the river.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, {{a number}} of rodeo stars entered the movie {{industry}} on a full-time basis, with many [...] "riding extras" [...] eventually becoming movie stars themselves, including: Hank Bell (300 films, between 1920 and 1952); Bill Gillis; Buck Jones; Jack Montgomery (initially worked as Tom Mix's body-double); and Jack Padjeon (first appeared in 1923, played Wild Bill Hickok in the John Ford directed The Iron Horse in 1924). But the best known stuntman turned star was probably Yakima Canutt, who with his apprentices - who included John Wayne - devised during the 1930s new safety devices, including: the 'L' stirrup which allowed a rider to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup; and cabling equipment to cause spectacular <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes,</b> while releasing the team. A focus on replicable and safe stunts saved producers money and prevented lost down-time for directors through reduced accidents and injury to performers. Stuntmen were now {{an integral part of}} a films drawing power, helping to fill cinemas with thrill seeking patrons anxious to see the new Saturday matinee.|$|R
25|$|When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, {{they brought}} {{a battery of}} rodeo {{techniques}} that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new safety devices was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes,</b> while releasing the team, {{all on the same}} spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable {{for the rest of the}} day. The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the last time it was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra when British actor and friend of Yak Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Porky {{is looking}} to join the military. He briefly {{considers}} the Army's infantry division and the Navy before deciding to join the Air Corps; when the recruiter asks Porky for his name, he responds, [...] "Porky Cornelius Washington Otis Lincoln Abner Aloysius Casper Jefferson Philbert Horatius Narcissus Pig," [...] a full name unused before or since. He applied {{to one of the}} jobs. The sergeant (similar to MGM's Spike) sends Porky through a series of tests, which he fails disastrously. When the other soldiers are being issued rifles, Porky is issued a feather duster and ordered to clean a voice-activated robot plane. Meanwhile, Little Kitty is playing with a puppy, and the plane's control unit picks up her voice. The plane takes Porky on an incredibly wild ride. It destroys a military balloon (the crew parachute to safety). It levels a building except for the clock tower. It crashes through a circus tent, causing trapeze performers to do tricks on his plane. It goes through the ocean, chasing a fish and getting chased in turn by a whale. It even <b>crashes</b> into a <b>wagon</b> load of hay, turning the cargo into straw hats. It nearly destroys several other planes, but they nimbly escape. Finally, a number of other children show up and shout constant commands at the puppy, causing the plane to go totally berserk. Finally, the exhausted puppy's owner tells him to come home, and the plane does so, crashing into the hangar. Porky goes racing from the building and dashes into the office of the infantry division, proclaiming that he wants to [...] "l-l-learn to m-m-march". The cartoon ends with Porky carrying a rifle and marching in formation with a number of other soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} The Return of Randal Morn for Arcane magazine, rating it a 2 out of 10 overall. According to Webb, [...] "Return {{is suitable}} only for players of limited imagination and {{a fondness for}} spoon feeding. Its strictly linear plot drags players brutally between set-pieces, the outcome of which is usually entirely beyond their control. The characters they meet are sad, two-dimensional collections of statistics held together by names, while the unremittingly tedious world they can explore is peopled by such fearsome beasts as orcs and - gasp - humans!" [...] He also bleakly describes the plot as the party sets out to rescue Randal Morn and [...] "wanders around the woods and gets beaten up a bit. Then they wander around a town and get beaten up a lot. A <b>wagon</b> <b>crashes.</b> The good guys beat up the bad guys. The end." [...] Webb felt that the designer failed to offer a proper scope to the adventure, by not allowing it to be flexible {{so that it could}} be shaped to suit the party playing it, or pulling the players along with plot tibdbits while giving the Dungeon Master the power to push them. He criticized that the adventure enforces its will on the characters with [...] "edicts" [...] where actions come to the same result regardless of how cautious the player characters are, which [...] "directly discourages creative play". He calls the scenario's encounters [...] "unfortunately mundane", with the party [...] "repeatedly facing large groups of humans and orc warriors. As a result the battles are usually drawn out slugging matches." [...] Webb concludes the review by saying: [...] "Return works as a scenario but not as an adventure. It's functional rather than fun, sort of painting by numbers without the creative bits." ...|$|R
