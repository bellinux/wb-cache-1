25|$|In cities {{during the}} Great Leap, {{there was an}} {{emphasis}} on <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of public space even for activities that had usually {{taken place in the}} home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls. Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area in <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> {{in the table}} above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.|$|E

[...] "First Nations"' came into common usage in the 1980s to replace the term [...] "Indian band" [...] in referring to groups of Indians with common government and language. Elder Sol Sanderson says that he coined the term in the early 1980s. Others say that the term came into common usage in the 1970s to avoid using the word [...] "Indian," [...] which some Canadians considered offensive. No legal {{definition of the term}} exists. Some Aboriginal peoples in Canada have also adopted the term [...] "First Nation" [...] to replace the word [...] "band" [...] in the formal name of their community.

60|$|Now this {{intellectual}} inferiority of the legislator is {{not only}} directly bad for the community by producing dull and stupid legislation, {{but it has a}} discouraging and dwarfing effect upon our intellectual life. Nothing so stimulates art, thought and science as realisation; nothing so cripples it as unreality. But to set oneself to know thoroughly and to think clearly about any human question is to unfit oneself for the forensic claptrap which is contemporary politics, is to put oneself out of the effective current of the nation's life. The intelligence of any community which does not make a <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of that intelligence, starves and becomes hectic, tends inevitably to preciousness and futility on the one hand, and to insurgency, mischief and anarchism on the other.|$|E
60|$|But {{this new}} {{tolerant}} spirit in method involves no {{weakening of the}} ultimate conception. Modern Socialism sets itself absolutely against {{the creation of new}} private property out of land, or rights or concessions not yet assigned. All new great monopolistic enterprises in transit, building and cultivation, for example, must from the first be under public ownership. And the chief work of social statesmanship, the secular process of government, must be the steady, orderly resumption by the community, without violence and without delay, of the land, of the apparatus of transit, of communication, of food distribution and of all the great common services of mankind, and the care and training of a new generation in their <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> and in more civilized conceptions of living.|$|E
