25|$|Pollokshields Church of Scotland {{was built}} as Pollokshields Established Church by Robert Baldie in 1877–1878. The {{architecture}} is mixed Gothic with an early English tower with tabernacles above the broaches of the spire at the southwest {{comer of the}} building. The tower has a clock face on each of its four sides. The south (entrance) front has a large geometrical window above a row of trefoil headed windows with stiff leaf capitals. The side aisles have twin lancet windows beneath the clerestory of triple lancet windows to the main church. The interior has aisle arcades formed by polished granite columns on high octagonal sandstone bases with French Gothic capitals supporting pointed arches beneath the clerestory windows and the high scissor braced roof trusses. Each <b>column</b> <b>cap</b> is different The timber roof of the side aisles and the main trusses add to {{the grandeur of the}} interior. The south balcony is reached by a staircase from the east porch. The deep chancel was remodelled in 1912–1914 with new organ, pulpit and communion table.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a pretest {{analysis of a}} commonly used and increasingly popular superstructure-to-cap-beam connection used {{in the state of}} California subjected to seismic loading. The current connection investigated is used for precast girders placed on inverted-tee cap beams. The development of a prototype bridge and a 50 % scale test unit was discussed. Then multiple models were analyzed ranging from a single girder with a cap beam to a assembly with a <b>column,</b> <b>cap</b> beam, diaphragms, deck slab and ten girders based on the prototype and test unit. The analysis models were analyzed in the general purpose finite element program ABAQUS. A new connection detail utilizing an unstressed, prestressing strand placed through the girders was then modeled and proposed to provide a moment resistant connection and allow a plastic hinge to form {{in the top of the}} column. By allowing a plastic hinge to form in the top of the column the system is more economical then the current design detail...|$|E

50|$|It {{was built}} in 1912 in a Colonial Revival style by J.W. Heartfield. The plan is nearly square, 20' x 24', with {{clapboard}} siding and corner beads. There is a hipped roof that is now asphalt, but was once shingled in cedar. The front elevation exhibits a semi-circular portico supported by two Doric <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with oversized capitals and two pilasters.|$|R
5|$|Nelson's Pillar (also {{known as}} the Nelson Pillar or simply the Pillar) was a large granite <b>column</b> <b>capped</b> by a statue of Horatio Nelson, built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed O'Connell Street) in Dublin, Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom, it survived until March 1966, when it was {{severely}} damaged by explosives planted by Irish republicans. Its remnants were later destroyed by the Irish Army.|$|R
50|$|Dingle's St. Mary's was a neo-Gothic church {{built to}} designs by J. J. McCarthy and O'Connell. The {{foundation}} stone was laid in 1862. It originally had a nave and aisles separated by arcades, supported on <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> by octagonal tops. The arcades were demolished {{in one of}} the most radical reordering schemes to have been executed in Ireland. The project also saw the demolition of the exterior walls to below the original clerstory level, and, most notably, of the attic and upper ranges of the west elevation.|$|R
50|$|The church facade is {{predominantly}} Baroque in style with the roughness and heaviness of its looks although some hints of Renaissance style {{can be found}} on the details of its twin belfries. The recessed main portal showcases a relief of the papal symbol and is flanked by two heavily-ornamented saints' niches. Stone balusters decorate the single window on the facade, the blind windows flanking it and the base of the pediment. Dominating the facade are <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with Ionic capitals and scroll-like volutes on the pediment.|$|R
50|$|The front {{facade of}} the house is {{dominated}} by a four-column neoclassical Greek portico, its <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> by Egyptian capitals, and supporting a fully pedimented gable. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, which rise to an architrave and an iron-balustraded balcony for the second floor. The interior of the house retains many fine finishes, although some of its upstairs bedrooms have been converted into meeting spaces, and much of the eastern outer wall was removed to provide access to the large meeting wing.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} follows a strong axial plan {{that focuses on}} a three-story rotunda with an {{elaborate}} plasterwork ceiling and adjacent light wells. A coffered plaster dome, supported by eight fluted serpentine marble <b>columns,</b> <b>caps</b> the striking three-story rotunda. Each coffer essentially consists of a large gold shell, and the frieze has eight panels showing the winds as depicted in Greek mythology. On {{either side of the}} main north-south corridor are spectacular circular stairs that rise under small secondary domes and provide access to offices on the second and third stories.|$|R

50|$|Initially, {{the light}} brick, stone and terra-cotta edifice housed University College and the School of Law. During those early years, in {{addition}} to serving as NYU's main academic building, the university rented offices, studio space and residential apartments within {{the building and the}} American Book Company also rented space in the building. This combination of institutional and commercial tenants is apparent in the building's tripartite facade design. The University's academic presence on the three top floors was marked by engaged Ionic <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> by pediments. In 1927, due to the pressures of a growing post-war student body, NYU ejected commercial tenants to use the space for academic purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{house and}} grounds are {{separated}} from the street by a brick and wrought iron fence with the entrance gate flanked by tall brick <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with stone ball finials. To {{the south of the}} house is the garden that was originally laid out in a geometric arrangement with patterned beds of flowers, ornamental shrubs and large orange and grapefruit trees. Today a formal English garden can be found with gravel paths, boxwood hedges and plants favored in the 19th-century. In {{the rear of the house}} is the two-story slave quarters that housed many of the estimated 18 slaves that were at the Nathaniel Russell House.|$|R
50|$|Simms School Building is a {{historic}} elementary school building located at Huntington, Cabell County, West Virginia. It was built in 1919-1920, and is a two story wire brick, steel frame building in the Classical Revival style. It has a square plan, with a center auditorium surrounded by a circular corridor with classrooms on three sides. The front entrance has a center colonnade with four round limestone Doric order <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with a limestone frieze and projecting cornice. The second floor features an open porch with wood columns and a projecting cornice topped by a clay tile mansard roof. An addition was completed in 1964. The school closed after 1980, and it now houses 20 apartment units for the elderly.|$|R
50|$|The {{floors of}} the basements and upper floors were poured in 20.5 sq ft slabs. These slabs were 11 in thick in the basements and on the first floor, and 9.5 in thick on all other floors. The roof was a 7.5 in slab. Spandrel beams were not used in the {{flooring}} system. The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted {{to do away with}} <b>column</b> <b>caps</b> in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels in the fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support. Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a creosote-impregnated wood block.|$|R

Nixon opened the Nixon Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{on the corner}} of 6th Avenue and William Penn Place. The ornate Beaux Arts style {{building}} was opulently decorated. The interior featured massive fake-marble <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with gold, framed wall panels that seemed like damask silk, and velvet and silk draperies.The theater hosted many star performers, and put on elaborate shows. In 1905 four horse-drawn chariots came on stage in [...] "Ben Hur", and a herd of camels, horses, goats featured in [...] "Garden of Allah". The theater closed in 1950, when it was sold to Alcoa. It was demolished {{to make way for the}} present Regional Enterprise Tower.|$|R

30|$|The {{evolution}} of pier cap design {{is a consequence}} of the intensive use of bridges caused by the changes in the transportation infrastructures [4]. In general, abutment design has been extensively analyzed [4], particularly for integral abutments. Barr et al. [5] investigated the spalling of an integral abutment bridge in Salt Lake City, UT, through monitoring and finite element modeling. Nikravan [6] studied the behavior of integral bridges subjected to temperature variations using 3 D finite element models. However, pier choices are generally limited to CIP concrete supported either by one hammerhead bent cap or more than one column and pile bent cap [7]. Some special types (straddle bent caps) are briefly addressed elsewhere [8]. Public agencies have guidelines on the design of the most common bent cap types, such as rectangular <b>column</b> bent <b>caps</b> [9, 10], inverted T <b>column</b> bent <b>caps</b> [9, 10] and hammerhead bent caps [11]. However, comparative design/construction guidance for alternates is lacking.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a two-storey structure built from sandstone ashlar, fronted by a projecting tetrastyle Tuscan portico. The façade presents five bays with round-arched windows and, in the centre under the portico, a round-arched door {{at the top of}} a set of four steps. The cupola surmounting the building has a square base with a second octagonal stage on the side of which is a clock face. Above is a round drum surrounded by a rotunda of Ionic <b>columns,</b> <b>capped</b> by a dome. The ground floor was originally open and contained an arcade housing a market for grain and butter. The openings to the arcade were later filled with the current ground-floor windows. The building has served a number of purposes over the years; as well as housing Lancaster's Council Chamber and subsequently the City Museum, it also housed the town court (complete with lock-ups) and branches of Barclays Bank (until 1969) and the National Westminster Bank (until 1977).|$|R
5000|$|In 1879, a large {{monument}} {{was erected}} in St John's churchyard in Stratford Broadway, {{to commemorate the}} 13 and others who were executed or tortured in Stratford during the persecutions. Designed by J T Newman, it consists of an ornate hexagonal <b>column,</b> <b>capped</b> with a 12-sided spire rising to a height of 65 feet. One side of the column carries a terra cotta plaque, sculpted in relief, based on the illustration of the martyrdom in Foxe's book. The other panels carry {{the names of the}} 13 martyrs, together with Elizabeth Warne (burnt 23 August 1555), Stephen Harwood (burnt 30 August 1555), Hugh Laverock and John Apprice (both burnt 15 May 1556). Also included are Patrick Packingham, who was actually executed at Uxbridge and the Reverend Thomas Rose, the Vicar of All Saints Church, West Ham, who [...] "was tortured and exiled for preaching against auricular confession, transubstantiation, purgatory and images". The memorial is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England.|$|R
60|$|But it {{is greatly}} {{to be feared}} that our friend Stephen was bored with his errand before {{he arrived at the}} little wooden station of the Illinois capital. Standing on the {{platform}} after the train pulled out, he summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard, which he swept away when he spat, where was the office of Lincoln & Herndon. The stranger spat twice, regarded Mr. Brice pityingly, and finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the New England-looking meeting-house opposite until they came to the great square on which the State House squatted. The State House was a building with much pretension to beauty, built in the classical style, of a yellow stone, with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> at the gently slanting roof. But on top of it was reared a crude wooden dome, like a clay head on a marble statue.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh {{ice water}} content (IWC) regions in Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) are a {{potential}} threat to commercial aviation as they are suspected to cause in-service engine power-loss events and air data probe malfunctions. To investigate this, the High Altitude Ice Crystals (HAIC) / High Ice Water Content (HIWC) projects set up a first field campaign in Darwin (Australia) in 2014. The airborne instrumentation was selected to provide the most accurate measurements of both the bulk total water content (TWC), using a specially developed isokinetic evaporator, and the individual ice crystals properties using particle imaging probes. This study focuses on determining the size ranges of ice crystals responsible for the mass in high IWC regions, defined here as cloud regions with IWC greater than 1. 5 gm - 3. It is shown that for high IWC areas {{in most of the}} encountered MCS systems, median mass diameters (MMDs) of ice crystals range from 250 to 500 μm and decrease with increasing TWC and decreasing temperature. At the same time, the mass contribution of the smallest crystals (below 100 μm) remains generally low (below 15 %). In contrast, data from two flight missions in a long-lasting quasi-stationary tropical storm reveal that high IWC values can also be associated with MMDs in the range 400 - 800 μm and peak values of up to 2 mm. Ice crystal images suggest a major growth contribution by vapor deposition (<b>columns,</b> <b>capped</b> <b>columns)</b> even for such larger MMDs values...|$|R

According to the contractor, nearly [...] "1,800 {{cubic yards of}} self-leveling mass concrete are contained in the bridge piers. These seven piers were post-tensioned to support the pre-cast arches, which were erected in segments on shoring towers and then post-tensioned as well.

50|$|The William Street facade is {{primarily}} symmetrical with a ground floor colonnade of five pointed arches between two slightly projecting bays. Blind circular openings {{are located in}} the infills between each arch. The colonnade is reached via central stone stairs. Five sets of horizontal-pivot timber sash windows align with the five arches of the colonnade. The entry is asymmetrical and located at the Stephens Lane end of the colonnade. The two end bays have stop-chamfered corners to the ground and first floors which are rendered and painted. Engaged <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with foliated convex elements are located within the stop chamfers. Each end bay has a centrally located segmental arch which surrounds a rendered section containing two lancet-type windows with semi-circular heads. The first floor levels have three similarly styled windows, symmetrically placed, and the second floor levels have larger scale windows which project above the eaves line and have curved pediments. A variety of bonds make up the brickwork, including English, Flemish, and English Garden Wall. The bricks of the William Street wing are discernibly better quality than those of the rear wing and have struck or ruled pointing. Carved sandstone brackets line the eaves.|$|R
50|$|Within the walls, {{the body}} of the church is divided into a six bay nave and side aisles. The side aisles are formed by two heavy brick faced arcades. They {{comprise}} compound columns supporting six round arched openings. The compound <b>columns</b> are <b>capped</b> with white painted concrete capitals embellished with mouldings of foliage. The side aisles are further divided by round archways defining each of the bays of the nave and springing from the compound columns of the principal arcades.|$|R

An ornate Beaux Arts structure, crowned by a large dome it was arguably the most opulent theater in city history. S. Trevor Hadly in Only in Pittsburgh describes that the interior [...] "was in the Louis XVth style. Inside were massive imitation Parawazza marble <b>columns</b> <b>capped</b> with solid gold. ...
