You didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were {{in time with the}} dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan hoplite {{followed}} a strict laconic code of honor. No soldier was considered superior to another. Suicidal recklesness, berserkery, and rage were prohibited in a Spartan army, as these behaviors endangered the phalanx. Recklessness {{could lead to}} dishonor, {{as in the case}} of Aristodemus. Spartans regarded those who fight, while still wishing to live, as more valorous than those who don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> die. They believed that a warrior must not fight with raging anger, but with calmed determination. By the laconic way of life, Spartans must walk without any noise, and speak only with few words. Other ways for Spartans to be dishonored were dropping the shield (rhipsaspia), failing to complete the training, and deserting in battle. Dishonored Spartans were labeled outcasts, and were forced to wear different clothing for public humiliation. In battle, stories of valor were told to inspire troops and, before a major confrontation, they sang soft songs to calm the nerves.|$|E
25|$|Education is an {{important}} factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> don’t know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment. In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%). There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> don't get radio play". The release of the EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E
500|$|Carte {{was deeply}} {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his son Michael in 1932, discussed below. [...] The actor Martyn Green said, [...] "The heart dropped right out of him. [...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't care what they say about the production. I should <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> said nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{longtime}} {{advocate of}} health care reform, Neal {{was involved in the}} major health care reform efforts of 1993–94 and 2009–10. In working on the unsuccessful Clinton health care plan of 1993 he balanced his desire for health care reform with the interests of the major health insurance and medical companies in his district, achieving a compromise allowing insurance companies to charge small businesses higher premiums. He was later involved writing the House's 2009 health care reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures subcommittee, he had a hand in developing the bill's financing plan. He explained that his priorities were to address [...] "pre-existing conditions, capping out-of-pocket expenses and making sure people don't lose their health <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> lose their job". Despite his support for the act, he spoke about his preference for a [...] "piecemeal" [...] approach to health care reform, saying it would allow for a more reasonable debate.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{with the}} press further {{deteriorated}} when Lorne's private secretary, Francis de Winton, threw four journalists off the royal train. Although the Lornes {{had no knowledge of}} de Winton's action, it was assumed by the press that they did, and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness. Louise was horrified by the negative press, and when she heard about reports of [...] "a nation of flunkies" [...] at the viceregal court, taking lessons in [...] "the backward walk," [...] Louise declared that she [...] "wouldn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> came in blanket coats!". (A reference to the ubiquitous capote, a coat made of blanket-cloth, both durable and warm. The cultural significance of the blanket coat in genteel society, with reference to several early Governors-General and their wives, can be found in [...] "'Very Picturesque and Very Canadian': The Blanket Coat and Anglo-Canadian Identity in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century" [...] by Eileen Stack of the McCord Museum of Canadian History.) Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the [...] "feeble undercurrent of criticism" [...] turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E
500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E

His most {{prominent}} opponent, former opposition Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, had {{the backing of the}} popular former LDP prime minister Jun'ichirō Koizumi. In a rare display of humor, Masuzoe dismissed a question as to whether the [...] "tag team" [...] of ex-prime ministers was intimidating, saying [...] "I wouldn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had a hundred prime ministers!" [...] Hosokawa, as well as rival Kenji Utsunomiya, both made opposition to nuclear power a key issue in their campaigns, while Masuzoe, who supported a gradual phase-out of nuclear power, focused on social welfare issues. He ultimately won the election amid low voter turnout following a blizzard in Tokyo the previous day.|$|E
2500|$|The Horseman's Word {{was one of}} {{a number}} of groups that emerged in Britain as part of a popular {{outgrowth}} from Freemasonry, which was commonly known as the [...] "Mason's Word" [...] in Scotland after the secret password that it used. Freemasonry had influenced a range of friendly societies and benefit clubs which were established with the purpose of providing working people with <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> fell sick or got old. Such groups included the Society of Oddfellows, Ancient Order of Druids, Ancient Order of Foresters, and Ancient Order of Royal Shepherds, all of whom adopted the initiatory structure and ceremonial elements found in Freemasonry. The Freemasons and these friendly societies were weakest in the rural hinterland of Scotland, and it was here that several groups emerged to cater for local conditions while embracing the basic Masonic model.|$|E

2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> say, 'Look, kid, you're {{going to drive}} that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E
2500|$|Spencerian {{views in}} 21st century {{circulation}} derive from his political theories and memorable {{attacks on the}} reform movements of the late 19th century. He has been claimed as a precursor by libertarians and anarcho-capitalists. Economist Murray Rothbard called Social Statics [...] "the greatest single work of libertarian political philosophy ever written." [...] Spencer argued that the state was not an [...] "essential" [...] institution {{and that it would}} [...] "decay" [...] as voluntary market organisation would replace the coercive aspects of the state. He also argued that the individual had a [...] "right to ignore the state." [...] As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of patriotism. In response to being told that British troops were in danger during the Second Afghan War (1878-1880) he replied: [...] "When men hire themselves out to shoot other men to order, asking nothing about the justice of their cause, I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are shot themselves." ...|$|E
