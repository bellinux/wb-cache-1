50|$|Channel bonding is an {{arrangement}} of communications links in which two or more links are combined for redundancy or increased throughput. Examples include links associated with network interfaces on a host computer, or downstream and upstream channels within a DOCSIS cable modem <b>connection.</b> <b>Channel</b> bonding is differentiated from load balancing in that load balancing divides traffic between network interfaces on per network socket (OSI model layer 4) basis, while channel bonding implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level, either per packet (OSI model Layer 3) or a data link (OSI model Layer 2) basis.|$|E

Further, sockets are not necessarily associated with a persistent <b>connection</b> (<b>channel)</b> for communication between two nodes, nor is there necessarily some single other endpoint. For example, a datagram socket {{can be used for}} connectionless communication, and a multicast socket can be used to send to multiple nodes, or an address range where there {{may or may not be}} any nodes to receive data. However, in practice for internet communication, sockets generally have associated addresses and often have a connection.|$|E

HAR divides the physical network into several levels of virtual networks. There is one <b>connection</b> <b>channel</b> between two adjacent virtual networks that allows blocked packets in the higher level {{to move to the}} lower level. Different routing algorithms can be used in each virtual network, and the overall network is deadlock-free provided the routing algorithm in the lowest level virtual network is deadlock-free. However, the routing algorithm in any other virtual network can be fully adaptive, even nonminimal, to increase performance. HA [...] ...|$|E

The method is experimentally validated with an inkjet printhead that is augmented with a glass <b>connection</b> <b>channel,</b> through which the bubble was observed optically, {{while at the same time}} the piezocurrent was measured.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{microorganisms}} is often confined in restricting geometries. In this work, we designed {{a device to}} study the growth propagation of budding yeast along linear arrays of microfluidic chambers. Vacuum assisted cell loading was used to seed cells of limited numbers in the up-most chambers of each linear array. Once loaded, cells grow until confluent and then overgrow, pushing some of the newborns into the neighboring downstream chamber through connection channels. Such a scenario repeats sequentially along the whole linear chamber arrays. We observed that the propagation speed of yeast population along the linear arrays was strongly channel geometry dependent. When the <b>connection</b> <b>channel</b> is narrow and long, the amount of cells delivered into the downstream chamber is small so that cells grow over several generations in the same chamber before passing into the next chamber. Consequently, a population growth of more than 50 generations could be observed along a single linear array.
