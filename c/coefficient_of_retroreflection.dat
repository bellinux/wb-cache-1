40|$|One {{factor that}} has been causally linked to {{nighttime}} pedestrian-vehicle collisions is pedestrians being insufficiently conspicuous to drivers. Pedestrian conspicuity can be enhanced by use of retroreflective material, and this on-road experiment investigated the influence of retroreflector configuration, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>retroreflection</b> (RA) of those retroreflectors, and pedestrian motion on conspicuity. There were two retroreflector configurations, three levels of RA, and the test pedestrian either walked or stood in place. Data from 121 participants are reported. The pedestrian was detected by more participants and at greater distances when the pedestrian was walking and wearing retroreflectors on the wrists and ankles (W+A). Response distances to the walking pedestrian wearing the W+A configuration increased as RA increased. Increasing RA did not, however, increase response distances to the standing pedestrian wearing the W+A configuration, the standing pedestrian wearing the torso configuration, or the walking pedestrian wearing the torso configuration. These results suggest that RA may increase pedestrian conspicuity when biological motion information is present but RA may not increase pedestrian conspicuity when biological information is not present. ii...|$|E

Few geometric shapes are capable <b>of</b> <b>retroreflection.</b> Among them are the lens-and-mirror, and cube corner geometry; however, the right triangular prism (RTP) has been introduced as a viable alternative. This study demonstrates a more efficient fabrication technology when compared to current industry practices.

40|$|Some {{advanced}} concepts for gated viewing are presented, including spectral diversity illumination techniques, non-line-of-sight imaging, indirect scene illumination, and {{in particular}} setups in bistatic configurations. By using a multiple-wavelength illumination source target speckles could be substantially reduced, leading to an improved image quality and enhanced range accuracy. In non-line-of-sight imaging experiments we observed the scenery through the reflections in a window plane. The scene was illuminated indirectly as well by a diffuse reflection of the laser beam at different nearby objects. In this setup several targets could be spotted, which, e. g., offers the capability to look around the corner in urban situations. In the presented measuring campaigns the advantages of bistatic setups in comparison with common monostatic configurations are discussed. The appearance of shadows or local contrast enhancements {{as well as the}} mitigation <b>of</b> <b>retroreflections</b> supports the human observer in interpreting the scene.

Fredlund Abstract: The modelling of flow through saturated/unsaturated soils has become routine in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The analysis {{requires that the}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability for an unsaturated soil be defined. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability can be estimated based on currently available procedures. However, each procedure has limitations and consequently cares should be taken {{in the selection of}} a proper procedure. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a saturated soil is a function of void ratio. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of an unsaturated soil of constant volume, {{is a function of the}} degree of saturation. However, soil is deformable and both the degree of saturation and the void-ratio influence the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a compressible, unsaturated soil.
