The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy.

5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype.

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E

5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder is Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do {{clinical}} {{characteristics of}} recurrent miscarriage couples with a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> and who opt for PGD differ from couples that decline PGD after extensive genetic counselling? SUMMARY ANSWER: No differences in clinical characteristics are identified between recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> who opt for PGD {{compared with those}} that decline PGD after extensive genetic counselling. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Couples who have experienced two or more miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage) are at increased recurrence risk {{if one of the}} partners carries a structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality.</b> PGD can be offered to avoid (another) miscarriage or pregnancy termination when (invasive) prenatal diagnosis shows an abnormal result. To date, no reports are available that describe reproductive decision-making after genetic counselling on PGD in these specific couples. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort study of 294 couples carrying a structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> seeking genetic counselling on PGD between 1996 and 2012. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality.</b> They had been referred for genetic counselling to the only national licensed PGD centre. Clinical characteristics analysed included couple associated characteristics, characteristics concerning reproductive history and external characteristics such as type of physician that referred the couple for genetic counselling and the clinical geneticist performing the counselling on PGD. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 294 couples referred for counselling on PGD, 26 were not accepted because they did not meet the criteria for IVF-PGD. The remaining cohort of 268 couples consisted of two-thirds female and one-third male carriers. Main PGD indications were reciprocal translocations (83. 9 %) and Robertsonian translocations (16. 7 %). Following genetic counselling, 76. 9 % of included couples chose PGD as their reproductive option, the others declined PGD. Reproductive choice is not influenced by sex of the translocation carrier (P = 0. 499), type of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> (P = 0. 346), number of previous miscarriages (P = 0. 882), history of termination of pregnancy (TOP) because of an unbalanced fetal karyotype (P = 0. 800), referring physician (P = 0. 208) or geneticist who performed the counselling (P = 0. 410). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study only included recurrent miscarriage couples carrying a structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality,</b> who were actually referred to a PGD clinic for genetic counselling. We lack information on couples who were not referred for PGD. Some of these patients may not have been informed on PGD at all, while others were not referred for counselling because they did not opt for PGD to start with. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study shows that reproductive choices in couples with recurrent miscarriage {{on the basis of a}} structural <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> are not influenced by characteristics of the couple itself, nor by their obstetric history or external characteristics. These findings suggest that a couples' intrinsic attitude towards PGD treatment is a major factor influencing their reproductive choice. Future research will focus on these personal motives that seem to push reproductive decision-making following genetic counselling in a given direction...|$|R
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is not usually}} inherited from a person's parents. No environmental risks are known, and the mother's age does not play a role. Turner {{syndrome is}} due to a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> in which all or part of one of the X chromosomes is missing or altered. While most people have 46 chromosomes, people with TS usually have 45. The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormality</b> may be present in just some cells in which case it is known as TS with mosaicism. In these cases, the symptoms are usually fewer and possibly none occur at all. Diagnosis is based on physical signs and genetic testing.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{spontaneous}} abortion during the first trimester is <b>chromosomal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{miscarriage}} include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and {{drug or alcohol}} use.
