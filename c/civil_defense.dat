5|$|Krusty, {{refusing to}} submit to Bob's demands, takes refuge in a <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> shack in the desert, which he uses to {{transmit}} a heavily improvised show. Bart and Lisa {{find their way into}} the cockpit of the Duff Blimp, where Bob, having lost his patience thanks to Krusty, tries to detonate the bomb, which {{turns out to be a}} dud. Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original Wright Brothers aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> shack where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the shack.

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Katrina, 150,000people and 120,000head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban <b>Civil</b> <b>Defense</b> officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to, and did not, {{pose a threat to}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> plan {{to counter the}} American air raids.

Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing {{the event}} {{as a serious}} {{radiological}} accident, the OAEP organized an emergency response team to manage the situation, {{in conjunction with the}} local public health and <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Cuba and Puerto Rico, {{neither of}} which were {{expected}} to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly. Cuba's <b>Civil</b> <b>Defense</b> evacuated 350,000people from the coastal provinces. The government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm. Soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters, but stood down when it became evident {{that they would not}} needed. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed a five-member team to Puerto Rico ahead of Hurricane Dean. They were equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{potential}} impacts from Helene, the Weather Bureau began to advise prompt emergency evacuation in their advisories. Areas between Beaufort, South Carolina and Cape Fear, North Carolina were urged to begin evacuation procedures immediately. The Southeastern American Red Cross sent ten field staff warnings to locations in Georgia and South Carolina in order to assist in setting up emergency shelters. The Red Cross held 27hurricane preparation conferences to plan preparation procedures. Other <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> organizations also mobilized hurricane preparation staff and equipment. The Weather Bureau sent a mobile weather station to Charleston, South Carolina in order to monitor weather conditions and alert surrounding populations with short-range radio equipment. Beaches on North Carolina's coast, including Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, were completely evacuated during the night of September27. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 100members of the United States National Guard were dispatched to monitor waterfront property, while 60others were kept on standby. Civilian vehicles attempting to enter Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were sent back by highway patrol 15mi (25km) outside the city borders, following an order issued by Governor of South Carolina George Bell Timmerman, Jr. The order was issued to minimize casualties and prevent looting. Approximately 100members of the National Guard and local police were kept to patrol the beach. Despite repeated orders for mandatory evacuation, a few people remained in Myrtle Beach. <b>Civil</b> <b>Defense</b> authorities forcibly evacuated stragglers, but others were permitted to remain.|$|E

5|$|Fairbanks {{received}} {{word of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor via civilian shortwave radio operators who passed the news to the U.S. Army base. More than 200 <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> volunteers immediately signed up for work that included orchestrating a town blackout, blocking town airfields, and making emergency plans to evacuate the town {{in the event of an}} attack. In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks. Ladd Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E

5|$|In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of <b>Civil</b> <b>defense</b> {{informed}} that the first of 13temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should {{take care not to}} leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists.

5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, <b>civil</b> <b>defense</b> (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Cosme was {{predicted}} {{to make landfall}} on Hawaii as a tropical storm.
