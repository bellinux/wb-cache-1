50|$|Most of Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand {{and most}} of South America use a supply that is within 6% of 230 V. In the UK and Australia the nominal supply voltage is 230 V +10%/−6% to {{accommodate}} {{the fact that most}} supplies are in fact still 240 V. Japan, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, North America, Central America and some parts of northern South America use a voltage between 100 V and 127 V. The 230 V standard has become widespread so that 230 V equipment can be used {{in most parts of the}} world with the aid of an adapter or a change to the equipment's <b>connection</b> <b>plug</b> for the specific country.|$|E

50|$|Windows Vista {{features}} Windows Connect Now {{which supports}} {{setting up a}} wireless network using several methods supported in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup standard. It implements a native code API, Web Services for Devices (WSDAPI) to support Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) and also a managed code implementation in WCF. DPWS enables simpler device discoverability like UPnP and describes available services to those clients. Function Discovery is a new technology that serves as an abstraction layer between applications and devices, allowing applications to discover devices by referencing the device's function, rather than by its bus type or {{the nature of its}} <b>connection.</b> <b>Plug</b> and Play Extensions (PnP-X) allow network-connected devices to appear as local devices inside Windows connected physically. UPnP support has also been enhanced to include integration with PnP-X and Function Discovery.|$|E
5000|$|Like Rejewskis [...] "card-catalog" [...] method, {{developed}} {{using his}} [...] "cyclometer," [...] the Zygalski-sheet procedure was {{independent of the}} number of plugboard <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> in the Enigma machine.|$|R

500|$|Two and a {{half weeks}} later, {{effective}} 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> to 7–10, which, writes Rejewski, [...] "to a great degree, decreased the usefulness of the bombs." [...] Zygalski's perforated ("Zygalski") sheets, writes Rejewski, [...] "like the card-catalog method, was independent of the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections.</b> [...] But the manufacture of these sheets, [...] in our [...] circumstances, was very time-consuming, so that by 15 December 1938, only one-third of the whole job had been done.

5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand {{and many}} {{associated}} South Pacific island nations, the AS/NZ 3123 standard is used. In this series, multiple sizes of three-phase round-pin socket are standardized by current rating and neutral circuit. Each socket accepts plugs {{up to its}} rating, but excludes plugs with a higher current rating or with a neutral pin (if not on the socket). Multiphase plugs and sockets are rated at up to 500 V and all include an earth <b>connection.</b> These <b>plugs</b> and sockets are usually IP56 rated if fitted correctly. A screw collar helps hold plug and socket together.|$|R
50|$|Pit <b>connections</b> and pit <b>plugs</b> {{are unique}} and {{distinctive}} features of red algae that form {{during the process}} of cytokinesis following mitosis. In red algae, cytokinesis is incomplete. Typically, a small pore is left {{in the middle of the}} newly formed partition. The pit connection is formed where the daughter cells remain in contact.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{three phase}} plug which {{requires}} a neutral connection cannot be inserted into a socket outlet which does not provide for such a <b>connection.</b> However, a <b>plug</b> which {{does not require a}} neutral connection can be inserted into a socket outlet which provides such a connection, although the neutral connection would not be utilized in that situation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{utility of}} the card catalog, writes Rejewski, was {{independent}} {{of the number of}} <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> being used by the Germans on their Enigma machines (and of the reconstruction of message keys). Preparation of the catalog [...] "was laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready... daily keys be obtained within about fifteen minutes." ...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the USB micro plug, a new plug receptacle called micro-AB was also introduced. It can accept either a micro-A plug or a micro-B plug. Micro-A adapters allow for <b>connection</b> to standard-A <b>plugs,</b> as used on fixed or standard devices. An OTG product must have a single micro-AB receptacle and no other USB receptacles.|$|R
5000|$|To set up TV2Me, {{the cable}} or {{satellite}} box and a broadband internet <b>connection</b> are <b>plugged</b> in the device. “The server requires an Internet connection with an upstream speed of 512 kb/s or higher.”On {{the receiving end}} (for example the computer), any browser {{can be used to}} view in real-time or with a 6-second delay. The delayed mode uses the extra time to produce a slightly better picture. No additional software needs to be installed. “The [...] "target" [...] (receiving location) can be anywhere on earth − anywhere there's wired or wireless broadband. The viewer can use virtually any PC running Windows, Mac, Linux - even Solaris.” ...|$|R
5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|R
5000|$|The grill {{method is}} {{described}} by Marian Rejewski as being [...] "manual and tedious" [...] and, like the later cryptologic bomb, as being [...] "based... {{on the fact that}} the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> the Enigma's commutator, or [...] "plugboard" [...] did not change all the letters." [...] Unlike the bomb, however, [...] "the grill method required unchanged pairs of letters than only unchanged letters." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} mechanize and {{speed up the}} process, Rejewski, a {{civilian}} mathematician working at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau in Warsaw, invented the [...] "bomba kryptologiczna" [...] (cryptologic bomb), probably in October 1938. Each bomb (six were built in Warsaw for the Cipher Bureau before September 1939) essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas and took the place of some one hundred workers. The bomb method was based, like the Poles' earlier [...] "grill" [...] method, {{on the fact that}} the <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> in the commutator ("plugboard") did not change all the letters. But while the grill method required unchanged pairs of letters, the bomb method required only unchanged letters. Hence it could be applied even though the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> in this period was between five and eight. In mid-November 1938, the bombs were ready, and the reconstructing of daily keys now took about two hours.|$|R
50|$|While the {{connection}} on an Ethernet over copper cable {{is similar to}} that of a conventional Ethernet cable, the physical layers used for Ethernet over copper are different from the physical layers used for conventional Ethernet, so special adapters are required for Ethernet over copper; the Ethernet over copper <b>connection</b> cannot be <b>plugged</b> into a conventional Ethernet port on a switch, router, or computer.|$|R
5000|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, however the term receptacle {{does not appear in}} IEC 60050 and the internationally accepted term is socket-outlet. Similarly, blade meaning the contact of a plug is not normally used outside North America, although blade contact is defined in IEC 60050, however the normal English term used in <b>connection</b> with mains <b>plugs</b> is pin.|$|R
5000|$|The Grose Bochse (old German for Große Büchse, [...] "Big Gun") was {{a medieval}} supergun of the Teutonic Order. It was cast from June to September 1408 in several pieces and was presumably {{assembled}} by a screw or <b>plug</b> <b>connection.</b> The cannon was even {{bigger than the}} slightly later finished Faule Grete and may have reached {{the dimensions of the}} largest known bombard by caliber, the Pumhart von Steyr.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, the Luftwaffe {{introduced}} a plugboard switch, called the Uhr (clock), {{a small box}} containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch {{into one of the}} 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these <b>plug</b> <b>connections</b> were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise. In one switch position, the Uhr did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.|$|R
25|$|Several {{manufacturers}} have made deliberately incompatible variants for use where <b>connection</b> with standard <b>plugs</b> is not acceptable. Common uses include filtered supplies for computer equipment and cleaners' supplies in public buildings and areas (to prevent visitors plugging in unauthorised equipment). Examples are one design made by MK {{which has a}} T-shaped earth pin, and the Walsall Gauge 13A plug, which has each pin rotated 90°, the latter being in use on parts of the London Underground for 110V AC supply. and also in some British Rail offices for filtered computer supplies.|$|R
500|$|After 1 October 1936, German {{procedure}} changed, and {{the number}} of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of <b>plug</b> <b>connections.</b> The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's [...] "cyclometer", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations.

Then the wireless power transfer technology is illustrated, showing the convenience of the resonant coupling topologies in increasing the power transfer efficiency. At last, the in-moving technology is introduced and the preliminary studies on it are addressed...|$|R
50|$|Many {{connectors}} are keyed, {{with some}} mechanical component which prevents mating except with a correctly oriented matching connector. This {{can be used}} to prevent incorrect or damaging interconnections, either preventing pins from being damaged by being jammed in at the wrong angle or fitting into imperfectly fitting plugs, or to prevent damaging <b>connections,</b> such as <b>plugging</b> an audio cable into a power outlet. For instance, XLR connectors have a notch to ensure proper orientation, while Mini-DIN plugs have a plastic projection, which fits into a corresponding hole in the socket and prevent different connectors from being pushed together (they also have a notched metal skirt to provide secondary keying).|$|R
50|$|Panel-mounting jacks {{are often}} {{provided}} with switch contacts. Most commonly, a mono jack {{is provided with}} one normally closed (NC) contact, which {{is connected to the}} tip (live) <b>connection</b> when no <b>plug</b> is in the socket, and disconnected when a plug is inserted. Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts, one for the tip (left channel live) and one for the ring or collar (right channel live). Some designs of jack also have such a connection on the sleeve. As this contact is usually ground, it is not much use for signal switching, but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the socket was in use.|$|R
5000|$|Powerpole {{connectors}} {{are available}} with current ratings up to 180 amperes. The size most commonly used is the 15/30/45 ampere-rated variety. These sizes all use the same plastic housing in multiple colors, differing only in the metal contact inserted into the housing (selected based on the ampacity and wire size). [...] The colors {{can be used to}} signify signal types (power, speaker, logic, microphone audio, etc.) or differing voltages. Powerpole connectors can be attached side to side and also stacked {{on top of each other}} to make, for example, four <b>connections</b> with one <b>plug</b> insertion. The contacts are rated for 100,000 no-load insertions and 250 hot-plugs at full load.|$|R
