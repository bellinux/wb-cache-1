25|$|Some chainrings can be {{outfitted}} with a <b>chain</b> <b>guard</b> — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the chainring. Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. <b>Chain</b> <b>guard</b> is usually mounted on the outboard side of the chainring or, in case of multi-sprocket chainring, on the outboard side of the largest chainring. Single-sprocket chainrings may have chain guards on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on multi-speed juvenile bicycles.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} racer, {{featuring a}} tuned engine, front disc brake and finished in bright yellow, {{was known as}} the 'Yellow Peril'. In March to June 1970 the updated S called the 'Roadster' had the 750 cc engine, low-level exhaust, upward-angled silencers with reverse cones. September 1970 saw the introduction of the classic 'Fastback Mk2', which had alloy levers with modified stands and <b>chain</b> <b>guards.</b> The ‘Street Scrambler’ and the ‘Hi Rider’ were launched in May 1971, with the ‘Fastback Long Range’ with increased petrol tank capacity from July 1971.|$|R
50|$|A fully {{enclosed}} <b>chain</b> <b>guard</b> or chaincase enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing trouser clips or rolling up a trouser leg. A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting {{caught in the}} chain or front chainring. While newer designs may use a partial <b>chain</b> <b>guard,</b> the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured.|$|E

5000|$|Most Murray {{bicycles}} {{were for}} the youth market, often featuring one-piece steel Ashtabula cranksets and internally brazed frames using inexpensive seamed or straight-gauge steel tubing. These low-cost parts and materials undercut the prices of Murray's competition, selling millions of bicycles (often with retailer names) to department stores, hardware stores, and general retailers. Schrekengost styled more than 100 mostly youth bicycles for Sears, Western Auto, Firestone Tire, and other retailers, including the Spaceliner, Western Flyer, and Firestone. By modifying <b>chain</b> <b>guards,</b> luggage carriers, lighting, handlebars, and truss rods, Schrekengost gave each bicycle a distinctive look while retaining the same welded tube frame design.|$|R

50|$|Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza {{built the}} Tower of Mendoza {{in the early}} 13th century. He {{attended}} the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 and for having contributed to {{the breaking of the}} siege of the <b>chains</b> that <b>guarded</b> the store of Almohade Muhammad al-Nasir Miramamolin (1199-1213), added to his coat of arms a border With chains.|$|R
2500|$|His {{leadership}} was decisive in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa {{in the year}} 1212. In that engagement, the Christian forces of Sancho, Alfonso, Afonso II of Portugal, and Peter II of Aragón allied to defeat {{the forces of the}} Almohad Caliph Muhammad an-Nasir. [...] Sancho's troops cut the <b>chains</b> <b>guarding</b> the tent and Slavic guards ring of the Miramamolín, supreme commander of the Al-Andalusian Forces. [...] For this, it is believed the chains became the symbol of Navarre and replaced the sable eagle on a golden field with a golden chain on a gules field in the Navarrese coat-of-arms. But others suspect they represented the Basques' star-like Sun of Death seen on their Hilarri (Basques' Stelae) or houses traditionally for protection, and perhaps painted on their shields too with the same religious purpose, meaning of Life or Death, or the new Imagery used for Jesus or Christianity as for others were the Christi Anagram or plain Cross on the shield.|$|R
5000|$|How best to {{lubricate}} a bicycle chain is a commonly debated question among cyclists. Liquid lubricants penetrate {{to the inside}} of the links and are not easily displaced, but quickly attract dirt. [...] "Dry" [...] lubricants, often containing wax or Teflon, are transported by an evaporating solvent, and stay cleaner in use. The cardinal rule for long chain life is never {{to lubricate}} a dirty chain, as this washes abrasive particles into the rollers. Chains should be cleaned before lubrication. The chain should be wiped dry after the lubricant has had enough time to penetrate the links. An alternative approach is to change the (relatively cheap) chain very frequently; then proper care is less important. Some utility bicycles have fully enclosing <b>chain</b> <b>guards,</b> which virtually eliminate chain wear and maintenance. On recumbent bicycles the chain is often run through tubes to prevent it from picking up dirt, and to keep the cyclist's leg free from oil and dirt.|$|R
