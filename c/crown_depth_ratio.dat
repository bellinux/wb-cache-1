40|$|Background and Aims: Morphological {{variation}} in light-foraging strategies potentially plays {{important roles in}} efficient light utilization and carbon assimilation in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments such as tropical moist forest understorey. By considering a suite of morphological traits at various hierarchical scales, we examined the functional significance of crown shape diversity and plasticity in response to canopy openness. Methods: We conducted a field comparative study in French Guiana among tree saplings of 14 co-occurring species differing in light-niche optimum and breadth. Each leaf, axis or crown functional trait was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Key Results: We found divergent patterns between shade-tolerant and heliophilic species {{on the one hand}} and between shade and sun plants on the other. Across species, multiple regression analysis showed that relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was positively correlated with leaf lifespan and not correlated with crown vertical growth rate. Within species displaying a reduction in <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> in the shade, we observed that <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was limited by reduced crown vertical growth rate and not by accelerated leaf or branch shedding. In addition, the study provides contrasting examples of morphological multilevel plastic responses, which allow the maintenance of efficient foliage and enable effective whole-plant light capture in shaded conditions under a moderate vertical light gradient. Conclusions: This result suggests that plastic adjustment of relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> does not reflect a strategy maximizing light capture efficiency. Integrating and scaling-up leaf-level dynamics to shoot- and crown-level helps to interpret in functional and adaptive terms inter- and intraspecific patterns of crown traits and to better understand the mechanism of shade tolerance.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop regression prediction models for tree age, tree height, crown diameter, <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> for A. senegal growing in Ferlo, in the northern Senegal. F our plantations of different years old (ISRA, 10 years old plant ations, Ndodj, 8 years old plantations, Boulal, 5 years old plantations and Déali, 4 years old plantations) were selected. The following dendometric variables : crown height, crown diameter, stem diameter at the breast height, stem basal diameter (at 0. 30 m) and the height from the tree base to first branch were measured on a total of 489 trees. The results suggested that the ecological structure of the different year old A. Senegal plantation revealed a bell-shaped form with left dissymmetric distribution indicating a predominance of individuals with small diameter at breast height. Allometry study of A. Senegal showed highly significant positive correlations (p = 0. 00) between stem diameter at breast height, stem basal diameter, tree height, crown diameter and <b>crown</b> <b>depth.</b> Positive correlations were also found between crown diameter, tree height and crown height.

The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design with three replications in a factorial arrangement.

The results showed that most of phenotypic characteristics significantly altered as a result of endophyte infection in both tall fescue and meadow fescue plants.

The embedment <b>depth</b> <b>ratio</b> of the footing was varied from zero to 0. 75. The plate load tests were performed in an outdoor test pit dug in natural ground measuring 2000 x 2000 mm in plan and 1000 mm in depth. The geocell used in the tests was non-perforated with pocket size 110 x 110 mm 2 and height 100 mm, fabricated from continuous polypropylene filaments as a nonwoven geotextile. The tests were conducted on geocell reinforced bed sand, which was compacted to 85 % relative density.

It emphasizes {{the extraction of}} the 3 D geometric information such as tree location, tree height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> (or <b>crown</b> height), crown radius, and surface curvature. First, trees are modeled as 30 hemi-ellipsoids with the following parameters: tree-top coordinates, trunk base height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>crown</b> radius, and crown surface curvature. This model-based approach turns a tree interpretation task into a problem of optimal tree model determination. Multi-angular images are {{used to determine the}} optimal tree model for each tree.
