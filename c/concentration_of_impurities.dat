40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Green {{function}} method, analytical solutions of the diffusion equation which describes nonstationary migration <b>of</b> nonequilibrium interstitial <b>impurity</b> atoms have been derived. It is supposed that the initial distribution <b>of</b> nonequilibrium <b>impurity</b> interstitials is formed due to ion implantation and, therefore, is described by the Gaussian function. The condition <b>of</b> the constant <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> interstitials (the Dirichlet boundary condition) or reflecting boundary condition was imposed on the surface of a semiconductor. The Dirichlet boundary condition was also enforced for the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> interstitials in the infinity, i. e., in the bulk of a semiconductor. On {{the basis of}} the solutions derived the redistribution of ion-implanted boron in silicon substrate during low-temperature thermal treatment has been simulated. The calculated profile of boron atoms after annealing agrees well with experimental data. It means that the analytical solutions derived can be used both for verifying the numerical results and for modeling the long-range migration <b>of</b> nonequilibrium <b>impurity</b> interstitials during low-temperature thermal treatments.

5000|$|Directional {{solidification}} {{can be used}} as a purification process. Since most impurities will be more soluble in {{the liquid}} than in the solid phase during solidification, impurities will be [...] "pushed" [...] by the solidification front, causing much of the finished casting to have a lower <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> than the feedstock material, while the last solidified metal will be enriched with impurities. This last part of the metal can be scrapped or recycled. The suitability of directional solidification in removing a specific impurity from a certain metal depends on the partition coefficient of the impurity in the metal in question, as described by the Scheil equation. Directional solidification is frequently employed as a purification step in the production of multicrystalline silicon for solar cells.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{deformation}} {{tests on}} ice from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) deep ice core show that ice {{from the different}} climate zones in the ice core has flow properties correlated with the <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> in the sample. The deformation tests are performed by uniaxial unconfined compression at - 16 degrees C with an octahedral compression stress of 3 bars. The ice samples are compressed for 1 / 2 to 3 years until the tertiary strain rate is reached. It is believed {{that by the end}} all downhole flow conditions are forgotten and that the ice sample has settled in a state determined by the applied stress and temperature conditions. All samples are tested under the same stress and temperature conditions so the resulting deformation rates and final ice crystal size and fabrics can only differ due to varying impurity concentrations. The results show that ice from cold climatic periods with high <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> deforms more slowly than ice from warm climatic periods in compression. When tertiary creep is reached, the crystal size is smaller in the cold ice than in the warm. The ice from warmer climatic periods with lower <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> deforms at a factor of 2 - 3 times more rapidly in compression. The tertiary steady state crystal size is increased by 50 % and the ice crystals have oriented more favorably for the applied compression in the warm ice, which {{is believed to be the}} reason why the strain rates are greater here than in the cold ice. In the bottom 200 m of the GRIP ice core, zones are observed with folds on the scale of 1 - 8 cm. An investigation of the ice layers in and around the folds shows that the layers are composed of ice from different climatic zones. The folding is believed to result from the different flow and rheological properties of the layers involved in the folding structures...|$|R
