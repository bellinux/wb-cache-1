5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E
5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he waited longer, {{he would do}} worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, {{beginning}} on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{was more}} {{religious}} than his father, and was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Protestants were resorting to military force, then {{he must do}} likewise. He {{was willing to do}} whatever it took to fight the heretics and preserve Spanish hegemony, even intervening in papal elections to ensure the choosing of a pro-Spanish pope. Philip succeeded three times with popes Urban VII, Gregory XIV, and Innocent IX. But the fourth time, he failed to prevent the election of the pro-French Clement VIII.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{difficult}} to <b>convince</b> oneself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a play results in the capture of opposing stones, self-capture does not occur.|$|R
50|$|Thompson {{ultimately}} <b>convinced</b> King <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he wrote}} such a genre survey, {{he would no}} longer have to answer tedious, repetitive interview questions on the topic.|$|R
5000|$|... “Because of {{the false}} {{empirical}} assumptions of the stay-or-go policy, many of those at the IECC seem to have <b>convinced</b> themselves <b>that</b> <b>if</b> last-minute warnings triggered flight, this would pose a deadlier threat than staying put.|$|R
25|$|Du Plessis's sudden {{decision}} to stop playing rugby before the 1981 tour to New Zealand {{was motivated by}} a combination of mental fatigue and the death of his Western Province teammate, full-back Chris Burger in a Currie Cup match. Playing under Du Plessis' leadership against Free State at Bloemfontein in 1980, 28-year-old Burger died after incurring a neck injury, sustained either while being tackled by two players or during the subsequent loose scrum. Craven tried to convince Du Plessis to continue playing, and remained <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Du Plessis had made himself available for the tour, South Africa would have won the series.|$|E
500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{this were the}} best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe {{as one of the}} most horrible disasters [...] "in the best of all possible worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E
500|$|Hogg {{founded the}} Houston Child Guidance Center in 1929 to provide {{counseling}} for disturbed {{children and their}} families. Hogg was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> children's emotional and mental problems were treated, more serious illness could be prevented in adults. Her interest in mental health came from her father, who had read widely on mental health issues; during his terms as governor, Ima had often accompanied him on visits to state institutions, including charity hospitals and asylums for the mentally ill. She furthered her knowledge of the field while she {{was a student at}} UT, taking several courses in psychology. Ima was convinced that her youngest brother, Tom, would have benefited from similar intervention, as he had reacted badly after their mother's death and as an adult was [...] "restless, impulsive, and alarmingly careless with money". Although her ideas on mental health would be considered mainstream today, in 1929 they were pioneering. In 1972, she told the Houston Chronicle that, of all her activities, she had derived most pleasure from her role in establishing the Houston Child Guidance Center.|$|E

60|$|Stumpy's visage fell. The basket {{could not}} serve him here, {{and the rate}} at which the soup was being ladled out <b>convinced</b> him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he were to return for a jug there would not be much left for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] replied Charley, {{looking in}} despair at his {{unfinished}} viands {{and then at}} the Indian. A glance round the circle seemed further to <b>convince</b> him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not eat it himself there were none of the party likely to do so.|$|R
500|$|The State Department {{created a}} team of diplomats who would support PBSUCCESS. It was led by John Peurifoy, who took over as Ambassador to Guatemala in October 1953. Another {{member of the team}} was William D. Pawley, a wealthy {{businessman}} and diplomat with extensive knowledge of the aviation industry. Peurifoy was a militant anti-communist, and had proven his willingness to work with the CIA during his time as United States Ambassador to Greece. Under Peurifoy's tenure, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, although those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy stated that he was [...] "definitely <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> [...] is not a communist, then he will certainly do until one comes along". Within the CIA, the operation was headed by Deputy Director Frank Wisner, who had worked in the U.S. intelligence service since World War II. The field commander was former U.S. Army Colonel Albert Haney, who was then chief of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney reported directly to Wisner, thereby separating PBSUCCESS from the CIA's Latin American division, a decision which created some tension within the agency.|$|E
500|$|Everton had a young {{but highly}} {{effective}} {{team for the}} 1938–39 campaign, and Lawton was praised {{for the way he}} led the attack, with the Evening Standards Roland Allen describing Lawton as a [...] "clever footballer, bringing his wing men into the game with shrewd flicks and widely flung and accurate passes" [...] after Everton recorded a 2–1 victory over Arsenal at Highbury. The game against Arsenal was part of a run of six wins in the first six games of the campaign, during which time Lawton scored eight goals. Everton lost their lead {{at the top of the}} table to Derby County over Christmas, but returned to form and to first position by Easter. They faced a difficult final run of games, but beat Chelsea and recorded two victories over Sunderland to secure the club's fifth league title, finishing four points ahead of second-place Wolverhampton Wanderers. Lawton scored 35 goals in 38 league games to finish as the division's top-scorer for the second successive season. However, in the summer he wrote to Leicester City to request that the club buy him from Everton; it was reported that he reached out to Leicester as they were managed by Tom Bromilow, his former Burnley manager. Everton were fifth in the league and Lawton was the division's top-scorer with four goals when league football was suspended three games into the 1939–40 season due to the outbreak of World War II. Lawton later remarked that [...] "I'm <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it hadn't been for the War, we'd have won the Championship again, the average age of those players was about 24 or 25".|$|E
2500|$|In September the Rockefeller Brothers Fund {{announced}} it would be divesting its fossil fuel investments totalling $60 million. [...] "We are quite <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [19] We {{have here}} an {{additional}} section to the Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners. The result of long experience <b>convinced</b> him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he possessed {{a spark of}} grace which impelled him to groan after God, all the powers of earth and hell could not destroy him.--Ed.|$|R
60|$|Elsewhere, of course, {{he would}} be ready. Wilson tried to <b>convince</b> him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had been present himself when Angelo {{told him about the}} {{homicide}} committed by Luigi, he would not have considered the act discreditable to Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved.|$|R
50|$|Their {{partnership}} was strained when Pembleton {{investigated the}} accidental shooting {{of a foreign}} exchange student by Tim's cousin, Jim (portrayed by David Morse). Pembleton was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Jim, <b>if</b> only in the few seconds before the shot was fired, was motivated by racism. Pembleton investigates the case vigorously, and is outraged when Jim is acquitted.|$|R
2500|$|Alito {{wrote that}} he was not <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they ruled for the Foundation it would not open a {{floodgate}} of lawsuits, [...] "Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action—be it a conference, proclamation or speech—to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court." [...] In support of this he cited the Foundations own claim against the speech of Rod Paige that had been dismissed by the district court.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{question}} {{regarding the}} timing of the uprising in Macedonia and Thrace implicated an apparent discordance not only among the SMAC and the SMARO, but also among the SMARO's leadership. At the Salonika Congress of January 1903, where Delchev did not participate, an early uprising was debated and it was decided to stage one in the Spring of 1903. This led to fiercing debates among the representatives at the Sofia SMARO's Conference in March 1903. By that time two strong tendecies had crystallized within the SMARO. The right-wing majority was <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Organization would unleash a general uprising, [...] Bulgaria would be provoced to declare war of the Ottomans and after the subsequent intervention of the Great Powers the Еmpire would collapse.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking at the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, on March 26, 2011, Gingrich said, [...] "I {{have two}} grandchildren—Maggie is 11, Robert is 9. I am <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{we do not}} decisively win the {{struggle}} over the nature of America, by the time they're my age {{they will be in}} a secular atheist country, potentially one dominated by radical Islamists and with no understanding of what it once meant to be an American." [...] He referred to his decision to seek office again, pointing to a 2002 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the phrase [...] "under God" [...] in the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional, saying, [...] "I had been watching the courts grow steadily more secular and steadily more anti-religious starting with the 1963 school prayer decision. But for some reason this particular decision struck me as so blindingly stupid, so profoundly un-American." [...] He added, [...] "Bravery will come from our churches, our synagogues, everyday folks. It won't come from the elites. It won't [...] those currently in power because if it could have come from them, it would have." ...|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON. They do {{not look}} at it quite in that way. The most {{worthless}} soldier wants to live for ever. To make him risk being killed by the enemy I have to <b>convince</b> him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he hesitates he will inevitably be shot at dawn by his own comrades for cowardice.|$|R
5000|$|Alfred {{summarised}} his retail {{philosophy in}} an article written in the summer in 1923: [...] "My experience in the motorists' trade has <b>convinced</b> me <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> one can exactly meet the desires of a good class of public, time alone is necessary to make it profitable. Compared with quality, price is relatively important." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robbie's lack of {{concentration}} gets him demoted {{to being a}} forklift, after they discover him using spare toy parts to make new toys: Sebastian Musclewhale and OctoMonkey. Donner arrives at the elves' factory and discovers Robbie and reveals Blitzen's true intentions and <b>convinces</b> him, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he wants his place on the team, he can compete in the Reindeer Games. After looking for [...] "Wise Old Coaches Who Can Save The Day" [...] in the phone book, Robbie and Donner visit to Old Jingle, a mad old coach, {{who lives in a}} teetering house on the top of Pointy Mountain. He decides to take Robbie on as a pupil. In his celebratory happiness, his house slides down the hill. Old Jingle <b>convinces</b> Robbie <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he wants to pull the sleigh, he must win one key event: the Steeple Chase.|$|R

60|$|This little {{touch of}} {{philosophy}} <b>convinced</b> Bax <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he did not}} wish to sit there half the night, the sooner he changed the subject the better, so he called the waiter, and paid his bill, saying to his companions {{that it was time to}} go aboard if they wanted a snooze before tripping the anchor.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Republicans <b>convinced</b> Allen <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she would}} switch {{political}} parties, they would appoint {{her as a}} county commissioner. She did so, and was appointed on July 25, 2006, after resignation from the House. In the 2006 general election, however, Allen was defeated for a full term by Democrat Judy Dodge, and has since {{moved back to the}} Democratic Party.|$|R
5000|$|After an {{abortive}} stay at Union College [...] - [...] {{where he}} was a founder of the Chi Psi Fraternity [...] - [...] Spencer ran away and signed on a whaler at Nantucket.
