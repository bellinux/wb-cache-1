40|$|This study {{involves}} an investigatioh {{into the nature}} and effectiveness of the pre-service training, where provided, of secondary school Mathematics teachers at the 11 <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> administered by the House of Representatives in the Republic of South Africa. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine whether the HDE (Secondary) course offered at some <b>of</b> the aforementioned <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> is justified, In spite of the fact that it contravenes the requirements <b>of</b> the <b>Education</b> Act, No. 73 of 1969. Three different questionnaires were designed and during 1986 were sent to heads of Mathematics departments at the aforementioned <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> to Mathematics teacher educators at these colleges and to beginning secondary school Mathematics teachers, teaching at schools administered by the House of Representatives in the Eastern Cape and Natal. The findings of this study show that the secondary course for Mathematics teachers is only offered at 5 <b>of</b> the 11 <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and only a small percentage of students take this course. During 1986 most of the Mathematics teacher educators at the <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> were not suitably qualified. The study also shows that the Mathematics curriculum for the training of secondary school teachers is inadequate and a revision thereof is thus recommended. An obvious conclusion drawn from the findings is that the training of secondary school Mathematics teachers at these <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> is still in an early stage of development. One of the main recommendations of this study is that the training of secondary school Mathematics teachers at <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> administered by the House of Representatives should be terminated, in view of its ineffectiveness and In accordance with Education Act, No. 73 of 1969. On the other hand, in case this is not possible, suggestions are also made for the improvement of the pre-service training of secondary school mathematics teachers at these <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>education...</b>|$|R

5|$|Doris Louise Sands {{was born}} on 19 June 1921 in St. Agnes, New Providence, The Bahamas, to Sarah Elizabeth (née Fyne) and John Albert Sands. After {{completing}} her secondary education, Sands began teaching {{at the age of}} fifteen. On 3 January 1943 at Zion Baptist Church in Nassau, Sands married Ratal Allen Johnson. They subsequently had one son and Johnson worked for 17 years to earn the money to further her education. Around 1953, she was able to enroll at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education. She returned to the Bahamas in 1956 and joined the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). Granted a four-year government scholarship to further her education in Canada, Johnson enrolled in a master's degree program in educational administration. Beginning her studies at MacDonald <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> of McGill University, she earned her master's degree and began work on her doctorate at the Ontario <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> at the University of Toronto. In the midst of her studies, the government terminated the scholarship during her third year of studying abroad, under the guise that her master's degree had been completed. Johnson believed that the scholarship was terminated because she had been active in organizing. She helped found the Women’s Suffrage Movement in the Bahamas, and in 1958 both the Bahamian Federation of Labour and the National Council of Women, traveling home intermittently during her studies to work towards enfranchisement. She returned home, but was advised that the only available positions for teaching administrators were in outlying islands.|$|E
