The early season weed control treatments consisted of a pre-emergence herbicide, winter rye cover, and radish/pennycress cover mixture. Overall, a flumioxazin, acetochlor, or winter rye treatment were the most effective in reducing weed density, biomass, and seed production. These two treatments generally resulted {{in at least a}} 50 % reduction in total weed density compared to the control. A flumioxazin or winter rye treatment resulted in no weed seed production of common lambsquarters at Site 1 in 2011, compared to 2018 seeds m- 2 in the control. Results demonstrate the importance of early season weed control as part of a comprehensive weed management plan. Soybean row spacing and variety were not as effective in reducing weed density, biomass, and seed production.

40|$|Background: The {{invasive}} {{alien species}} Ambrosia artemisiifolia (<b>common</b> or short <b>ragweed)</b> is increasing its range in Europe. In the UK and the Netherlands airborne concentrations of Ambrosia pollen are usually low. However, more than 30 Ambrosia pollen grains per cubic metre of air (above the level capable to trigger allergic symptoms) were recorded in Leicester (UK) and Leiden (NL) on 4 and 5 September 2014. Objective: The aims {{of this study were}} to determine whether the highly allergenic Ambrosia pollen recorded during the episode could be the result of long distance transport, to identify the potential sources of these pollen grains and describe the conditions that facilitated this possible long distance transport. Methods: Airborne Ambrosia pollen data were collected at 10 sites in Europe. Back trajectory and atmospheric dispersion calculations were performed using HYSPLIT_ 4. Results: Back trajectories calculated at Leicester and Leiden show that higher altitude air masses (1500 m) originated from source areas on the Pannonian Plain and Ukraine. During the episode, air masses veered to the west and passed over the Rhône Valley. Dispersion calculations showed that the atmospheric conditions were suitable for Ambrosia pollen released from the Pannonian Plain and the Rhône Valley to reach the higher levels and enter the air stream moving to Northwest Europe where they were deposited at ground level and recorded by monitoring sites. Conclusions: The study indicates that the Ambrosia pollen grains recorded during the episode in Leicester and Leiden were probably not produced by local sources, but transported long distances from potential source regions in East Europe, i. e. the Pannonian Plain and Ukraine, as well as the Rhône Valley in France...|$|R

Environmental exposure units such as the Allergen BioCube® are valuable models for clinical allergy studies. A study was conducted to validate the Allergen BioCube for uniform ragweed pollen concentrations and clinically relevant sign and symptom responses to ragweed exposure. Methods: Ragweed pollen concentrations were measured on 3 consecutive days in the Allergen BioCube and verified by Rotorod collection and continuous laser particle count measurements. Subjects (N= 10) were exposed to ragweed pollen in the BioCube for 3 hours per day for 3 consecutive days. Subjects assessed their nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion during each BioCube exposure; total nasal symptom score was computed. Peak nasal inspiratory flow was also assessed during BioCube exposure. Results: Uniform ragweed pollen concentrations were obtained throughout each of the 3 -hour testing periods in the Allergen BioCube, both spatially and temporally, at all subject positions, with a low mean standard deviation of 10 %. Pronounced increases in mean total nasal symptom scores (6. 7 ± 0. 94 to 7. 6 ± 0. 86, last 90 minutes of exposure) occurred for all three BioCube ragweed pollen exposure visits. Mean peak nasal inspiratory flow decreased 24 % at 3 hours of BioCube exposure on Day 3. No safety issues of concern occurred in this study.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper we presented the localities in Romania where we identified populations of Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Between 2008 - 2011, investigations were continuing. Our data clearly show that Ambrosia is present throughout the country. The territories heavily infested are railway embankments, along traffic routes, gravel pits, building sites, forest edges, industrial areas, cemeteries and recreational areas. It is quite <b>common</b> to find <b>ragweed</b> in many private gardens, or flower pots in urban areas. The few foci observed along riversides got there by household waste and construction waste. In many rural communities {{find it on}} the drainage ditches. Disturbed and neglected land (on city limits and outside the city), abandonment of land without subsequent turning of stubble and another wrong agricultural practice, absence of ruderal weed control are the main causes that favor the dissemination of our country. Intensity of anthropogenic influence is manifested mainly by transport of materials and soil movement during road rehabilitation and construction of highways. The recent observations show that {{could be expected to}} appear on agricultural fields, now being found only on the outskirts of cultivated land, at 5 - 6 meters from high traffic roads. Ambrosia benefits from human activities to spread. This implies a strong control strategy. The main objective of the fighting activities need to be to reduce damages caused by its pollen and to limit its expansion. If invasion by Ambrosia is left uncontrolled, increase of allergies could heavily augment the treatments. Knowledge about mechanical or chemical control of ragweed could be very important for road and rail services, agricultural institutions, farmers, staff responsible for managing natural areas, institutions that approves and oversees residential sites and factories, responsible personnel of the administrations from cities and rural localities. Reducing the population is more required than simply reducing its biomass. Individual measures often do not solve the real problem. In Timisoara, the fight against such a quarantine organism became in fact obligatory by administrative decision in 2007. A. artemisiifolia has been fought by grubbing and repeated cutting (in parks, along the main roads). This taxa respond to the cutting by producing more secondary branches. Under these conditions we determined and compared several eco-physiological parameters. SLA and SLW are good indicators of leaf toughness. LWL is useful measure of the physiological water status of plants. Leaves of Ambrosia are highly plastic in response to their growing conditions, varying greatly in morphology, anatomy and physiology...|$|R
40|$|Organic tomato growers {{rely heavily}} on tillage, manual weeding, and plastic mulch for weed control in fresh market tomato production. Tillage can {{increase}} soil erosion, disrupt soil aggregates and microbial communities, and may promote weed emergence by breaking weed seed dormancy. Manual weeding and the application and removal of plastic mulch are time consuming {{and can lead to}} increased labor expenses. Weeds are controlled during a critical period, usually 4 to 6 weeks after transplanting tomatoes. Controlling weeds during this period helps prevent yield losses and weeds that emerge after the critical period have little effect on crop yield. Although crop yields are conserved, weeds that emerge after the critical period can produce seed that increases weed seed banks following a tomato crop. Alternative weed management strategies are needed to help improve current weed management practices employed by growers and to reduce the use of cultivation and manual weeding in fresh market tomato production. The objectives of our research were to evaluate the use of cover crops to suppress weeds in fresh market tomato and to evaluate the effect of mowing height and frequency on summer annual weeds. ^ Field experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 and four treatments were examined: 1) tomatoes transplanted into plastic beds (ORG); 2) tomatoes transplanted into plastic beds plus clover sown between crop rows after the critical period (CLOVER); 3) tomatoes transplanted in no-till roller-crimped rye beds plus clover sown between crop rows (MIX); 4) tomatoes transplanted in no-till roller-crimped rye beds (RYE). We found that clover grown as a living mulch between tomato rows after the critical period reduced weed biomass in both years and weed inflorescence in 2010 compared to all other treatments. However, tomato yields were also lower in the CLOVER treatment than in the ORG treatment. Substituting plastic mulch with roller-crimped rye resulted in considerably higher weed biomass and lower yields. Greenhouse experiments conducted in 2011 evaluated the effect of mowing frequency (single and repeated clippings) and mowing height (5, 10, 20 cm) on five summer annual weeds (large crabgrass, barnyardgrass, giant <b>ragweed,</b> <b>common</b> lambsquarters, and velvetleaf). We found that mowing frequency and height reduced the total dry weight of all weed species compared to uncut plants. Weeds cut once were generally able to survive and produce weed seed. Our results suggest that frequent mowing can help suppress summer annual weed growth and seed production but mowing alone may be insufficient for adequate weed control. By addressing these issues, our research contributes to efforts that reduce cultivation and manual weeding while also improving the viability of organic vegetable production in order to help growers meet increasing consumer demands. ...|$|R

40|$|The over-reliance and {{continued}} use of glyphosate as the sole mechanism for weed control {{has led to the}} selection of glyphosate-resistant weeds. New trait technology incorporating 2, 4 -D tolerance in soybean will provide an alternative method to control weeds that are hard to control with glyphosate alone and reduce selection pressure by tank mixing herbicides with 2, 4 -D, but the response of aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase- 12 (AAD- 12) transformed soybean have not been evaluated. In addition, off-site movement of auxinic herbicides on sensitive soybean will be of greater concern as 2, 4 -D and dicamba will be applied at a field-scale level during the peak growing season with new transgenic crops becoming commercially available in the near future. The purpose of my research was to quantify the effects of 2, 4 -D timing and rates on AAD- 12 soybean yield components and AAD- 12 protein expression; characterize the effects of dicamba and 2, 4 -D rates on sensitive soybean plants; and analyze the effect of 2, 4 -D plus glyphosate on summer annual weeds. It is conclude that 1) AAD- 12 soybean plants can tolerate up to 2, 240 g ha- 1 2, 4 -D. Seed yield, seed mass, pod number, seed number, seed per pod, reproductive node number, pods per reproductive node, node number, and percent reproductive nodes were not affected by 2, 4 -D when applied at the V 5, R 2, or the V 5 followed by the R 2 soybean growth stages of AAD- 12 soybean plants. 2) The youngest fully emerged trifoliate in the DAS- 68416 - 4 event had the highest AAD- 12 expression, with means ranging from 369 to 390 ng cm- 2, while the older leaves maintained a lower level of expression, 171 to 211 ng cm- 2. The youngest leaves of event DAS- 21606 - 3 had the highest level of AAD- 12 protein expression (205 to 225 ng cm- 2), while the level of AAD- 12 was lower in older leaves (71 to 149 ng cm- 2). In general, 2, 4 -D treatments did not reduce AAD- 12 protein expression at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after treatment; however, in a few instances AAD- 12 protein expression was increased or decreased by 8 to 11 % after 2, 4 -D treatment. 3) Glyphosate at rates ≥ 840 g ha- 1 controlled giant <b>ragweed,</b> <b>common</b> lambsquarters, common waterhemp, and velvetleaf by 94 to 100 %. Giant ragweed was controlled 99 to 100 % by 2, 4 -D alone when rates were ≥ 280 g ha- 1. Common lambsquarters, common waterhemp, and velvetleaf control increased as 2, 4 -D rates increased, with 1, 120 g ha- 1 providing 90 to 94 % control. 4) Sensitive soybean seed yield was reduced by 5 % when 87 to 116 g ha- 1 2, 4 -D was applied and a 10 % reduction was caused by 149 to 202 g ha- 1 2, 4 -D. 5) Dicamba treatments applied to sensitive soybean reduced seed yield by 5 % from 0. 042 to 0. 528 g ha- 1 and a 10 % reduction was caused by 0. 169 to 1. 1 g ha- 1 dicamba. Path analysis indicated that seeds m- 2, pods m- 2, main stem reproductive nodes m- 2, and main stem nodes m - 2 were the most influential yield components in seed yield formation when either 2, 4 -D or dicamba treatments were applied to sensitive soybean plants. The introduction of 2, 4 -D-tolerant crops will allow add an addition method to control weeds that are resistant to glyphosate while not altering reproduction, but precautions need to be taken to avoid injury to nearby sensitive plants. ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{comprises}} 99 % of most spray {{solutions and}} {{properties of the}} water used as carrier can influence the efficacy of herbicides. Water pH is one property of water which can limit the solubility of some herbicides or cause degradation of herbicides through hydrolysis. Water hardness, or the amount of dissolved cations in water, can reduce herbicide efficacy due to binding of herbicide molecules to cations. The presence of these cations can cause reduced absorption or translocation of the herbicide into plants. Glyphosate is the most studied herbicide {{with respect to the}} influence of water pH and hardness. Some herbicides have also exhibited reduced efficacy when co-applied with other herbicides or foliar fertilizers. Antagonism of herbicides has been documented with protoporphyrinogen IX inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate. Glyphosate has been documented to exhibit reduced phytotoxicity when applied with manganese fertilizer. The objective of this research was to evaluate the response of selected herbicides applied in water with varying pH and hardness, or co-applied with various herbicides and foliar fertilizers. ^ Saflufenacil, a protoporphyrinogen IX inhibitor, was tested to determine a response to five pH levels (4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, and 9. 0) or three water hardness levels (0, 310, and 620 mg L- 1). A field study on common lambsquarters and giant ragweed was conducted as well as a greenhouse bioassay on horseweed and corn to determine the influence of these water properties on saflufenacil efficacy. In both the field and greenhouse experiments, no influence of water hardness was seen when proper adjuvants were included in the spray solution. However, water pH at 4. 0 reduced the efficacy of saflufenacil on common lambsquarters in the field experiments and corn in the greenhouse experiments. High pressure liquid chromatography testing on the solubility of saflufenacil found that the solubility of saflufenacil was reduced from 3, 687 mg L- 1 at pH 7. 7 to 10 mg L- 1 at pH 4. 0. This reduction in solubility may have led to the reduced efficacy on corn in the greenhouse where a pH of 4. 0 showed only 79 % reduction in growth as compared to 87 % reduction in growth with a pH of 7. 7. ^ A second study on saflufenacil was conducted to test if adjusting the pH of the saflufenacil solution would influence efficacy. Saflufenacil was mixed in five different carrier waters with initial pH values of 4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, or 9. 0 and adjusted to one of four final pH levels (4. 0, 6. 5, 9. 0, or no change). When initial pH levels were acidic (4. 0 or 5. 2) and raised to a more neutral pH, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was increased. It was also observed that when initial pH was 6. 5 or 7. 7 and reduced to 4. 0, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was reduced. ^ Saflufenacil was also tested for interaction with fourteen herbicides. A field study was conducted on fallow ground containing <b>common</b> lambsquarters, giant <b>ragweed,</b> and giant foxtail. Saflufenacil co-applied with glyphosate or glufosinate provided the most consistent and best control of giant foxtail and common lambsquarters at 14 days after treatment. At 21 days after treatment, control of common lambsquarters was best with 2, 4 -D and dicamba mixed with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided 85 % or more control of common lambsquarters except imazaquin, imazethapyr, or chlorimuron-methyl co-applied with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided better control of weeds as compared to saflufenacil alone. ^ 2, 4 -D and dicamba, two growth regulator herbicides, were tested for a reduction in efficacy when applied in water with calcium ions, magnesium ions, manganese fertilizer, or zinc fertilizer. 2, 4 -D control of horseweed or redroot pigweed was decreased when ammonium sulfate {{was not included in the}} spray solution regardless of the presence of cations or fertilizers. Overall, 2, 4 -D efficacy was reduced when applied in water containing manganese fertilizer as compared to 2, 4 -D applied in deionized water. The presence of calcium ions decreased 2, 4 -D control of common lambsquarters when ammonium sulfate was not used. Dicamba control of common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed was decreased when applied in water with magnesium or manganese in the absence of ammonium sulfate. No reduction in dicamba control of horseweed was noted across cation solutions, as was seen with 2, 4 -D. ...|$|R

Soybean growth was affected by <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> density however soybean demonstrated no plasticity. <b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> growth was affected by <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> density and irrigation. <b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> demonstrated plasticity by altering specific leaf area and biomass partitioning when in competition with soybean. A field study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of glufosinate-based herbicide programs for season-long control of glyphosate-resistant <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in glufosinate-resistant soybean. The results of this study conclude that glufosinate, paraquat, 2, 4 -D, dimethenamid-P, cloransulam-methyl, or plus chlorimuron ethyl applied preplant (PP) followed by glufosinate applied POST alone or in tank-mixture provided ≥ 84 % control of glyphosate-resistant <b>common</b> <b>ragweed,</b> reduced density to ≤ 20 plants m─ 2, and secured ≥ 1819 kg ha─ 1 soybean yield. Preplant followed by POST resulted in the highest gross profit margins compared to PP alone or PRE followed by POST treatments...|$|E
40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> emerges {{early in}} the season in Nebraska, USA and is {{competitive}} with soybean; therefore, preplant herbicides are important for effective control. Glyphosate {{has been used as a}} preplant control option; however, confirmation of glyphosate-resistant (GR) <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in Nebraska necessitates evaluating other herbicide options. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the efficacy of preplant (PP) herbicides followed by (fb) glufosinate alone or in tank-mixture with imazethapyr, acetochlor, or S-metolachlor applied post-emergence (POST) for control of GR <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in glufosinate-resistant soybean; (2) their effect on <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> density, biomass, and soybean yield; and (3) the partial economics of herbicide programs. A field experiment was conducted in a grower’s field infested with GR <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in Gage County, Nebraska, USA in 2015 and 2016. Preplant herbicide programs containing glufosinate, paraquat, 2, 4 -D, dimethenamid-P, cloransulam-methyl, or high rates of flumioxazin plus chlorimuron-ethyl provided 90 – 99 % control of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> at 21 d after treatment (DAT). The aforementioned PP herbicides fb a POST application of glufosinate alone or in tank-mixture with imazethapyr, acetochlor, or S-metolachlor controlled GR <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> 84 – 98 % at soybean harvest, reduced <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> density (≤ 20 plants m− 2) and biomass by ≥ 93 %, and secured soybean yield 1, 819 – 2, 158 kg ha− 1. The PP fb POST herbicide programs resulted in the highest gross profit margins (US$ 373 –US$ 506) compared to PP alone (US$ 91) or PRE fb POST programs (US$ 158). The results of this study conclude that effective and economical control of GR <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in glufosinate-resistant soybean is achievable with PP fb POST herbicide programs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to {{contribute}} to the reduction of the prevalence of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) in European countries {{in order to reduce the}} burden on public health, agriculture and biodiversity. This will consist of developing strategy elements for the reduction of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> and its pollen in countries where the species is already established, e. g., Hungary, Slovenia, parts of Austria, and Southeastern Europe and for the prevention of further import and spread in countries not yet heavily infested, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Northern European countries. Laboratory and field experiments covered the germination biology and seed bank behaviour and the impacts of chemical and non-chemical control strategies on <b>common</b> <b>ragweed.</b> Trials on integrated control strategies like increased competition on <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> were conducted, too. Desk-top studies on biological control and investigations of the impact of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> on the biodiversity were carried out by associated project partners. Based on these results recommendations for successful control of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> in rural and non-rural areas have been developed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is {{the number}} one weed in Hungary: it covers ca. 5 % of the arable land, causing huge losses in row crops, {{especially}} in sunflowers. In addition, because of the high allergenicity of its pollen, <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> is a heavy burden on the health care system. This minireview discusses the importance of use of herbicide-tolerant sunflower hybrids in eliminating <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> from sunflower fields, with special emphasis on the efficacy of <b>common</b> <b>ragweed</b> control of two acetolactate-synthase inhibitor postemergence herbicides (imazamox and tribenuron methyl) in several sunflower hybrids that carry the resistance gene against such herbicides. <b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> control by these herbicides was excellent: they suppressed the growth of the weed plant until the canopy closure of the crop (8 -leaf stage). <b>Common</b> <b>ragweed</b> plants germinating after this date were unable to compete with the crop: although they survived, they remained small (ca. 70 % reduction in height), produced ca. 90 % less male inflorescences (source of the allergenic pollen), and caused no significant reduction in the crop yield. In order to stop the seed production by the few late-germinating weed plants we recommend a mechanical common measure (row-cultivator) in late August...|$|E
