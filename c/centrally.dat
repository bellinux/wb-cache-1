5|$|The Centre {{can sleep}} 40 people, {{primarily}} in dormitory-style rooms with smaller rooms provided {{for use by}} group leaders. There are both toilet and shower facilities within the building. The building is <b>centrally</b> heated and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi. The building is <b>centrally</b> heated with a large main hall and kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Altar 35 is a plain {{monument}} {{associated with}} Stela 43. The stela-altar pair is <b>centrally</b> {{located at the}} base of the stairway of Temple IV.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest <b>centrally</b> symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest <b>centrally</b> symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two <b>centrally</b> symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{departments}} are located <b>centrally</b> within {{the structure of}} the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.|$|E
5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in bus chassis production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, <b>centrally</b> mounted engine was discontinued, which led to the loss of the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E
5|$|Firoz Shah Palace Complex {{is another}} {{prominent}} historical site located inside the city. It {{was built by}} Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1354. Asigarh Fort, a <b>centrally</b> protected monument, was built in 1304–1305. Historical places from the British era include St. Thomas Church and Jahaj Kothi Museum, a Jain temple converted to a museum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{headquarters}} for the National Council for Negro Women moved to Pennsylvania Avenue, <b>centrally</b> located between the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The former headquarters, where Bethune also lived at one time, has been designated as a National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Like the two {{contemporary}} architects Bramante and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, Leonardo {{experimented with}} designs for <b>centrally</b> planned churches, {{a number of}} which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.|$|E
5|$|Located <b>centrally</b> in North America, {{the state}} is an {{important}} transportation hub. From the Dallas/Fort Worth area, trucks can reach 93 percent of the nation's population within 48 hours, and 37 percent within 24 hours. Texas has 33 foreign trade zones (FTZ), {{the most in the}} nation. In 2004, a combined total of $298 billion of goods passed though Texas FTZs.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{success is}} {{dependent}} {{on a variety of}} factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a “pool–comparison” tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more <b>centrally</b> placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more <b>centrally</b> concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.|$|E
5|$|Nai Talim evolved {{out of his}} {{experiences}} at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937. Nehru government's vision of an industrialised, <b>centrally</b> planned economy after 1947 had scant place for Gandhi's village-oriented approach.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, {{a belief that}} significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that <b>centrally</b> places {{conspiracy theories}} in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush, {{referred}} to locally as the Pine Bush, {{is one of}} the largest of the 20 inland pine barrens in the world. It is <b>centrally</b> located in New York's Capital District within Albany and Schenectady counties, between the cities of Albany and Schenectady. The Albany Pine Bush was formed thousands of years ago, following the drainage of Glacial Lake Albany.|$|E
5|$|The {{orientation}} and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space. The {{placement of the}} city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems. <b>Centrally</b> located Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} binary {{operations}} {{that can be}} viewed as generalizations of the addition operation on the real numbers. The field of abstract algebra is <b>centrally</b> concerned with such generalized operations, and they also appear in set theory and category theory.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. <b>Centrally</b> located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is <b>centrally</b> {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Western Han dynasty, thirteen <b>centrally</b> controlled commanderies—including the capital region—existed in the western third of the empire, while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten semi-autonomous kingdoms. To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings. By 157 BC, the Han court had replaced all of these kings with royal Liu family members, since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned. After several insurrections by Han kings—the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC—the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new <b>centrally</b> controlled commanderies. Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff; this duty was assumed by the imperial court. Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes. The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy reinforced the conventional methods for organising the collective farms. Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed <b>centrally.</b> Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be <b>centrally</b> controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most <b>centrally</b> brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may {{have been based on}} a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make up part of the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by {{only two or three}} police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), <b>centrally</b> controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum was {{circumscribed}} by Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten in 1879 {{with what}} was then known as Hydnum suaveolens as the type species. Before then, fungi with spines (hydnoid fungi) had been grouped in Hydnum by Elias Fries in his 1821 work Systema mycologicum. Karsten defined Hydnellum as having fruitbodies with a corky or leathery, tough cap, and a <b>centrally</b> attached stipe. Synonyms of Hydnellum include Calodon (Karsten, 1881), and Phaeodon (Joseph Schröter, 1888).|$|E
5|$|IIM Lucknow was {{established}} in 1984 and is currently a <b>centrally</b> funded institution. It is the fourth Indian Institute of Management to be established in India (after IIM Calcutta, IIM Ahmedabad, and IIM Bangalore). Noted academician Ishwar Dayal {{played a significant role}} in setting up the institution; he served as the founding director of IIM Lucknow for four years. Industrialist Hari Shankar Singhania, who took over as the chairman of Board of Governors in 1992, served until 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Stackpole {{delivered}} the William A. Coleman Fountain {{to the city}} of Sacramento, a Moderne work (<b>centrally</b> located in what is now known as Cesar Chavez Park) which celebrated the city's completion of a difficult water filtration project. That same year, Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education. Returning with a small Rivera painting, Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William Gerstle (who was initially unimpressed), and began a several-year effort to bring Rivera to work in California.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing <b>centrally</b> is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured <b>centrally</b> for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a <b>centrally</b> managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that {{part of the reason for}} the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E
5|$|John II was {{succeeded by}} his first cousin Manuel I, in 1495. This king {{was the first to}} convert the {{traditional}} square armorial banner into a rectangular (2:3) field with the coat of arms on its centre. Specifically, the flag was now a white rectangle <b>centrally</b> charged with the coat of arms (bearing eleven castles) on an ogival or heater-shaped shield and surmounted by an open royal crown. This flag was used exclusively as the kingdom's banner since Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the armillary sphere for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. <b>Centrally</b> the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{substantive}} federal crimes {{during this period}} were created by two omnibus pieces of legislation: the Crimes Act of 1790 (authored and introduced by Senator and future Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth) and the Crimes Act of 1825 (authored by Justice Joseph Story and introduced by Representative Daniel Webster). Congress also passed a variety of single-subject criminal statutes, which were not <b>centrally</b> codified in any official publication.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{historical}} note, the Jewish {{community has}} figured <b>centrally</b> {{in the history}} of Transylvania, and in that of the wider region. They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar era—between 13 and 15 percent—this figure plummeted {{as a consequence of the}} Holocaust and emigration; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E
5|$|Part I {{authorised}} {{the establishment}} of County Associations under schemes to be drawn up by the Army Council, and laid out the expected form of these associations and their areas of authority. It provided {{that they were to}} be funded <b>centrally</b> but could raise funds in their own right, and that any other regulations necessary for the administration of the associations were to be made by the Army Council. It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered.|$|E
5|$|Poole has eleven infant schools, seven junior schools, ten primary schools, nine {{secondary}} schools, three special schools, five {{independent schools}} and one college of further education. Two of Poole's secondary schools are grammar schools which maintain a selective education system, {{assessed by the}} eleven-plus exam. Poole High School is the largest secondary school in Poole with 1,660 pupils. The Bournemouth and Poole College attracts over 16,000 students a year {{and is one of}} the largest further education colleges in the country and the leading provider of academic and vocational education in Dorset. It has two <b>centrally</b> located main campuses in Poole and Bournemouth.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel <b>centrally</b> as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured <b>centrally</b> and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|Several burials (presumably of {{high-ranking}} benefactors and clergy) {{were made}} within the priory and 19th-century archaeologists found stone coffins during excavations. They are visible against the east wall, but their original location was not recorded. Two <b>centrally</b> placed grave slabs are visible below the east window. The priory once housed the Brus cenotaph, {{a memorial to}} its founders erected in 1521. It was removed in 1540 and dismantled. Most of its parts were recovered and reassembled in the 19th century, and the reconstructed cenotaph is displayed in Saint Nicholas' Church next to the ruins.|$|E
