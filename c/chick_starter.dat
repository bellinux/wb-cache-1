40|$|Phosphorous (P) {{is a key}} {{nutrient}} {{in animal}} production systems. In the beef industry, a primary source of P is through supplementation with mineral blocks. Within the industry, there has been significant conjecture that the method used to manufacture mineral blocks (hot versus cold pour process) could {{have a significant effect}} on P bioavailability. Anecdotal evidence suggests that mineral blocks manufactured using a hot pour process have a greater P bioavailability than those manufactured using a cold pour process. Thus the aim of this study was to determine if manufacturing method did affect P bioavailability in mineral blocks. A chick tibia bone assay (Fernandes et al. 1999) was used to determine bone mineral deposition and thus P bioavailability. The investigation was carried out with 256 day-old male Cobb 500 broiler chickens over a period of 21 days. Eight chicks were allocated to a cage and each cage assigned to one of four treatments (eight replicate cages) in a completely randomized block design. The treatments consisted of four dietary groups: 1) Control group fed a standard broiler <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> diet; 2) MBC group, fed a broiler <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> with the inclusion of MaxiBreed® block - cold pour process; 3) MBH group, fed a broiler <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> with the inclusion of MaxiBreed® block - hot pour process and; 4) PPA group, fed a <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> with the inclusion of Phosphoric acid being the P source in the mineral blocks. Diets were formulated to equivalent nutrient (ME = 10. 0 - 11. 0 MJ/kg) and mineral levels (Available P = 0. 49 - 0. 50 g/kg). Body weight and feed intake were recorded on day 0 and at weekly intervals thereafter. On day 21, 3 birds per cage were euthanized, the tibia removed and the mineral bone ash content quantified. Samples of all diets and P sources from the 4 dietary groups were also collected and analysed. The results indicated that the MBH supplemented diet increased weight gain and significantly improved (P< 0. 0001) FCR of birds compared with the control diet and significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) tibia bone ash percentage compared with all other diets. In contrast, the PPA supplemented diet significantly decreased (P< 0. 0001) body weight gain and resulted in less efficient feed conversion compared with all other treatment groups. The MBC supplemented diet resulted in a numerically lower weight gain and significantly impaired (P< 0. 0001) FCR compared with the control diet. No significant difference in tibia bone P content was observed in the four treatment groups. Although significant effects on growth performance were observed, it is concluded that manufacturing method (hot pour process versus cold pour process) does not affect P bioavailability in mineral blocks. Furthermore, the chick tibia bone ash assay is a useful method in determining mineral availability...|$|E

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate high levels of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in broiler diets throughout a 49 d growing period. Diets were formulated based on digestible amino acid content to contain 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 % DDGS. Diets were formulated to be optimum nutrient density commensurate with approximately 1 % supplemental poultry oil. Each dietary treatment was assigned to four replicate pens with 25 commercial male broiler <b>chicks.</b> <b>Starter</b> (0 - 14 d) and grower (14 - 35 d) diets were fed as pellets with finisher (35 - 49 d) diets fed as mash. Bulk density (mass/volume) was determined on all the diets. Body weights and feed consumption were determined at 14, 35, 42 and 49 d of age. At {{the conclusion of the}} study, five representative birds per pen were processed to determine dressing percentage and parts yield. Generally, the bulk density of pellet or mash diets in all different growth periods decreased as DDGS inclusion rates increased, especially in mash diets. Level of DDGS had little effect on body weight at any age until up to 20 % inclusion, after which body weight declined significantly. Feed intake was not significantly affected by level of DDGS during all the periods except of 0 - 14 d. For the whole period (0 - 49 d), the estimated metabolizable energy intake by chickens was less as DDGS inclusion increased. Increasing DDGS levels significantly increased calorie conversion ratio (CCR, calorie/gain ratio), especially during the period of 0 - 42 and 0 - 49 d. Dressing percentage decreased linearly with increasing DDGS levels from 0 - 50 %. There was a significant reduction in breast meat or leg quarter yield as a percentage of live weight with increasing DDGS inclusion, while birds fed higher levels of DDGS had higher wings as percentage of live weight. These results indicate that up to 30 % DDGS could be used in broiler diets if price was justified. Inclusion of high levels of DDGS reduces the bulk density and pellet quality and may be a major reason for reduced performance. Low energy density of DDGS diets is probably the limiting factor in meeting the energy needs of the chick...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Frequently, {{publications}} {{pertaining to}} waterfowl state that medicated feeds {{should not be}} fed to ducklings and goslings. In some localities, producers and hobbyists who raise {{a small number of}} ducklings and goslings can purchase only medicated chick, turkey, or gamebird starter and grower feeds. Because of the lack of documented information on this subject and the numer-ous requests for advice on this matter, anticoccidial drugs, zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline, and ampro-lium, were mixed in mash feed and fed to Khaki Campbell male ducklings to 4 weeks of age. No significant differences in mean body weight, mortality, and anatomical development were observed among the treatments. Medicated commercial crumble turkey and <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> feeds produced significantly better feed conversion than the mash medicated or nonmedicated feeds. These differences can be attributed to greater feed spillage with the mash feed. Some ducklings in all treatments showed unsteadiness of gait and shaky legs. These conditions disappeared when the ducklings were moved from the battery brooder to an outside pen. Zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline,and amprolium used at the recommended levels for chickens and turkeys did not cause any leg or anatomical problems in ducklings.

The raw and processed bambara groundnuts were used as the sole source of protein in a basal broiler <b>chick</b> <b>starter</b> diet. Soybean based diet served as the control. There were four (4) experimental groups each made up of five birds in three replicates, allocated to the experimental diets. Application of roasting and fermentation techniques were able to reduce the levels of some antinutrients in the bambara groundnut except for oxalate that increased significantly for the fermented sample. The {{results showed that the}} serum parameters like total protein, uric acid and creatinine levels indicated that both roasted and fermented based diet fed to the birds were unable to efficiently make available the nutrients in the diets to the birds. Serum transaminases (GOT and GPT) and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) showed significant (p< 0. 05) increase in the activity of the serum of birds fed on roasted and fermented bamabara groundnut based diet.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the crude protein (CP) equivalence value of Natuzyme-p (NP) enzyme by using regression response equations, two experiments were carried out using Ross (308) broiler chicks. Graded levels of dietary CP (while amino acids levels were kept constant) and NP enzyme were used to derive the regression equation in the first experiment. Four levels of dietary CP and NP enzyme were fed to 160 feather-sexed male broiler <b>chicks</b> during the <b>starter</b> (0 - 28 d of age) and grower (28 - 42 d of age) period. Each diet was offered to four replicates of five chicks in a completely randomized design. Results obtained in experiment one failed to fit a regression equation between BW, dietary CP levels and NP enzyme. In experiment two, graded levels of CP changed along with the levels of lysine (Lys), Met+Cys and threonine (Thr). Regression equations between BW and dietary CP and NP enzyme were derived. Nonlinear and linear equations were generated for enzyme and CP. Based on an assessment of r² and P value, nonlinear equations {{were used to determine}} enzyme equivalence. The derived regression equations of body weight for CP were set to be equal with those obtained for NP and were solved; enzyme equivalence value for CP was calculated by subtracting the obtained value from CP content of basal diet. Crude protein equivalence value of NP at 28 and 42 d of age was estimated to be 0. 96 and 0. 38 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to chemically characterize and biologically evaluate millet offal {{as a replacement for}} maize in the diets of broiler chickens. Two types of millet offal were chemically characterized: the one obtained as a by-product of brewing industry and the other a by-product of pap manufacture. Studies were further carried out to further determine the effects of varying levels of millet offal obtained from the brewing industry on the performance of broiler chickens. The results of the studies indicated that millet offal from the brewery contained 14. 60 % CP, 4. 57 % CF, 2. 25 % EE, 2. 90 % Ash and 2148. 0 kcal/kg ME while the one from pap manufacture contained 20. 65 % CP, 3. 12 % CF, 3. 01 % EE, 3. 36 % Ash and 2506. 0 kcal/kg ME. The results further indicated final body weight values of 602. 02, 605. 85, 605. 83 and 561. 72 g/bird for <b>starter</b> <b>chicks</b> (5 weeks old) and 2283. 7, 2192. 2, 2145. 9 and 1904. 5 g/bird for finisher chickens (9 weeks old). Generally, there was an increase in feed intake as dietary millet offal increased. Feed cost per bird generally decreased when millet offal replaced maize in the diets. Therefore, millet offal can be classified as medium energy and protein sources in poultry diets. Moreover, millet offal can replace up to 50 % maize in the diet without any adverse performance of broiler chickens and at reduced cost of feed production...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate plasma free amino acid concentra-tions in the chick. After one hour of fasting, total plasma amino acid concentration decreased to {{approximately half of the}} full-fed value. Within three to six hours, most amino acids had returned toward the full-fed level but did not exceed it throughout a 48 hour period of starvation. However, after 48 hours fasting lysine, threonine, and isoleucine accumulated three-fold, two-fold and two-fold of the full-fed level, respectively. Serine and glutamic acid exceeded the full-fed level at three hours and then declined. Alanine reached its highest level after six hours of fasting and then declined. In full-fed chicks diurnal variations of plasma free amino acid concentrations were observed. The lowest and highest concentrations were observed at 11 a. m. and 8 to 11 p. m., respectively under a 24 -hr lighting. Reference plasma amino acid patterns are reported for chicks fed a practical diet ad libitum. In day-old chicks, concentrations of total amino acids, methionine plus one half cystine, lysine, and arginine were high. Alanine and glutamic acid concentrations were low. Most amino acid concentrations declined gradually during the first four weeks of life, but methionine plus one half cystine, phenylalanine, threonine and serine concentrations decreased sharply between two and four weeks. Lysine concentration continued to decrease in <b>chicks</b> fed the <b>starter</b> diet. At 20 weeks, plasma amino acid concentrations had decreased considerably except for methionine plus one half cystine and basic amino acids. The plasma amino acid pattern for chicks fed an isolated soybean protein diet was similar to that of chicks fed the practical diet...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{supplementary}} oils—saturated and unsaturated—were examined {{in groups of}} cholesterol-fed cockerels. Unsaturated oils failed to suppress hypercholesterolemia and atherogenesis. When various oils and fats high in oleie acid {{were added to the}} mash, slight lowering of serum cholesterol occurred. Oleie acid per se given to a group was accompanied by a diminution in atherosclerosis.

40|$|Amaranthus cruentus is a {{tropical}} leaf vegetable grown in most tropical {{regions of the}} world for its vegetable protein. The fresh matured leaves of the plant were harvested and sun dried until a moisture content of between 12 - 13 % was obtained. The sun dried leaves (Amaranthus cruentus leaf meal, ACLM) were milled and analysed for their proximate composition. Crude protein was 23. 0 %+ 0. 55; crude fat, 5. 4 %+ 0. 01; crude fibre, 8. 8 %+ 0. 02; ash, 19. 3 %+ 0. 01 and gross energy, 3. 3 + 0. 01 kcal/g all on dry matter basis. Methionine and to a lesser extent, lysine, arginine, leucine and aspartate were high. The ACLM was incorporated into five formulated broiler starter diets at varying inclusion levels. The control diet 1 had no ACLM inclusion. All the six diets including control diet 1 were formulated isocaloric and isonitrogenous and fed to the experimental chicks (n = 540). Birds kept on diet 2 (5 % ACLM inclusion level) had the best average weight gain (WG) of 372. 9 + 29. 94 g/chick. The feed efficiency (FE) value and the protein efficiency ratio (PER) for birds on diet 2 were similar (P > 0. 05) to values obtained for the reference diet. The nitrogen retention (NR) and apparent nitrogen digestibility (AND) values obtained for diet 2 were highest at 1. 48 + 0. 24 gN/chick/day and 63. 12 %+ 10. 28, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 1360 {{male and female}} <b>chicks</b> were fed <b>starter</b> and {{finisher}} diets containing either 0, 1, 2, or 3 % Nutri-Bond in two separate experiments. A different genotype was used in each experiment. No significant treatment effects were observed for mortality or feed conversion. However, male and female body weights in one replicate were lower when diets were fed which contained I utri-Bond. Monetary returns were lower when the diets contained Nutri-Bond. 1980 Poultry Science 59 : 659 - 661 It has been demonstrated that crumbled and/or pelleted feeds have an advantage over all-mash diets for broiler chickens (Proudfoot and Sefton, 1978). Furthermore, pelleted feed which contains excessive fines does not support growth as well as pelleted feeds with low levels (Proudfoot and Sefton, 1978). When diets containing comparatively high levels of corn meal are pelleted, the pellets tend to disintegrate, resulting in excessive quantities of fines. In order to minimize the fines in pelleted broiler diets containing corn meal, pellet binders {{are added to the}} diets. The two most widely used are lignosol (Proudfoot and DeWitt, 1976) and sodium bentonite-anhydrous silicate clay (Scott et al, 1969). More recently, a by-product of the grain industry referred to as "Nutri-Bond" has appeared on the market as a possible pellet binding agent. Nutri-Bond contains 18 % crude protein, 40 % carbohydrate, 15 % salt (NaCl), and 10. 96 MJ/kg metabolizable energy. The feed industry has questioned the effects on performance resulting from the inclusion of Nutri-Bond in broiler feeds. Two separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of feeding 0, 1, 2, and 3 % Nutri-Bond in TABLE 1.

40|$|A 28 -day {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion of Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf meal on the haematological and serum biochemical indices of starter broilers. The Neem leaves used in the experiment were manually harvested, air-dried and milled to become Neem leaf meal. The Neem leaf meal was included in broiler starter diets at 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 % levels, respectively. One hundred and fifty (150) Anak broiler <b>starter</b> <b>chicks</b> raised on a commercial starter mash for one week were used. They were divided into 5 groups of 30 birds each and randomly assigned to the 5 experimental diets in a completely randomized design (CRD). Each group was sub-divided into 3 replicates of 10 birds each and each replicate housed in a pen fitted with necessary brooding facilities. Feed and water were given to them ad libitum for 4 weeks. Proximate analysis of the Neem leaf meal displayed same characteristics as leaf meals from other tropical browse plants - high crude fibre (15. 56 %) and moderate crude protein content (18. 10 %). At {{the end of the}} feeding trial, blood was collected from the birds, 4 per treatment and analysed for haematological and serum biochemical indices. Haemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) of the birds were significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) but not below the level considered normal for birds. No traces of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were observed. Blood sugar was significantly raised (P< 0. 05) by the leaf meal but cholesterol was significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) decreased with increase in leaf meal (P< 0. 05). Serum electrolytes: calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate tended to show that Neem leaf meal up to 10 % dietary inclusion level could still maintain the integrity of the kidney in boosting cation/anion exchange. The haematological and serum biochemical parameters obtained from this study suggested that dietary Neem leaf meal has no deleterious effects on some physiological indices of starter broilers...|$|R
