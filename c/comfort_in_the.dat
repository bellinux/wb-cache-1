This led Nick to seek <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman.

In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband.|$|E
5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did not reflect the dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E

5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

However, both material prosperity and scientific advances prove unsatisfactory to help him since the former can not offer him happiness and the latter only leads to further destruction of the world. By thus portraying Billy Pilgrim <b>the</b> Everyman <b>in</b> his book, Vonnegut exposes a vivid image of post-war Americans who wished to look outward for more choices to achieve their human freedom from their painful memories of <b>the</b> tragedies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. </p...|$|R

25|$|Shoujo, as a tradition, {{is defined}} by this {{contrast}} against a prevailing and dominant masculine culture. Its female-ness is incalculable and omnipresent. Rather than taking <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge that this difference exists, Hagio uses her narratives to question its very foundation, specifically, gender. By undermining the reader's sense of gender and applying scrutiny to the interpretive structures related to it, she is calling into question the very conventions that define the work that they are reading.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian pharaohs {{held the}} highest {{positions}} in Egyptian society, both in {{religious and political}} spheres. Kings were revered as gods in human form. Ellen F. Morris, a professor in Columbia University's Department of Anthropology, suggests that pharaohs used retainer sacrifices {{as a way to}} flaunt their power. She also argues that pharaohs would have to have significant power, in both a political and religious sense, to convince their subjects that it was worth sacrificing their lives on earth for the pharaoh and his <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next life. In addition, their families would have to be convinced that the pharaoh's <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life to come was important enough to allow their loved ones to be sacrificed. This would not be possible if those being sacrificed did not have a very strong belief in the life to come. Egypt's government had to convince the people that the king was a god, and what belonged to him in his life on earth, belonged to him in the afterlife also. Dr. David O'Connor, from New York University Institute of Fine Arts, proposes that subjects of a king being willing to escort him into the afterlife demonstrates that a change had occurred in the way the Egyptians viewed their king.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{electrical}} heating systems, {{the electrical}} power consumption should {{be lower than}} the Contracted Power Limit. Energy distribution devices are used to solve this problem, but they are only concerned with the electrical energy. We claim that this energy distribution must also consider <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building. <b>In</b> this work, an electrical energy distribution MAS for coordinating the electrical heaters is proposed. The MAS is responsible for both objectives: the electrical power must be lower than the Contracted Power Limit and <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building must be maintained if sufficient power is available. The MAS is now being implemented in a real world application of an electrical heating system marketed by a local company...|$|R

25|$|Although Parma {{had taken}} the city, his Protestant opponents took some <b>comfort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the city had been {{destroyed}} {{in the process and}} was of no use as a garrison. Yet this was in no way a Pyrrhic victory; Parma had lost fewer than 500 of his own force, and the Protestant rebels had lost a significant geographical and militarily strategic point, and one of their more intrepid young commanders in Cloedt. Parma had nearly unfettered access to the Electorate's northern regions, called the Niederstift, from which he could mount an attack on the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands. Gebhard renounced of the Electorate in 1588. Despite Ernst of Bavaria's unchallenged possession, Parma continued to acquire and fortify towns throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 4 October morale was low amongst the monarchical troops {{stationed}} in Rossio Square, due to the constant danger of being bombarded by the naval forces and not even the Couceiro's batteries, strategically placed there, could bring them <b>comfort.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> headquarters there were discussions about {{the best position to}} bomb the Rotunda. At 3am, Paiva Couceiro departed with a mobile battery, escorted by a municipal guard squad, and positioned himself in Castro Guimarães Garden, in Torel, waiting for daybreak. When the forces in Rotunda began to shoot on Rossio, revealing their position, Paiva Couceiro opened fire, causing casualties and sowing confusion amongst the rebels. The bombardment continued with advantage towards the monarchical side, but at eight in the morning Paiva Couceiro received orders to stop fighting, as there would be an armistice of an hour.|$|E
