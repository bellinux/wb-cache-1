40|$|This paper {{argues that}} counterpart-theoretic {{accounts}} of modality {{that allow for}} many-one <b>counterpart</b> relations, and thereby make room for contingent identities, {{are not able to}} preserve the transitivity of identity. It will be shown that the translation scheme of <b>counterpart</b> theorists breaks down and that they have to abandon the claim that objects can be contingently identical in virtue of sharing a <b>counterpart.</b> Moreover, modifications of <b>counterpart</b> theory that preserve the transitivity of identity are shown to require jettisoning the idea that the <b>counterpart</b> relation is a similarity relation and greatly reduce the explanatory power of <b>counterpart</b> theory...|$|R

40|$|The main {{question}} {{of this paper}} is whether any modal properties are ascribed to an object or not. According to David Lewis's <b>counterpart</b> theory, the answer is yes and no. It is yes only if we provide appropriate contexts where <b>counterpart</b> relationships hold between possible objects. This sort of <b>counterpart</b> relations is mind-dependent since its establishment depends on what people pay attention to etc [...] It allowed that any objects have any modal properties in this case. On the other hand, the answer is no only if <b>counterpart</b> relations are determined by Lewis's theory of natural properties. This sort of <b>counterpart</b> relations is mind-independent since they are fixed by virtue of objective resemblance between objects, that is, one role of natural properties. I show that there are these two types of <b>counterpart</b> relations in Lewisian metaphysics. Moreover, I point out that the range of mind-independent <b>counterpart</b> relations corresponds to that of possibly nomological possibilities. In the result, any modal properties are not ascribed to possible objects in the case of mind-independent <b>counterpart</b> relationships involved natural properties...|$|R

40|$|Choosing {{the right}} <b>counterpart</b> {{can have a}} {{significant}} impact on negotiation success. Unfortunately, little research has studied such negotiation <b>counterpart</b> decisions. Three studies examined the influence of past negotiations on preferences to negotiate again with a <b>counterpart.</b> Study 1 found that the more favorable a past negotiated agreement the stronger the preference to negotiate with the <b>counterpart</b> in the future. Moreover, this relation was mediated through liking of the <b>counterpart.</b> Study 2 manipulated the difficulty of achieving a favorable agreement in the negotiation and found a significant effect of this situational factor such that subsequent <b>counterpart</b> preferences were less favorable when the negotiation was difficult. Similar to Study 1, this effect was mediated through liking of the <b>counterpart.</b> Study 3 examined the possibility of debiasing negotiator preferences from the biasing influence of situational characteristics by providing relevant information about the negotiation situation. Replicating the results of Study 2, negotiation difficulty affected <b>counterpart</b> preferences before additional information was given or when irrelevant information was given. However, once negotiators received relevant information on the negotiation situation, the effect of negotiation difficulty disappeared. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R
