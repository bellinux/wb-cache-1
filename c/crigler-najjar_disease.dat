40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 25 -year-old man with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> who had since birth a marked unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinemia}} without bilirubin overproduction, without any neurological involvement and in whom phenobarbital administration failed to produce any effect. Analysis of his biliary bile pigments on two occasions showed (i) a decrease excretion of bilirubin, as indirectly suggested by a high ratio of biliary bile acids over total bilirubin; (ii) an increase in unconjugated bilirubin IX alpha quantitated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) following alkaline methanolysis and by direct extraction and TLC of the tetrapyrroles; (iii) a high proportion of bilirubin monoconjugates whereas the excretion of diconjugates was very low. Classification of the present patient into <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> type I or II was not possible. The most striking and practical difference among the various cases of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> remains the response to phenobarbital.

40|$|Phenobarbital response, {{bile pigment}} composition, and the {{fractional}} biliary excretion ratio of bilirubin were studied in nine children with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease.</b> In five children, serum bilirubin levels decreased during phenobarbital treatment by 26 % {{or more and}} the pigment composition in bile changed with {{a decrease in the}} proportion of unconjugated bilirubin from 33 % +/- 12 % to 13 % +/- 1 % and an increase in monoconjugates and diconjugates from 57 % +/- 14 % and 10 % +/- 2 %, respectively, to 72 % +/- 4 % and 16 % +/- 3 %. In four children, serum bilirubin levels did not change significantly during phenobarbital treatment. In these patients, bile pigments comprised 91 % +/- 10 % unconjugated bilirubin, 9 % +/- 11 % monoconjugates, and 1 % +/- 1 % diconjugates. On the basis of these differences, the former group can be classified as having type 2 <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> and the latter, type 1. Bile pigment analysis in parents of patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> showed an increased proportion of monoconjugates in {{at least one of the}} partners in three of four couples tested, despite normal serum bilirubin levels. Serum bilirubin levels were about the same in type 1 and 2 patients and amounted to 236 +/- 62 mumol/L and 214 +/- 82 mumol/L, respectively. In addition the fractional bilirubin excretion ratio, calculated as the ratio ([bilirubin in bile]/[bilirubin in serum]) /([bile acid in bile]/[bile acid in serum]) could not differentiate between these two groups. However, there was a 10 -fold and 100 -fold difference of this ratio between patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> and those with Gilbert's syndrome and between patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> and controls.

40|$|Background & Aims: Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as {{occurs in}} <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> and {{neonatal}} jaundice, carries {{the risk of}} neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity {{is related to the}} increased passage of free bilirubin (UCBfree) the fraction of bilirubin that is not bound to plasma proteins, into the brain. We hypothesized that albumin treatment would lower the UCBfree fraction, and thus decrease bilirubin accumulation in the brain. Methods: We treated chronic (e. g., as a model for <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease)</b> and acute hemolytic (e. g., as a model for neonatal jaundice) moderate hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats with phototherapy, human serum albumin (HSA) or phototherapy + HSA. Results: In the chronic model, adjunct HSA increased the efficacy of phototherapy; it decreased plasma UCBfree and brain bilirubin by 88 % and 67 %, respectively (p Conclusions: We showed that adjunct HSA treatment decreases brain bilirubin levels in phototherapy-treated Gunn rats. We hypothesize that HSA decreases these levels by lowering UCBfree in the plasma. Our results support the feasibility of adjunct albumin treatment in patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> or neonatal jaundice. (C) 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

40|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinemia}} in <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>disease</b> is conventionally {{treated with}} phototherapy and phenobarbital. Orlistat treatment increases fecal fat excretion and decreases plasma unconjugated bifirubin (UCB) concentrations in Gunn rats, the animal model for CN disease. We determined in CN patients {{the effects of}} orlistat treatment on plasma UCB concentrations, and on fecal excretion of fat and UCB. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial was conducted in 16 patients, simultaneous with their regular treatment (phototherapy, n = 11, and/or phenobarbital, n = 6). Patients received orlistat or place bo, each for 4 - 6 wk. Compared with placebo, orlistat increased fecal fat excretion (+ 333 %) and fecal UCB excretion (+ 43 %). Orlistat treatment significantly decreased plasma UCB concentration (- 9 %). In 7 of 16 patients, the decrease in plasma UCB levels was clinically relevant (> 10 %, mean 21 %). In patients with a clinically relevant response, plasma UCB concentrations during orlistat were strongly, negatively correlated with fecal fat excretion (r = - 0. 93). Clinically relevant response to orlistat treatment was not correlated with age, sex, CN type, BMI, or co-treatment with phototherapy or phenobarbital, but appeared correlated with a relatively lower dietary fat intake. In conclusion, orlistat treatment decreases plasma UCB concentrations, particularly in a subgroup of CN patients. Dietary fat intake may determine the responsiveness to orlistat treatment...|$|R

40|$|Gilbert's {{syndrome}} is {{typically associated with}} a deficiency in hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (B-GTA). The overproduction of bilirubin that is often found in this condition could be a fortuitous coincidence {{that leads to the}} unmasking of the disease, which otherwise often remains latent. Some cases of chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia could, however, be related to a defect in hepatic uptake, as reflected by alterations in BSP kinetics. Severe deficiencies of hepatic B-GTA exist in all types of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease.</b> An increased proportion of bilirubin monoglucuronide is always found in bile when a B-GTA deficiency is present. This observation strongly suggests a common biochemical defect in Gilbert's syndrome and in <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease,</b> and thus renders the suggestion that the latter condition may be separated into two groups somewhat inappropriate. There is, however, no doubt that further knowledge of the conjugating enzyme, or enzymes, is required: such information may lead to the characterisation of several types of enzymic defects. Whereas little is new as far as the Dubin-Johnson {{syndrome is}} concerned, Rotor's syndrome can no longer be considered to be a variant of the former. The transport defect which is involved in most cases of Rotor's syndrome, if not in all, is an impairment of hepatic storage, thus distinguishing it from the impairment of excretion which is involved in the Dubin-Johnson syndrome. The distinct patterns of urinary coproporphyrin excretion, which were recently reported in Dubin-Johnson and Rotor's syndromes, offer additional evidence for a clear differentiation between these two entities...|$|E
40|$|The {{end product}} of the {{breakdown}} of the heme group of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins is bilirubin. Bilirubin is hydrophobic and cannot be excreted as such. Therefore, mammals have a liver enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (B-UGT), which conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid, thereby making the molecule much more water soluble. Bilirubin glucuronides are secreted into bile. Patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>disease</b> have a deficiency in bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and accumulate high serum levels of bilirubin. An animal model for CN disease is the Gunn rat. The obvious target for gene therapy for CN disease is the liver, but because liver cells do only divide infrequently, they are difficult to transduce. To investigate whether cells that are easily transduced can be used to develop gene therapy for CN disease, we have transduced Gunn rat fibroblasts with B-UGT, using a recombinant retrovirus. Gunn rat fibroblasts expressing B-UGT were able to glucuronidate bilirubin present in cell culture media. In this study, we describe the intraperitoneal transplantation of Gunn rats with Gunn rat fibroblasts expressing B-UGT. Transplantation of the fibroblasts corrected the genetic deficiency of the Gunn rats, serum bilirubin concentrations of the transplanted Gunn rats were reduced to normal, and bilirubin glucuronides appeared in bile. However, due to the prolonged period of cell culture, the transplanted fibroblasts were transformed, and the experimental animals developed tumors after transplantatio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>disease</b> is an {{inherited}} disorder of bilirubin metabolism. The disease {{is caused by}} a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (B-UGT). Patients with CN disease have high serum levels of the toxic compound, unconjugated bilirubin. The only defect in bilirubin metabolism of CN patients is the absence of B-UGT activity. The transplantation of cells able to glucuronidate bilirubin should therefore lower serum bilirubin levels. The Gunn rat is the animal model of CN disease. Primary Gunn rat fibroblasts (GURF) were transduced with a recombinant retrovirus, capable of transferring B-UGT cDNA. A cell line was obtained expressing B-UGT at a level comparable to hepatocytes. Bilirubin added to the culture medium of these cells was glucuronidated and excreted. The B-UGT activities of transduced GURF and freshly isolated Wistar hepatocytes were compared at different bilirubin concentrations. The specific B-UGT activities of these two cell types were comparable when physiological bilirubin concentrations (5 - 10 microM) were present in the culture media. At higher bilirubin concentrations (20 - 80 microM) the hepatocytes were more active than the transduced GURF. We conclude that with the addition of only one enzyme (B-UGT) fibroblasts can perform the complete set of reactions necessary for bilirubin glucuronidation. The difference in B-UGT activity between transduced GURF and hepatocytes at 20 - 80 microM bilirubin can be explained by lower UDP-glucuronic acid and glutathione S-transferase levels in GURF. Our findings also indicate that these cells could be used to develop extrahepatic gene therapy for CN diseas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>disease</b> is {{classified}} into two subtypes, type I and II. The molecular {{basis for the}} difference between these types is not well understood. Several mutations in the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase (B-UGT) gene of six CN type I and two CN type II patients were identified. Recombinant cDNAs containing these mutations were expressed in COS cells. B-UGT activity was measured using HPLC and the amount of expressed protein was quantitated using a sandwich ELISA. This enabled us to determine the specific activities of the expressed enzymes. All type I patients examined had mutations in the B-UGT 1 gene that lead to completely inactive enzymes. The mutations in the B-UGT 1 gene of patients with CN type II only partially inactivated the enzyme. At saturating concentrations of bilirubin (75 microM) CN type II patient A had 4. 4 +/- 2 % residual activity and CN type II patient B had 38 +/- 2 % residual activity. Kinetic constants for the glucuronidation of bilirubin were determined. The affinities for bilirubin of B-UGT 1 expressed in COS cells and B-UGT from human liver microsomes were similar with Km of 5. 1 +/- 0. 9 microM and 7. 9 +/- 5. 3 microM, respectively. B-UGT 1 from patient B had a tenfold decreased affinity for bilirubin, Km = 56 +/- 23 microM. At physiological concentrations of bilirubin both type II patients will have a strongly reduced conjugation capacity, whereas type I patients have no B-UGT activity. We conclude that CN type I is caused by a complete absence of functional B-UGT and that in CN type II B-UGT activity is reduce...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 23 -yr-old man who had had since birth marked and {{sustained}} unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia and who had had several attacks of grand mal seizures. Analysis of serum bilirubin by diazoreactive methods showed serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin as high as 445 mumol/L that were not affected by phenobarbital administration. However, analysis of serum bile pigments by high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated marked decrease of unconjugated bilirubin after phenobarbital treatment (from 432. 4 mumol/L to 291. 0 mumol/L) associated with slight increase of bilirubin monoconjugates and disconjugates (from 0. 25 mumol/L to 0. 42 mumol/L).

40|$|SUMMARY Three {{cases of}} chronic nonhaemolytic {{jaundice}} with conjugated bilirubin in the serum an {{described in a}} Chinese family. Bromsulphthalein excretion tests gave results typical of the Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Liver histology in the proband showed cytoplasmic pigment of the lipofuscin-melanin variety, and intravenous cholecystography failed to show visualisation of the gallbladder. Unusual findings included onset during the neonatal period in the proband {{and the presence of}} some iron pigment in the hepatic cells with a little canalicular cholestasis. It is suggested that the infant may have had a concomitant nonspecific hepatitis. These cases are regarded as belonging to a disease group in which the Dubin-Johnson syndrome is at one end of a spectrum. The mode of inheritance is discussed. The hereditary defects in bilirubin metabolism are rare and incompletely understood causes ofjaundice.

As the normal endothelial fenestration and lentiviral vectors are similar in size (150 [*]nm), we hypothesized that a transient increase in hepatic blood pressure may enhance in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes.

40|$|Gilbert's {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurring {{in the absence of}} liver disease or haemolysis. Total plasma bilirubin can be as high as 80 mumol/l and mild intermittent jaundice does occur. The inheritance pattern is probably autosomal recessive. It has been estimated that some 10 - 15 % of the Western population suffers from Gilbert's syndrome. Bilirubin-uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT 1 A 1) is the only enzyme involved in the conjugation of bilirubin. In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, hepatic glucuronidation by UGT 1 A 1 is reduced to about 30 % of normal.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{differentiate}} between <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>disease</b> types 1 and 2. DESIGN: The patterns of serum bilirubins, bile pigment composition, and phenobarbital response were studied. PATIENTS: Three infants, affected by high serum unconjugated bilirubin concentrations, previously classified as type 1 CN. METHODS: Serum and bile bilirubin pigment composition, {{both before and}} after phenobarbital (PB) treatment, were determined by alkaline methanolysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography. PB was given for at least 3 weeks by oral administration (5 mg/kg bw per day). RESULTS: No diconjugated bilirubin was found either before or after PB treatment in the serum of the three studied infants. In two patients traces of monoconjugated bilirubin were detected before PB therapy, and the ratio of conjugated/total bilirubin (percent) was increased by the PB response. In the third patient, traces of monoconjugated bilirubin appeared only after PB administration. However, the serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration decreased significantly only in the second patient, following the second cycle of PB treatment, leading to the diagnosis of type 2 CN. The analysis of the methyl ester derivatives of bile pigments was also performed on bile samples obtained in two patients by Entero-Test (R) {{both before and after}} PB treatment. An absolute increment in monoesterified bilirubin concentration was found after PB administration, although the percent concentration increased in one case and decreased in the other. No diesterified bilirubin was detected in the bile samples. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that in types 1 and 2 CN disease it is possible to detect traces of monoconjugated but not diconjugated bilirubin both in serum and in bile. Whereas PB treatment is effective in slightly increasing the serum monoconjugated bilirubin concentration even in type 1 CN disease, the diagnosis of type 1 or 2 is based on finding a substantial decrease of serum unconjugated bilirubin following PB administration...|$|R

40|$|Trabalho Final de Mestrado Integrado, Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2014 Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is a {{rare disease}} {{characterized}} by an unconjugated hyperbilirrubinemia since birth. This disease is classified into two distinct forms: Crigler-Najjar type 1 and Crigler-Najjar type 2. The Crigler-Najjar type 1 {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder with a complete deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate- 5 '-glucuronosyltransferase type 1 enzyme (UGT 1 A 1) activity, {{resulting in a total}} loss of bilirubin glucuronidation. This condition can be fatal due to the permanent and severe unconjugated hyperbilirrubinemia associated with kernicterus. Patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> type 2 have residual UGT 1 A 1 activity, resulting in a milder phenotype. These patients are still able to conjugate and excrete bilirubin via the bile. Bile of type 2 patients contains mono-conjugates and some bi-conjugates, although the bile of type 1 patients contains essentially no conjugated bilirubin. Patients with Crigler-Najjar type 2 can be treated with phenobarbital, which enhances the residual UGT 1 A 1 activity and decreases plasma UCB concentrations by approximately 30 %. In order to decrease plasma UCB levels, Crigler- Najjar type 1 patients rely on lifelong phototherapy, the routine treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Because liver transplantation is the only available curative treatment for liver-based inborn errors of metabolism, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was performed in six patients with CN. Mean age at surgery was 52. 5 months (range 27 to 100). Despite a mean daily phototherapy of 12. 4 +/- 0. 8 hr, mean bilirubin of the 6 patients was 388 microM/L (range 175 to 703) before OLT; {{one of them was}} also being treated with tin-protoporphyrin. All 6 had elevated AST/ALT, ranging from 1. 4 to 6 times upper normal values. Complications occurred in three patients after OLT, including miliary tuberculosis in one, graft rejection and retransplantation in one, and hepatic artery thrombosis in one. All patients survive with normal serum bilirubin level (follow up 6 to 116 months). Four have normal enzymes on post-OLT follow-up (30 to 95 months), follow a normal education program, and have a normal social life. One recently transplanted patient has progressively normalizing liver function tests 6 months after OLT. One patient transplanted at 8 y. o. (now 116 months post-OLT) has moderate neurological delay due to pretransplant kernicterus, and posttransplant chronic persistent hepatitis.

40|$|UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) play an {{important}} role in detoxification of endo- and xenobiotics. Deficiencies of these enzymes can have serious consequences, for example, in <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> Type I. Recently it was shown that the activated form of the abundant food-derived carcinogen 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP) is glucuronidated mainly by UGT 1 isoforms. Therefore UGT 1 deficiency may have {{an important}} impact on metabolism and excretion of PhIP in the body and consequently for the susceptibility toward carcinogenic effects through PhIP. To test this hypothesis we investigated fate and distribution of PhIP in the UGT 1 -deficient Gunn rat. In 2 h after intravenous injection of PhIP, Gunn rats excreted significantly more PhIP and metabolites than control animals, which were age- and weight-matched Wistar rats. In bile, both glucuronides of N-OH-PhIP were reduced but, in urine, only the N 3 -glucuronide was reduced while the N 2 -glucuronide was elevated. The metabolic pathway ratio between 4 '-hydroxylation and N-hydroxylation was dramatically changed in the Gunn rat (five times higher in bile and doubled in urine, resulting in a four times higher ratio in total), mostly because of the doubled amount of 4 '-PhIP-sulfate in Gunn rats compared to Wistar rats. Tissue levels of PhIP and metabolites were significantly lower in liver and colon of the Gunn rats. We conclude that, in Gunn rats, PhIP is alternatively metabolized through UGT 2 B enzymes and sulfotransferases, which adds another clue to the potential importance of sulfotransferases in detoxification of PhI...|$|E

40|$|Patients with Crigler-Najjar {{syndrome}} and Gunn rats cannot form bilirubin glucuronides owing {{to a lack}} of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. Because increased serum and tissue bilirubin levels remain constant, an alternative excretory route has to substitute for this deficiency. Gunn rats excrete in bile only 2 - 13 % of the bilirubins eliminated in Wistar rats. In contrast, the biliary excretion rate of urobilinogen in Gunn and Wistar rats is comparable. The sum of bilirubins and urobilinogen excreted in the bile of Gum rats amounts to 10 - 30 % of pigments excreted in Wistar rats. Despite this low biliary excretion, the intestinal content and fecal excretion of bile pigments in Gunn and Wistar rats were similar. These data support an extrabiliary entrance of unconjugated bilirubin into the intestine. Additional proof for this was found in that the intestinal lumen of Gunn rats still contains a high amount of bilirubins and urobilinogen after 3 d of external biliary drainage. A similar procedure in Wistar rats resulted in the complete disappearance of bile pigments from the intestine. The direct transmural transport of bilirubin from blood to all parts of the intestinal lumen was demonstrated by injecting C- 14 -bilirubin i. v. into Gunn rats with isolated parts of small and large intestine. In Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert's syndrome patients, the biliary excretion of bile pigments has previously been shown to be strongly reduced. Their stools, however, contained approximately the same amount of bile pigments as in normal subjects. Although only traces of unconjugated bilirubin were detected in the stool of normal persons (4 +/- 3 % of total bile pigments), higher amounts were found in patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> (20 +/- 12 &). These results suggest a direct intestinal permeation of unconjugated bilirubin in severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia both in man and rats...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} serum bilirubins was {{determined}} in serum {{of humans and}} rats with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to increased pigment load or defective hepatic conjugation. Bilirubin ester conjugates were present in all serum samples tested and were identified as bilirubin 1 -O-acyl glucuronides. In Gilbert's syndrome, the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in healthy control subjects. Because the concentration of unconjugated pigment was increased, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins was markedly decreased. Sera from patients with <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>disease</b> differed from those with Gilbert's syndrome by the higher unconjugated bilirubin levels and the undetectability of diconjugated bilirubins. A striking finding was that in hemolytic disease, the concentration of both monoconjugates and diconjugates was enhanced in parallel {{with the increase of}} unconjugated pigment. Therefore, the fraction of conjugated relative to total bilirubins remained within the normal range. As in Gilbert's syndrome, heterozygote R/APfd-j/+ rats with impaired hepatic bilirubin conjugation exhibit an increased unconjugated bilirubin level in serum, whereas the concentration of total conjugates was comparable to the values in normal rats. In serum of normal rats loaded intraperitoneally with unconjugated bilirubin, both unconjugated and mono- and diconjugated bilirubins were increased in parallel so that the ratio of unconjugated to esterified pigment remained unaffected. Decreased hepatic conjugation or increased bilirubin load was associated with a lower percentage of diconjugates relative to total conjugates both in human and rat serum. The present results are consistent with a compartmental model in which there is bidirectional transfer across the sinusoidal membrane for unconjugated bilirubin {{as well as for the}} bilirubin glucuronides. Because typical patterns of serum bilirubins are found in Gilbert's syndrome and patients with hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia, determination of esterified bilirubins in serum is of value to study the pathophysiology and the differential diagnosis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. status: publishe...|$|E
