25|$|Safety {{features}} on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full braking power, was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> <b>system.</b> The front passenger airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Lexus GS came standard with dual front airbags, front driver and passenger knee airbags, {{front and rear}} row side curtain airbags, and front row side torso airbags standard while rear row side torso airbags were optional. An Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) was standard on the V8 model while optional on the V6 model. The radar-based Pre-Collision System (PCS) with a Dynamic Radar <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> <b>system</b> was optional. PCS can automatically apply up to 0.3g of deceleration if the driver does not react to imminent crash warnings. Anti-lock braking, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) are standard on all models. VSC with the electric power steering system can immediately alter steering torque assist during evasive maneuvers.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{negative}} feedback, the diagram might represent a <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. [...] The error signal is {{the departure of the}} speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.|$|E

2500|$|On February 9, 2010, Toyota {{announced}} a voluntary global recall of third generation 2010 Prius models manufactured {{from the current}} model's introduction through late January. Affected models, including 133,000 Prius vehicles in the U.S. and 52,000 in Europe, are to receive an anti-lock brake software update to fix brake response over rough roads, following reports of delayed braking response on certain surface conditions. Apple co-founder and Prius collector Steve Wozniak was also quoted by media outlets regarding a possible cruise control issue {{on one of his}} several Priuses, where the steps for [...] "upping the speed" [...] using the Dynamic Radar <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> <b>system</b> allegedly caused unintended acceleration. Wozniak later maintained that he was misquoted, but did have an individual vehicle and customer service issue, while auto journalists and other Prius drivers suggested user error. On March 8, 2010, a publicized incident of alleged Prius acceleration in San Diego was later suspected to be a hoax or not repeatable. The manufacturer shared that 713,000 Prius in North America, 997,000 in Japan, another 130,000 in Europe and the rest in other regions are being recalled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with safety in (cooper-ative) adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> In these systems, {{the speed of the}} cars is maintained automatically, based on the preferred speed of the driver and the speed of the preceding car. Technologies that are used in these systems, such as radar and radio communication, introduce many factors of uncertainty in the system. In this paper, we present models for different adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> strategies, in which this uncertainty is explicitly modelled. By simulating emergency braking situations under these uncertain circumstances, we find the minimal safe time headway for these strategies. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of fuel consumption models use vehicle tractive power and/or velocity as explanatory variables. These models {{appear to be}} simple and easy to implement, however they suffer from two major drawbacks, namely: (a) the use of vehicle specific power results in a bang- bang control (i. e. the optimum fuel consumption results from a full throttle acceleration) if higher orders of power are not considered in the model; and (b) the calibration of the model parameters cannot be done using publicly available data and thus requires field data collection for each vehicle. Consequently, the research {{presented in this paper}} develops two simple fuel consumption models that do not result in a bang-bang <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and that can be calibrated easily using publicly available data. Specifically, the models can be calibrated using the Environmental Protection Agency city and highway fuel economy ratings that are publicly available. The models are demonstrated to estimate vehicle fuel consumption rates consistent with in-field measurements (coefficient of determination above 0. 90). Finally, a procedure for estimating CO 2 emissions is developed producing emission estimates that are highly correlated with field measurements (greater than 0. 98). The development of this model attempts to bridge the existing gap between traditional power-based fuel consumption models and vehicle operational <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> such as fuel-optimized <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> real-time eco-driving <b>systems,</b> and adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> on passenger cars using road topography information. status: publishe...|$|R
