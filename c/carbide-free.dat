50|$|Bainite {{occupies}} a region {{between these two}} process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. In contrast to pearlite, where the ferrite and cementite grow cooperatively, bainite forms by the transformation of carbon-supersaturated ferrite with the subsequent diffusion of carbon and the precipitation of carbides. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them <b>carbide-free.</b> At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.|$|E

It is demonstrated that this nanostructure, generated by isothermal transformation at 200 ◦ C, has a {{resistance to wear}} that supersedes that of other <b>carbide-free</b> bainitic steels transformed at higher temperatures. The experimental results, in combination with a theoretical analysis of rolling/sliding indicates that under the conditions studied, the role of sliding is minimal, so that the maximum shear stresses during contact are generated below the contact surface. Thus, the hardness following testing is found to reach a maximum below the contact surface. The fine scale and associated strength of the structure combats wear during the running-in period, but the volume fraction, stability and morphology of retained austenite {{plays a significant role}} during wear, by work-hardening the surfacethroughphase transformation into very hard martensite.

40|$|AbstractIntergranular {{cracking}} {{behaviors in}} water quenched 2. 25 Cr- 1. 5 W heat-resistant steels are {{understood in the}} light of the formation of grain boundary carbides and the impurities segregation to grain boundaries or carbide interface at the grain boundaries. Before stress rupture tests, all materials were water-quenched after holding at 1050 °C for 1 h. The microstructure showed a typical lath martensite. Heating rate was 1200 °C/h to a testing temperature and stress rupture test was performed without any soaking. At a fixed temperature, time to failure increased as the applied stress decreased. Irrespective of the bulk contents of P, the fracture mode was intergranular except for a condition corresponding to a longer time to failure. From AES analyses, the crater interface where grain boundary carbides had existed showed a segregation concentration of P much higher than that at the <b>carbide-free</b> grain boundaries, resulting from the much higher interface energy. The phosphorus segregation at the carbide interfaces of the alloy containing the higher bulk content of phosphorus is mainly replaced by the segregation of nitrogen, tin and tellurium in the alloy containing a lower bulk content of phosphorus. These results suggest that the intergranular cracking follows the sequence from the crater interface to the <b>carbide-free</b> grain boundaries...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{has been focused}} on the wear resistance of <b>carbide–free</b> bainitic steels and other microstructures of steels like conventional bainite, pearlite and quench & tempered (Q&T) martensite. The material which is used to create a <b>carbide-free</b> bainitic microstructure has 0. 6 %C and 1. 73 %Si. The rolling–sliding wear tests are performed in tribology lab on a Twin disc machine. The results are analyzed by using optical microscope, SEM, Optical surface profiler, XRD and Vickers hardness test. The results showed that ausferritic steel has excellent wear resistance in comparison to steels with other microstructures. The wear rate difference between ausferritic and other steels is almost twice that of the difference between AF 250 and AF 300. This proves that the austempered ausferritic steel has a very good wear resistance. The other samples with pearlitic, quenched and tempered martensitic and bainitic microstructures showed higher wear rate. The deformed layer thickness is found to be deeper for steels with ausferritic microstructures and the hardness increased more than 300 HV over the initial bulk hardness for these steels. This increase might be due to plastic deformation and to the strain induced martensitic transformation of the retained austenite. Steels with other microstructures as bainite, pearlite and quenched and tempered martensite showed an increase in hardness along with an increase in deformation layer thickness which was lower than for steels with ausferritic microstructures.

The nanostructuring treatment consisted of austempering with an isothermal quenching at 240 °C and 300 °C. The conventional heat treatment consisted on quenching and tempering at 350 °C for 1 h and quenching and tempering at 550 °C for 1 h. Time and temperature of tempering was chosen so that the hardness of both samples (nanostructured as well as quenched and tempered) was similar. The microstructure of steel after each heat treatment was described {{with the use of}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was shown, that the austempering conducted at 240 °C produced homogenous nanobainitic structure consisting of <b>carbide-free</b> bainite plates with nanometric thickness separated by the layers of retained austenite. The austempering at 300 °C produced a sub-micrometric <b>carbide-free</b> bainite with retained austenite in form of layers and small blocks.

The novel non-equilibrium heat {{treatment}} procedure known as Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) may offer {{the prospect of}} higher strength steel products with enhanced formability based upon martensitic microstructures containing controlled quantities of carbon-enriched retained austenite.

The concept is comparable to that producing <b>carbide-free</b> bainite, for example, in TRIP-assisted steel, although Q&P allows separation of the ferrite formation and austenite enrichment stages of the process. However, although the Q&P concept is readily understood, evolution of the microstructure during interrupted quenching and partitioning has been inferred indirectly from dilatometer studies and metallographic examination after final quenching to room temperature.

The compacts of ultralow carbon Fe-Cr-Mo powder with carbon additions (base metal powder admixed with 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 wt. % graphite) and without carbon addition (plain base powder) were sintered in a vacuum furnace at pressure of 1. 28 x 10 - 5 MPa at 1280 ˚C for 45 min. After sintering, the sintered specimens were continuously cooled with different nitrogen gas pressures of 0, 2500 and 5000 mbars (or 0, 0. 25, 0. 5 MPa). Mechanical properties of the sintered alloys were strongly controlled by carbon contents and cooling rates after sintering. The sintered specimens, with 0. 3 wt. % carbon and cooled by nitrogen of 5000 mbars, showing superior tensile strengths and good ductility, had microstructures dominated by <b>carbide-free</b> bainitic structures and some retained austenite. The sintered specimens with lower carbon contents and cooled under slower cooling rates, having lower tensile strengths but slightly higher ductility, had microstructures with lower bainite volume fractions and even without bainitic structures. The dominant phase in the sintered specimens with low strength but high ductility was ferrite...|$|E
