5|$|Several {{calls of}} red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} have been recorded. The bird's contact <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a rolling metallic krur-rr or kree, which may carry long distances and is always given while flying; its alarm <b>call</b> <b>is</b> sharp. Displaying males vocalize {{a sequence of}} soft growling followed by a repetitive kred-kred-kred-kred.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long <b>call</b> <b>is</b> heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm <b>call</b> <b>is</b> given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a {{familiar}} sound, {{particularly during the}} breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's <b>call</b> <b>is</b> higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} <b>calls</b> have <b>been</b> recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|R
5|$|The most usual <b>call</b> <b>is</b> CaaW!-CaaW!-CaaW!.|$|E
5|$|The bird's song can be {{described}} as a buzzed zee-zee-zeeee with an upward inflection. Its <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a flat ctuk.|$|E
5|$|The contact <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a very quiet, {{thin and}} high-pitched sit, {{but the most}} {{distinctive}} <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a penetrating tsree, with a vibrato quality, sometimes repeated {{as a series of}} notes. The male's song begins with srrih, srrih followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.|$|E
50|$|International {{telephone}} <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{those made}} between different countries. These telephone <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> processed by international gateway exchanges (switches). Charges for these <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> high initially but declined greatly during the 20th century due to {{advances in technology}} and liberalization. Originally they were placed via long-distance operators. The <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> transmitted by cable, communications satellite, radio, and more recently, fiber optics and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). International Direct Dialling {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, so <b>calls</b> can <b>be</b> dialed by country code without an operator.|$|R
5000|$|Hog calling, or pig <b>calling,</b> <b>is</b> the art {{of making}} a call to {{encourage}} pigs to approach the caller. The skill is mainly used by pig farmers, {{and to a lesser}} extent by hunters. Competitions in hog <b>calling</b> <b>are</b> held. [...] Mechanical or electronic pig <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> available for hunting.|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{under the}} purview of the Bell System, local {{telephone}} <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> typically unmetered and included in flat rate billing. The term toll <b>calling</b> <b>was</b> adopted for long distance <b>calls</b> which <b>were</b> subject to toll charges.|$|R
5|$|The male's <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a soft proop-proop whistle, {{similar to}} that of the common teal, whereas the female has a mallard-like {{descending}} quack, and a low croak when flushed.|$|E
5|$|The rasping {{advertising}} <b>call</b> <b>is</b> readily {{distinguished from}} the hwitt-hwitt-hwitt of spotted crake, the monotonous clockwork tak-tak-tak-tak-tak of striped crake, or the quick-quick of Baillon's crake. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E

50|$|Before direct {{distance}} dialing (DDD) all long-distance <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> {{established by}} special switchboard operators (long-distance operators) even in exchanges where calls within the local exchange were dialed directly. Completion of long-distance <b>calls</b> <b>was</b> time-consuming and costly as each <b>call</b> <b>was</b> handled by multiple operators in multiple cities. Record keeping was also more complex, as the duration of every toll <b>call</b> had to <b>be</b> manually recorded for billing purposes.|$|R
50|$|After the {{consolidation}} in 2012, all dispatch <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> routed through Santa Cruz Fire Department's dispatch center. Previously, dispatch <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> sent through UC Santa Cruz's own dispatch center.|$|R
5|$|A loon’s wail is a {{long call}} {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> given {{back and forth between}} breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or in an attempt to move closer together after being separated. It is a loud aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} <b>call</b> <b>is</b> repeated. This <b>call</b> <b>is</b> made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E
5|$|Mother-cub vocalisations: Apart from chirping, mothers {{use some}} other sounds to {{interact}} with their cubs. A repeated ihn ihn is used to gather the cubs, while a prr prr is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm <b>call</b> <b>is</b> used to warn the cubs to stand still {{in the presence of}} danger.|$|E
50|$|The contact <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{very loud}} series of steeply {{ascending}} notes pee-koko... pee-koko followed by more abrupt notes. Numerous other vocalizations {{such as a}} low kweer <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> produced in other behavioural contexts. Some <b>calls</b> appear to <b>be</b> antiphonal duets.|$|R

5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has {{cinnamon}} upperparts, brownish crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts. Its redder coloration and small size led German naturalist Ernst Hartert to describe it as a distinct taxon in 1906. The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to those of}} the Australian subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter, {{known in}} Europe as Professor Layton and the Spectre's <b>Call,</b> <b>is</b> a puzzle {{adventure}} video game produced by Level-5 for the Nintendo DS handheld game console.

5|$|The Cape sparrow's {{calls are}} chirps {{similar to those}} of the house sparrow, but much more musical and mellow. The basic <b>call</b> <b>is</b> used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E
50|$|Singing <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{based on}} a sung {{delivery}} of calls, most often to a recognizable melody, and square dance <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{mixed in with the}} song's original lyrics. Many widely recognized songs have been turned into singing calls. The primary purpose of singing <b>calls</b> <b>is</b> to help the dancers relax, dance well together as a group, and enjoy the song and the caller's performance.|$|R
50|$|Remote <b>call</b> {{forwarding}} <b>is</b> also a {{means for}} a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign exchange line, this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> flat-rated but trunk <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> expensive.|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight <b>call</b> <b>is</b> intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' <b>call</b> <b>is</b> much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow's {{chirping}} chup <b>call</b> <b>is</b> softer, less strident, {{and higher}} pitched {{than that of}} the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.|$|E

5000|$|Cold <b>calling</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} the {{solicitation}} of business from potential customers who have had no prior contact with the salesperson conducting the call. [...] Cold <b>calling</b> <b>is</b> used to attempt to convince potential customers to purchase either the salesperson’s product or service. Cold <b>calling</b> <b>is</b> generally referred to as an over-the-phone process, making it a source of telemarketing, but can also be done in-person by door-to-door salespeople. Though cold <b>calling</b> can <b>be</b> used as a legitimate business tool, scammers can use cold calling as well.|$|R
40|$|In the spawing season, sound {{production}} of captive walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas) was {{examined by the}} grunt call projection method. The pollock emitted four patterns of grunt calls, namely threatening call, aggressive-attacking call, courting call, and mating call. The sound frequency of these grunt <b>calls</b> <b>is</b> less than 800 Hz. The characteristics of walleye pollock behaviour matching each grunt <b>call</b> <b>are</b> as follows: (1) Only one threatening grunt <b>call</b> <b>was</b> emitted by the superior male to threaten other males encountered. (2) Aggressive-attacking grunt <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> emitted from two to five times in order to drive out other males from the male's occupied space. Behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (3) Courting <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> emitted from six to twelve times in order to court other males and females which are characterized by swimming faster than usual. The behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (4) Mating grunt <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made more than thirteen times in order to mate with mature females. Behaviour included chasing, and dorsal, lateral and ventral mounting...|$|R
