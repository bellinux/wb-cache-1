40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of Kegel exercises on reducing urinary incontinence symptoms in women with stress urinary incontinence. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted on females with stress urinary incontinence who had done Kegel exercises and met inclusion criteria in articles published between 1966 and 2012. The articles from periodicals indexed in KoreaMed, NDSL, Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, and other databases were selected, using key terms such as “Kegel” or “pelvic floor exercise. ” Cochrane’s risk of bias was applied to assess the internal validity of the RCTs. Eleven selected studies were analyzed by meta-analysis using RevMan 5. 1. Results. Eleven trials involving 510 women met the inclusion criteria. All trials contributed data to one or more of the main or secondary outcomes. They indicated that Kegel exercises significantly reduced the urinary incontinence symptoms of female stress urinary incontinence. There was no heterogeneity in the selected studies except the standardized bladder volumes of the pad test. Conclusion. There is some evidence that, for women with stress urinary incontinence, Kegel exercises may help manage urinary incontinence. However, while these results are helpful for understanding how to treat or <b>cure</b> <b>stress</b> urinary incontinence, further research is still required...|$|E
40|$|Stress urinary {{incontinence}} {{is a symptom}} that arises from damage to the muscles, nerves, and connective tissue of the pelvic floor. Urethral support, vesical neck function, and function of the urethral muscles are important determinants of continence. The urethra {{is supported by the}} action of the levator ani muscles through their connection to the endopelvic fascia of the anterior vaginal wall.

Although the traditional attitude has been to ignore the urethra as a factor contributing to continence, it does play a role in determining stress continence since in 50 % of continent women, urine enters the urethra during increases in abdominal pressure, where it is stopped before it can escape from the external meatus.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVT-O 5 -yr implantation for management of pure SUI in women. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective observational study was conducted in four tertiary reference centers. Consecutive women presenting with urodynamically proven, pure SUI treated by TVT-O were included. Patients with mixed incontinence and/or anatomic evidence of pelvic organ prolapse were excluded. Intervention: TVT-O implantation without any associated procedure. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Data regarding subjective outcomes (International Consultation on Incontinence-Short Form [ICIQ-SF], Patient Global Impression of Improvement, patient satisfaction scores), objective <b>cure</b> (<b>stress</b> test) rates, and adverse events were collected during follow-up. Multivariable analyses were performed to investigate outcomes. Results and limitations: Of the 191 women included, 21 (11. 0 %) had previously undergone a failed anti-incontinence surgical procedure. Six (3. 1 %) patients were lost to follow-up. The 5 -yr subjective and objective cure rates were 90. 3 % and 90. 8 %, respectively. De novo overactive bladder (OAB) was reported by 24. 3 % of patients at 5 -yr follow-up. Median ICIQ-SF score significantly improved from 17 (interquartile range [IQR]: 16 - 17) preoperatively to 0 (IQR: 0 - 2) (p < 0. 0001). Failure of a previous anti-incontinence procedure was the only independent predictor of subjective recurrence of SUI (hazard ratio [HR]: 4. 4; p = 0. 009) or objective (HR: 3. 7; p = 0. 02).

Recent experimental data suggests that the non-linearity is not only caused by matrix cracking but also by matrix plasticity due to shear stresses.

This paper reports the results of the latest investigation, in which the stress sensing system has been used to explore the chemo-thermo-mechanical effects of the epoxy underfill within a typical flip chip module. In-situ readings of all 60 measuring cells of the stress chip were performed cyclically during the entire underfill process. So, it was possible to clearly distinguish between the <b>stresses</b> <b>curing</b> of the underfill at the process temperature and the stresses induced by thermal shrinkage of the epoxy during the subsequent cooling - even as functions of process and design parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal {{effects on}} the pin-bearing {{behavior}} of an IM 7 /PETI 5 composite laminate are studied comprehensively within this paper. Pin-bearing tests of several lay-ups at the operating temperatures of 129, 21, and 177 C are conducted to generate data {{on the effect of}} temperature changes on the pin-bearing behavior of the IM 7 /PETI 5 material. A unique computational study investigating the factors influencing pin-bearing strength is performed for the [90, 0] 8 s lay-up. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model is developed including the modeling of resin layers between plies in the laminate with a pin hole. Using a previously established technique, the pin-bearing problem was modeled assuming a rigid frictionless pin and restraining only radial displacements at the hole boundary. An original three-dimensional solution, where thermal residual stresses were combined with the state of stress due to pin-bearing loads was evaluated. The presence of thermal residual stresses were observed to intensify the interlaminar stresses predicted at the hole boundary in the pin-bearing problem. Furthermore, the research shows that changes in material properties drives pin-bearing strength degradation with increasing temperature. The thermal residual <b>cure</b> <b>stresses</b> then somewhat affect the extent that the pin-bearing strength changes with temperature.

40|$|The main {{result of}} {{underground}} mining extraction is creating of large underground voids (mine stopes). These empty openings are typically backfilled with an engineering cementitious material called cemented paste backfill (CPB). The {{main purpose of}} CPB application in underground mining is to provide stability and {{ensure the safety of}} underground openings, maximize ore recovery, and also provide an environmental-friendly means of underground disposal of potential acid generating tailings. CPB is a mixture of mine tailings, cement binder and water. CPB has a complex geotechnical behaviour when poured into mine voids. This is because of the different thermal (T), hydraulic (H), mechanical (M) and chemical coupled processes and interactions that take place in CPB soon after placement. In addition to these THMC behaviours, various external factors, such as stope geometry, drainage condition and arching effects add more complexity to its behaviour. In order to acquire a full understanding of CPB behaviour, {{there is a need to}} consider all of these THMC factors and processes together. So far, there has not been any study that addresses this research need. Indeed, fundamental knowledge of the THMC behaviour of CPB provides a key means for designing safe and cost-effective backfill structures, as well as optimizing mining cycles and productivity of mines. Innovative experimental tools and CPB testing methods have been developed and adopted in this research to fulfill the objectives of this research. In the first phase of the study, experiments with high columns are developed to study the THMC behaviour of CPB from early to advanced ages with respect to height of the column and curing time. The column experiments simulate the mine stope and filling sequence and provide an opportunity to study external factors, such as evaporation, on the THMC behaviour of CPB. However, an important factor is the overburden pressure from the stress due to self-weight that cannot be simulated through column experiments. Therefore, in the second phase of this study, a novel THMC <b>curing</b> under <b>stress</b> apparatus is developed to study the THMC behaviour of CPB under various pressures due to the self-weight of the CPB, drainage conditions, and filling rate and sequence. Comprehensive instrumentation and geotechnical testing are carried out to obtain fundamental knowledge on the THMC behaviour of CPB in different curing conditions from early to advanced ages. The results of these studies show that the THMC properties of CPB are coupled. Important parameters, such as <b>curing</b> <b>stress,</b> self-desiccation due to cement hydration, temperature, pore water chemistry, and mineralogical and chemical properties of the tailings, have significant influence on the shear strength and compressive strength development of CPB. Factors such as evaporation and drying iii shrinkage can also affect the hydro-mechanical properties of CPB. The curing conditions (such as <b>curing</b> <b>stress,</b> drainage and filling rate) also has significant impact on CPB behaviour and performance.

Reduction of 5. 31 % was observed for a cross-ply laminate experimentally, the ultimate failure strength was predicted for the same using progressive failure to an accuracy of plus/minus 3 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{curing process}} of fibrous {{composite}} materials takes {{place during the}} last stage of the manufacturing. The differences in free contraction between the fibres and the matrix cause, during {{this stage of the}} process, the appearance of residual stresses. The presence of these stresses may affect both the strength and the stiffness of the laminate and also have influence on the development of failure mechanisms in the material. The study of residual stresses at macro- and meso-mechanical level is widely developed, there being several methods able to quantify them, Andersson et al. [1]. By contrast, at micromechanical level, due to the high complexity of the material at this scale, the measurement and prediction of residual stresses presents more difficulties. The development of reliable failure criteria for composite materials is a particularly active field of research, Hinton [2, 3]. Thus, if knowledge of the mechanisms of failure at micromechanical level is considered to be fundamental for the development of failure criteria able to perform a more complete diagnosis of the appearance of these mechanisms, París [4], the analysis of the influence of <b>curing</b> <b>stresses</b> at this scale then acquires high relevance...|$|R

The conclusion summarizes the information processed and examines the future development of the issues involving the spiritual care rendered to the law enforcement officers under the provisions of a modern society...|$|R
5000|$|Clematis vitalba {{was used}} to make rope during the Stone Age in Switzerland. In Slovenia, the stems of the plant were used for weaving baskets for onions and also for binding crops. It was {{particularly}} useful for binding sheaves of grain because mice do not gnaw on it. In Italy, the sprouts are harvested to make omelettes (called [...] "vitalbini" [...] in Tuscany, [...] "visoni" [...] in Veneto). It is also widely considered {{in the medical community}} to be an effective <b>cure</b> for <b>stress</b> and nerves.|$|R
