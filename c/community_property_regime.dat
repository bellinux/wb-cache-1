40|$|The {{provisions}} of art. 312 of the Civil Code establish: a legal system, {{that is the}} <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> and two types of conventional regimes: the regime of separation of goods and the regime of conventional community (the latter includes conventional derogation from <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime).</b> Legal matrimonial regime includes assets acquired by each spouse during marriage, except property required by law, which represents each spouse’s own assets. Community legal regime will apply in all situations in which prospective spouses opt for separation of property regime or the regime of conventional community. Separation of property regime {{is characterized by the}} fact that each of the spouses is the exclusive owner of their current assets and of those acquired alone after the dissolution of marriage, for the adoption of this regime the spouses being forced to draw up an inventory of movable property belonging to each one at the contracting of marriage.

40|$|Community {{property}} {{is thought to}} be a more equitable marital property regime than the common law because we assume that providing each spouse with an interest in fifty percent of the family’s income also provides a substantial amount of equality between spouses. Historically, however, as the regime operated in the United States, it was not especially favorable to wives. Although the concept implied a partnership between spouses, in practice wives were denied rights a partner would expect to enjoy. This article examines how women lobbied to enlarge the protection California wives enjoyed under the state’s <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> in the early twentieth century. Women adopted a strategy that does not conform to Progressive Era stereotypes. Women’s groups argued that couples would receive a federal income tax reduction if the state’s property system gave more rights to wives. Women’s use of these anti-tax arguments helped further their goals of equalizing spouses’ rights and obligations until the tacit political alliance of women and wealthy taxpayers unwound...|$|E

40|$|When the Supreme Court decided Poe v. Seaborn in 1930, {{it did not}} {{foresee the}} {{mischief}} its decision would cause in later years. Seaborn held that, under the community property law {{of the state of}} Washington, each spouse had a vested interest in one half of all community property, including income, notwithstanding the husband’s right to control and manage the property. Accordingly, spouses in community property states were entitled to split their income for income tax purposes. This gave married persons in community states a decided advantage over their counterparts in common law states, who could not enjoy this advantage. Because of this geographical disparity, Congress, in 1948, enacted the joint filing provisions giving all married persons the right to file joint returns and thus split their incomes. However, this legislation itself created a series of problems, to wit: the marriage penalty, innocent spouse issues, problems in division of marital assets in divorce, and estate issues. Recently, when the California legislature extended its community property law to cover Registered Domestic Partners (RDPs), Seaborn was pressed into service to allow income splitting for California RDPs, who are not spouses under federal law. This again has produced a series of geographic disparities in tax treatment of same sex unions in common law and community property states. Moreover, the extension of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> to non-married persons is itself a departure from the age-old understanding that community property is a marital property regime solely applicable to married persons...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{communities}} in conservation in central Philippines, {{with reference to}} marine protected areas. It analyzes communities as intersections of multiple actors with stratified interests and power, involving complex processes of place-making, ecological knowledge, tenure, governance, markets, and negotiation with domestic and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As rights to places are fundamentally at issue with protected areas, matters of tenure are central for the study. And because marine protected areas (MPAs) are community-based, questions of local empowerment have equal centrality. The ownership of rights to marine resources by village members is a necessary if not sufficient condition for the political empowerment of communities in conservation. The issue of property rights in the Philippines is irrevocably linked to issues of equity, as social actors confront prevailing unequal relations of power. The development of community commitment to the reconfigured arrangements of marine protected area establishment depends on substantial economic gains for marginalized villagers, an equitable distribution of those gain, the ecologically sound management of resources over which rights are negotiated and gains generated, and a socially meaningful realignment of relations of power among nested sources of authority. My analysis points to the advantages of a reinforced <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> that would call for measures by the national government to enhance villagers' tenure over their settlements and community waters (katubigang barangay). Such a regime is no panacea for the manifold social and environmental challenges faced by communities, but it {{would enable them to}} engage more confidently and constructively with state, NGO and other interests in conservation, and to address the real or perceived threats of dislocation by externally proposed schemes.

Focusing on Oklahoma, {{the first state to}} switch, this article traces these laws from initial proposals through their repeal after Congress enacted nationalized income-splitting in 1948. Earlier studies have focused on the impact of these laws, primarily on wives as secondary earners within families, and not on their development. From the various political and social forces precipitating this trend, this study explores the actual reasons states adopted these regimes and shows that an economic goal, namely reducing married couples 2 ̆ 7 federal income taxes, drove state legislatures. Thus, while examining state legislative processes, this paper shows the goal of federal tax reduction led to changes in an entirely separate area of state law. This analysis also provides a new perspective on the American federal system, illustrating the complex and reciprocal relationship between state and federal laws and incentives. While initially states altered their domestic laws to give their residents a benefit under the federal tax code, using the federal system to win benefits for their residents vis-a-vis those of other states, these state-law changes ultimately induced the federal government to adopt a uniform national policy on income-splitting...|$|R
40|$|Background: Property {{rights to}} natural {{resources}} comprise a major policy instrument {{in efforts to}} advance sustainable resource use and conservation. Debate over the relative effectiveness of different <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> in reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the links between <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence from {{the past two decades}} on the environmental impacts of <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> in fisheries, forests and rangelands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>regimes,</b> as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive, negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influence effect of <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three languages, resulting in a total of 34, 984 screened titles. Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> studies: 55 % of the studies related to forestry, 31 % to fisheries, and 14 % to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case–control studies but presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-aftercontrol- impact (BACI) design. We found that <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> comparisons differed across resource domains with, for example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmental outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pressure, and {{the presence or absence of}} clear, stable and legitimate rights (i. e. ‘positive regime characteristics’). Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclusions about the environmental impacts of different <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> within or across resource systems. The majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on <b>property</b> rights <b>regimes</b> would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe <b>property</b> rights <b>regime</b> characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes...|$|R

Since the 1970 ’s, several Amazonian peasant communities have demanded political and legal support for their management practices and property rights. Sixty-two riverine communities of the Brazilian Amazon basin and their accomplishments in managing collective owned fisheries were studied from September/ 1997 to June/ 1999.

The survey collected data on asset ownership both at the household and individual levels. This allows us to overcome a typical problem faced by gender analyses, that of only having the sex of the household head and not the sex of the owner(s). The study explores gender differences in homeownership and housing wealth. There is fairly equal distribution of homeownership and housing wealth, which is not all that surprising given the partial <b>community</b> <b>property</b> marital <b>regime.</b> Any <b>property</b> purchased during marriage or while in a consensual union is considered joint property, unless it is inherited, in which case it is considered individually-owned property. This plus the fact that housing is an asset typically acquired during marriage/consensual union may help explain the relatively egalitarian distribution pattern of housing ownership and housing wealth. There are, however, gender differences in the determinants of homeownership and housing wealth. Past migration is associated with women owning homes and owning more housing wealth but does not seem to impact men’s homeownership or housing wealth. An extra year of schooling increases men’s housing wealth more than women’s housing wealth and women living in the coastal region own less housing wealth than men in the region. homeownership, gender, marital <b>regime,</b> partial <b>community</b> <b>property</b> rights, Ecuador, International Development,...|$|R

40|$|Agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> {{interact}} with relevant property stakeholders’ behaviors and benefits, playing {{a vital role}} in national and regional cultivated land use. In China, state and collective agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> are the two main forms of cultivated land use. To help fully realize the multi-objectives of cultivated land use benefits provided by agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes,</b> our study investigated the relationship between agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> and cultivated land use. This paper describes the role of a cultivated land use system in facilitating the relationship between agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> and cultivated land use from a geographical perspective. Understanding the cultivated land use system is the foundation for comparatively analyzing differences in the cultivated land use benefits in two adjacent areas, a state-owned regime and a collective regime, in the city of Fujin, China, through a comprehensive evaluation. We found the following results: (1) The arrangement of agrarian property rights directly reflects capital, material and technology inputs by motivating agricultural labors to obtain different economic benefits; (2) The state agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> reflects top-down agricultural management while the collective agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regime</b> reflects bottom-up agricultural management in China. The different agricultural managements influence planting structure and land use planning, resulting in different ecological benefits; (3) Labor division and social insurance are the main drivers of different social benefits from the two regimes. Examining cultivated land use benefits provides a new comparative perspective for studying agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes.</b> The results show that cultivated land use benefits from collective and state agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> are different. These findings clarify that, incentivized by the different types of agrarian property ownerships represented by collectively and state-owned regimes, local governments and organizations aim to achieve the multi-objective cultivated land use benefit goal of Chinese agricultural development, including economic, ecological and social benefits. With China’s goal of conducting moderate agricultural reform in its agrarian <b>property</b> <b>regime,</b> verification of rural collective land rights is an effective form of asset management in collective areas in China, while deepening land tenure and usufruct is an important priority in state-owned regimes.

Rural communities were characterized by a number of social and economic issues, especially individualism, lack of trust, corruption, and poverty.

A vast body of research has addressed the question of under what (external) conditions decentralised {{collective action}} will succeed (for a recent review, see Agarwal 200 1, specificallyin the context of forests, see Ostrom 1998). But there seems much less debate, let alone agreement, on the question of relationships between local-level collective action institutions and other institutions at different levels. From the perspective of those interested in proving that community-level institutions of resource management can and do work, often the only role the state can (and should) play is "non interference" or at most "legitimisation"? Ifthe need for "nested enterprises" has been recognised, {{it is only in the}} case of common-pool resources that are part of a larger system (Ostrom 1990 : 90). Even here, the precise meaning and form of "nestedness" are yet to be elaborated. 4 The focus has remained on the conditions of success for local-level collective actionin which the state implicitly has a minimal role. Others have recognised that the neat separation of state, <b>community</b> and private <b>property</b> <b>regimes</b> is only a theoretical one, and that in fact resource rights or tenure regimes are better characterised as variations in the manner in which different strand...|$|R

50|$|In the United States {{there are}} nine <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaska has also adopted a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> system, but it is optional. Spouses may create <b>community</b> <b>property</b> by {{entering}} into a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> agreement or by creating a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> trust. In 2010, Tennessee adopted a law similar to Alaska's and allows residents and non-residents to opt into <b>community</b> <b>property</b> through a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> trust. The commonwealth of Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as <b>community</b> <b>property</b> also as do several Native American jurisdictions. In the case of Puerto Rico, the island had been under <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law since its settlement by Spain in 1493. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar statute allowing spouses to elect a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> system under Oklahoma law would not be recognized for federal income tax reporting purposes. The Harmon decision should also apply to the Alaska system for income reporting purposes.|$|R
50|$|States vary {{in their}} rules for {{division}} of assets in a divorce. The major difference is between states that use a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> system and states that do not. In <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states, <b>community</b> <b>property</b> belongs to the spouses equally. The following states use <b>community</b> <b>property</b> regimes: Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Alaskan law gives couples the option to create <b>community</b> <b>property</b> by written agreement.|$|R
