2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a <b>conical</b> <b>tip</b> into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the <b>conical</b> <b>tip</b> (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

50|$|One type of {{plotter pen}} uses a {{cellulose}} fiber rod inserted through a circular foam tube saturated with ink, {{with the end}} of the rod sharpened into a <b>conical</b> <b>tip.</b> As the pen moves across the paper surface, capillary wicking draws the ink from the foam, down the rod, and onto the paper. As the ink supply in the foam is depleted, the migration of ink to the tip begins to slow down, resulting in faint lines. Slowing the plotting speed will allow the lines drawn by a worn-out pen to remain dark, but the fading will continue until the foam is completely depleted. Also, as the fiber tip pen is used, the tip slowly wears away on the plotting medium, producing a progressively wider, smudged line.|$|E

When used with sodium hypochlorite and EDTA, laser activation of aqueous fluids can increase the efficiency of debridement and disinfection of root canals. However, the use of forward-firing laser fibers with such solutions poses a risk of driving fluid past the root apex, which could cause postoperative complications. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the mechanism of fluid agitation caused by a novel honeycomb tip. Glass capillary tubes filled with distilled water were used to replicate single-tooth root canals. A 980 nm pulsed diode laser was used with 200 μm diameter plain <b>tips,</b> tube-etched <b>conical</b> <b>tips,</b> and honeycomb tips. To record fluid movements, the tubes were backlit and imaged using a digital camera attached to a microscope. The honeycomb tips generated agitation with fluid movement directed onto the walls, while both the conventional plain fibers and the <b>conical</b> <b>tips</b> created fluid movement largely in a forward direction. The use of honeycomb tips alters the pattern of fluid agitation, and this laterally directed effect might lower the risk of fluid extrusion beyond the apex...|$|R

The effects of the rear contact geometry on the scratch friction between the tip and substrate, represented by recovery angle φ, owing to the instantaneous elastic recovery of the polymer substrate, are also introduced. Validated by the experimental and numerical results from the literature, the proposed analytical model can describe well the scratch coefficient of friction (SCOF), which is defined as the ratio of the tangential force to the normal force. Meaningful guidance is provided to understand the scratch friction behavior.|$|E
