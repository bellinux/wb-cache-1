40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} solution for natural convection in a vertical annular porous medium for various <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> temperature boundary conditions and radiation parameters. The heat transfer is assumed to take place by convection and radiation. The inner wall (hot wall) of the annulus is maintained at an isothermal temperature while the outer <b>wall</b> (<b>cold</b> <b>wall)</b> is subjected to different temperature conditions. The temperature conditions maintained at the <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> are evaluated for uniform as well as non uniform temperatures. The fluid is assumed to obey Darcy’s law. The governing partial differential equations are non-dimensionalised and solved by finite element method. The porous medium is discretised with unstructured triangular elements. The effects of radius ratio and Rayleigh number on the Nusselt number and Sherwood number are investigated on the annulus for different temperatures at <b>cold</b> <b>wall.</b> The effects of radiation on flow patterns, temperature distribution and concentration distribution are discussed. The results reveal that the Nusselt number and Sherwood number at <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> decrease {{with the increase in}} radius ratio, whereas they increase with the radius ratio at hot wall for different temperature boundary conditions at the <b>cold</b> <b>wall.</b> Temperature <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> conditions have pronounced effect on the Nusselt and Sherwood number...|$|R

50|$|Sour {{cherries}} require similar cultivation {{conditions to}} pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet cherries. Trees will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet cherries, Morellos are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees {{too large for}} most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as Colt and Gisella are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant winter months). Morello cherry trees fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder.

Montgomerie reported on 16 November 1840 that there were 22 insane patients and he expected that the yearly average of seventeen patients would increase with growth of the settlement. In the report, he also suggested the Lunatic Asylum be built for 24 patients and should any more room be needed, buildings would be added on. In addition, floors [...] "should be laid with bricks on edge, embedded in good mortar so as to admit of being washed, and prevent the patients lifting the floors, which constructed with tiles as in the Jail, they have been enabled to do so;" [...] and [...] "wood for the walls and bed places in consequence of very bad effects having arisen from patients in the Jail having destroyed the bed places and by squatting on the floor and leaning against <b>cold</b> <b>walls,</b> have in several instances cramped their limbs and stiffened their joints so as to cause lameness".

The Organisation Todt had neglected it, KZ to adapt in time, even though they had six weeks. In a bombing of the nearby Belgrade airport in April 1941, which had opened in 1937, the fairground had been severely affected. The barracks possessed no sanitary facilities except two wells, and the windows were broken. Through the roof snow fell and froze on the concrete floor. Only after some time, did the Organisation Todt provide three storey wooden racks for beds, without a ceiling, without sheets, and only straw that has never been changed. The food they got from the Belgrade care - from the remains that were left from the Belgrade population, supplied, on average, about 80 grams of food per day and person. For each of the 300 infants, there was 200 grams of milk per day. Every night, between 10 and 25 people died of hunger and cold. The bodies of the deceased had to be disposed by the inmates on the frozen Sava, where they were taken by the Belgrade municipality staff car, and driven to the Jewish cemetery.|$|E

30|$|A {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is that spherical inserts with <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> were used. The <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> introduce a delineation error for threshold-based delineation methods which depends {{on the size of the}} walls, the spatial resolution, and the contrast [17]. However, at high contrast, these delineation errors are very small. Therefore, the result that both PSF reconstructions lead to an underestimated volume at high contrast, when delineated with threshold-based methods, is not affected by the <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> of the spheres. The situation is different at low contrast (SBR 3). First, there is no notable difference in tBC delineation between PSF algorithms and the other investigated reconstruction algorithms, which is explained by the absence of Gibbs artifacts at this contrast. Second, for all reconstruction algorithms, tBC delineation underestimated the actual volumes of all investigated spheres. This is mainly caused by the effects of the <b>cold</b> <b>walls.</b> At low contrast, the <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> lead to an underestimated volume when a threshold is used which was optimized for data without walls, e.g., clinical data. The optimization of this algorithm for such spheres would require a calibration which takes the <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> into account. However, such a calibration would be only of limited use since it is only valid for the type of spheres the calibration was performed with. An alternative would be the use of spheres without <b>cold</b> <b>walls</b> as performed by Bazañez-Borgert et al. [29]. However, the main result at low contrast, namely that there is no difference in tBC delineation between PSF-based and other reconstructions, could also be shown with the presented measurements.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleation}} {{density and}} average size of graphene crystallites grown using <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) on 4 μm-thick Cu films electrodeposited on W substrates can be tuned by varying growth parameters. Growth at a fixed substrate temperature of 1000 °C and total pressure of 700 Torr using Ar, H 2 and CH 4 mixtures enabled the contribution of total flow rate, CH 4 :H 2 ratio and dilution of the CH 4 /H 2 mixture by Ar to be identified. The largest variation in nucleation density was obtained by varying the CH 4 :H 2 ratio. The observed morphological changes are analogous to those that would be expected if the deposition rate were varied at fixed substrate temperature for physical deposition using thermal evaporation. The graphene crystallite boundary morphology progresses from irregular/jagged through convex hexagonal to regular hexagonal as the effective C deposition rate decreases. This observation suggests that edge diffusion of C atoms along the crystallite boundaries, in addition to H 2 etching, may contribute to shape evolution of the graphene crystallites. These results demonstrate that graphene grown using <b>cold</b> <b>wall</b> CVD follows a nucleation and growth mechanism similar to hot wall CVD.
