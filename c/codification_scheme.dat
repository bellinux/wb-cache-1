40|$|Typically, in the {{semiconductor}} industry pn heterojunctions {{have been used as}} either light-emitting diodes (LED) or photodiodes by applying forward current bias or reverse voltage bias, respectively. However, since both devices use the same structure, the light emitting and detecting properties could be combine in one single device, namely LED-based photodetector. Therefore, by integrating LED-based photodetectors as either transmitter or receiver, optical wireless communication could be easily implemented for bidirectional visible light communication networks at low-cost. Therefore, this dissertation focus on the investigation of the photodetection characteristics of InGaN LED-based photodetectors for visible light communication in the blue region. In this regard, we obtain external quantum efficiency of 10 % and photoresponse rise time of 71 μs at 405 -nm illumination, revealing high-performance photodetection characteristics.

40|$|Architecture {{design is}} a {{fundamental}} step in the successful application of Feed forward Neural Networks. In most cases {{a large number of}} neural networks architectures suitable to solve a problem exist and the architecture design is, unfortunately, still a human expert’s job. It depends heavily on the expert and on a tedious trial-and-error process. In the last years, many works have been focused on automatic resolution of the design of neural network architectures. Most of the methods are based on evolutionary computation paradigms. Some of the designed methods are based on direct representations of the parameters of the network. These representations do not allow scalability; thus, for representing large architectures very large structures are required. More interesting alternatives are represented by indirect schemes. They codify a compact representation of the neural network. In this work, an indirect constructive encoding scheme is proposed. This scheme is based on cellular automata representations and is inspired by the idea that only a few seeds for the initial configuration of a cellular automaton can produce a wide variety of feed forward neural networks architectures.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is offered by cloud, which can be delivered in a composite form, consisting of a set of application and data components, that works together to deliver higher-level functional software. SaaS components are placed on top of the virtual machines (VMs) in cloud computing environment, which are deployed on physical or storage servers. The SaaS placement is an NP-hard problem. The research problem refers to how a SaaS component is placed on virtual machine to optimize its performance while satisfying the SaaS resource and response time constraints with service level agreement (SLA) constraints. This thesis presents SaaS placement problem as an optimization problem, to maximize the profit of the SaaS providers. Intractability nature of the SaaS placement problem leads to the use of genetic algorithms to obtain sub-optimal solution for SaaS component placement on virtual machine.

Some terrorist organizations carry out indiscriminate attacks, some others opt for selective killings. Some terrorist organizations focus on attacks against the State, some others attack social groups. To shed light on this variation, we propose in this paper a new methodological approach to the analysis of target selection. Going beyond gathering information about objective traits of the victims, we connect the selection of the victim with the aims and strategies of terrorist organizations. Thus, we codify information about victims in two different variables. One {{has to do with the}} selectivity of the killing-the “how ” of the attack. The other, with the strategic aim of the killing –the “why ” of the attack. Building on those two variables, we propose a <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> general enough to fit the violence of different types of terrorism. To illustrate our methodology, we have created an exhaustive dataset of terrorist killings for three types of terrorism in three Western European countries (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In total, we have collected detailed evidence, based on local sources, on 3, 230 fatalities for the period 1965 - 2005. We consider cases of (i) revolutionary or left-wing terrorism (Red Brigades, GRAPO); (ii) ethno-nationalist terrorism (ETA, IRA); (iii) and fascist or right-wing terrorism (Nar, Ordine Nero). To make sense of the data, we suggest six propositions that may account for the unearthed variance in target selection within terrorist organizations...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{knowledge-based}} system for material design {{is a complex}} task, due to the interrelationship of many factors in steel making process. In addition to this, design specifications vary frequently and material design knowledge is held in largely intuitive undefined format. This thesis discusses a material design system which deals with {{the determination of the}} steelmaking aim chemistry. If an attempt is made to design aim chemistry only based on a mathematical approach of utilising the empirical models between various design parameters, it would result in unrealistic design because relationships between various design parameters are not always linear. Therefore it is inevitable to apply knowledge-based methods along with the mathematical approach to deal with this complex task. The approach put forward in this thesis is a hybrid approach, where the knowledge-base is applied at every stage of the design process to utilise the expert as well as the heuristic knowledge of metallurgists to obtain the designs which are realistic and which take into account various limitations and constraints encountered in steel making. The material design is also characterised by extensive utilisation of the grade history database which contains performance data for various steel grades and thickness combinations. The inputs to the system are through interactive dialogue sessions and the inputs consist of the material standards, size, quantity, tonnage, end use and the customer special requirements. These inputs along with the numerous rules in the knowledge-bases as well as the mathematical modelling enable the effective design of the steelmaking aim chemistry. Knowledge Elicitation (KEL) is the most important stage, but it is often the principal bottleneck in the development of {{knowledge-based system}}s. Due to the difficulties faced in the knowledge elicitation process, development of a knowledge-based system for material design in steel making industry is a complex task. An attempt is made in this thesis to present a novel approach to deal with knowledge elicitation for material design problems in steel making industry. This research centres around the human aspects and is based on practical expelience gained while developing a knowledge-based system for material design at BHP Steel, Australia. This approach involves codification of the customer special requirements to identify the knowledge sources involved in the design process. This is followed by the use of paper models to improve the efficiency of KEL process. The second stage of the structured interviews is based on the customer special requirement codes for eliciting the missing information and for clarifying any ambiguities or inconsistencies. This research also focuses on the use of non-interviewing techniques to elicit the expert knowledge {{in order to reduce the}} expensive interview time. The knowledge representation scheme developed for the material design system aims at reducing the search time and storage space by utilising the <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> to classify various knowledge sources into appropriate categories. The thesis then presents the application of fuzzy logic to the material design system to rank the alternative steel making aim chemistries according to the degree which will satisfy the customer 2 ̆ 7 s requirements of chemistry and mechanical properties, with due consideration given to the economic aspects and the complexity involved in the production. Statistical data regarding the performance of the grades produced in the past are also utilised in this process. The development of the membership functions for the material design fuzzy logic based system, which is an important task, is presented in this thesis. Four factors considered in the development of the membership functions include chemistry, mechanical properties, relative cost and the complexity involved in the production of the steel material. Finally the thesis presents the development of an interactive graphical user interface for a material design knowledge-based system based on a three character alphanumeric <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> for customer special requirements. This user interface makes the material design system more user friendly and enables error free and fast input of the basic information and the customer special requirements, corresponding to any customer order for steel plates. This is achieved through two interactive dialogue sessions utilising two input screens. In addition to making the system more user friendly and visually appealing, the interface developed also adds flexibility and sophistication to the prototype knowledge-based system for designing steel plates...|$|E

The researcher acted as the moderator; and a set of semi-structured questions, based on meanings attached to camera-angle codes as defined by Mascelli, were answered by the participants. The <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> of Mascelli was applied to the unconventional camera angles in Avatar and The English Patient. These were compared with the viewers’ responses. Finally, the results were interpreted, in order to establish whether a meaningful relationship exists between the viewers’ responses and the interpretation of unconventional camera angles by such a seminal figure as Joseph V. Mascelli. The literature study focused on a media aesthetic explanation of cinematography, which included media aesthetics theory, framing, and composition, as well as the general codes and conventions relevant to cinematography. The literature overview includes a study of books, academic articles, internet sources, legislation, and training videos. A Nexus and EbscoHost search (Academic Search Premier and Jstor) was conducted on cinematography in general, and on camera angles in particular. Chapter 5 indicates the viewers’ overall interpretations of the unconventional camera angles used in Avatar and The English Patient. The graphs in Chapter 5 indicate that the viewers found the unconventional camera angles used in the films to represent the meaning of the shots appropriately, and that they understood why each unconventional camera angle had been used. The viewers’ responses correspond with the meanings of the unconventional camera angles, as stated by Mascelli. To ensure the effectiveness of a film and the accurate representation of the meanings of camera angles and camera sizes, the way it is described by Mascelli should ideally be taken into consideration by all future producers. Mascelli’s descriptions of camera angles and camera sizes, combined with the media aesthetics, as described by Zettl – when successfully applied – could lead to the production of a good quality film and images within the film.

40|$|Distributed {{heterogeneous}} computing {{is being}} widely {{applied to a}} variety of large size computational problems. This computational environments are consists of multiple het- erogeneous computing modules, these modules interact with each other to solve the prob-lem. Dynamic load balancing in distributed computing system is desirable because it is an important key to establish dependability in a Heterogeneous Distributed Computing Systems (HDCS). Load balancing problem is an optimization problem with exponential solution space. The complexity of dynamic load balancing increases with the size of a HDCS and becomes difficult to solve effectively. The solution to this intractable problem is discussed under different algorithm paradigm. The load submitted to the a HDCS is assumed to be in the form of tasks. Dynamic allocation of n independent tasks to m computing nodes in heterogeneous distributed computing system can be possible through centralized or decentralized control. In central-ized approach,we have formulated load balancing problem considering task and machine heterogeneity as a linear programming problem to minimize the time by which all task completes the execution in makespan. The load balancing problem in HDCS aims to maintain a balanced allocation of tasks while using the computational resources. The system state changes with time on arrival of tasks from the users. Therefore,heterogeneous distributed system is modeled as an M/M/m queue. The task model is represented either as a consistent or an inconsistent expected time to compute (ETC) matrix. A batch mode heuristic has been used to de-sign dynamic load balancing algorithms for heterogeneous distributed computing systems with four different type of machine heterogeneity. A number of experiments have been conducted to study the performance of load balancing algorithms with three different ar-rival rate for the task. A better performance of the algorithms is observed with increasing of heterogeneity in the HDCS. A new <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> suitable to simulated annealing and genetic algorithm has been introduced to design dynamic load balancing algorithms for HDCS.

40|$|THE {{necessity}} for {{a revision of}} the Statute Law of the Colony has long been recognized, and for some years past a sum of money has annually been voted by Parliament for the codification of the Statutes. The <b>codification</b> <b>scheme</b> was, however, abandoned, and we were authorized by the Government to bring out this revised edition, which, it will at once be observed, has been prepared on an entirely different basis from the first edition. The various Statutes, instead of being printed, as hitherto, simply in their chronological order, have been arranged alphabetically according to the subjects to which they relate, all enactments and portions of enactments dealing with the same subject being grouped together. The expediency of this innovation may perhaps be questioned by some who have been long accustomed to the chronological order; but {{the advantages of the}} alphabetical arrangement - which has been adopted in the Australian colonies-are obvious, and we had, moreover, the strongly expressed opinion of the Honourable the Attorney-General in its favour. The chief difficulty in carrying out the present arrangement has been occasioned by the "patchy" nature of many of the Statutes, it being by no means uncommon to find several subjects of a totally different character treated of in the same Act, This has rendered it necessary to print portions {{of a large number of}} Acts more than once. The alphabetical arrangement was in itself a matter of considerable difficulty. We have endeavoured to produce one which will, we trust, be found practically useful and convenient: for, in the words of the learned and eminent compilers of the first volume of the Statute Law, "A scientific, methodical arrangement of the laws under certain artificial heads, indicating' the particular department of polity intended to be embraced, might be useful for the philosopher, and perhaps for the legislator, but for all practical uses by the public in general or by the practitioners of the law, we apprehend it would be of little use. " Advantage has been taken of the provisions of Sect. 12 of Act 5 of 1883 to embody alterations made in the Statutes by subsequent legislation. The text of every enactment has been carefully compared with the certified original in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and it may not be amiss to mention that several discrepancies were found to exist between the original and the published copies now in use. This Edition comprises the whole of the Statute Law up to and including the Acts passed during the Session of 1886. It consists of three volumes, the first two containing the text of the Acts, and the last a full Chronological Table and a complete Alphabetical Index.
