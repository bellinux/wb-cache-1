The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Credit</b> Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 45 - 48. This study basically {{deals with}} <b>consumer</b> <b>credits</b> as a <b>consumer</b> finance tool which has gained widespread use in recent years, in Turkey. One {{of the reasons}} behind this change is competition, which got tougher day by day, urging the banks to provide more and more diversified services rather than classical banking services. There have been many studies undertaken on consumer loans in Western countries where <b>consumer</b> <b>credits,</b> credit cards, mortgage loans and all other individual banking services {{have been used for}} many years. With a background of four years, <b>consumer</b> <b>credits</b> are not studied thoroughly in Turkey. This study covers some of the previous studies undertaken in other countries in reference to Turkey and is mainly concerned with the emergence and growth stages of <b>consumer</b> <b>credits.</b> This study also sheds light on the perceptions of the persons on <b>consumer</b> <b>credits</b> who are mostly salaried employees in Ankara. Data used to give insights about the perceptions on <b>consumer</b> <b>credits</b> is gathered from a questionnaire specifically designed for this study. The number of the respondents was 228, of whom 47 actually used <b>consumer</b> <b>credits.</b> It is quite obvious that <b>consumer</b> <b>credits</b> will be used more in the coming years with some financial and legislative changes in implementation.

25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of <b>consumer</b> <b>credit</b> was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of <b>consumer</b> <b>credit</b> to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National <b>Consumer</b> <b>Credit</b> Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Credit</b> and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all <b>consumer</b> <b>credit</b> contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

25|$|The NextGen Score is a scoring model {{designed}} by the FICO company for assessing <b>consumer</b> <b>credit</b> risk.

In 2004, FICO research showed a 4.4% {{increase in the number}} of accounts above cutoff while simultaneously showing a decrease in the number of bad, charge-off and Bankrupt accounts when compared to FICO traditional. FICO NextGen score is between 150 and 950.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 report {{produced}} by the Cato Institute found {{that the cost of}} the loans is overstated, and that payday lenders offer a product traditional lenders simply refuse to offer.

Because a consumer's credit file may contain different information at each of the bureaus, FICO scores can vary depending on which bureau provides the information to FICO to generate the score.|$|E

Other forms of <b>consumer</b> <b>credit,</b> such as title and payday loans, became available for those who could not get even the most restrictive credit cards available.

25|$|Research for the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation {{found that}} a {{majority}} of Illinois payday loan borrowers earn $30,000 or less per year. Texas' Office of the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Credit</b> Commissioner collected data on 2012 payday loan usage, and found that refinances accounted for $2.01 billion in loan volume, compared with $1.08 billion in initial loan volume. The report did not include information about annual indebtedness. A letter to the editor from an industry expert argued that other studies have found that consumers fare better when payday loans are available to them. Pew's reports have focused on how payday lending can be improved, but have not assessed whether consumers fare better with or without access to high-interest loans. Pew's demographic analysis was based on a random-digit-dialing (RDD) survey of 33,576 people, including 1,855 payday loan borrowers.|$|E
25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of <b>consumer</b> <b>credit</b> products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E
