5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no anal fin.

The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle).</b> This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle,</b> the base of the caudal fin, {{distinguishing}} this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column, are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle</b> (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle.</b> The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark has an elongated body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by the slender <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle.</b> The snout is short and rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{geometric}} morphometrics {{was used to}} characterize body shape variation in meiotic gynogenetic and triploid sea bass in comparison with diploid controls. A total of 13 coordinate landmark data were recorded on the profile of 34 -month-old control (n = 81), gynogenetic (n = 117) and triploid (n = 131) siblings generated from two females (A and B). Three main axes of morphometric variation were consistent, and these accounted for 60. 8 and 57. 6 % of the total variability in females A and B, respectively. There were significant shape deviations of triploid and gynogenetic fish relative to the controls, and differences were particularly evident in the progeny of one female. Overall,triploids displayed a more slender shape than diploids, whereas gynogenetic fish were deeper bodied and had flexed <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles</b> and cranial features.

50|$|S. armatus {{reaches a}} maximum length of 5.7 cm (standard length) and vary in color from dark red to beige. Compared to other ghost pipefishes, they possess an {{elongated}} <b>caudal</b> tail and <b>peduncle,</b> as indicated by their common name.|$|R
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle,</b> distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E

The dorsal surface of the <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncle</b> bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth.

40|$|Local {{specialisation}} can be advantageous for individuals, and {{may increase}} the resilience of the species to environmental change. However, there may be trade-offs between morphological responses and physiological performance and behaviour.

We rejected the hypothesis that deeper body shape of fish from habitats with high predation pressure led to decreases in locomotor performance. However, there was a trade-off between deeper body shape and muscle quality. Muscle of deeper-bodied fish produced less force than that of shallow-bodied saltmarsh fish. Nonetheless, saltmarsh fish had lower swimming performance, presumably because of lower muscle mass overall coupled with smaller <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles</b> and larger heads. Saltmarsh fish performed better in saline water (20 ppt) relative to freshwater, and relative to fish from freshwater habitats.

40|$|Tunas and mackerels, {{members of}} the teleost fish family Scombridae, are epipelagic predators capable of {{attaining}} high swimming speeds as well as undertaking long-distance migrations (for reviews, see Beamish, 1978; Magnuson, 1978; Joseph et al., 1988). All members of this family possess anatomical characteristics, such as a streamlined body shape and a high-aspect-ratio caudal propeller, that reduce drag or increase thrust production (Webb, 1975; Collette, 1978; Magnuson, 1978; Dewar and Graham, 1994). Scombrids also have caudal keels and finlets along their narrow <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles</b> that are thought to aid in minimizing the turbulence encountered by the caudal fin as it moves laterally during swimming (Aleev, 1963; Collette, 1978; Magnuson, 1978).

The ichthyofauna was sampled quarterly from September 2011 to July 2012, through the electrofishing technique.

The main food items consumed were detritus, aquatic and terrestrial insects, and other aquatic invertebrates. We observed low levels of trophic niche breadth and diet overlap between most species. The PCA scores indicated the occurrence of three ecomorphotypes. PCA axis 1 segregated at one extreme, species with dorsoventrally depressed bodies, longer <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles,</b> and well-developed swimming fins; and at the other extreme, species with compressed bodies and peduncles, and relatively larger eyes and anal fins. PCA axis 2 segregated species with elongated bodies and ventrally oblique mouths. The partial Mantel test revealed a significant correlation between diet and morphology, indicating independence from the phylogeny.

40|$|Since the {{description}} of a helicoidal pattern of muscle fibres in teleost fishes by Van der Stelt (1968), Alexander (1969) stated {{that there are two}} basic patterns.

More anteriad a quite different pattern is found, resembling the helicoidal pattern. The elucidation of this pattern was disclosed by both Van der Stelt (1968) and Alexander (1969) by reconstruction from horizontal, as well as vertical serial sections. Van Raamsdonk et al. (1974), in a study of the early development of the myomeres of Brachydanio rerio, observed a transition of a primary longitudinal course of muscle cells to a presumably helicoidal one in transverse sections of the embryo. As it is more easy to obtain and interpret a series of transverse sections, we have tried to devise a method of reconstruction of the muscle fibre course, starting from transverse sections. With some caution, the results of these studies on Brachydanio may be summarized as follows: 1. The embryo starts with a primordial, longitudinal muscle cell orientation. 2. In the young embryo the muscle cell orientation changes to a helicoidal one. 3. A further change in conformity with Alexanderâ€™s primitive pattern is found in later stages of development...|$|R

Rainbow trout from streams had more robust bodies with larger <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles</b> and heads and longer paired fins than rainbow trout from lakes. Un-like other lake populations, piscivorous rainbow trout populations had relatively large heads and mouths that were more similar in size to those of stream-dwelling populations.

40|$|The Eocene (Ypresian) fauna of Bolca, Italy {{yields a}} famous {{assemblage}} of marine tropical teleosts. One {{of the most}} anatomically distinctive teleosts from Bolca is the enigmatic â€ Bajaichthys elegans, generally interpreted {{as a member of}} Lampridiformes (oarfishes and allies). Re-examination of the type and only specimen of â€ Bajaichthys contradicts this attribution, and we propose that its original description as a member of Zeiformes (dories) was in fact correct. â€ Bajaichthys bears numerous derived features of zeiforms not found in lampridiforms, including: a pelvic spine, a first vertebra closely associated with the neurocranium, and a reduced metapterygoid not contacting the quadrate. Lampridiform-like attributes, including a greatly elongated ascending process of the premaxilla, are known to be convergent between this group and Zeiformes. Using a combination of morphological and molecular data, we confirm this revised interpretation and resolve the position of â€ Bajaichthys within zeiform phylogeny.

Our inferred placement of â€ Bajaichthys and other fossil taxa with extended <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles</b> (e. g. â€ Archaeozeus) suggests that the elongate morphotype is ancestral for Zeiformes as a whole, and that the deep-bodied geometry typical of extant taxa probably appeared several times independently.

40|$|Synopsis The common {{pattern of}} {{replicated}} {{evolution of a}} consistent shapeâ€”environment relationship might reflect selection acting in similar ways within each environment, but divergently among environments. However, phenotypic evolution depends {{on the availability of}} additive genetic variation {{as well as on the}} direction of selection, implicating a bias in the distribution of genetic variance as a potential contributor to replicated evolution. Allometry, the relationship between shape and size, is a potential source of genetic bias that is poorly understood. The threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, provides an ideal system for exploring the contribution of genetic variance in body shape allometry to evolutionary patterns. The stickleback system comprises marine populations that exhibit limited phenotypic variation, and young freshwater populations which, following independent colonization events, have often evolved similar pheno-types in similar environments. In particular, stickleback diversification has involved changes in both total body size and relative size of body regions (i. e., shape). In a laboratory-reared cohort derived from an oceanic Alaskan population that is phenotypically and genetically representative of the ancestor of the diverse freshwater populations in this region, we determined the phenotypic static allometry, and estimated the additive genetic variation about these population-level allometric functions. We detected significant allometry, with larger fish having relatively smaller heads, a longer base to their second dorsal fin, and longer, shallower <b>caudal</b> <b>peduncles.</b> There was additive genetic variance in body size and in size-independent body shape (i. e., allometric elevation), but typically not in allometric slopes.
