Measuring {{heart rate variability}} is often considered a powerful tool to assess the intrapartum health status of fetus and has been envisaged using various techniques. In the present <b>contribution,</b> <b>scale</b> invariance parameters, such as the Hurst exponent and the global regularity exponent, are estimated from wavelet coefficients of intrapartum fetal heart rate time series. Their ability to evaluate the health status of fetuses is quantified from a case study database, constituted at a French Academic Hospital in Lyon. Notably, the ability of such parameters to discriminate subjects incorrectly classified according to FIGO rules as abnormal is discussed. Also, {{the impact of the}} occurrence of decelerations identified as complicated by obstetricians on the values taken by Hurst parameter is investigated in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{empirical}} associations between parental monitoring and for the first time contribution to self, family and community, as outcome of positive youth development, across time among Lithuanian youth. Data for this study are drawn from the first two available waves of an ongoing longitudinal Positive Youth Development research project (POSIDEV), conducted in Lithuania. The sample size for this study was N = 1098 (54. 5 % girls and 45. 5 % boys). Measurements used: parental monitoring scale and three-dimensional <b>contribution</b> <b>scale.</b> Results indicated that parental monitoring at Time 1 predicted all components of contribution: to self (β =. 37, p<. 001), to family (β =. 49, p<. 001) and to community (β =. 23, p<. 001) at Time 2. Results also indicated that parental monitoring is more strongly related to contribution in emerging adults group than in adolescents group. To conclude, results of current two-wave study highlighted the importance of the parental monitoring on the outcomes of positive youth development one year later...|$|E

Workers at 272 organizations answered questionnaires that included the SCS. Because of non-participation or missing data, the number of subjects included in the analyses for internal consistency and validity varied from 1, 675 to 2, 462 (response rates 54. 6 %– 80. 2 %). Fifty-four workers were included in the analysis of test–retest reliability (response rate, 77. 1 %). The SCS showed high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α coefficients in men and women were 0. 85 and 0. 86, respectively) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 91). Significant (p < 0. 001), positive, moderate correlations were found between the SCS score and scores for organization-based self-esteem and work engagement in both genders, which support the SCS’s convergent and discriminant validity. The criterion validity of the SCS was supported by the finding that in both genders, the SCS scores were significantly (p < 0. 05) and inversely associated with psychological distress and sleep disturbance in crude and in multivariable analyses that adjusted for demographics...|$|E

40|$|The Fundamental Plane has finite {{thickness}} and is tilted {{from the}} virial relation, indicating that dynamical mass-to-light ratios (Mdyn/L) vary among early type galaxies. We use {{a sample of}} 16, 000 quiescent galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to map out variations in Mdyn/L through the 3 D Fundamental Plane space defined by velocity dispersion (sigma), effective radius (R_e), and effective surface brightness. We consider contributions to Mdyn/L variation due to stellar population effects, IMF variations, and variations in the dark matter fraction within one R_e. Along the FP, {{we find that the}} stellar population <b>contribution</b> <b>scales</b> as M*/L ~ f(sigma), while the dark matter and/or IMF <b>contribution</b> <b>scales</b> as Mdyn/M* ~ g(Mdyn). The two contributions to the tilt of the FP rotate the plane around different axes in the 3 D space, with dark matter/IMF variations likely dominating. Through the thickness of the FP, we find that Mdyn/L variations must be dominated either by IMF variations or by real differences in dark matter fraction with R_e. Thus the finite thickness of the FP is due to variations in the stellar mass surface density within R_e, not the fading of passive stellar populations. These structural variations are correlated with galaxy star formation histories such that galaxies with higher Mdyn/M* at a given sigma have higher [Mg/Fe], lower metallicities, and older mean stellar ages. It is difficult to explain the observed correlations by allowing the IMF to vary, suggesting difference in dark matter fraction dominate. These can be produced by variations in the "conversion efficiency" of baryons into stars or by the redistribution of stars and dark matter through dissipational merging. A model in which some galaxies experience low conversion efficiencies due to premature truncation of star formation provides a natural explanation for the observed trends.

One important component of these practices is to monitor program implementation. However, in experiential education and more broadly the social sciences this process is rarely assessed or evaluated; when it is assessed it is frequently resource intensive. As such, program providers have needed an implementation measurement approach more conducive to low-resource organizations. This paper introduces a self-report mechanism to measure facilitator characteristics that contribute to delivering a program as designed. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of 121 program facilitator responses to the Facilitator Characteristics and Program <b>Contributions</b> <b>Scale</b> (FCPC) indicated that the FCPC is a valid and reliable measure of facilitator characteristics and their pro-fidelity beliefs, and thus may be a promising alternative to other resource intensive approaches to implementation assessment...|$|R
