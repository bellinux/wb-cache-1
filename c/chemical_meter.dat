40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to developing variable-rate sprayer technologies is to install electronic control systems on conventional sprayers. This study introduces a direct injection type electronic solution concentration control system. This control system was installed {{on a field}} sprayer, and then a map-based variable-rate sprayer was developed. The control system consisted of a chemical tank, a <b>chemical</b> <b>metering</b> pump, the metering pump’s driver, the metering pump’s speed sensor, the implement’s travelling speed sensor, an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a GPS receiver and a mixing unit. The metering pump discharge was measured at different carrier liquid (water) working pressures (3, 4 and 5 bar) and different <b>chemical</b> <b>metering</b> pump shaft speed (100, 200, 300 and 400 r/min, i. e. pump’s working range). Data analysis showed {{that the effect of}} metering pump speed, sprayer working pressure and their interaction was significant (P< 0. 001) on the metering pump’s discharge. Metering pump’s discharge function and the independent variables of pump speed and working pressure were calculated. In order to determine the system response time, an electromotor replaced on the right hand front wheel of the tractor (the implement’s traveling speed sensor location), thus simulating the implement’s movement. An Electrical Conductivity (EC) sensor was mounted on rightmost nozzle of the boom. The chemical tank was filled with thick brine. The system response time was measured at different working pressures (3, 4 and 5 bar), travelling speeds (3, 6 and 9 km h- 1) and spraying concentration change rates (2, 3 and 4 L ha- 1). The working pressure was the only variable with a significant effect on the response time at the 1 % level. The mean of response times were 25. 8, 22. 8 and 17. 9 s at 3, 4 and 5 bar working pressures, respectively. The look-ahead firmwar...|$|R

40|$|A {{radiation}} source for detecting specific <b>chemicals</b> at several <b>meter</b> distances even behind walls, car doors or other barriers is {{the application of}} Million electron Volts (MeV) neutrons from nuclear fusion reactions at such low intensities to avoid any danger for human bodies. The chemical analysis consists in the neutron activation of nuclei emitting then gamma radiation of lines very specific for the excited nuclei. The neutron generation by the Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) had been developed to a level where very low cost neutron generators in mass production may be developed with a power supply from a normal AC plug-in or a battery. For specific chemicals e. g. the ratio of nitrogen against other elements used in all explosives, the selection of few specific gamma lines for the detectors may be of sufficiently low cost {{in the case of}} mass production...|$|R
40|$|Australia is {{employing}} mitigation {{technologies to}} counter annual evaporation losses from irrigation storage dams and channels. Annual evaporation losses from these storages {{are estimated to}} be around 1. 32 GL/yr and up to 2. 88 GL/yr. A water balance approach provides a practical approach for estimating aggregate losses due to evaporation. The accuracy of this method depends greatly on the accuracy of the equipment used to measure the change in water depth. Monitoring systems and data analysis techniques have recently been commercialized by Aquatech Consulting as the Irrigate Seepage and Evaporation <b>Meter.</b> <b>Chemical</b> covers have been promoted as a low cost method to reduce evaporation losses. These products are generally biodegradable and {{there is a need to}} reapply frequently (between three and ten days). Monolayers also offer much potential for affecting evaporation savings but inconsistent evaporation saving performance has limited their adoption in Australia. ...|$|R
40|$|Cannon Boiler Works Inc. {{has been}} {{investigating}} a system for removing NOx from the exhaust gases of furnaces, gas turbines, chemical reactors, incinerators, and boilers. Computer simulations, bench-scale and pilot plant tests have proved {{that the system is}} capable of removing substantially all of the NOx from natural gas fired equipment exhaust streams. Originally designated as the Cannon NOx Digester, it has recently been renamed the Low Temperature Oxidation (LTO) System for NOx and SOx Reduction. The principal elements in the system are a fan, heat exchanger, oxidation chamber, spray chamber acting as a gas/liquid absorber, demister, an ozone generator, liquid oxygen storage or dry air supply system for the ozonator, <b>chemical</b> storage and <b>metering</b> system for the caustic neutralizer, and a data acquisition and control system. Most of the ozone is consumed in converting NOx to N{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } which hydrates to nitric acid which is then scrubbed out of the gas as it passes through the absorber. CO also reacts with ozone to form CO{sub 2 } which is subsequently scrubbed out with NaOH. A demonstration, planned for the Alta Dena Dairy located near Los Angeles and in violation of California`s air quality regulations for natural gas fired boilers, was started, delayed due to boiler modifications, and will be continued shortly with new funding. This paper describes the LTO process and presents results from the initial demonstration...|$|R

40|$|The report herein is {{a summary}} of the work {{performed}} on three projects to demonstrate hydrocarbon drilling and production methods applicable to deep and ultra deepwater field developments in the Gulf of Mexico and other like applications around the world. This work advances technology that could lead to more economic development and exploitation of reserves in ultra-deep water or remote areas. The first project is Subsea Processing. Its scope includes a review of the ''state of the art'' in subsea components to enable primary production process functions such as first stage liquids and gas separation, flow boosting, <b>chemical</b> treatment, flow <b>metering,</b> etc. These components are then combined to allow for the elimination of costly surface production facilities at the well site. A number of studies were then performed on proposed field development projects to validate the economic potential of this technology. The second project involved the design and testing of a light weight production riser made of composite material. The proposed design was to meet an actual Gulf of Mexico deepwater development project. The various engineering and testing work is reviewed, including test results. The third project described in this report encompasses the development and testing of a close tolerance liner drilling system, a new technology aimed at reducing deepwater drilling costs.

40|$|Exploration {{of ocean}} {{seafloor}} is {{of paramount importance}} for {{a better understanding of the}} geodynamic evolution of our Planet. The pilot experiment of ORION-GEOSTAR 3 EC project was the first long-term continuous geophysical and oceanographic experiment of an important seafloor area of Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, the Marsili abyssal plain. The latter hosts the Marsili Seamount which is Europe’s one of the largest underwater volcano of Plio-Pleistocenic age. In spite of its dimensions, it is rather unknown about the present characteristics and activity. For this reason, we deployed a deep-sea observatory network, composed by two bottom observatories, on the seafloor at the base of the seamount at 3320 m b. s. l., in the period December 2003 -May 2005. Some of the instruments on board the observatory were: broad-band seismometers, hydrophones, gravity meter, two magnetometers (scalar and vectorial), 3 D single-point current meter, ADCP, CTD, automatic pH analyser and off-line water sampler for laboratory analyses. The first successful scientific objective was to obtain long-term continuous recordings under a unique time reference. The data analysis shows that they are generally of good quality and really continuous (only a few gaps). As a first step we performed a classification of seismic waveforms, a first inversion of magnetic variational data, and a first analysis of gravity <b>meter,</b> <b>chemical</b> and oceanographic data. Analysis of individual time series has shown interesting results, i. e. depth of the magnetic Moho under the Marsili, attenuation of recorded seismic body waves and clues of hydrothermal circulation. We show examples of the preliminary data analysis together with first results and comparisons among data coming from different sensors...|$|R
40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of <b>chemical</b> used by <b>metering</b> pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|R
