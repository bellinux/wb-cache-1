40|$|It {{is argued}} that the <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities</b> from the {{regional}} and local point of view can be constructed, that in fact are tied to territorial policies and {{to the development of}} a territorial culture that integrates the local system of companies. Moreover a process of such nature can contribute to overcome the deterioration of backward territories. The construction of territorial competitiveness has to be one along the fundamental lines of action of sub-national governments. The existence of a solid service sector and some degree of specialisation in tertiary activities are among a number of territorial diversity of factors which need to be taken into account in relation to the creation of <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities.</b> In addition globalisation has presumably played a significant role in the productive restructuring of economies; within this the service sector has had over the years an increasing quantitative and qualitative importance in economic structures. This urges to evaluate the role of the third sector, in a context of economic globalisation, in the processes of constructing regional <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities.</b> This paper aims at providing a wide-ranging assessment of efficiency of the third sector at the regional level and its sources as well as an examination of the territorial structure of services and commerce in Mexico, specialisation patterns and productive structures. Our interest is to begin a line of study to analyse the efficiency of the Mexican tertiary sector by looking at the differences in regional performance and also the geographical determinants of these differentials. We will evaluate if there are clear patterns of concentration, specialisation and regional efficiency because of its impact on regional competitiveness. The regional efficiency of the service sector in Mexico in the period of NAFTA operation will be analysed. We employ state level data to examine technical efficiency's differentials across regions and their determinants. The methodology includes Data Envelopment Analysis to measure the efficiency of the third sector which is the dependent variable in a reduced form model that links regional performance with a number of proxies for various types of agglomeration economies such as specialisation, urbanisation and internal economies of scale...|$|R

Here, we investigate whether bacteria can {{adapt to a}} microenvironment with distinctive softness by examining the type-IV pili (TFP) -mediated motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells on brush-like surfaces that are grafted {{with a layer of}} thermally sensitive polymer chains, where the softness of the brush-layer is tunable by applying a small temperature change (from 30 to 37 C). We report that P. aeruginosa cells slingshot more on soft surfaces at a shear-thinning condition, which greatly facilitates their surface crawling by means of reducing energy dissipation. This adaptive response suggests that P. aeruginosa cells may be able to sense the local viscoelasticity and then deploy TFP to adapt to their physical surroundings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{significant}} trends in the past decades is the growing use of the Internet and communication technologies (ICT).

40|$|International audienceElymus repens (L.) Gould and Agrostis stolonifera (L.), are {{competitive}} grasses with guerrilla {{strategy that}} invade grasslands {{with a low}} stocking rate. In this work, we tested the hypotheses that grazing exclusion facilitates vegetative development of rhizomes and stolons of these clonal grasses and that such change is a key mechanism for their abundance in set-aside grasslands. The <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities</b> of these two guerrilla species were characterised by samples in plant community (species richness and biomass) and {{on the level of}} individual species (morphometric measurements on stolons and rhizomes) during a growing season. Compared to grasslands where grazing was excluded for three years, species richness was higher in grazed site and the plant community structure differed. Indeed, with grazing exclusion, a shift from annual species with a diversified growth-form to perennial species with a tall tussock and graminoid growth-form was monitored. In ungrazed situation, Elymus repens and Agrostis stolonifera were the dominant grasses, and the standing biomass for the lowland community showed a significant increase compared to the grazed site. Vegetative development increased <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities</b> of these two guerrilla species and led by phenomenon of competitive exclusion to the disappearance of annuals species. With grazing cessation, Elymus repens was found to increase the size of aerial traits (shoot length and the number of leaves per shoot) and this may both be propitious for achieving dominance within plant communities and also maintaining its competitive local advantage. By contrast, Agrostis stolonifera showed an increase in a root trait, i. e. rhizome length, in the fenced site, which provide good ability for spatial propagation and then to explore adjacent patches. We concluded that Elymus repens presented a morphological capacity to change its colonising strategy from a guerrilla strategy to a phalanx strategy, by morphological variability of aerial organs, when it was submitted to competitive stress and environment modifications. Agrostis stolonifera showed a capacity to escape aerial competition resulting from grazing cessation, than to increase underground propagation capacity. The present study highlighted the capacities of Elymus repens to respond in an adaptative way to competitive pressure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} ‘Europeanization’ of the Hungarian {{regional}} innovation policy. We {{argue that the}} transposition of EU directives in the national legislation does not automatically fulfill the intermediate objective of Europeanization: good governance. Neither does it necessarily accomplish the ultimate objective of Europeanization: in this case, the reinforcement of the regions’ knowledge-based, <b>competitive</b> <b>capacities</b> that enable and enhance their catching-up. We document that Hungary complies with the procedural conditionalities listed in the European regulatory and legislative documents, but procedural Europeanization could not prevent a systemic failure caused by policy opportunism. The paper describes the social mechanism that has brought about state capture (also) within the public policy field of territorial development. We show that instead of substantive Europeanization, a single-actor governance system has been established. The concept of smart specialization in territorial development was easily incorporated in a carefully established system of façade regionalism. Meanwhile the real-world practice of regional innovation and development policy implementation recalls the hierarchical, paternalistic redistribution and subsidy allocation that characterized both the socialist era and the early transition years. This ‘traditional’ system features however some new elements, referred to by Magyar (2013) as the post-communist mafia state.

In {{order to avoid}} this situation leading to an unfair tax competition, instead of decreasing the corporation tax wholly, tax incentives for industrial property rights which contribute innovation are prefered. The dynamism of industrial property rights is higher {{compared to the other}} production factors and it is more susceptible to tax incentives. Lately, countries have begun tax incentive applications called either “patent box regime” or “innovation box regime” in order to attract innovative international companies to themselves. For the first time in 1973, “patent box regime” began to be implemented in Ireland and spread rapidly. In this content, this application was entered into force in such counties: France (2000), Hungary (2003), Belgium and the Netherlands (2007), Spain, Luxembourg and China (2008), Malta (2010), Liechtenstein (2011), England (2013), Portugal, Italy and Turkey (2014).
