40|$|Surface {{diffusion}} of strongly adsorbing hydrocarbon vapours on activated carbon {{was measured by}} using a <b>constant</b> <b>molar</b> flow method (D. D. Do, Dynamics of a semi-batch adsorber with <b>constant</b> <b>molar</b> supply rate: a method for studying adsorption rate of pure gas, Chem. Eng. Sci. 50 (1995) 549), where pure adsorbate is introduced into a semi-batch adsorber at a <b>constant</b> <b>molar</b> flow rate. The surface diffusivity was determined from the analysis of pressure response versus time, using a linear mathematical model developed earlier. To apply the linear theory over the non-linear range of the adsorption isotherm, we implement a differential increment method on the system which is initially equilibrated with some pre-determined loading. By conducting the experiments at different initial loadings, the surface diffusivity can be extracted {{as a function of}} loading. Propane, n-butane, n-hexane, benzene, and ethanol were used as diffusing adsorbate on a commercial activated carbon. It is found that the surface diffusivity of these strongly adsorbing vapours increases rapidly with loading, and the surface diffusion flux contributes significantly to the total flux and cannot be ignored. The surface diffusivity increases with temperature according to the Arrhenius law, and for the paraffins tested it decreases with the molecular weight of the adsorbate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to propose, for the first time, a set of group <b>molar</b> <b>constants</b> for sodium to {{calculate}} the partial solubility parameters of sodium salts. The values were estimated using the few experimental partial solubility parameters of acid/sodium salt series available either from the literature (benzoic acid/Na, ibuprofen acid/Na, diclofenac Na) or determined in this work (salicylic acid/Na, p-aminobenzoic acid/Na, diclofenac), the group contribution method of van Krevelen to calculate the partial parameters of the acids, and three reasonable hypothesis. The experimental method used is a modification of the extended Hansen approach based on a regression analysis of the solubility mole fraction of the drug lnX(2) against models including three- or four-partial solubility parameters of a series of pure solvents ranging from non-polar (heptane) to highly polar (water). The modified method combined with the four-parameter model provided the best results for both acids and sodium derivatives. The replacement of the acidic proton by sodium increased the dipolar and basic partial solubility parameters, whereas the dispersion parameter remained unaltered, thus increasing the overall total solubility parameter of the salt. The proposed group <b>molar</b> <b>constants</b> of sodium are consistent with the experimental results as sodium has a relatively low London dispersion <b>molar</b> <b>constant</b> (identical to that of -OH), a very high Keesom dipolar <b>molar</b> <b>constant</b> (identical to that of -NO(2), two times larger than that of -OH), and a very high hydrogen bonding <b>molar</b> <b>constant</b> (identical to that of -OH).

Like the constants for the other groups, the group <b>molar</b> <b>constants</b> proposed for sodium are certainly not the exact values. However, they are believed to be a fair approximation of the impact of sodium on the partial solubility parameters and, therefore, can be used as such in the group contribution method of van Krevelen...|$|R
