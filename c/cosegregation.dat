5000|$|Genetic linkage is the {{phenomenon}} where by alleles at different loci cosegregate in families. The strength of <b>cosegregation</b> {{is measured by}} the recombination fraction θ, the probability of an odd number of recombination. More complex pedigree provide higher power. Identity by descent (IBD) matrix estimation is a central component in mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) using variance component models. Alleles have identity by type (IBT) when they have the same phenotypic effect. Alleles that are identical by type fall into two groups; those that are identical by descent (IBD) because they arose from the same allele in an earlier generation; and those that are non-identical by descent (NIBD) or identical by state (IBS) because they arose from separate mutations. Parent-offspring pairs share 50% of their genes IBD, and monozygotic twins share 100% IBD. It should be noted that what is relevant in linkage analysis is the inheritance (or coinheritance) of alleles at adjacent loci; therefore; it is critical importance to determine whether the alleles are identical by descent (i.e. copies from same parental alleles) or only identical by state (i.e. appearing same, but derived from two different copies of alleles). Therefore there three categories of family-based linkage analysis - strongly modeled (the traditional lod score model), weakly model based (variance components methods), or model free. Variance component methods may be viewed as hybrids.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer based method to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions from expressed sequence tag data. Using a redundancy-based approach, valid SNPs are distinguished from erroneous sequence by their representation multiple times in an alignment of sequence reads. A second measure of validity was also calculated based on the <b>cosegregation</b> of the SNP pattern between multiple SNP loci in an alignment. The utility of this method was demonstrated by applying it to 102, 551 maize (Zea mays) expressed sequence tag sequences. A total of 14, 832 candidate polymorphisms were identified with an SNP redundancy score of two or greater. Segregation of these SNPs with haplotype indicates that candidate SNPs with high redundancy and <b>cosegregation</b> confidence scores are likely to represent true SNPs. This was confirmed by validation of 264 candidate SNPs from 27 loci, {{with a range of}} redundancy and <b>cosegregation</b> scores, in four inbred maize lines. The SNP transition/transversion ratio and insertion/deletion size frequencies correspond to those observed by direct sequencing methods of SNP discovery and suggest that the majority of predicted SNPs and insertion/deletions identified using this approach represent true genetic variation in maize...|$|E

Results are presented of DNA fingerprint segregation analyses {{carried out in}} three chicken pedigrees, calculating the number of detected loci, testing for Mendelian inheritance, and <b>cosegregation</b> among fingerprint bands. Two pedigrees (families 1 and 2) were analysed using the Jeffreys probes 33. 6 and 33. 15 only, and one pedigree (family 3) was analysed using 33. 6, 33. 15. 3 ′α-globin HVR and M 13 protein III gene repeat. Mean band transmission frequencies in families 1 and 2 were near to the Mendelian expectation of 0. 5 and no mutations were observed. Family 3 showed transmission frequencies slightly exceeding 0. 5. Linkage among bands was higher than observed in some other avian species, with each allele represented by a mean of 1. 48 HaeIII fragments. <b>Cosegregation</b> of heterozygous parental fragments representing distinguishable loci followed the expected binomial distribution. The number of minisatellites detectable by the four probes {{was estimated to be}} 217. The pattern of <b>cosegregation</b> among those minisatellite loci was tested against that expected for different levels of recombination {{through the use of a}} simulation model.

40|$|Improved {{methods to}} produce hybrid soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] seed could augment {{several types of}} research. Two {{previously}} described methods, the traditional method and the dilution method, require insect-facilitated cross-pollination of ms ms nuclear male-sterile plants. The traditional method requires a substantial time investment during flowering to remove fertile siblings, and the dilution method requires {{a substantial amount of}} land and pollen-parent seed. Because time, land, and seed are limited, a more efficient method would be valuable. The <b>cosegregation</b> method was developed, utilizing close genetic linkage between the W 1 locus and the Ms 6 locus. The W 1 ___, seedling has a purple hypocotyl; the w 1 w 1 seedling has a green hypocotyl. The ms 6 ms 6 plant is male sterile and female fertile. Approximately 97 % of the purple-hypocotyl seedlings, W 1 ___, in a line segregating for the w 1 and ms 6 alleles in coupling phase will he fertile, Ms 6 ___, and can be removed as a pollen source at the first-trifoliolate stage. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the three methods of hybrid soybean seed production for seed yield, efficiency, and hybrid seed purity and quality. We used a randomized complete-block design (three replications per location, three locations, two years). The <b>cosegregation</b> method gave higher seed yield, better efficiency, and equal or better seed quality (percentage germination, 100 -seed weight) than the other methods. Male-sterile plants yielded an average of 28. 6 seeds plant− 1 with the <b>cosegregation</b> method, 18. 2 seeds plant− 1 with the traditional method, and 9. 5 seeds plant− 1 with the dilution method. The <b>cosegregation</b> method will be useful in several research areas, including genetic control of complex traits, prediction of parental value, recurrent selection, and commercialization of hybrid soybean...|$|E

40|$|Migraine is a {{frequent}} familial disorder that, in common with most multifactorial disorders, has an unknown etiology. The authors identified several families with multiple individuals affected by typical migraine using a single set of diagnostic criteria and studied these families for <b>cosegregation</b> between the disorder and markers on chromosome 19, {{the location of a}} mutation that causes a rare form of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). One large tested family showed both <b>cosegregation</b> and significant allele sharing for markers situated within or adjacent to the FHM locus. Multipoint GENEHUNTER results indicated significant excess allele sharing across a 12. 6 - cM region containing the FHM Ca 2 + channel gene, CACNL 1 A 4 (maximum nonparametric linkage Z score = 6. 64, p = 0. 0026), with a maximum parametric lod score of 1. 92 obtained for a (CAG) (n) triplet repeat polymorphism situated in exon 47 of this gene. The CAG expansion did not, however, appear to be the cause of migraine in this pedigree. Other tested families showed neither <b>cosegregation</b> nor excess allele sharing to chromosome 19 markers. HOMOG analysis indicated heterogeneity, generating a maximum HLOD score of 3. 6.

40|$|Soybean is an autogamous crop species, and the {{production}} of large numbers of hybrid seeds has been tedious. Nevertheless, hybrid seed is important to certain types of research. Insect pollination of male-sterile plants facilitates {{the production}} of hybrid soybean seed. A new method of hybrid soybean seed production, the <b>Cosegregation</b> Method, which was developed in this dissertation research, utilizes close genetic linkage between a male-sterility locus, Ms 6, and a seedling marker locus, W 1. This closely-linked marker system allows identification of male-sterile plants at the seedling stage and improves hybrid seed production through greater efficiency and higher yield of hybrid seed per male-sterile plant. The <b>Cosegregation</b> Method was used to produce testcross (hybrid) seed for genotypic evaluation of germplasm. Seven lines were evaluated with two testers. Vegetative heterosis was expected to precondition testcross plants to early lodging, pod abortion, and grain yield reduction. Near-isogenic tester lines containing alleles affecting stem growth (normal, semideterminate, and short) were used to try to reduce vegetative heterosis and increase reproductive heterosis. Significant midparent heterosis and inbreeding depression, but not high-parent heterosis, was observed for nearly all traits. Concurrent use of per se and F 1 heterosis evaluation was considered most appropriate for germplasm evaluation. The choice of tester was important in determining parental value of germplasm. The semideterminate and short-stem types may be of value in commercial hybrid soybean lines, but were not useful to germplasm evaluation. The <b>Cosegregation</b> Method also can be used to facilitate S 1 and half-sib (population or inbred line as tester) recurrent selection for population improvement of complex agronomic traits by improving evaluation through the elimination of male-sterile plants as seedlings, and by allowing greater control of parental contributions during intermating. Development and use of the <b>Cosegregation</b> Method will assist in the elucidation of the genetic control of complex traits, the identification of lines to improve these traits, the improvement of populations for these traits through the use of recurrent selection, and determination of the agronomic potential of commercial hybrid soybean...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cosegregation</b> of {{cell wall}} and DNA of a lysis-negative mutant of Bacillus subtilis was {{examined}} by continuously labeling (i) cell wall, (ii) DNA, and (iii) both cell wall and DNA. After {{four to five}} generations of chase in liquid media it was found by light microscope autoradiography that the numbers of wall segregation units per cell are 29 and 9 in rich and minimal medium, respectively. Under the same conditions the numbers of segregation units of DNA were almost 50 % lower: 15 and 5, respectively. Simultaneous labeling of cell wall and DNA (iii) provided figures almost identical to those obtained for cell wall alone, (i), implying <b>cosegregation</b> of the two components. Statistical analysis ruled out their random distribution into daughter cells. Measurements of the positions of grain clusters {{at the end of}} the chase period along chains of cells, each derived from a single cell at the beginning of chase, show that cell wall units are localized according to a symmetrical pattern, whereas those of DNA are distributed in an asymmetrical but highly regular way. It appears that of two cell wall units of the same age one only has a strand of DNA attached to it. We present a simple diagrammatic model of cell wall organization and DNA-cell wall association which is compatible with our observations. Finally, we discuss previous experiments pertinent to <b>cosegregation</b> of cell wall and DNA obtained with cells grown on solid media as well as with germinating spores; an explanation for the independent segregation of cell wall and DNA observed in the latter case is advanced...|$|E

40|$|Recurrent {{selection}} (RS) {{has been}} used in plant breeding to successively improve synthetic and other multiparental populations. Synthetics are generated from a limited number of parents (Np), but little is known about how Np affects genomic selection (GS) in RS, especially the persistency of prediction accuracy (rg, g ^) and genetic gain. Synthetics were simulated by intermating Np= 2 – 32 parent lines from an ancestral population with short- or long-range linkage disequilibrium (LDA) and subjected to multiple cycles of GS. We determined rg, g ^ and genetic gain across 30 cycles for different training set (TS) sizes, marker densities, and generations of recombination before model training. Contributions to rg, g ^ and genetic gain from pedigree relationships, as well as from <b>cosegregation</b> and LDA between QTL and markers, were analyzed via four scenarios differing in (i) the relatedness between TS and selection candidates and (ii) whether selection was based on markers or pedigree records. Persistency of rg, g ^ was high for small Np, where predominantly <b>cosegregation</b> contributed to rg, g ^, but also for large Np, where LDA replaced <b>cosegregation</b> as the dominant information source. Together with increasing genetic variance, this compensation resulted in relatively constant long- and short-term genetic gain for increasing Np > 4, given long-range LDA in the ancestral population. Although our scenarios suggest that information from pedigree relationships contributed to rg, g ^ for only very few generations in GS, we expect a longer contribution than in pedigree BLUP, because capturing Mendelian sampling by markers reduces selective pressure on pedigree relationships. Larger TS size (NTS) and higher marker density improved persistency of rg, g ^ and hence genetic gain, but additional recombinations could not increase genetic gain...|$|E

40|$|Evidence for the {{involvement}} of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of bipolar affective disorder is now well established. However, the mode of inheritance is non-mendelian and this makes the identification of susceptibility loci difficult. A short-cut to localisation of a disease gene for an oligogenic/multifactorial disorder such as bipolar disorder may come from observation of <b>cosegregation</b> with a monogenic trait. We have described a family (pedigree 324) {{in which there was}} <b>cosegregation</b> of major affective disorder and Darier's disease, a dominantly inherited skin disorder, and hypothesised that this reflects genetic linkage between genes involved in these disorders. Genetic mapping studies have placed the locus for Darier's disease on chromosome 12 q 23 -q 24. We conducted subsequent linkage studies (1995) upon 45 bipolar families (without Darier's disease). These results showed some evidence in favour of linkage with chromosome 12 q markers with maximum evidence at a trinucleotide repeat marker within intron 1 of the phospholipase A 2 A (PLA 2 A) gene.

Using the enzymes HincII, NcoI, and SfaNI, 85 % of patients were heterozygous for at least one polymorphism and thus potentially informative for <b>cosegregation</b> studies. The polymorphisms were used to follow the inheritance of the defective allele of the LDL receptor gene in the relatives of a patient with FH. Assays of LDL receptor activity on lymphoblastoid cell lines from two members of the family was used to confirm that the proband, but not the hypercholesterolaemic brother, had a defect in the LDL receptor.

The multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 –Hirschsprung’s disease association {{has been shown to}} cosegregate in Hirschsprung’s disease patients with both short- and long-segment aganglionosis, although patients with longsegment aganglionosis a to carry the greatest risk. The Hirschsprung’s disease–medullary thyroid carcinoma relationship also appears to be bi-directional, and activation or suppression of the rearranged during transfection gene appeared to vary over succeeding generations within the same family. Rearranged during transfection gene variations are associated with both conditions. The <b>cosegregation</b> of Hirschsprung’s disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 is particularly interesting as it involves both ‘‘switch off’ ’ and ‘‘switch on’ ’ of the rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene in the same patient.

40|$|Most {{diagnostic}} laboratories {{are confronted with}} the increasing demand for molecular diagnosis from patients and families and the ever-increasing genetic heterogeneity of visual disorders. Concerning Retinal Dystrophies (RD), almost 200 causative genes {{have been reported to}} date, and most families carry private mutations. We aimed to approach RD genetic diagnosis using all the available genetic information to prioritize candidates for mutational screening, and then restrict the number of cases to be analyzed by massive sequencing. We constructed and optimized a comprehensive <b>cosegregation</b> RD-chip based on SNP genotyping and haplotype analysis. The RD-chip allows to genotype 768 selected SNPs (closely linked to 100 RD causative genes) in a single cost-, time-effective step. Full diagnosis was attained in 17 / 36 Spanish pedigrees, yielding 12 new and 12 previously reported mutations in 9 RD genes. The most frequently mutated genes were USH 2 A and CRB 1. Notably, RD 3 –up to now only associated to Leber Congenital Amaurosis – was identified as causative of Retinitis Pigmentosa. The main assets of the RD-chip are: i) the robustness of the genetic information that underscores the most probable candidates, ii) the invaluable clues in cases of shared haplotypes, which are indicative of a common founder effect, and iii) the detection of extended haplotypes over closely mapping genes, which substantiates <b>cosegregation,</b> although the assumptions in which the genetic analysis is based could exceptionally lead astray. The combination of the geneti...|$|E
40|$|A beta-tubulin gene from a UV-irradiated benomyl-resistant mutant of Fusarium moniliforme was isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The gene encodes a 446 -amino-acid {{polypeptide}} with homology {{to other}} fungal beta-tubulins. RNA blot analysis showed {{expression of the}} gene during vegetative growth and conidial germination but no expression during conidiation. A point mutation, which likely confers benomyl resistance, has been identified in the cloned gene; this mutation results in a single amino acid substitution of asparagine for tyrosine at position 50. Expression of benomyl resistance in the mutant was also cold sensitive. Sexual crosses betweeen the mutant and a wild-type strain indicated <b>cosegregation</b> of benomyl resistance and cold sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|We report two {{familial}} {{cases of}} NF 1 presenting as C to T transitions changing an Arg- 1947 codon {{to a stop}} codon. In {{one of the two}} families, <b>cosegregation</b> of the mutation with NF 1 was demonstrated, indicating this mutation causes the disease in this family. As the same mutation at Arg- 1947 has been reported previously in three cases of unrelated Caucasians (two are sporadic; the origin of the other is not reported), the codon at Arg- 1947 (CGA) in the NF 1 gene {{is considered to be a}} hotspot common among different ethnic groups and also among familial and sporadic cases. ...|$|E
40|$|Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant genodermatosis characterized by disturbed keratinocyte adhesion. The disease has recently been mapped to a 14 cM region on chromosome 3 q. We have further refined {{the location of the}} HHD gene by linkage analysis in six HHD families from Germany and Italy using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers and found no evidence for genetic heterogeneity. We observed complete <b>cosegregation</b> between HHD and marker D 3 S 1587, with a maximal lod score of 4. 54. Detailed haplotype analyses allowed us to narrow the interval containing the HHD locus to 5 cM, flanked by D 3 S 1589 and D 3 S 1290...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} linkage analysis in seven Italian families, in which mild osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) segregated as a dominant trait, {{by means of}} six DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of type I collagen genes. OI type I {{was linked to the}} alpha 1 (I) gene (COL 1 A 1) in two families, and to the alpha 2 (I) gene (COL 1 A 2) in one family. OI type IV segregated with COL 1 A 2 in two families. In two OI type I families, the molecular genetic data were insufficient for exclusion of one gene. Four DNA polymorphisms were particularly informative for <b>cosegregation</b> analysis of OI in Italian kindreds...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at [URL] aim of this work is to characterize possible modifying factors in 2 large families carrying the A 1555 G mitochondrial mutation. The heteroplasmy of the mutation, the presence of aminoglycosides, the <b>cosegregation</b> with other mitochondrial mutations, the proposed linkage in chromosome 8 and the association with TRMU and MTO 1 genes were studied. None of the mentioned modifying factors were related with the phenotype presentation of A 1555 G mutation. However, TRMU G 28 T single nucleotide polymorphism is present in 1 of the studied families. This study has been partially financed by the ILUNDAIN Foundation for Neurological Studies. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Normal tissue {{homeostasis}} {{is maintained}} through asymmetric cell divisions that produce daughter cells with differing self-renewal and differentiation potentials. Certain tumor cell subfractions can self-renew and repopulate the heterogeneous tumor bulk, suggestive of asymmetric cell division, but an equally plausible {{explanation is that}} daughter cells of a symmetric division subsequently adopt differing cell fates. <b>Cosegregation</b> of template DNA during mitosis is one mechanism by which cellular components are segregated asymmetrically during cell division in fibroblast, muscle, mammary, intestinal, and neural cells. Asymmetric cell division of template DNA in tumor cells has remained elusive, however. Through pulse-chase experiments with halogenated thymidine analogs, we determined that a small population of cells within human lung cancer cell lines and primary tumor cell cultures asymmetrically divided their template DNA, which could be visualized in single cells and in real time. Template DNA <b>cosegregation</b> was enhanced by cell–cell contact. Its frequency was density-dependent and modulated by environmental changes, including serum deprivation and hypoxia. In addition, we found that isolated CD 133 + lung cancer cells were capable of tumor cell repopulation. Strikingly, during cell division, CD 133 cosegregated with the template DNA, whereas the differentiation markers prosurfactant protein-C and pan-cytokeratins were passed to the opposing daughter cell, demonstrating that segregation of template DNA correlates with lung cancer cell fate. Our results demonstrate that human lung tumor cell fate decisions may be regulated during the cell division process. The characterization and modulation of asymmetric cell division in lung cancer can provide insight into tumor initiation, growth, and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Congenital contractural {{arachnodactyly}} (CCA) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder that is phenotypically similar to but genetically distinct from Marfan syndrome. Genetic-linkage analysis has implicated the fibrillin- 2 gene (FBN 2) as the CCA locus. Mutation analysis of two isolated CCA patients revealed missense mutations, indicating that defects in FBN 2 {{may be responsible}} for this disorder. However, <b>cosegregation</b> of a mutant allele with the disease phenotype has not yet been established. We have investigated the primary cause of CCA in a large well-characterized kindred with five generations comprising 18 affected individuals. Previous studies demonstrated linkage of this family's CCA phenotype to FBN 2. Mutation analysis of cDNA derived from the proband and her affected brother, using a nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay, revealed the partial skipping of exon 31. Approximately 25 % mutant transcript is produced, which is apparently sufficient to cause a CCA phenotype. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA revealed an unusual base composition for intron 30 and identified the mutation, a g- 26 t transversion, {{in the vicinity of the}} splicing branch-point site in intron 30. Genomic DNA from 30 additional family members, both affected and unaffected, then was analyzed for the mutation. The results clearly demonstrate <b>cosegregation</b> of the branch-point mutation with the CCA phenotype. This is the first report of a CCA mutation in a multiplex family, unequivocally establishing that mutation in FBN 2 are responsible for the CCA phenotype. In addition, branch-point mutations only very rarely have been associated with human disease, suggesting that the unusual composition of this intron influences splicing stability...|$|E
