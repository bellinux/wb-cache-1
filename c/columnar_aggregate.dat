Wilson Zumberge and Marshall (1) have recently done a classification of lake ice and reported that two basic structures were found: i) a coarsely crystalline <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregate,</b> ii) a finely crystalline granular aggregate. This crystalline granular aggregate is produced by the affects of heavy snow fall at the time of freeze-up or by snow fall on the ice surface which, by a process of wet and dry snow metamorphism, changes into the granular aggregate, forming a miner portion of the ice sheet...|$|E

This compound, as a free ligand or metal substituted, gives mesogenic material with a discotic, columnar structure. Its structural and magnetic properties have been characterized by optical and ESR spectroscopies. The spreading monolayer was not homogeneous and use of a typical film-forming amphiphile, such as stearic acid, was necessary for obtaining stable, reproducible surface films, which were easily transferred onto quartz plates treated with dimethyldichlorosilane. The properties of the film were also analyzed with both UV-vis and ESR spectroscopies. The film did not show orientation order, and the discotic material maintained a <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregate</b> structure...|$|E
40|$|How does DNA melt in <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{relative}} to its melting in diluted solution? Is the melting temperature increased or decreased with the aggregate density? Have DNA-DNA interactions, predominantly of electrostatic nature, {{an effect on}} the character of the melting transition? In attempt to answer these questions, we have incorporated the theory of electrostatic interactions between DNA duplexes into the simplest model of DNA melting. The analysis shows that the effect of aggregate density is very different for aggregates built of homologous (or identical) DNA fragments {{relative to}} the case of DNA with random base pair sequences. The putative attraction between homologous DNA helices hampers their melting and increases the melting temperature and can even dramatically change the character of the transition. In the aggregate of nonhomologous DNAs, the pattern of electrostatic interactions is more complicated, and their effect could be opposite; in some cases we may even expect electrostatically induced melting. These findings define new directions for melting experiments in dense DNA assemblies. I...|$|E

The spreading isotherms of pure metal compounds were interpreted in terms of inhomogeneous, rigid surface films, not suitable for LB film deposition. A better transfer was reached with mixtures (e. g. molar ratio) of Cu-TAP with the film forming stearic acid, thus obtaining stable and reproducible LB films with more than 300 layers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and physical properties {{of a series}} of molecular clips derived from the concave molecule propanediurea. These molecular clips are cavity-containing receptors that can bind a variety of aromatic guests. This binding is a result of hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. Previous work on molecular clips has been limited to compounds derived from substituted glycoluril. Propanediurea, the compound on which the clips described in this thesis are based, is a molecule that is slightly more concave than glycoluril. A literature survey is presented on the synthesis of glycoluril derivatives and analogues, with special focus on propanediurea derivatives. Subsequently, synthetic efforts to prepare a variety of propanediurea derivatives are described, as well as the synthesis of a variety of molecular clips and half clips from the newly prepared propanediurea derivatives. The binding properties of these propanediurea-derived clips are investigated. It is shown that higher flexibility of the side walls increases the affinity for guests. A comparison is made between clips derived from propanediurea and clips derived from glycoluril. The former clips have a much higher affinity for resorcinol than the latter ones. It is shown that this difference is due to the slightly smaller distance between the carbonyl binding sites in the propanediurea-derived clips. Finally, a number of functionalizations of the propanediurea-derived clip molecules are treated, with the ultimate goal of using their exceptional binding properties in the construction of large supramolecular aggregates. Clips functionalized with porphyrin residues as well as studies on their complexation behavior are descibed. Resorcinol-functionalized polystyrene is used to form a <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregate</b> by self-assocation with clips functionalized at their convex sides with large aliphatic tails. In addition, a clip functionalized at its convex side with resorcinol residues is presented. This molecule can self-associate to form hyperbranched or dendrimer-like structure...|$|E

40|$|Effects of pulse {{magnetic}} {{field on the}} optical transmission properties of thin ferrofluid (FF) layers were experimentally investigated. It was observed that, under an influence of an external uniform {{magnetic field}}, pulses applied to the samples surfaces in normal direction decrease the optical transmission with further returning it to its original state, even {{before the end of}} the field pulse. The dependencies of the observed effects on the magnetic pulse magnitude and the samples thickness were investigated. The experimental results are explained using FF <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> growth and lateral coalescence under influence of a magnetic field, leading to a light scattering type Rayleigh-to-Mie transition. Further evolution of this process comes to a geometrical optics scale and respective macroscopic observable opaque FF <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> emergence. These changes of optical transmission are non-monotonic during the magnetic field pulse duration with minimal value in the case of Mie scattering, which is known as a magneto-optical extinction trend inversion. The residual inversion was detected after the external magnetic field pulse falling edge. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we showed that a homogeneous external magnetic field is enough for the formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> and their fusion. The results clarify the known Li theory (Li et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 (2004) 3357, and Sci. Technol. Adv.

40|$|The optical {{transmission}} of a thin ferrofluid layer was investigated at various optical radiation wavelengths. The turning on of the durable {{external magnetic field}} pulse leads to nonmonotonic changes of the {{optical transmission}} value with minimal value during the field pulse. This phenomenon {{is related to the}} formation of <b>columnar</b> nanoparticle <b>aggregates</b> and transformation in the ferrofluid bulk. It was shown that time interval corresponding to the optical transmission minimum is proportional to the laser wavelength, which can be explained with Mie-like optical extinction on the ferrofluid aggregates and its dependence on the diameters of <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Hence, a simple experimental approach was proposed to measure and control the ferrofluid aggregates diameters in submicron spatial dimension ranges. Particularly, this approach could be used for the formation of composite nanomaterials consisting of polymers and magnetic nanoparticles with controlled structural parameters. These materials could be reused after parameters changes (e. g., lattice constant, aggregate size, and magnetic permeability tensor) with a heating/cooling cycle without the need for preparation of a new material from scratch...|$|R

The glycine derivative is a good gelator of chloroform, the alanine derivative gels ethanol and toluene, and the phenylalanine derivative gels benzene and toluene. The tryptophan derivative does not gel any of the solvents tested, most probably due to its more bulky structure, but forms microspheres by evaporation-induced self-assembly. The self-assembly properties of the π-gelators have been investigated using infrared, UV-absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, concentration- and temperature-dependent NMR, and X-ray scattering experiments on dried xerogel {{as well as the}} wet organogel. The latter experiments suggest the glycine gel in chloroform includes <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> with an overall disordered columnar oblique mesophase.

We determine the relative stabilities of the leftand right-handed helical conformers formed by these deuterated molecules by performing a conformational analysis in different alkane solvents.

Quinaldine red acetate and Pyronin Y self-organize into unimolecular stacks driven by attractive aromatic interactions. At high concentrations, spatial correlation among the molecular stacks gives rise to nematic liquid crystals in both systems. Quinaldine red acetate additionally produces a rare chromonic O phase built of <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> with anisotropic cross-section ordered in a rectangular lattice.

40|$|The {{design of}} supramolecular motifs with {{tuneable}} stability and adjustable supramolecular polymerisation mechanisms is of crucial importance to precisely control {{the properties of}} supramolecular assemblies. This report focuses on constructing p-conjugated oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPE) -based one-dimensional helical supramolecular polymers that show a cooperative growth mechanism. Thus, a novel set of discotic molecules comprising a rigid OPE core, three amide groups, and peripheral solubilising wedge groups featuring C 3 and C 2 core symmetry was designed and synthesised. All of the discotic molecules are crystalline compounds and lack a columnar mesophase in the solid state. In dilute methylcyclohexane solution, one-dimensional supramolecular polymers are formed stabilised by threefold intermolecular hydrogen bonding and pp interactions, as evidenced by 1 H NMR measurements. Small-angle X-ray and light scattering measurements reveal significant size differences between the <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> of C 3 - and C 2 -symmetrical discotics, that is, the core symmetry strongly influences {{the nature of the}} supramolecular polymerisation process. Temperature-dependent CD measurements show a highly cooperative polymerisation process for the C 3 -symmetrical discotics. In contrast, the self-assembly of C 2 -symmetrical discotics shows a smaller enthalpy release upon aggregation and decreased cooperativity. In all cases, the peripheral stereogenic centres induce a preferred handedness in the <b>columnar</b> helical <b>aggregates.</b> Moreover, one stereogenic centre suffices to fully bias the helicity in the C 2 -symmetrical discotics. Finally, chiral amplification studies with the C 3 -symmetrical discotics were performed by mixing chiral and achiral discotics (sergeants-and-soldiers experiment) and discotics of opposite chirality (majority-rules experiment). The results demonstrate a very strong sergeants-and-soldiers effect and a rather weak majority-rules effect...|$|R

In particular, for aqueous-based one-dimensional supramolecular polymers, this is a daunting task.

Intriguingly this rod-to-sphere transition is expressed in a loss of cooperativity in the temperature-dependent self-assembly mechanism. The aggregates were characterized using circular dichroism, UV and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and cryotransmission electron microscopy. In analogy to many systems found in biology, mechanistic details of the self-assembly pathways emphasize the importance of cooperativity as a key feature that dictates the physical properties of the produced supramolecular polymers...|$|R

Equimolar mixtures of the melamine with the complementary benzoic acids form discrete hydrogen-bonded heterodimers with elongated central core. The dimeric supermolecules involving two-chain partially fluorinated acids organize to infinite bilayer ribbons composed of distinct lipophilic, H-bonded polar aromatic and fluorinated regions, respectively. The two-dimensional lattice symmetry of the ribbon phases, rectangular or oblique, are defined by {{the positions of the}} fluorinated chains at the phenyl ring of the acid component.

Additionally, a cubic phase is observed at more elevated temperatures above the Col(h) phase. Docking of 2 or 3 equiv. of the two-chain benzoic acids to the melamine core leads to the formation of cylindrical aggregates with a polar hydrogen-bonded aromatic center surrounded by lipophilic alkyl segments and an outer sphere of fluorinated molecular blocks.

Absorption and fluorescence spectra of solutions are analyzed {{on the basis of}} quantum chemical calculations performed by the CS-INDO-CI (conformations spectra-intermediate neglect of differential overlap-configuration interaction) me thd. the absorption maximum is due to the SO- Sq transition while fluorescence originates from the weak SO- S 1 transition. In <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates,</b> the former transition corresponds to delocalized excited states while the latter corresponds to localized ones; calculation of intermolecular interactions shows that, at the temperature domain of the mesophases, all the molecules have the same excitation energy and, therefore, no spectral diffusion of the fluorescence is expected, in agreement with the time-resolved emission spectra. Excitation transfer is investigated by studying the fluorescence decays of mesophases doped with energy traps. Their analysis is made by means of Monte Carlo simulations considering both intracolumnar and intercolumnar jumps and using four different models for the distance dependence of the hopping probability.

A remarkable match/mismatch relationship between the configurations of the chiral centers of the cyclic diamine {{and those of the}} peptidic frame was observed. The macrocyclic tetraimine intermediates have been studied in detail by NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and molecular modeling, and the results support the appropriate preorganization induced by the match combination of the chiral centers.

The structural studies (NMR spectroscopy, CD, modeling) of these systems showed an intrinsically lower reactivity of the mismatch combination, even when the product of the reaction was acyclic.

Brachiopods (Composita sp.) are locally abundant in the reef facies, and contributed substantial firm ground for encrustation. Reef growth was controlled mainly by the abundance of fenestellid bryozoans. Their presence indicates reef formation during normal marine conditions. The reef developed in a high-energy area of the inner shelf. Reef growth probably stopped with the establishment of a peloidal mudstone facies, eventually indicating hypersaline conditions. The Engihoul reef is similar to Bomel reefs (also in the Lives Formation).

We focus here on the determination of the orientation of side-chain-modified disk-like phthalocyanine molecules that self-organize to form parallel <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. This work complements and follows on work published previously (Langmuir 2005, 21, 360 - 368) where we used the visible absorbance dichroism in similar assemblies to determine the tilt angles of discotic molecules. The approach described here is applicable to all disk-like molecules that possess distinct in-plane or out-of-plane IR transitions. Molecular orientation is determined by comparison of absorbance intensities that are measured using (i) a RAIRS spectrum of the thin-film material on a gold surface, (ii) transmission spectra taken at two different polarizations of the thin-film material on an IR-transparent silicon substrate, and (iii) a transmission IR spectrum of an isotropic sample. We chose two distinct IR transitions of this molecule (a C-O-C “in-plane ” stretch, îC-O-C, and a C-H out-of-plane bend, äC-H), which we initially assume are orthogonal to each other. The îC-O-C transition is modeled as an in-plane circular dipole, and the äC-H transition is modeled as a linear out-of-plane dipole.

We also present comparative analysis using cryo-TEM and replica freeze-fracture TEM on both thermotropic and lyotropic LCs. In addition to the revisits of previous practices, some new concepts are introduced, e. g., suspended thermotropic LC thin films, combined high-pressure freezing and cryo-sectioning of lyotropic LCs, and the complementary applications of direct TEM and indirect replica TEM techniques. The significance of subnanometer resolution cryo-TEM observation is demonstrated in a few important issues in LC studies, including providing direct evidences for the existence of nanoscale smectic domains in nematic bent-core thermotropic LCs, comprehensive understanding of the twist-bend nematic phase, and probing the packing of <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> in lyotropic chromonic LCs.

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements {{show that the}} planar organic cores, {{in spite of their}} positive charge, form closely packed columns with a repeating distance of similar to 3. 45 angstrom. Specular X-ray reflectivity (SXR) reveals the LB multilayers to consist of Y-type bilayers with thickness 31 angstrom for ATOTA- 1 and 41 angstrom for ATOTA- 2. This significant difference is ascribed to the different packing motifs of the alkyl chains in the two LB films. GIXD and polarized UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy show that the <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> in the LB films are oriented along the dipping direction. This alignment is attributed to shear effects during LB transfer.

50|$|Grunerite is {{a mineral}} of the {{amphibole}} group of minerals with formula Fe7Si8O22(OH)2. It is the iron endmember of the grunerite-cummingtonite series. It forms as fibrous, <b>columnar</b> or massive <b>aggregates</b> of crystals. The crystals are monoclinic prismatic. The luster is glassy to pearly with colors ranging from green, brown to dark grey. The Mohs hardness is 5 to 6 {{and the specific}} gravity is 3.4 to 3.5.|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} some {{characteristics of}} an unusual crystallized triphormic, trioctahedral, swelling layer silicate are presented. The saponite-mineral may well {{be similar to the}} macroscopic fibrous material which occurs as an alteration product in a soil, as described by Brown & Stephen (1959). The mineral (Plate 1) occurs as a vein-filling in recently exposed tholeiite near Winnweiler, Pfalz, West Germany. It consists of lustrous brown to dark olive-green, friable, columnar masses (1000 - 500 mm ~) of densely packed, parallel, rod-like, anhedral particles (1 - 11 mm long • 0 " 01 mm 2 section). From scanning electron-optical examination the well-exposed edges of the aggregate xhibit many sharp, linear oriented rims. The base of the <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates</b> is in a plane parallel to that of the surface of the vein and parallel to the mutual (001) crystal plane. The aggregates consist essentially of saponite; a few very thin random interleaves of calcite and some small grains of quartz and feldspar were observed. Single saponite particles (0 - 1 - 2 ram long) isolated by ultrasonic dispersion are partially transparent and vary slightly in eolour. From X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and elee-tronoptical evidence these particles are free from impurities. Preliminary single-crystal studies showed the material to be unsuitable for crystal structure analysis; although the particles look like single crystals (showing optical continuity), only preferred orientation patterns could, in fact, be obtained. Ultimate chemical analyses howed the material to be iron-rich and the following mean structural chemical formula was derived by calculation on a basis of a total of 44 gram-equivalents of cationic onstituents: 1. 04 M + (Si~. ~o + + +) w + + Alt. trFe 0. 24 (Mgt [...] s 4 Fe 0. t 4 Fe~ 9 ~ +Tio~ 2) v 102 o(OH) 4.

50|$|Mendipite {{is found}} in <b>columnar</b> or fibrous <b>aggregates,</b> often {{radiated}} but more rarely straight long fibers, and in cleavable masses. The cleavage is perfect on {110} and fair on {100} and {010}. Fracture is conchoidal (shell-like) to uneven and the mineral is soft, with hardness only 2½ to 3, a bit {{less than that of}} calcite. Because of the lead content the specific gravity is high, at 7.24, or 7 to 7.2, just a little less than that of mimetite, another lead mineral. Mendipite is soluble in dilute nitric acid, HNO3. It is not radioactive.|$|R
40|$|For aqueous based supramolecular polymers, the {{simultaneous}} control over shape, size and stability {{is very difficult}} 1. At the same time, {{the ability to do}} so is highly important in view of a number of applications in functional soft matter including electronics, biomedical engineering, and sensors. In the past, successful strategies to control {{the size and shape of}} supramolecular polymers typically focused on the use of templates 2, 3, end cappers 4 or selective solvent techniques 5. Here we disclose a strategy based on self-assembling discotic amphiphiles that leads to the control over stack length and shape of ordered, chiral <b>columnar</b> <b>aggregates.</b> By balancing electrostatic repulsive interactions on the hydrophilic rim and attractive non-covalent forces within the hydrophobic core of the polymerizing building block, we manage to create small and discrete spherical objects 6, 7. Increasing the salt concentration to screen the charges induces a sphere-to-rod transition. Intriguingly, this transition is expressed in an increase of cooperativity in the temperature-dependent self-assembly mechanism, and more stable aggregates are obtained. For our study we select a benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxamide (BTA) core connected to a hydrophilic metal chelate via a hydrophobic, fluorinated L-phenylalanine based spacer (Scheme 1). The metal chelate selected is a Gd(III) -DTPA complex that contains two overall remaining charges per complex and necessarily two counter ions. The one-dimensional growth of the aggregate is directed by p-p stacking and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. However, the electrostatic, repulsive forces that arise from the charges on the Gd(III) -DTPA complex start limiting the one-dimensional growth of the BTA-based discotic once a certain size is reached. At millimolar concentrations the formed aggregate has a spherical shape and a diameter of around 5 nm as inferred from 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The strength of the electrostatic repulsive interactions between molecules can be reduced by increasing the salt concentration of the buffered solutions. This screening of the charges induces a transition from spherical aggregates into elongated rods with a length 2 ̆ 6 gt; 25 nm. Cryo-TEM allows to visualise the changes in shape and size. In addition, CD spectroscopy permits to derive the mechanistic details of the self-assembly processes before and after the addition of salt. Importantly, the cooperativity -a key feature that dictates the physical properties of the produced supramolecular polymers- increases dramatically upon screening the electrostatic interactions. This increase in cooperativity results in a significant increase in the molecular weight of the formed supramolecular polymers in water...|$|R
