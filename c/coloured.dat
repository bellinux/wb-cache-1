40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1994 Chapter 1 {{looks into}} the {{following}} issues: * Problem of research: How does the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA provide for the different abilities, aptitudes and interests of the pupils? The sub-problems of the research are: What is the theory of differentiation {{in the school system}} for <b>coloureds</b> in the RSA? How did the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> provide for differentiation up to 1963 ? What provision for differentiation is made at pre-primary, primary, and secondary phases in <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA. * Aim of research The {{purpose of this study is}} to ascertain through research how the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA provides for different abilities, aptitudes and interests of the pupils. The sub-aims of research are: - to describe the theory of differentiation in the school system for Coloureds; - to describe how the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> catered for differentiation up to 1963, and; - to ascertain and evaluate the provision of differentiation for <b>Coloureds</b> at present in pre-primary, primary, and secondary education. * Methods of research: The following methods of research were used: literature study interviews and scientific formulation of findings. * Demarcation of the field of study: This study is confined to the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA. The national and independent states have been excluded. The theoretical basis for differentiation and the historical perspectives on the school system for <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA have been discussed in Chapter 2 as well as the theoretical model for evaluation of differentiation. * The definition as well as the components of an education system are given in this chapter. The theoretical basis for differentiation includes: - views on differentiated education and differentiated teaching; - the meaning of educational planning for differentiated education; - techniques for differentiation; - anthropological grounds for differentiation and differentiated schools; - types of differentiation; - historical background of differentiation in the schools for <b>Coloureds.</b> The availability of differentiation in pre-primary and primary education for <b>Coloureds</b> at present in the RSA is discussed in Chapter 3. The following are the main issues: - Types of pre-primary and primary schools; - Control and organisation of education for <b>Coloureds</b> in RSA; - Curricula for pre-primary and primary education for Coloureds; - Number of students; - Examination and standards; - School guidance; Chapter 4 of this study will look into the availability of differentiation in secondary schools for <b>Coloureds</b> in the RSA. The following are the main issues: * Types of Secondary Schools * Phases * Curriculum for secondary education * Special education * Schools of industry and reform schools * Training of agriculture * Artisans * Seamen Chapter 5 summarises all issues discussed and after these findings and recommendations are made.

5|$|Following a light {{microscopy}} examination in 2001, it was initially {{thought that the}} rains were <b>coloured</b> by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study commissioned by the Government of India concluded that the rains had been <b>coloured</b> by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial green alga from the genus Trentepohlia. An international team later identified the exact species as T. annulata.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically <b>coloured.</b> This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus <b>coloured,</b> was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously <b>coloured</b> objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
50|$|In Southern Africa Cape <b>Coloureds</b> (Kaapse Kleurling) is {{the name}} given to an ethnic group {{composed}} primarily of persons of mixed race. Although Cape <b>Coloureds</b> form a minority group within South Africa, they are the predominant population group in the Western Cape.|$|R
50|$|The 1956 law allowed <b>Coloureds</b> {{to elect}} four people to Parliament, but a 1969 law {{abolished}} those seats and stripped <b>Coloureds</b> {{of their right}} to vote. Since Asians had never been allowed to vote, this resulted in whites being the sole enfranchised group.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} Cape <b>Coloureds</b> were interviewed in the {{documentary}} series Ross Kemp on Gangs.

5|$|He {{showed that}} <b>coloured</b> light {{does not change}} its {{properties}} by separating out a <b>coloured</b> beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E

Creoles make up 30% of the Mauritian population. Since independence over 90% of <b>Coloureds</b> have left Mauritius, hence Creole is generally refer to as an African person as a pose before independence Creole was usually referred to a mixed-race person of mostly European background.|$|R

5|$|Some {{animals are}} <b>coloured</b> purely {{incidentally}} because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange <b>coloured</b> riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E

5000|$|From 1907 to 1929, <b>Coloureds</b> of both Indian and European {{parentage}} were accrued {{the same}} status as black Africans under the Nyasaland Interpretation Ordinance, which classified them as [...] "natives". Educated <b>Coloureds</b> protested this policy, and successfully lobbied {{to have it}} challenged before the colonial judiciary. A Nyasaland judge determined that [...] "half-castes" [...] {{did not meet the}} legal definition of [...] "native", although he refrained from ruling on whether their newly altered status made them British subjects. The ruling incited considerable debate about the social, legal, and political standing of mixed-descent Africans in other British colonies. The Anglo-African Association seized this opportunity to demand they be taxed as Europeans, and exempted from what they perceived as a degrading [...] "hut tax" [...] levied on black residents of indigenous settlements. As a result of their lobbying, <b>Coloureds</b> were exempted from the hut tax; ironically, however, the government failed to clarify whether this entailed also subjecting <b>Coloureds</b> to the same taxes as the white population - a bureaucratic oversight that resulted in the entire community paying no tax by the early 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia), a British {{possession}} which remained governed {{directly by}} the Colonial Office, considered [...] "Coloured" [...] to be a strictly South African racial distinction, and evoked the term only when referring to immigrants of mixed race from South Africa accordingly. This resulted in considerable ambivalence towards local <b>Coloureds</b> born in Northern Rhodesia, whom colonial officials described with a menagerie of labels as varied as [...] "half-castes", [...] "Anglo-Africans", [...] "Indo-Africans", and [...] "Eurafricans". Northern Rhodesian <b>Coloureds</b> often bore distinguished British surnames, having descended {{from some of the}} colony's earliest pioneers, administrators, and officials. Nevertheless, beginning in the 1920s such individuals posed a particular classification problem for the Colonial Office, which remained frustrated by the fact it could classify <b>Coloureds</b> neither as European nor African. The British paternity of mixed children was an especially contentious issue, allowing <b>Coloureds</b> to petition for recognition as British subjects, entitled to British passports. Their requests were ignored by the Colonial Office, which regarded them only as protected subjects, a status otherwise reserved for black Africans.|$|R

5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly <b>coloured</b> or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly <b>coloured,</b> {{and many of them are}} chemically defended, but there is no relationship between the two factors.|$|E
40|$|More than {{a decade}} after the end of apartheid, {{inequality}} along racial lines is widely apparent. While the greatest disparity exists between Whites and non-Whites, inequality also persists among non-Whites. With reference to the youth of the Western Cape, <b>Coloureds</b> have higher per capita household income, more educated parents, superior schooling inputs and improved performance on achievement tests in comparison to Africans. The finding that <b>Coloureds</b> have only a slightly higher matriculation rate and a statistically equivalent enrolment rate leads one to ask whether the races face different influences on their process of educational attainment. Using individual and household data from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), matriculation and enrolment (conditional on matriculation) are modeled for Africans and <b>Coloureds</b> separately...|$|R
50|$|<b>Coloureds</b> {{were removed}} from the Common Roll of Cape Province in 1953. Instead of voting for the same representatives as White South Africans, they could now only vote for four White representatives to speak for them. Later, in 1968, the <b>Coloureds</b> were disenfranchised altogether. In the place of the four {{parliamentary}} seats, a partially elected body was set up to advise the government in an amendment to the Separate Representation of Voters Act.|$|R
