25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and oceanography, it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> are introduced. Their relative importance {{is determined by the}} applicable Rossby numbers. Tornadoes have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.|$|E
25|$|Since friction, {{pressure}} gradient and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> {{do not necessarily}} balance out, air masses actually accelerate and decelerate, so the actual speed depends on its past values too.|$|E
25|$|The Rossby {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} to <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces.</b> A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces,</b> and a large Rossby number indicates {{a system in which}} inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.|$|E

25|$|In {{studies with}} Manduca sexta, moths have dynamic flight sensory {{abilities}} {{due to their}} antennae. The antennae are vibrated in a plane {{so that when the}} body of the moth rotates during controlled aerial maneuvers, the antennae are subject to the inertial <b>coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> that are linearly proportional to the angular velocity of the body. The <b>coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> cause deflections of the antennae, which are detected by the Johnston's organ at the base of each antenna, with strong frequency responses at the beat frequency of the antennae (around 25Hz) and at twice the beat frequency. The relative magnitude of the two frequency responses enables the moth to distinguish rotation around the different principal axes, allowing for rapid course control during aerial maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|In moths, their {{antennae}} {{are known}} to be responsible for the sensing of <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> in the similar manner as with the halteres in flies. In both flies and moths, a collection of mechanosensors {{at the base of the}} appendage are sensitive to deviations at the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the pitch and roll planes, and at twice the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the yaw plane.|$|E
25|$|The ball {{travels in}} the air, {{and there is}} no net force upon it. To the {{stationary}} observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a curved path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing {{to the right of the}} instantaneous direction of travel for a counter-clockwise rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{asymptotic}} behavior of weakly transverse water-waves under a weak <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forcing</b> {{in the long}} wave regime.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> acts in a {{physically}} rotating system {{so as to}} induce a perpendicular deflection in a moving element. It can be caused inertially, by contact forces, or by both, and its action is restricted to the transverse and the axial directions. In cases where the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is caused inertially, the precise physical nature of the inertial force varies according to the chosen point of origin. However, when we choose the origin {{to be at the}} centre of the rotating system, we can ascertain a distinct physical nature for the inertial <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> that distinguishes it from the closely related centrifugal force. Centrifugal force arises from pressure differential, and the relevant causative motion in centrifugal force is directly tied up with the state of rotation. Inertial <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> on the other hand is caused by an independent motion in a rotating system. This motion will induce an inertial aether pressure in the all pervading electron-positron vortex sea, and due to the asymmetry that this motion causes, the inertial pressure will give rise to a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force.</b> Most of the well known phenomena that are believed to be caused by the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> are in fact caused by a complex mixture of illusion, general inertia, and dragging <b>forces.</b> Pure inertial <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> in isolation can be observed where a comet is deflected sideways and prevented from collapsing into the Sun.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} field of a rotating body of conductive gas or liquid develops self-amplifying electric currents, {{and thus a}} self-generated {{magnetic field}}, due {{to a combination of}} differential rotation (different angular velocity of different parts of body), <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> and induction. The distribution of currents can be quite complicated, with numerous open and closed loops, and thus the magnetic field of these currents in their immediate vicinity is also quite twisted. At large distances, however, the magnetic fields of currents flowing in opposite directions cancel out and only a net dipole field survives, slowly diminishing with distance. Because the major currents flow in the direction of conductive mass motion (equatorial currents), the major component of the generated magnetic field is the dipole field of the equatorial current loop, thus producing magnetic poles near the geographic poles of a rotating body.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E
25|$|In Newton's {{time the}} fixed stars were invoked as a {{reference}} frame, supposedly at rest relative to absolute space. In reference frames that were either at rest {{with respect to the}} fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, Newton's laws of motion were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, an important case being frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces, for example, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. Two interesting experiments were devised by Newton to demonstrate how these forces could be discovered, thereby revealing to an observer that they were not in an inertial frame: the example of the tension in the cord linking two spheres rotating about their center of gravity, and the example of the curvature of the surface of water in a rotating bucket. In both cases, application of Newton's second law would not work for the rotating observer without invoking centrifugal and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> to account for their observations (tension {{in the case of the}} spheres; parabolic water surface in the case of the rotating bucket).|$|E
25|$|In physics, the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|R
50|$|Where matter moves {{relative}} to the co-rotating frame it will seem to be acted upon by a <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force.</b> This is not derivable from the Roche lobe model as the <b>Coriolis</b> <b>force</b> is a non-conservative force (i.e. not representable by a scalar potential).|$|R

2500|$|<b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces</b> {{resulting}} from linear motion of these appendages are detected within the rotating {{frame of reference}} of the insects' bodies.

2500|$|The Coriolis force {{exists only}} when one uses a {{rotating}} reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves {{exactly like a}} real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force {{is a consequence of}} inertia, and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use Newton's second law in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout (Merry-go-round [...] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right. From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. For a mathematical formulation see Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces. In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces.</b> In long-range gunnery, sight corrections for the Earth's rotation are based upon the Coriolis force. These examples are described in more detail below.|$|E

In fact the south flowing Agulhas Current swings away from the African {{coastline}} between about East London and Port Elizabeth, from where it follows the edge of the Continental shelf roughly as far as the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank, 250km (155miles) south of Cape Agulhas. From there it is retroflexed (turned sharply round) in an easterly direction by the South Atlantic, South Indian and Southern Ocean currents, known as the [...] "West Wind Drift", which flow eastwards round Antarctica. The Benguela Current, on the other hand, is an upwelling current which brings cold, mineral-rich water from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the surface along the west coast of Southern Africa. Having reached the surface it flows northwards {{as a result of the}} prevailing wind and <b>Coriolis</b> <b>forces.</b> The Benguela Current, therefore, effectively starts at Cape Point, and flows northwards from there, [...] although further out to sea it is joined by surface water that has crossed the South Atlantic from South America as part of the South Atlantic Gyre. [...] Thus the Benguela and Agulhas currents do not strictly [...] "meet" [...] anywhere, although eddies from the Agulhas current do from time to time round the Cape to join the Benguela Current.|$|E
