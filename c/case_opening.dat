6000|$|When {{they were}} {{arranging}} {{him for his}} last rest, they found upon his bosom a small, plain miniature <b>case,</b> <b>opening</b> with a spring. It was the miniature of a noble and beautiful female face; and on the reverse, under a crystal, a lock of dark hair. They laid them back on the lifeless breast,--dust to dust,--poor mournful relics of early dreams, which once made that cold heart beat so warmly! ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{go out of}} {{the house}} for a walk, {{uncertain}} as yet whither I will bend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me, I find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and inevitably settle southwest, toward some particular wood or meadow or deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to settle,--varies a few degrees, and does not always point due southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this 'variation, but it always settles between west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side. The outline which would bound my walks would be, not a circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been thought to be non-returning curves, in this <b>case</b> <b>opening</b> westward, in which my house occupies the place of the sun. I turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour, until I decide, for a thousandth time, that I will walk into the southwest or west. Eastward I go only by force; but westward I go free. Thither no business leads me. It is {{hard for me to believe}} that I shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon. I am not excited by the prospect of a walk thither; but I believe that the forest which I see in the western horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me. Let me live where I will, on this side is the city, on that the wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and more, and withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much stress on this fact, if I did not believe that something like this is the prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe. And that way the nation is moving, and I may say that mankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have witnessed the phenomenon of a southeastward migration, in the settlement of Australia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement, and, judging from the moral and physical character of the first generation of Australians, has not yet proved a successful experiment. The eastern Tartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet. [...] "The world ends there," [...] say they, [...] "beyond there is nothing but a shoreless sea." [...] It is unmitigated East where they live.|$|E

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study analyzes {{the impact of}} labor market conditions and welfare policies accompanying the 1990 s waivers granted {{by the federal government}} to California and the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWOA) on families entering welfare (accessions). A time series model was specified for analyzing the number of families entering welfare from January 1983 to December 1998. The findings suggest that in 1998 under PRWOA, all else constant, there were fewer <b>case</b> <b>openings.</b> Prior to the PRWOA, policy shifts of the 1990 s did not have an impact on <b>case</b> <b>openings.</b> The findings also show that under economic recovery fewer families applied for welfare. The implications of these findings are that drastic measures such as time-limited welfare should be re-examined since a favorable economic environment allows many recipients to remain off public assistance {{even in the absence of}} such measures...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the ultimate load behaviour of small-scale steel box girder models is described. The models were subjected either to predominant shear or pure bending loads and, in the latter <b>case,</b> <b>openings</b> were introduced into the webs {{of two of the}} models.

Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality.|$|E

When arrested, Stuart had only four shillings and sixpence halfpenny ($0.46) and was thus unable to contribute to the cost of his defence. The Law Society had few resources and was unable to pay for many of the out of pocket expenses required for the defence case, such as checking Stuart's alibi, conducting forensic tests and consulting expert witnesses.|$|E

50|$|Livingston died in 1813 {{and passed}} his {{shares of the}} {{steamboat}} company on to his sons-in-law. With Fulton’s death two years later, the original power behind the partnership dissolved. This left the company with its monopoly in New York waters prey to other ambitious American businessmen. Livingston's heirs later granted an exclusive license to Aaron Ogden to run a ferry between New York and New Jersey, while Thomas Gibbons and Cornelius Vanderbilt established a competing service. The Livingston Fulton monopoly was dissolved in 1824 following the landmark Gibbons v. Ogden Supreme Court <b>case,</b> <b>opening</b> New York waters to all competitive steam navigation companies.

50|$|A {{monitor and}} any floppy or hard disk drives are {{connected}} to the motherboard through cables connected to graphics adapter and disk controller cards, respectively, installed in expansion slots. Each expansion slot on the motherboard has a corresponding opening {{in the back of the}} computer case through which the card can expose connectors; a blank metal cover plate covers this <b>case</b> <b>opening</b> (to prevent dust and debris intrusion and control airflow) when no expansion card is installed. Memory expansion beyond the amount installable on the motherboard was also done with boards installed in expansion slots, and I/O devices such as parallel, serial, or network ports were likewise installed as individual expansion boards. For this reason, it was easy to fill the five expansion slots of the PC, or even the eight slots of the XT, even without installing any special hardware. Companies like Quadram and AST addressed this with their popular multi-I/O cards which combine several peripherals on one adapter card that uses only one slot; Quadram offered the QuadBoard and AST the SixPak.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} MEPs’ voting behaviour on all {{regulations and}} directives forming the Six-Pack and the Two-Pack {{together with the}} key vote required to establish the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

After failing to get the saddlebag, he turns to see drag marks and a third, more recent corpse, Professor Tagert. Right next to him is Odell Redd, {{pointing}} Cassidy’s old gun at Chee. Redd drove the three originally, and disagreed with Tagert {{on how to handle}} this historical find: recognition versus wealth. When Tagert marched Redd out with his gun, Pinto took the gun and shot Tagert. Redd drove away. Thus Chee found Pinto walking down the road, saying he is ashamed. Learning that Taka Ji was the driver of that vehicle, Redd rues murdering the father. Redd now reaches for the saddlebag, and the perturbed rattlesnake bites him on the neck.

40|$|ABSTRACTUnstiffened {{plates are}} {{integral}} part {{of all kinds of}} structures such as ship and offshore oil platforms. Openings are unavoidable and absolutely reduce the ultimate strength of structures. In this study, the finite element analysis package, ABAQUS, is used to analyze the behavior of unstiffened plate with rectangular opening. The rectangular opening form is divided into two cases. In <b>case</b> 1, <b>opening</b> depth is constant, but opening width is varied. Meanwhile, in <b>case</b> 2 <b>opening</b> width is fixed and opening depth is varied. Besides, for the two different form opening, the effect of plate slenderness parameter (β), opening area ratio (AR) and opening position ratio (PR) on the ultimate strength of plate with opening under axial compression are presented. It has been found that the ultimate strength of plate ofcase 1 is much more sensitive to the plate slenderness parameter (β) and opening area ratio (AR) than that of case 2. However, for <b>case</b> 1, <b>opening</b> position (PR) almost has no effect on the ultimate strength, whereas, regardingcase 2, the influence of opening position (PR) depends on the plate slenderness parameter (β). Based on nonlinear regression analysis, three design formulae are not only developed butalso approved reasonably for the practical engineering design...|$|R
