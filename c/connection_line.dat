5|$|In 1899, Oslo Municipality {{established}} KKS {{to build}} and operate three tram lines. The second line to open was the Rodeløkka Line on 23 March 1900, which connected to the KSS-owned Grünerløkka–Torshov Line at Nybrua near Hausmanns gate. The line was built as double track until Tromsøgata. It ran along Trondheimsveien before it branched off at Helgesens gate towards Rodeløkka; it followed Rathkes gate, Verksgata and Københavnsgata before reaching Dælenenggata. Here, a small depot was built with place for six cars. On 26 January 1901, a new <b>connection</b> <b>line</b> through Dronningens gate was built from Tollbugata to Kirkeristen, and the company no longer needed to lease tracks from Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei in the city center. KKS was bought by KSS in 1905.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} {{his career with}} scoring totals of 512 goals and 814 assists for 1326 points in 1191 games. At {{the time of his}} retirement, Perreault was the sixth leading scorer in NHL history. Along with the other two members of the French Connection, Perreault was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame in 1989. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Sabres retired his number 11 in the same year, having been the only player to ever wear number 11 for the Buffalo Sabres; his #11 was the first number retired by the Sabres. When his French Connection linemates' numbers were retired, Perreault's #11 was lowered and raised back between Martin's #7 and Robert's #14, as the Buffalo Sabres retired the French <b>Connection</b> <b>line</b> as a group, marking the first three players to have their numbers retired by the Sabres.|$|E
25|$|Holmestrand Municipal Council {{voted on}} 20 November 1900 {{in favor of}} a station at the square with a {{connection}} over Gausen, estimated to cost NOK43,000, including the <b>connection</b> <b>line.</b> Because this avoided running via the docks, this gave the lowest cost. Other alternatives cost as much as NOK154,000. However, NSB's district chief stated on 18 May 1901 that the state railways were opposed to this alternative because the link would have a negative influence on operations at Holmestrand Station. After negotiations the two companies reached an agreement, with permission given on 26 August 1902.|$|E

25|$|The {{preliminary}} {{layout of}} the future Line 4 (Moyúa/Rekalde) was presented on January 25, 2008. The preliminary layout suggests that Moyúa Station, which gives service to Line 1 and Line 2, will connect with Rekalde with two intermediate stations: Zabalburu (which has a suburban rail station) and Irala. There have been discussions about the ramifications of whether to connect with either Moyúa Station or Bilbao Abando Station, {{this is due to}} the fact that Rekalde did not have a Metro <b>connection.</b> <b>Line</b> 3 was planned to connect Rekalde with the rest of the city, but the final plan moved the line in another direction.|$|E
25|$|The town's first station {{opened in}} 1881 and serving the Vestfold Line, was {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). With the planning of a private railway to Hvittingfoss during {{the last years of}} the 1890s, there arose a controversy over the location of a new station in Holmestrand. As both single parcels and whole wagon-loads would be transshipped between HVB and NSB, the two railway lines would necessarily have to be connected. Five proposals for lines were made, which would either give a common station for both railways in Holmestrand, or two separate stations. Two of the alternatives called for a common station, with the tracks either running via Gausen or the docks. A separate station was proposed either at the town square, with the <b>connection</b> <b>line</b> being built via Gausen or the docks. Alternatively, the station could be built at Gausen.|$|E
500|$|Since both tram {{companies}} were profitable, {{the city council}} decided to start another service—Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie (KKS, [...] "Kristiania Municipal Tramways")—the first municipally owned tram operator in Norway. Sagene Ring was the first line, which opened on 24 November 1899 from Sagene to Akersgata, {{where there was a}} connection onwards to Østbanen station using KES tracks. On 26 January 1901, a <b>connection</b> <b>line</b> was built from Tollbugaten to Kirkeristen in the city centre to avoid running on KES tracks.|$|E

500|$|In the 1974–75 season Shero led the Flyers to a 51–18–11 record. They won {{the newly}} formed Patrick Division, were first in the new Campbell Conference, and first overall in the NHL. In their opening series the Flyers swept the Toronto Maple Leafs, setting up a semi-final match-up against the New York Islanders. After taking a 3–0 series led, the Flyers lost three {{straight}} {{to set up a}} deciding seventh game. Before game seven, Shero wrote a quote by Dag Hammarskjöld – [...] "Only he deserves power who every day justifies it." [...] on the blackboard. Though Shero never admitted it, the quote was believed to be directed at centre Rick MacLeish who had underperformed in the series. MacLeish responded and in game seven he registered a hat-trick as the Flyers won the game 4–1. The win set up a Stanley Cup Finals match-up with Buffalo. Shero and the coaching staff again devised a game plan. This time it was to stop Buffalo's French <b>Connection</b> <b>line.</b> The first part of the plan was to keep Sabre's centre Gilbert Perreault out of the middle of the rink and to take away his passing options. The Flyers' centres were instructed to play close to Perreault and be physical against him, {{to the point where it}} bordered on a penalty. The second part involved wearing down the French connection. Shero made numerous line changes to keep fresh players out against the Sabre's trio. A perfect example of this part of the strategy was in game one. The French Connection took a 97-second shift and the Flyers made three line changes during that time. Shero's strategy worked, and the Flyers won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.|$|E
