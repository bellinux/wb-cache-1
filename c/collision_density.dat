40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} estimate the error when the flat-flux approximation is used to compute the resonance integral for a single absorber element embedded in a neutron source. The {{investigation was}} initiated by assuming a parabolic flux distribution in computing the flux-averaged escape probability which occurs in the <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> equation. Furthermore, also assumed were both wide resonance and narrow resonance expressions for the resonance integral. The fact that this simple model demonstrated {{a decrease in the}} resonance integral motivated the more detailed investigation of the thesis. An integral equation describing the <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> as a function of energy, position and angle is constructed and is subsequently specialized to the case of energy and spatial dependence. This equation is further simplified by expanding the spatial dependence in a series of Legendre polynomials (since a one-dimensional case is considered). In this form, the effects of slowing-down and flux depression may be accounted for to any degree of accuracy desired. The resulting integral equation for the energy dependence is thus solved numerically, considering the slowing down model and the infinite mass model as separate cases. From the solution obtained by the above method, the error ascribable to the flat-flux approximation is obtained. In addition to this, the error introduced in the resonance integral in assuming no slowing down in the absorber is deduced. Results by Chernick for bismuth rods, and by Corngold for uranium slabs, are compared to the latter case, and these agree to within the approximations made. ...|$|E

40|$|Nanoscale {{optoelectronics}} and molecular-electronics systems {{operate with}} current injection and nonequilibrium tunneling, phenomena that challenge consistent {{descriptions of the}} steady-state transport. The current affects the electron-density variation and hence the inter- and intra-molecular bonding which in turn determines the transport magnitude. The standard approach for efficient characterization of steady-state tunneling combines ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations (of an effective scattering potential) with a Landauer-type formalism and ignores all actual many-body scattering. The standard method also lacks a formal variational basis. This paper formulates a Lippmann-Schwinger <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> functional theory (LSC-DFT) for tunneling transport with full electron-electron interactions.

At low dose, where sublethal damage is unimportant, the contribution from target fragments dominates, causing the proton effectiveness to be very different from that of γ rays with a strongly fluence-dependent RBE. At high energies, the nuclear fragmentation cross sections become independent of energy.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{clustering}} of colour strings in the transverse plane of nucleus-nucleus collisions {{and argue that}} deconfinement sets in when the string density within a cluster reaches a critical value. We show that this implies a minimal cluster size {{at the onset of}} deconfinement, which in turn results in discontinuous behaviour for J/ψ suppression. Statistical quantum chromodynamics predicts that strongly interacting matter will become deconfined at high temperatures and/or densities. The aim of high energy nuclear collisions is to produce and study this new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, in the laboratory. One prerequisite for such studies is an understanding of the onset of deconfinement. In the most general sense, the deconfinement of quarks and gluons means that these partons are no longer constrained to the distributions by which they are governed within hadrons [1]. Such constraints are presumably removed once enough nucleon-nucleon interactions overlap in space and time, i. e., for a sufficiently high <b>collision</b> <b>density.</b> A partitioning of the coloured partons into colour-neutral subsets is then no longer meaningful; instead, there emerge colour-conducting clusters of much larger than hadronic size...|$|E

The validity of obtaining approximate solutions of the slowlngdown equation {{by the process of}} successive iteration is examined and proven to be universally applicable. The rate of convergence of the iterative procedure is shown to be intimately connected with the 2 ̆ 2 Spinney condition 2 ̆ 2. The iterative procedure is shown to be rapidly convergent when this condition is satisfied but the marked change in the neutron flux distribution below the resonance centre, when the condition is not satisfied, can result in very slow convergence. The iterative procedure of Goldstein and Cohen is extended to a third iteration and the behaviour of the first and second iterations, when the l/E dependence of the asymptotic flux is retained, is examined.

We consider both classical transport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary dimensions {{as well as a}} number of non-classical transport theories (non-exponential random flights) that describe a broader class of transport processes within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous asymptotic diffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize Grosjean's moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or uncollided) distribution from the collided portion and approximating only the latter using diffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension and for many free-path distributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations that are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small source-detector separations than either $P_ 1 $ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic diffusion. These diffusion-based approximations are exact in the first two even spatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical transport types.

40|$|This paper investigates {{and compares}} {{the effect of}} a solid, spherical {{particle}} phase on surrounding carrier fluids (air and water) in a turbulent channel flow. The fluid phase properties are chosen to represent a flow typical of the nuclear waste industry, with the flow modelled using the direct numerical simulation (DNS) code, Nek 5000, at a shear Reynolds number of 180. A Lagrangian particle tracker is developed and implemented to simulate the dispersed phase, capable of accommodating two-way coupling between the fluid and discrete phase and inter-particle collisions (four-way coupling). In order to investigate the effect that the four-way coupled particulate phase has on the turbulence field, mean fluid velocities and turbulence intensity statistics are recorded. The work demonstrates that the introduction of two-way coupling does indeed impact slightly on the turbulence field. Specifically, it reduces the mean velocity profile and increases the streamwise turbulence intensity in the near-wall region. Upon the introduction of inter-particle collisions, the flow statistics studied show a negligible response. <b>Collision</b> <b>density</b> distributions are studied and a temporal migration to the near-wall region is observed. Along-side this, to investigate particle density-ratio effects, water-based results are contrasted with simulations in air. The way in which the flow statistics are modified are shown to differ in air and water. Finally, a DLVO agglomeration model is demonstrated, whereby particles colliding with enough energy to overcome the potential barrier are considered bound.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{formulation of}} tunneling transport rests on an open-boundary modeling. There, conserving approximations to nonequilibrium Green function or quantum statistical mechanics provide consistent but computational costly approaches; alternatively, {{the use of}} density-dependent ballistic-transport calculations (e. g., Lang 1995 Phys. Rev. B 52 5335), here denoted 'DBT', provides computationally efficient (approximate) atomistic characterizations of the electron behavior but has until now lacked a formal justification. This paper presents an exact, variational nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory for fully interacting tunneling and provides a rigorous foundation for frozen-nuclei DBT calculations as a lowest-order approximation to an exact nonequilibrium thermodynamic density functional evaluation. The theory starts from the complete electron nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and I identify the operator for the nonequilibrium Gibbs free energy which, generally, must be treated as an implicit solution of the fully interacting many-body dynamics. I demonstrate a minimal property of a functional for the nonequilibrium thermodynamic grand potential which thus uniquely identifies the solution as the exact nonequilibrium density matrix. I also show that the uniqueness-of-density proof from a closely related Lippmann-Schwinger <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> functional theory (Hyldgaard 2008 Phys. Rev. B 78 165109) {{makes it possible to}} express the variational nonequilibrium thermodynamic description as a single-particle formulation based on universal electron-density functionals; the full nonequilibrium single-particle formulation improves the DBT method, for example, by a more refined account of Gibbs free energy effects. I illustrate a formal evaluation of the zero-temperature thermodynamic grand potential value which I find is closely related to the variation in the scattering phase shifts and hence to Friedel density oscillations. This paper also discusses the difference between the here-presented exact thermodynamic forces and the often-used electrostatic forces. Finally the paper documents an inherent adiabatic nature of the thermodynamic forces and observes that these are suited for a nonequilibrium implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{calculate}} synthetic digital chest tomosynthesis projections using a computer simulation model based on the Monte Carlo method. An anthropomorphic chest phantom was scanned in a computed tomography scanner, segmented and included in the computer model to allow for simulation of realistic high-resolution X-ray images. The input parameters to the model were adapted to correspond to the VolumeRAD chest tomosynthesis system from GE Healthcare. Sixty tomosynthesis projections were calculated with projection angles ranging from + 15 to − 15 °. The images from primary photons were calculated using an analytical model of the anti-scatter grid and a pre-calculated detector response function. The contributions from scattered photons were calculated using an in-house Monte Carlo-based model employing a number of variance reduction techniques such as the <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> estimator. Tomographic section images were reconstructed by transferring the simulated projections into the VolumeRAD system. The reconstruction was performed for three types of images using: (i) noise-free primary projections, (ii) primary projections including contributions from scattered photons and (iii) projections as in (ii) with added correlated noise. The simulated section images were compared with corresponding section images from projections taken with the real, anthropomorphic phantom from which the digital voxel phantom was originally created.

40|$|Strangeness {{enhancement}} in A+A collisions {{relative to}} p+p interactions {{as a signal}} for {{the transition to a}} deconfined state of strongly interacting matter was recently searched for mostly in high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei such as central Pb+Pb or Au+Au. The expectation is that in these large systems with about 360 participating nucleons such a transition is more likely because of a longer lifetime and higher energy density. However, earlier studies with lighter beams had demonstrated that already in S+S with 54 participants strangeness is significantly enhanced. In this work strange-particle production is studied as function of system size in symmetric central A+A collisions at 158 AGeV. Using the NA 49 spectrometer at the CERN-SPS, yields and kinematic distributions of kaons, K*(892), the phi-meson and, for reference purposes, also of pions are measured in minimum-bias and inelasticity-selected p+p interactions, and in central C+C and Si+Si collisions. Together with earlier data for central S+S and Pb+Pb the results present a complete picture of the evolution of strangeness enhancement as function of system size. The data show a continuous increase of the strange-particle abundances in dependence on system size, with a fast rise in small systems and a saturation already for about 60 participating nucleons if comparing central A+A collisions only. On the basis of the present data and using microscopic models for A+A coll isions an attempt is made to localize the origin of strangeness enhancement and to understand its evolution. For several reasons, rescattering is found to be an unlikely explanation, in particular for the lighter systems. The idea that the high string excitations - obtained in A+A collisions as a consequence of sequential N+N interactions - are responsible is dismissed on the basis of inelasticity-controlled p+p data. On the other hand, the geometry dependence indicated by a comparison of the central A+A data with those for peripheral Pb+Pb suggests that the density of the primary inelastic interactions in space-time plays a decisive role, because it is found to act as a scaling variable for the strangeness enhancement in all systems. The final conclusion of this work is that a high <b>collision</b> <b>density</b> leads to formation of coherent partonic (sub-) systems comprising several strings whose hadronization can be described statistically. Then, these systems and/or their hadronization must be subject to the phenomenon of canonical strangeness suppression respectively of grand-canonical strangeness enhancement.

25|$|Grain-gas heating: <b>Collisions</b> at high <b>densities</b> between gas {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This {{is not important}} in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.|$|R
40|$|The strongest starbursts are {{observed}} towards galaxy nuclei, or circumnuclear regions. However in interacting galaxies, star formation is also triggered in overlap regions far from nuclei, in spiral arms {{and sometimes in}} tidal tails. What is {{the relative importance of}} these starbursts? What kind of starformation is dominating, as a function of redshift? These different starbursts occur in different dynamical conditions (global and local) : gravitational instabilities, density waves, radial flows, shear, cloud <b>collisions,</b> <b>density</b> accumulations, and they have been investigated with the help of numerical simulations. Gravitational instabilities are necessary to initiate star formation, but they are not sufficient; galactic disks are self-regulated through these instabilities to have their Toomre Q parameter of the order of 1, and thus this criterium is in practice unable to predict the onset of intense star formation. Super star clusters are a characteristic SF mode in starbursts, and might be due to the rapid formation of large gas complexes. Star formation can propagate radially inwards, due to gravity torques and gas inflow, but also outwards, due to superwinds, and energy outflows: both expanding or collapsing waves {{are observed}} in circumnuclear regions. Mergers are more efficient in forming stars at high redshift, because of larger gas content, and shorter dynamical times. The relation between nuclear starbursts and nuclear activity is based on the same fueling mechanisms, but also on reciprocal triggering and regulations.
