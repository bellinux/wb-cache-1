50|$|Canonical {{analysis}} {{belongs to}} a group of methods which involve solving the characteristic equation for its latent roots and vectors. It describes formal structures in hyperspace invariant with respect to the rotation of their coordinates. In this type of solution, rotation leaves many optimizing properties preserved, provided it takes place in certain ways and in a subspace of its corresponding hyperspace. This rotation from the maximum intervariate correlation structure into a different, simpler and more meaningful structure increases the interpretability of the canonical weights C and D. In this the canonical analysis differs from Harold Hotelling’s (1936) <b>canonical</b> <b>variate</b> analysis (also called the canonical correlation analysis), designed to obtain maximum (canonical) correlations between the predictor and criterion canonical variates. The difference between the <b>canonical</b> <b>variate</b> analysis and canonical analysis is analogous to the difference between the principal components analysis and factor analysis, each with its characteristic set of commonalities, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.|$|E
5000|$|In statistics, {{canonical}} analysis (from κανων bar, measuring rod, ruler) {{belongs to the}} family of regression methods for data analysis. Regression analysis quantifies a relationship between a predictor variable and a criterion variable by the coefficient of correlation r, coefficient of determination r2, and the standard regression coefficient β. Multiple regression analysis expresses a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a single criterion variable by the multiple correlation R, multiple coefficient of determination R², and a set of standard partial regression weights β1, β2, etc. <b>Canonical</b> <b>variate</b> analysis captures a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a set of criterion variables by the canonical correlations ρ1, ρ2, ..., and by the sets of canonical weights C and D.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional morphometrics is {{the study}} of {{morphological}} variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles. The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: principal components, factor analysis, <b>canonical</b> <b>variate,</b> and discriminant function analysis. It is also possible to study allometry, which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes. For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics {{is that it does not}} capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to based on. For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics. Geometric morphometrics attempts to correct these problematic areas by more fully capturing shape variability.|$|E

We used Wold's method for {{calculation of the}} <b>canonical</b> <b>variates,</b> and we applied ridge penalization to the regression of pathway genes on <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> of the non-pathway genes, and the elastic net to the regression of non-pathway genes on the <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> of the pathway genes. Results We performed a small simulation to illustrate the model's capability to identify new candidate genes to incorporate in the pathway: in our simulations it appeared that a gene was correctly identified if the correlation with the pathway genes was 0. 3 or more. We applied the methods to a gene-expression microarray data set of 12, 209 genes measured in 45 patients with glioblastoma, and we considered genes to incorporate in the glioma-pathway: we identified more than 25 genes that correlated > 0. 9 with <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> of the pathway genes.

40|$|As a {{generalization}} of the canonical correlation analysis to k random vectors, the common <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> model was recently proposed {{based on the}} assumption that the <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> have the same coefficients in all k sets of variables, and is applicable to many cases. In this article, we apply the local influence method in this model to study the impact of minor perturbations of data. The method is non-standard because of the restrictions imposed on the coefficients. Besides investigating the joint local influence of the observations, we also obtain the elliptical norm of the empirical influence function as a special case of local influence diagnostics. Based on the proposed diagnostics, we find that the results of common <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> analysis for the female water striders data set is largely affected by omitting just one single observation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an outcome measure for lip shape during speech using statistical shape analysis techniques.

Geometric Morphometrics was employed to extract three-dimensional coordinate data for lip shape during four spoken words decomposed into seven visemes (which included the resting lip shape). <b>Canonical</b> <b>variate</b> analysis was carried out in an attempt to statistically discriminate the seven visemes.

Similar measures are described for assessing the predictivity associated with the individual samples (in the case of PCA and CVA) or group means (in the case of CVA).

For this purpose, Nielsen suggests to use standard CCA, as described by Hotelling in 1936 [38]. CCA finds two sets of linear combinations of the original variables, where the first two linear combinations (called <b>canonical</b> <b>variates)</b> are the ones with the largest correlation (called first canonical correlation). The second canonical correlation and <b>canonical</b> <b>variates</b> are determined subject to the condition that they are orthogonal to the first ones, and this process goes on for the higher-order <b>canonical</b> correlations and <b>variates.</b> Performing differences between these pairs of variates allows then to consider a change detection analysis based on linear combinations of the original variables, ordered by correlation (similarity) between pairs [12].|$|R
