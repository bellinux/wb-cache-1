Preliminary results demonstrating the performance of the system at an elevated temperature are presented. Limited post-situ results from direct measurement of the plastic deformation of thin Cu films on Si substrates induced by thermal cycling are also presented, primarily with the objective of establishing the need for detailed in-situ studies.

40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations (both physical measurements and visual observations) of duct systems have shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. In this study, three test methods were used to test the longevity of duct sealants: simple heating, heat cycling and combined pressure and heat cycling (aging). The most advanced method was the "aging " test, developed to evaluate the longevity of duct sealants by alternatively blowing hot (75 °C) and cold (- 5 °C) air through test sections, with the <b>apparatus</b> <b>cycling</b> between hot and cold air quickly. The temperatures and cycle length were chosen to accelerate the aging process of the duct seals. The aging apparatus was able to test eight samples at a time, with the test samples constructed from standard duct fittings. The results of these tests were used to evaluate different sealants relative to each other, so that recommendations regarding duct sealants may be developed. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with rubber adhesive) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. The accelerated test method is being developed into an ASTM Standard under sub-committee E 6. 41. 1...|$|R
40|$|Shigella spp., the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, {{are responsible for}} considerable morbidity and mortality in excess of a million deaths globally per year. Although PCR-based techniques (such as PCR-based dipstick biosensors) {{have been used for}} the molecular diagnosis of infectious disease, these assays were restricted due to the need for a sophisticated thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>apparatus</b> to denature target templates. To facilitate simple and rapid detection of target pathogens, we successfully devised an inexpensive, reliable and nearly instrument-free molecular technique, which incorporates multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) combined with a newly designed lateral flow biosensor (LFB) for visual, sensitive and specific detection of Shigella. The MCDA-LFB assay was conducted at 65 ˚C for only 20 min during the amplification stage, and then products were directly analyzed on the biosensor, alleviating the use of special reagents, electrophoresis equipment and amplicon detection instruments. The entire process, including specimen processing (35 min), amplification (20) and detection (2 - 5 min), can be finished within 1 h. The MCDA-LFB assay demonstrated high specificity for Shigella detection. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 10 fg of genomic templates per reaction in pure culture and 5. 86 CFU per tube in human fecal samples, which was consistent with MCDA by colorimetric indicator, gel electrophoresis, real time turbidity and fluorescence detection. Hence, the simplicity, rapidity and nearly instrument-free platform of the MCDA-LFB assay make it practical for ‘on-site’ diagnosis, point-of-care testing and more. Moreover, the proof-of-concept approach can be reconfigured to detect a wide variety of target sequences by re-designing the specific MCDA primers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} and investigates a novel hybrid fuel grain that reacts pyrophorically with gaseous oxidizer to achieve restart of a hybrid rocket motor propulsion system while reducing cost and handling concerns. This reactive fuel grain (RFG) {{relies on the}} pyrophoric nature of finely divided metal particles dispersed in a solid dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) binder, which {{has been shown to}} encapsulate air-sensitive additives until they are exposed to combustion gases. An RFG is thus effectively inert in open air {{in the absence of an}} ignition source, though the particles encapsulated within remain pyrophoric. In practice, this means that an RFG that is ignited in the vacuum of space and then extinguished will expose unoxidized pyrophoric particles, which can be used to generate sufficient heat to relight the propellant when oxidizer is flowed. ^ The experiments outlined in this work aim to develop a suitable pyrophoric material for use in an RFG, demonstrate pyrophoric relight, and characterize performance under conditions relevant to a hybrid rocket thruster. Magnesium, lithium, calcium, and an alloy of titanium, chromium, and manganese (TiCrMn) were investigated to determine suitability of pure metals as RFG additives. Additionally, aluminum hydride (AlH 3), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH 4), lithium borohydride (LiBH 4), and magnesium hydride (MgH 2) were investigated to determine suitability of metals hydrides as RFG additives or as precursors for pure-metal RFG additives. Pyrophoric metals have been previously investigated as additives for increasing the regression rate of hybrid fuels, but to the author’s knowledge, these materials have not been specifically investigated for their ability to ignite a propellant pyrophorically. ^ Commercial research-grade metals were obtained as coarse powders, then ball-milled to attempt to reduce particle size below a critical diameter needed for pyrophoricity. Magnesium hydride was ball-milled and then cycled in a hydride <b>cycling</b> <b>apparatus</b> to attempt to fracture the particles through hydrogen sorption and thermal stresses. These powders were then tested for pyrophoricity with atmospheric and pure concentrations of oxygen. The TiCrMn powder was chosen as the material for evaluation of propellant performance, and was mixed with DCPD in various weight ratios to determine the required additive loading needed for pyrophoricity of the bulk propellant. Weight percentages of 10, 20, 30, and 50 wt. % TiCrMn were used to evaluate relight capability and propellant performance, and weight loadings of 50, 70, and 90 wt. % TiCrMn were used to evaluate approximate maximum loading possible without rendering the propellant structurally unsound. Propellant tests were conducted in an opposed flow burner apparatus for sub-scale regression rate and relight experiments, and an optically accessible cylindrical combustion chamber (OCC) that allows high speed cameras to record the regressing propellant surface during combustion. Gaseous oxygen (GOX) was used as an oxidizer for all tests due to its ready availability and common use as a hybrid rocket oxidizer. Opposed flow burner experiments are an inexpensive means of rapidly testing various propellant formulations at different conditions, whereas OCC tests are useful for obtaining realistic data on how an RFG would likely operate as part of a propulsion system. ^ Relight in the opposed flow burner was attempted by cycling oxygen and nitrogen flows with carefully timed solenoid valves to initiate and extinguish combustion, and to control the slow diffusion of oxygen to the surface of the propellant, which would render the TiCrMn non-pyrophoric. The opposed flow burner experiments did not conclusively demonstrate the pyrophoric relight capability of the RFG propellant due in part to the persistence of hot spots between oxygen and purge nitrogen cycles, as determined by high-speed imaging in the near infrared range. An opposed flow burner apparatus was then constructed within a vacuum chamber assembly thus preventing atmospheric oxygen from diffusing to the propellant surface, but these tests did not demonstrate pyrophoric relight. Future work is proposed to evaluate the effect of pyrophoric particle size in order to determine the role ignition delay of each particle has in the relight capability of RFGs. ^ OCC experiments were conducted at a low and high GOX mass flux of approximately 150 and 300 kg/s/m 2, respectively, at a nominal chamber pressure of 150 psia. Four strand compositions were used: pure DCPD, 30 wt. % pyrophoric TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 10 microns, 30 wt. % oxidized TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 10 microns, and 30 wt. % TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 4 mm. Regression rate was measure by weight loss, average web thickness change at three axial locations on the strand, and through time-resolved tracking of the regressing propellant surface via high speed video. While visual observations suggest that the addition of TiCrMn significantly increases regression rate, initial data do not show a significant trend. Additionally, it is observed that the oxidized TiCrMn strands regress at the same rate as those loaded with pyrophoric TiCrMn, suggesting that erosive burning and heat addition of the added metal may be the cause of the observed increase in regression rate. The data are too sparse to make conclusions about the effect of particle size on regression rate, so further tests are recommended to develop a significant data set for the effect of pyrophoricity and particle size on regression rate. The test article was damaged at the end of the regression rate experimental campaign, which precluded the collection of relight data that was planned for strands loaded with 50 wt. % TiCrMn particles with an average diameter of approximately 1 - 4 mm. Though further tests are needed to demonstrate pyrophoric relight of an RFG, the current work establishes a baseline for RFG performance and suggests that pyrophoric relight is possible by tailoring the particle size of the pyrophoric metal additive to control heat release and ignition delay. ...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{stimulation}} of geothermal wells is a production enhancement technique {{that is an}} attractive option to operators of geothermal fields {{as a way to}} enhance and revitalize well performance capabilities through injection of cold water into the geothermal reservoir. This thesis presents a review of thermal stimulation procedures that have been carried out at various geothermal fields worldwide, and then sets out to demonstrate through laboratory experiments the effects of thermal stimulation on typical reservoir rocks. Thermal damage to crustal rocks is important in many fields of practical engineering applications. Thermal fractures have been discussed in many studies, however their formation under fully water saturated conditions as a result of rapid quenching is not fully understood. In this study, a new methodology is designed to replicate thermal stimulation in such an environment, using an apparatus that allows rocks to be heated to 350 °C at up to 22 MPa confining pressure and rapidly quenched with cold water to ambient temperature while maintaining system pressure. The results indicate that through thermal <b>cycling</b> in the <b>apparatus,</b> porosity was increased, density decreased, acoustic velocities attenuated and mechanical properties significantly altered. Maximum damage occurred during the first thermal cycle, a product of the thermo-mechanical Kaiser effect such that rocks should not experience additional damage unless a previous maximum stress is surpassed. The thesis details a comprehensive evaluation of the Rotokawa Andesite sourced from the Rotokawa Geothermal field located in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. The importance of microstructural fabrics on the physical properties of this reservoir lithology is demonstrated. The mineralogical and petrological fabrics of the rocks are coupled with detailed studies of the microstructural fracture networks, including measurements of porosity, density and permeability. Acoustic wave velocities and dynamic elastic moduli were determined. Uniaxial compressive strength testing coupled with acoustic emission have helped to determine the behavior of the rock under deformation and provided data to characterize the static elastic moduli of the rocks. These data are then utilized to build empirical, micromechanical and geometric relationships. To better constrain important engineering concerns such as wellbore stability, reservoir forecasting and stimulation procedures, thermal property measurements were carried out on samples recovered from the Rotokawa Andesite. In particular, measurements of linear thermal expansion, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry were measured utilizing varied experimental heating rates of 2, 5 and 20 K/min. The property analyses were carried out to determine if heating rates influenced the measurement of thermal properties, specifically thermal expansion coefficients and strain rate in the samples. Results indicate that thermal expansion is not heating rate dependent within the range investigated though the strain rate is significantly dependent on heating rate, with higher strain rates observed in conjunction with higher heating rates. By using a one dimensional stress model, a failure criterion can be established for the Rotokawa Andesite when subject to thermal stressing. The importance {{of this study is to}} further understand the critical heating and cooling rates at which thermal stress causes cracking within the Rotokawa reservoir. This can enhance permeability but can also affect wellbore stability, so constraining these conditions can be beneficial to resource utilization. To test effects of thermal stimulation in the laboratory, Rotokawa Andesite core was heated to 325 ºC at pressure of 20 MPa and quenched rapidly to 20 ºC while maintaining a pressure of 20 MPa. Permeability increased by an order of magnitude over original pre-treatment values. Ultrasonic velocities also reflected a significant change after stimulation testing. Scanning electron microscopy showed significant microstructural change to samples and supplemented physical property investigations. The results imply that thermal stimulation can be successfully repeated in the laboratory and is coupled with both thermal and chemical components. The results of these investigations are of profound importance for effective utilization and maintenance of the Rotokawa Geothermal field and the results also have implications for geothermal fields worldwide...|$|R
