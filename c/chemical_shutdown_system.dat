It is designed as much as practical based on neutron absorber solution injection into the existing core while the changes and interferences with the existing core structure are kept to a minimum. Core neutronic calculations were performed using MCNPX 2. 6. 0 and MTR_PC package for the current operational core equipped with the second <b>shutdown</b> <b>system,</b> and one experiment was conducted in the Tehran Research Reactor to test the neutronic calculations. A good agreement was seen between theoretical results and experimental ones. In addition, capability of the second <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> {{in the case of}} occurrence of design basis accident in the Tehran Research Reactor is demonstrated using PARET program...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} one for the safety of the reactor core. In case of any abnormal event or any parameter going abnormal or otherwise, it trips the reactor. Hence this system should be highly reliable. The reliability of the Present <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> could not be improved beyond a certain limit, due to many interconnections between the sub systems in the safety chain. i. e. Different sensors, processing electronics, safety logic are located physically at different and far off locations connected with cables, passing through cable trays, penetrations and buildings. New design configuration has been proposed, where there is only single system (PCB) comprising of processing electronics and comparison with thresholds, with voting logic built into the control rods itself. This eliminates the need for one exclusive safety logic system. With this design, the reliability promised to be more than the existing system, without the need for more than one <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> With this design, the reliability promised to be more than the existing system, without the need for more than one <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> The thesis discusses the details of the design made and improvements in the reliability factor...|$|R

5000|$|The Pickering A {{system did}} not {{originally}} {{have a second}} independent <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> The Bruce containment concept differs: the reactor's reactivity mechanism deck serves {{as a part of}} the containment boundary, is closer to the reactor, and more prone to damage in the event of an accident ("accidental physical disassembly"). The designers therefore foresaw the need for a second safety system to reduce the risk on an accident.

40|$|The {{government}} enacted <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> in {{the fall}} of 2011. It was to secure a right to sleep for the youth and prevent them from being addicted to game. The opinion on the system was dichotomized: gamers were against it for the reason that <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> was not effective while non-gamers like parents thought that it was a measure to prevent game addiction. The trust of the public on the government is influenced by the factors of moral and competence. That is, if the policy chosen by the government is effective, the public come to trust their government more. Focusing on the factors of the government competence, this study examined to know how the effectiveness and efficiency of governmental policies have impact on the public trust on the government. Particularly this study looked carefully into what factors of political effectiveness have impact on the trust by group (group with and against the <b>shutdown</b> <b>system).</b> Through this study some implication could be obtained for the difference in trust between two groups...|$|R

50|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} need the safety systems to avoid mission {{critical}} failures. The worst possible consequence {{that can result}} is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission critical failures for nuclear power plant is <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.|$|R

This paper describes safety requirements for JSFR conformed to the defense-in-depth principle in IAEA. Specific design features of JSFR are a passive reactor <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> and a recriticality-free concept against anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) in design extension conditions (DECs). A fully passive decay heat removal system with natural circulation is also introduced for design-basis events (DBEs) and DECs. In this paper, the safety design accommodation in JSFR was validated by safety analyses for representative DBEs: primary pump seizure and long-term loss-of-offsite power accidents. The safety analysis also showed the effectiveness of the passive <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> against a typical ATWS. Severe accident analysis supported by safety experiments and phenomenological consideration led to the feasibility of in-vessel retention without energetic recriticality.

Film electrical conductivity at ambient temperature was up to 50 S cm−1.

50|$|In {{controlled}} {{testing in}} 1986, with the EBR-II reactor running {{at full power}} and the emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> disabled, the reactor's supply of electricity was intentionally turned off, causing the coolant pumps to stop. This is a worse scenario than {{what happened in the}} Fukushima Nuclear Disaster. (At Fukushima, which began operation in 1971, the emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> turned off the reactor as soon as it detected the earthquake. However the tsunami destroyed the electric generators powering the coolant pumps, which needed to continue running after the reactor shutdown. Subsequently, the core overheated and meltdown occurred.) EBR-II, in contrast, handled the event without creating a dangerous situation. EBR-II had a negative thermal coefficient of reactivity that shut down the reactor when the temperature increased due to loss of the coolant pumps; the time required to heat the large pool of sodium surrounding the reactor provided a sufficient time buffer for the passive decay heat removal system to prevent the EBR-II reactor from melting down. The safe shutdown of the EBR-II relied only on the laws of physics and did not require operator or control system intervention.|$|R
