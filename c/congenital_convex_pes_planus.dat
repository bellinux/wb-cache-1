40|$|Background: Anterior {{knee pain}} and {{intermittent}} {{low back pain}} {{are among the most}} common orthopedic complaints of adoles-cents. However, little is known about <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> and its relative risk for these symptoms. The goal {{of the study was to}} track the prevalence of <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adolescents, and examine its associated risk to anterior knee pain and intermittent low back pain, respectively. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 97, 279 military recruits presenting to recruitment centers was conducted. <b>Pes</b> <b>planus</b> was graded by an orthopedist as mild, moderate or severe according to the flattening of the plantar arch and its rigidity to standing on one’s toes. Ante-rior knee pain was diagnosed when symptoms were attributed to the patellofemoral joint. Intermittent low back pain was diag-nosed when there was pain but neither abnormal clinical nor radiographic findings. Results: <b>Pes</b> <b>planus</b> was present in 15, 698 (16 %) individuals. 11, 549 (74 %), 3, 341 (21 %) and 808 (5 %) were diagnosed as having mild, moderate and severe <b>pes</b> <b>planus,</b> respectively. The prevalence of intermittent low back pain was 5 % in both the control and mild <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> groups, while it was 10 % in the moderate and severe <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> groups (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Background Multiple {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{soft tissue}} structures that apply forces {{and support the}} medial longitudinal arch have been implicated in <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> These structures have common functions but their interaction in <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> is not fully understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cross-sectional area (CSA) and thickness of the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles and plantar fascia thickness between normal and <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> feet. Methods Forty-nine adults with a normal foot posture and 49 individuals with <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> feet were recruited from a university population. Images of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL), flexor hallucis longus (FHL), peroneus longus and brevis (PER), flexor hallucis brevis (FHB), flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and abductor hallucis (AbH) muscles and the plantar fascia were obtained using a Venue 40 ultrasound system with a 5 – 13 MHz transducer. Results The CSA and thickness of AbH, FHB and PER muscles were significantly smaller (AbH − 12. 8 % and − 6. 8 %, FHB − 8. 9 % and − 7. 6 %, PER − 14. 7 % and − 10 %), whilst FDL (28. 3 % and 15. 2 %) and FHL (24 % and 9. 8 %) were significantly larger in the <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> group. The middle (− 10. 6 %) and anterior (− 21. 7 %) portions of the plantar fascia were thinner in <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Foot orthoses {{are widely}} used in the {{management}} of flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus,</b> yet the evidence to support this intervention has not been clearly defined. This systematic review aimed to critically appraise the evidence for the use of foot orthoses for flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adults. METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of science, SportDiscus, Embase) were systematically searched in June 2013 for randomised controlled, controlled clinical and repeated measure trials where participants had identified flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> using a validated and reliable measure of <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> and the intervention was a rigid or semi-rigid orthoses with the comparison being a no-orthoses (shoes alone or flat non-posted insert) condition. Outcomes of interest were foot pain, rearfoot kinematics, foot kinetics and physical function. RESULTS: Of the 2, 211 articles identified by the searches, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria; two were randomised controlled trials, one was a controlled trial and 10 were repeated measure studies. Across the included studies, 59 relevant outcome measures were reported with 17 calculated as statistically significant large or medium effects observed with use of foot orthoses compared to the no orthoses condition (SMD range 1. 13 to - 4. 11). CONCLUSIONS: No high level evidence supported the use of foot orthoses for flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> There is good to moderate level evidence that foot orthoses improve physical function (medial-lateral sway in standing (level II) and energy cost during walking (level III)). There is low level evidence (level IV) that foot orthoses improve pain, reduce rearfoot eversion, alter loading and impact forces; and reduce rearfoot inversion and eversion moments in flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> Well-designed randomised controlled trials that include appropriate sample sizes, clinical cohorts and involve a measure of symptom change are required to determine the efficacy of foot orthoses to manage adult flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> Helen A Banwell, Shylie Mackintosh and Dominic Thewli...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of and relation between rupture or tenosynovitis of the Flexor Hallucis Longus (FHL) tendon and range of motion, deformities and joint damage of the forefoot in RA patients with foot complaints. Methods Thirty RA patients with painful feet were analysed, their feet were examined clinically {{for the presence of}} <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> and range of motion (ROM), radiographs were scored looking for the presence of forefoot damage, and ultrasound examination was performed, examining the presence of tenosyovitis or rupture of the FHL {{at the level of the}} medial malleolus. The correlation between the presence or absence of the FHL and ROM, forefoot damage and <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> was calculated. Results In 11 / 60 (18 %) of the feet, a rupture of the FHL was found. This was associated with a limited motion of the MTP 1 -joint, measured on the JAM (χ 2 = 10. 4, p = 0. 034), a higher prevalence of <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> (χ 2 = 5. 77, p = 0. 016) and a higher prevalence of erosions proximal at the MTP- 1 joint (χ 2 = 12. 3, p = 0. 016), and joint space narrowing of the MTP 1 joint (χ 2 = 12. 7, p = 0. 013).

There were three excellent results, three very good, two good, and one poor. The patient with a poor rating was asymptomatic, had normal foot motion, and was sat-isfied with the procedure. Juvenile <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> is a common condition {{with a wide range}} of physical findings and symptomatology.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPes planovalgus (PPV) is {{a complex}} {{three-dimensional}} deformity of which routine radiographs provide only a two-dimensional analysis. HypothesisAngles and other radiographic parameters of the foot in children and adolescents, when studied on both the dorsoplantar and the lateral view, {{can be used to}} establish a radiographic classification system for PPV that provides useful therapeutic guidance in clinical practice. Materials and methodsA retrospective single-centre study was conducted on 65 feet in 35 patients aged 7 to 18 years and having adequate ossification. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or neurologic PPV and available weight-bearing dorsoplantar and strict lateral radiographs. We excluded <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> due to tarsal coalition, congenital bone deformities, or overcorrection of talipes equinovarus (n= 25). All possible axes were drawn and angles measured after an evaluation of interindividual agreement. ResultsWe identified four patterns of PPV: subtalar <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> (n= 16) with marked subtalar valgus and longitudinal sag predominating at the talonavicular joint, midtarsal <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> (n= 12) without subtalar valgus but with marked midtarsal abduction and sag predominating at the cuneonavicular joint, mixed <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> (n= 28) with subtalar valgus, midtarsal abduction, and sag at both the talonavicular and cuneonavicular joints, and pes planocavus (n= 9) with sag of the medial arch and cavus deformity of the lateral arch.

40|$|Background: Foot orthoses are {{commonly}} used for symptomatic flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adults. However, there are no clinical guidelines for the prescription of customised foot orthoses that are specific to this population. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate prescription habits of Australian podiatrists for customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adults and to develop consensus-based practice recommendations for the prescription of these foot orthoses. Methods: A four round Delphi survey was undertaken with 24 podiatric experts to establish current use and rationale for individual prescription variables of customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adults. Round one determined prescription use (consensus) and rounds two, three and four determined the rationale for use (agreement) of prescription variables across the rearfoot, midfoot, forefoot, as well as accommodation and materials used. For consensus and agreement to be accepted, 70 % of the respondents were required to use or agree on the rationale for use of individual prescription variables. Results: Consensus was reached in round one for two variables, choice of shell material (polyolefin) and when to prescribe a forefoot post balanced to perpendicular. In rounds two, three and four, agreement was reached for 52 statements related to the rationale for use of individual prescription variables, including when to prescribe: an inverted cast pour [heel in an inverted position], an inverted rearfoot post, a medial heel (Kirby) skive, minimal/maximum arch fill, a medial flange, a forefoot post and common orthotic accommodations. Conclusion: This study found consensus or agreement for the use of several prescription variables for customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> in adults.

To date, there is little evidence for non-orthotic rehabilitative strategies. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of an osteopathic and exercise intervention on objective measures of navicular heights and positions, navicular drop, and self-report measures of pain using a short-form McGill’s pain questionnaire in participants with progressed flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> Methods: Fourteen participants with pre-diagnosed or examined progressed flexible <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> were randomly allocated into either the immediate start group (one week of baseline, three weeks of intervention, four weeks follow-up) or the delayed start group (four weeks baseline, three weeks intervention, one week follow-up).

The objective {{of this study was to}} compare foot kinematics between normal, pes cavus and <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> foot posture groups using a multi-segment foot model. Ninety-seven healthy adults, aged 18 – 47 were classified as either normal (n = 37), pes cavus (n = 30) or <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> (n = 30) based on normative data for the Foot Posture Index, Arch Index and normalised navicular height. A five segment foot model was used to measure tri-planar motion of the rearfoot, midfoot, medial forefoot, lateral forefoot and hallux during barefoot walking at a self-selected speed. Angle at heel contact, peak angle, time to peak angle and range of motion was measured for each segment. One way ANOVAs with post-hoc analyses of mean differences were used to compare foot posture groups. The pes cavus group demonstrated a distinctive pattern of motion compared to the normal and <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> foot posture groups. Effect sizes of significant mean differences were large and comparable to similar studies. Three key differences in overall foot function were observed between the groups: (i) altered frontal and transverse plane angles of the rearfoot in the pes cavus foot; (ii) Less midfoot motion in the pes cavus foot during initial contact and midstance; and (iii) reduced midfoot frontal plane ROM in the <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> foot during pre-swing.

Associations of hallux valgus with age, body mass index (BMI), race, education, <b>pes</b> <b>planus,</b> foot pain, and in women, history of high heel shoe use, were assessed using sex-specific Poisson regression with robust variance estimation for risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). ResultsHallux valgus was present in 58 % of women and 25 % of men. Higher BMI was inversely associated with presence of hallux valgus in women (P trend= 0. 001), with the strongest inverse association observed in those with BMI of 30. 0 or more compared to those with normal BMI (RR= 0. 7, 95 % CI: 0. 5, 0. 9). Women, who usually wore high-heeled shoes during ages 20 – 64 years compared to those who did not, had increased likelihood of hallux valgus (RR= 1. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 0, 1. 5).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the immediate effects of pre-made foot orthotics on rear-foot and tibia variability and joint coupling patterns during stance phase of gait in male athletes with <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> Methods: Subjects of this semi-experimental research included 8 active men with <b>pes</b> <b>planus.</b> Kinematic gait data of these subjects were recorded by a motion analysis system with 8 cameras. After calculating three-dimensional angles, vector coding method was used for assessing coupling. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normal distribution of data and dependent samples t-test was used to compare means in each sub-phase. Results: Results showed that in the first 3 sub phases of stance, there were no significant differences between joint coupling with and without orthotics  (P> 0. 05), while in  the fourth sub-phase the mean coupling angle decreased significantly by 19 % (P= 0. 002 -P 0. 05).   Conclusion: These results suggest that foot orthotics does not have an effect on rear foot and tibia joint coupling patterns in the first 75 percent of stance phase of gait, but leads to a decrease in these patterns in the last 25 percent. Thus, it seems that movements of the shank decrease relative to heel movements in terminal stance phase, and this change can explain reduction in knee pain and other beneficial effects of using foot orthotics in subject with <b>pes</b> <b>planus...</b>|$|R

A significant association was found between foot type and hallux valgus (p = 0. 003); <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> feet had the highest prevalence as compared with neutrally aligned feet (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 43, p = 0. 0006). Foot type was also significantly associated with fixed hammer/claw toes (p = 0. 01); pes cavus feet had the highest prevalence as com-pared with neutrally aligned feet (OR = 3. 89, p = 0. 001). Foot type was also significantly associated with hallux limitus (p = 0. 006) with <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> feet having the highest prevalence as compared with neutrally aligned feet (OR = 2. 19, p = 0. 003). However, foot type was not significantly related to any ulcer outcome (p = 0. 7). Fixed hammer/claw toes (OR = 3. 91, p...|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, distal 18q- {{is associated}} with an increased incidence of clubfoot and rocker bottom feet. Also, a significant chance of developing <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> or <b>pes</b> cavus exists. People with distal 18q- frequently have overlapping toes. Scoliosis and genu varum are also known orthopedic complications in children and adults with distal 18q-.|$|R
5000|$|Tapered fingers is {{when one}} end of the finger is diminished in thickness, causing the ends of the fingers to appear pointed. This {{deformity}} is not debilitating in any particular manner. In addition to tapered fingers, both hands and feet tend to be small. Some males were observed to have <b>pes</b> <b>planus,</b> also known as flat feet.|$|R
40|$|Posterior tibial tendon {{dysfunction}} (PTTD) is {{an important}} cause of acquired <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> that frequently observed in adults. Factors that {{play a role in}} the development of PTTD such as age-related tendon degeneration, inflammatory arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, peritendinous injections and more rarely acute traumatic rupture of the tendon. PTT is the primary dynamic stabilizer of medial arch of the foot. Plantar flexion and inversion of the foot occurs with contraction of tibialis posterior tendon, and arch of the foot becomes elaveted while midtarsal joints are locked and midfoot-hindfoot sets as rigid. Thus, during the walk gastrocnemius muscle works more efficiently. If the PTT does not work in the order, other foot ligaments and joint capsule would be increasingly weak and than <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> occurs. We present a 10 -yearold female patient diagnosed as PTTD and conservative treatment with review of the current literature...|$|R
50|$|Flat feet (also called <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> or fallen arches) is a {{postural}} deformity {{in which}} the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire {{sole of the foot}} coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. Some individuals (an estimated 20-30% of the general population) have an arch that simply never develops in one foot (unilaterally) or both feet (bilaterally).|$|R
40|$|Posterior tibialis tendon rupture is a {{diagnosis}} {{that is often}} missed. This {{is thought to be}} secondary to nonspecific clinical findings and the lack of any laboratory or radiographic test to reliably confirm the diagnosis. We report sixteen cases of surgically confirmed posterior tibialis tendon rupture. Based on our review of these patients, the diagnosis of posterior tibialis tendon rupture should be strongly suspected in the adult patient presenting with a history of a twisting ankle injury and generalized medial ankle pain and swelling. A flexible, asymmetric <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> and forefoot pronation deformity with absence of posterior tibialis tendon function on manual testing is seen on examination. This is associated with loss of ipsilateral heel inversion on bilateral heel rise. The patient is usually unable to perform ipsilateral single leg heel rise and has less severe <b>pes</b> <b>planus</b> of the contralateral foot. This study reviews the presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of posterior tibialis tendon rupture...|$|R
