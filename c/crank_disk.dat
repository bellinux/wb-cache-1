40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and <b>crank</b> <b>disk.</b> In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade carrier bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade carrier bearings, <b>crank</b> <b>disk</b> and blade carrier bearings. Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and <b>crank</b> <b>disk,</b> the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|E
50|$|The rack {{locomotive}} had plate frames, arranged outside the coupled wheels, and {{was equipped with}} the Heusinger von Waldegg version of Walschaerts valve gear. The pinion for the rack was mounted between the coupled wheels, just forward of the driving axle. The pinion axle was coupled to the drivers through side rods, with the connecting rods coupled directly to <b>crank</b> <b>disks</b> which were mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle, outside the frames. These <b>crank</b> <b>disks</b> were grooved to act as brake drums.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{of the outside}} and inside sets of motion could each be {{separately}} reversed by its own screw gear, while each set also had its own independent regulators, injectors and feed pumps. The locomotive had steam brakes on all coupled wheels as well as both bogies, {{the first and last}} South African steam locomotive to be equipped with braked bogies. The coupled wheels and the rack engine's <b>crank</b> <b>disks</b> had separate hand brakes and the inside and outside piston pairs had separate counter-pressure air brakes. In addition, the locomotive had a combination ejector to work the train's vacuum brakes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{a common}} {{understanding}} that hot forging will improve the properties of a steel part in relation to what is the result when the same part is made by casting solely. A study has been performed where two <b>crank</b> pin <b>disks</b> of a particular steel alloy, one hot forged and the other cast, both in quenched and annealed condition, have been tested using a new innovative “eye”-specimen bending test. The used test procedure is described, and it is shown that the forged and the cast material in this test will collapse and break down in different ways...|$|R

50|$|The Lambert opposed {{cylinder}} motor had {{a number}} of features not usual in that form of gas engine in that era. For example, the oiler was of the precision variety, in which a ratchet actuated worm drive a worm gear carrying a spring actuated oil force pump successively over the oil leads to be supplied, the plunge spring being compressed by a circle of wedges, and the rise from each compression being regulated by an individual temper screw. Oil leads dropped oil on the crank wrist rod ends. The <b>cranks</b> had full <b>disk</b> arms and the crank shaft journals ran in bronze bearings.|$|R
