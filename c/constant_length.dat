500|$|The Sigma 8–16mm lens is an enthusiast-level, ultra {{wide-angle}} rectilinear {{zoom lens}} made by Sigma Corporation specifically {{for use with}} APS-C small format digital SLRs. It is the first ultrawide rectilinear (non-fisheye lens) zoom lens with a minimum focal length of 8mm, designed specifically for APS-C size image sensors. The lens was introduced at the February 2010 Photo Marketing Association International Convention and Trade Show. At its release it was the widest viewing angle focal length available commercially for APS-C cameras. It is part of Sigma's DC (Digital Camera) line of lenses, meaning {{it was designed to}} have an image circle tailored to work with APS-C format cameras. [...] The lens has a <b>constant</b> <b>length</b> regardless of optical zoom and focus with inner lens tube elements responding to these parameters. The camera has hypersonic zoom autofocus.|$|E

2500|$|Parallel {{transport}} of tangent vectors along a {{curve in the}} surface was the next major advance in the subject, due to Levi-Civita.

Parallel transport along geodesics, the [...] "straight lines" [...] of the surface, can also easily be described directly. A vector in the tangent plane is transported along a geodesic as the unique vector field with <b>constant</b> <b>length</b> and making a constant angle with the velocity vector of the geodesic. For a general curve, this process has to be modified using the geodesic curvature, which measures how far the curve departs from being a geodesic.|$|E

Sir Humphry Davy, {{who also}} {{speaks of the}} {{diminution}} of power with increase of distance from the poles[A] (483.), supposes, that when both poles are acting on substances to decompose them, still the power of decomposition diminishes to the middle distance. In this statement of fact he is opposed to Grotthuss, and quotes an experiment in which sulphate of potassa, placed at different distances from the poles in a humid conductor of <b>constant</b> <b>length,</b> decomposed when near the pole, but not when at a distance. Such a consequence would necessarily result theoretically from considering the poles as centres of attraction and repulsion; but I have not found the statement borne out by other experiments (505.); and in the one quoted by him the effect was doubtless due {{to some of the}} many interfering causes of variation which attend such investigations.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{behavior}} of the dendritic or axonal membrane voltage due to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often modeled with the one-dimensional cable equation. For the cable equation, a <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> is defined; it describes the axial decay of the membrane voltage {{in the case of}} constant applied electric field. In TMS, however, the induced electric field waveform is typically a segment of a sinusoidal wave, with characteristic frequencies of the order of several kHz. Objective: To show that the high frequency content of the stimulation pulse causes deviations in the spatial profile of the membrane voltage as compared to the steady state. Methods: We derive the cable equation in complex form utilizing the complex frequency-dependent representation of the membrane conductivity. In addition, we define an effective <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> $lambda_{mathrm{eff}}$, which governs the spatial decay of the membrane voltage. We model the {{behavior of}} a dendrite in an applied electric field oscillating at 3. 9 kHz with the complex cable equation and by solving the traditional cable equation numerically. Results: The effective <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> decreases as a function of frequency. For a model dendrite or axon, for which the low-frequency <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> is 1. 5 mm, the effective <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> at 3. 9 kHz is is decreased by a factor 10 to 0. 13 mm. Conclusion: The frequency dependency of the neuronal <b>length</b> <b>constant</b> has {{to be taken into account}} when predicting the spatial {{behavior of the}} membrane voltage as a response to TMS...|$|R
