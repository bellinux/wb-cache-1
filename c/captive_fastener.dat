50|$|A <b>Captive</b> <b>fastener</b> {{is often}} made with thread locking, press-fitting, or {{broaching}} to accomplish an anchor-hold {{within a larger}} assembly housing. However, a <b>captive</b> <b>fastener</b> may also be melded with the material into which it is joined, either through cold forming or welding.|$|E
40|$|An {{alignment}} {{and mounting}} apparatus for mounting two modules (10, 12) includes a first portion having a cylindrical alignment pin (16) projecting normal to a module surface, a second portion having a three-stage alignment guide (18) including a shoehorn flange (34), a Y-slot (42) and a V-block (22) which sequentially guide the alignment pin (16) with successively finer precision {{and a third}} portion {{in the form of}} a spring-loaded <b>captive</b> <b>fastener</b> (20) for connecting the two modules after alignment is achieved...|$|E
40|$|A <b>captive</b> <b>fastener</b> {{device is}} {{utilized}} to hold two members together. The device {{is comprised of}} a housing which may be securely attached to the first member. Within the housing is a spring which biases a bottom of a first lip of a cup washer. The top of the first lip contacts {{the top of the}} housing when the fastener is not engaged. The fastener has a ledge {{at the bottom of the}} fastener head which rests on a top surface of a second lip of the cup washer. The bottom surface of the second lip contacts the first member when the fastener has fully engaged the second member to secure the first and second members together. The first lip of the cup washer has a greater diameter than the second lip. The first lip also has a greater diameter than the fastener. When the fastener is not engaged, a top surface of the first lip engages a bottom surface of the top of the housing. The housing top has an access hole of smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the fastener head which retains the fastener within the housing when the fastener is not engaging the second member...|$|E
50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>fasteners</b> are an {{engineered}} {{class of}} fastener {{designed for a}} permanent hold (captivation) within a target assembly or housing, including upon servicing. They provide a secure joining, and avoid fastener loss or damage that might {{be caused by a}} loose part.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} types are the screw, nut and bolt. Other, more {{specialized}} types, include <b>captive</b> threaded <b>fasteners,</b> stud, threaded inserts, and threaded rods.|$|R
40|$|A {{variable}} pressure washer has two interlocking channel rings {{separated by a}} channel and retained by a <b>captive</b> set of <b>fasteners.</b> Within the channel between the rings are multiple rows of springs having at least two different spring moduli. The washer is particularly suited for use with a polar boss assembly secured to a bulkhead of a pressure vessel such as of propellent tank dome structure where the washer allows for the substantially uniform deflection of multiple O-rings as affected by the curved structure...|$|R
