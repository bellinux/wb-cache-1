The Linares area (Jaén, Spain), where an important mining activity on metallic sulphides ores was developed, has been selected for this study. This activity has produced a large volume of mining voids. Electrical resistivity tomography is a geophysical tool well suited to the detection and mapping of known and unknown mining voids. The technique is capable of discriminating between the developing cavities, where the target is primarily conductive weathered material, and the empty voids comprising resistive air-filled cavities. Such cavities may be water-filled, in which case they are likely to yield conductive anomalies as the water would be significantly more conductive than the surrounding material (unweathered granite in this case).

The tools of the theory of the Hamiltonian dynamical systems are applied to determine the strength and the the position of the trapped vortex and to discuss its stability. The unsteady evolution of a distributed-vorticity region is then investigated numerically by using a high-order blob vortex method.

The objective is to minimize the maximal dimensionless excess of temperature between the solid body and the cavity. There is uniform heat generation on the solid body. The total volume and the cavity volume are fixed, but the geometric lengths and thickness of the X-shaped cavity can vary. The cavity surfaces are isothermal while the solid body has adiabatic conditions on the outer surface. The emerged optimal configurations and performance are reported graphically. When compared to the Y- and C- and H-, the X-shaped cavity performs approximately 53 % better than the Y-shaped cavity and 68 % better than the C-shaped cavity for the area fraction f = 0. 05, while its performance is 22 % inferior {{to the performance of}} the H-shaped cavity for the area fraction f = 0. 1.

To compensate for this shortcoming, assumptions or a priori knowledge {{need to be}} incorporated in the inversion process. A possible option for a broad class of problems is to restrict the range of values within which the unknown model parameters must lie. Typical examples of such problems include cavity detection or the delineation of isolated ore bodies in the subsurface. In cavity detection, the physical properties of the cavity can be narrowed down to those of air and/or water, and the physical properties of the host rock either are known to within a narrow band of values or can be established from simple experiments. Discrete tomography techniques allow such information to be included as constraints on the inversions. We have developed a discrete tomography method {{that is based on}} mixed-integer linear programming. An important feature of our method is the ability to invert jointly different types of data, for which the key physical properties are only loosely connected or unconnected.

In the Heisenberg picture evolution resulting from continuous observation may be described by quantum Langevin equations. We use this method to examine the noise spectrum that results from a continuous observation of the position of a moving mirror, and examine the possibility of detecting the noise resulting from the quantum back-action of the measurement. In addition to the work on continuous measurement theory, we also consider the problem of reconstructing the state of a quantum system from a set of measurements.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of quaternized poly(vinylpyridine) (QPVP) on controlled pore glass (CPG) size, {{over the}} ionic strength range 0. 001 - 0. 5 M {{was found to}} display nonmonotonic behavior {{as a function of}} pore size. Both adsorption kinetics and ionic strength effects deviated dramatically from behavior typical of adsorption on flat surfaces when the ratio of the pore radius Rp to the polymer hydrodynamic radius Rh became smaller than ca. 2. Ionic strength enhancement of adsorption for small pore sizes was observed at much higher salt concentrations than is typical for polycation adsorption on flat surfaces. The amount of polymer adsorbed per unit surface area of glass GA, in 0. 5 M NaCl, exhibited a shallow maximum at Rp/Rh ˜ 5. Since the value of GA for small pore size CPG is strongly depressed by the large surface area, an alternative and more interesting observation is that the amount of polymer adsorbed per gram of CPG, Gw, displays a strong maximum when Rp is equal to or slightly smaller than Rh. The efficiency with which QPVP binds anionic micelles to (negatively charged) CPG (grams of surfactant/grams of QPVP) increases strongly with diminishing pore size, indicating that the configuration of polycation bound to small pores favors micelle binding. Since the micelles are larger than small pores, the results indicate that when Rp <Rh, adsorbed polycation molecules reside only partially within the pore.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A newly {{suburban}} area called Mokattam City was constructed on the Mokattam high plateau. It overlooks the Nile valley {{at the site}} of Cairo. Mokattam high plateau rises above the flood plain of the Nile valley by about 180 meters. Geologically, it belongs to Eocene time and it is mainly covered by thick succession of limestone with thinner beds of shale and marl. Mokattam high plateau suffered occasional landslides at different locations. Frequent rock falls were observed along the southern edge of the plateau. The most significant was an edge failure that occurred in front of a five-storey hotel. The rock mass that slipped reached the edge of this hotel and left the footing of the corner column almost overhanging. Since then the problem was subject to various studies by several workers who attributed the problem to several causes including geological, morphological, physical and human factors. In this present work, thorough investigation and analysis of the problem have been made in order to assess the potential hazards due to rock fall and its causes. The study indicated that the problem occurred due to variety or combination of causes including geological, morphological, physical and human. However, the triggering factor was water infiltration due to rainfall and human activities. Geological and morphological conditions lead to the susceptibility to rock fall caused by water infiltration.

TG-MS analysis on the parent IMO only shows loss of water (up to ca. 700 K), while XRD indicates the formation of a lamellar phase, because of the mutual reaction of inner silanols. With both Me-IMO and Me-IMO-NH 2, Mass spectrometry and NMR analysis reveals the occurrence of a more complex collapsing mechanism, basically due to the reaction of outer Al-OH groups and inner Si-CH 3, following the cleavage of the NTs structure, yielding methane and transient Al-O-CH 2 -Si species. All three materials show a limited decrease in the interlayer distance caused by collapse, as well as a substantial residual porosity. It is concluded that the layered structure can be conceived as consisting in an overall buckled structure, the strong strain within the silico-alumina layer of the single-walled nanotube providing the driving force against a complete flattening.

40|$|The {{electropolishing}} process (EP) {{is considered}} an essential step in the processing of high gradient SRF cavities. Studies on EP of small samples has been started at Fermilab {{as part of the}} SRF materials R&D program. A simple bench top setup was developed to understand the basic variables affecting the EP. In addition a setup for vertical EP of half cells, based on the Cornell design, was used and another one for dumbbells was designed and tested. Results and findings are reported. ELECTROPOLISHING OF NIOBIUM In the past four years, most of the laboratories and universities involved in R&D programs for the production of high gradient superconducting RF cavities substituted the standard buffered chemical polishing (BCP) process with EP [1, 2]. At the moment the introduction of EP is considered the essential step toward the production of over 35 MV/m superconducting RF cavities. The main improvement of the cavity performance associated to EP is the reduction of the material surface roughness. Whereas during BCP the chemical reaction mostly happens at the grain boundaries resulting in an enhancement of the material topological features, during EP the electrochemical process smoothens these features resulting in a reduction of the overall surface roughness of the material. The use of EP has an impact, not only on the performances of cavities, but also on the overall processing sequence that has to be modified, especially those steps involving the chemical treatment of dressed cavities.

In 2007, cavity occurrence and use were assessed in 12 plots (6 in old forests, 6 in young forests), covering a total area of 97 ha. Overall, 720 cavities from 466 trees were assessed. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) results showed that cavity trees were significantly larger than non-cavity-trees. Besides, cavity-trees were decayed in a significantly higher proportion than non-cavity-trees. Large decayed trees provided woodpeckers with suitable substrate for excavation, and were also a source of nonexcavated natural cavities. For nesting, birds preferred living trees, longer cavity depths, cavities with narrower entrances, woodpecker-created cavities and smaller diameter trees. The smaller holes may be preferred to avoid the access of medium and large sized predators. Similarly, deeper cavities may prevent predators from reaching them to remove chicks. Even if woodpecker-created cavities were preferred by birds, most of the cavities were not created by woodpeckers and only {{a small proportion of}} woodpecker-created cavities were used by birds (12 %), so the role of woodpecker as keystone species in this area could not be confirmed. The preference for living trees may be related to cavity microclimate stability, as living trees heat and cool more slowly than decayed trees, leading to more stable temperatures. The preference for cavity-trees with smaller diameter {{may be due to the}} presence of large decayed trees unable to hold a nest. Taking into account that cavity-trees had larger diameters than non-cavity-trees, and that trees occupied by birds were smaller than non-occupied cavity-trees, many birds occupied medium-size trees. Nest-entrance tended to be oriented to East-Southeast, perhaps because such sunny orientations help to warm young and keep the cavity dry. Cavity and nest densities were higher in old forests in relation to young forests, perhaps because old forests provide higher availability of large decayed trees, which are important sources of cavities. Overall, occupation was low (19 %), which may be due to the presence of a high proportion of low quality cavities which were unsuitable for nesting. Alternatively, intra- and interspecific territoriality may lead to low occupation rates of <b>cavitie...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{habit of}} man to {{excavate}} artificial cavities began {{a very long time}} ago. Man’s efforts were initially moved by the need to have a safe place to live, to control the surrounding territory, to collect and transport water, to exploit the natural resources. For all these purposes, he had to face a number of geological and morphological constraints that, depending on site characteristics, guided, favored or complicated the excavation. Therefore, all the phases in the “life” of an artificial cavity, from the original idea, to planning and realization, up to its later evolution and possible conservation, depend in some ways on geology and morphology. Lithology of hosting rock is the first aspect to consider: the rock mass must allow hand excavation but, at the same time, it should present physical-mechanical characteristics such to support the newlyformed cavity. The geological and structural setting, including the main faults and the discontinuity systems in the rock mass, have to be particularly taken into account. Choice of the site where to locate an artificial cavity is also dictated by morphology, the morphological factors being, in turn, strictly related to land management and control. When safety reasons were considered to be the main priority, for instance, those sites that apparently were extremely difficult to excavate and to settle in were chosen. Morphology is also strictly related to slope instability. Several rock settlements situated at the borders of deep valleys and ravines are directly involved in mass movements, due to natural evolution of the slopes and to open cracks produced by the tensional release in the unsupported rock mass. Inside the artificial cavities, in turn, problems of instability may be observed. Locally, these may become so significant to compromise the overall stability of the structure. Slope instability processes deserve a greater attention from cavers and scientists, since their effects might be extremely dangerous for people visiting and working in artificial cavities, and for the cultural heritage therein contained as well. Availability of water resources is a further factor that controlled during historical times the choice of sites for settlements and towns. As a consequence, the hydrogeology plays a crucial role for artificial cavities, and particularly for those works intended to collect and transport water to settlers and inhabitants. Aqueducts, tunnels, fountains are, for the reasons above, very important to study {{in the context of the}} geological and hydrogeological setting, considering at the same time the social and historical aspects of the community that designed and realized them. The present contribution is an attempt in categorizing the aforementioned factors that play a role in the realization of artificial cavities. The topic is very wide, covering several interrelated disciplines and field of research, and should deserve to be treated with much greater detail and thoroughness. Our goal is therefore to stimulate with this article cavers and interested scientists in carrying out studies about the crucial role that geology and morphology have in the development of artificial <b>cavitie...</b>|$|E
