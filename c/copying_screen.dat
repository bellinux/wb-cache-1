40|$|Several cloned disease {{resistance}} genes {{from a wide}} range of plant species are known to share conserved regions with similar structural motifs. Degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of the nucleotide binding site of the genes RPS 2, N and L 6 were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from genomic DNA of two doubled haploid lines of Brassica oleracea. Sequences of amplified products were highly variable, but most of them showed similarity to known {{disease resistance}} genes, including RPS 5, RPS 2 and N, and to disease resistance gene-like sequences (RGLs) from different species. Primers based on B. oleracea sequences amplified five groups of RGLs. Products were mapped through cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence assays onto four different linkage groups of B. oleracea. PCR amplification from cDNA and allele analysis indicated that four locus-specific RGL fragments are expressed in cauliflower. Screening of a B. oleracea bacterial artificial chromosome library (BAC) with four B. oleracea RGL probes identified a small number of clones, suggesting that the four RGLs may not be highly <b>copied.</b> <b>Screening</b> of a BAC library of A. thaliana with the same probes identified clones that mapped onto four different chromosomes. These map positions correspond to known disease resistance loci of A. thaliana...|$|R

40|$|An RFLP genomic {{subtraction}} {{was used}} to isolate male-specific sequences in the species Silene latifolia. One isolated fragment, SLP 2, shares similarity to {{a portion of the}} Activator (Ac) transposase from Zea mays and to related proteins from other plant species. Southern blot analysis of male and female S. latifolia genomic DNA shows that SLP 2 belongs to a low-copy-number repeat family with two Y-linked <b>copies.</b> <b>Screening</b> of a S. latifolia male genomic library using SLP 2 as a probe led to the isolation of five clones, which were partially sequenced. One clone contains two large open reading frames that can be joined into a sequence encoding a putative protein of 682 amino acids by removing a short intron. Database searches and phylogenetic analysis show that this protein belongs to the hAT superfamily of transposases, closest to Tag 2 (Arabidopsis thaliana), and contains all of the defined domains critical for the activity of these transposases. PCR with genomic and cDNA templates from S. latifolia male, female, and hermaphrodite individuals revealed that one of the Y-linked copies is transcriptionally active and alternatively spliced. This is the first report of a transcriptionally active transposable element (TE) family in S. latifolia and the first DNA transposon residing on a plant Y chromosome. The potential activity and regulation of this TE family and its use for Y chromosome gene discovery is discussed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{provide the}} medical {{students}} involved in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with a remotely accessible training tool for the self acquisition of information retrieval skills. CONTENT: Access to the training tool is made trough a portal Web site. The tool is initiated with a clinical case. A selection of relevant electronic resources such as dictionaries, encyclopaedias, textbooks, and bibliographical databases is proposed. Each resource comes with search examples achieved by librarians concerning {{the subject of the}} clinical case. Each step of the strategy is described, commented and illustrated with a <b>screen</b> <b>copy</b> of the original resource. To reinforce the realism, users are invited to click on the appropriate areas of the <b>screen</b> <b>copy</b> to progress in the search. A catalogue is created with the documents retrieved from the different resources. The catalogue is searchable independently and provides links to full-text when available. The technical support for the training tool consists of a set of related databases (FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Inc., USA). Data concerning the clinical case, including medical imaging, is contained in a first database. Description of – and links to resources are collected in a second database as well as basic user instructions. For every search example in a specific resource, a database is created from a template, containing all the searched terms and <b>screen</b> <b>copies</b> necessary to provide an interactive demonstration. The catalogue of documents constitutes the last database. The prototype must now be presented to teachers and students and evaluated for quality, performance and user-friendliness. Results will help us to improve the design and content of the training tool...|$|R
