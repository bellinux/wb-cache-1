5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> production.|$|E

40|$|Bifidobacterium longum 1941, B. animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI ® B 94, Lactobacillus casei 279, Lb. casei LAFTI L 26, Lb. acidophilus 4962, or Lb. acidophilus LAFTI L 10 {{were used}} as an adjunct in the {{production}} of <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses,</b> which were ripened at 4 and 8 °C for 24 wk. Effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. Higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. Product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses.</b> There were positive and significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic, and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of α s 1 -CN and β-CN to the scores of cheddary flavor (P < 0. 05). Scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of Bifidobacterium sp. or Lb. casei 279 ripened at 8 °C. The scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (P < 0. 05). The results show that both 4 and 8 °C have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses.</b> © 2009 Institute of Food Technologists ®. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E

Partial least squares-linear discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) provided a 70 % success rate in correct prediction of the age of the cheeses based on their key headspace volatile profiles.

Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread crumbs.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the release of ACE-inhibitory {{peptides}} in <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses</b> made with starter lactococci and Lactobacillus casei 279 or Lb. casei LAFTI® L 26 during ripening and to isolate, purify and identify such peptides. Addition of probiotic organisms increased the ACE-inhibitory activity of the cheeses during ripening at 4 °C possibly due to the increased proteolysis. The IC 50 (concentrations of ACE needed to inhibit 50 % of ACE activity) was the lowest after 24 weeks of ripening in the probiotic cheeses (0. 23 - 0. 25 mg·mL- 1) compared to 36 weeks for cheeses without any probiotic (0. 28 mg·mL- 1). Water-soluble extracts of each cheese were subjected to several stages of chromatography fractionation, Inhibitory activity found in the crude fractions ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mg·mL- 1. The fraction with the highest activity was purified using a second stage chromatography. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides corresponding to the αs 1 -casein N-terminal peptides [(f 1 - 6), (f 1 - 7), (f 1 - 9), (f 24 - 32) and (f 102 - 110) ] and β-casein N-terminal peptides [(f 47 - 52) and (f 193 - 209) ] were found, Our results suggested that ACE inhibition in <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses</b> was dependent on proteolysis to a certain extent.
