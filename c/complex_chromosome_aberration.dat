40|$|Abstract Background The sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) {{has been}} used with success for suppressing or eliminating important insect pests of agricultural or veterinary importance. In order to develop SIT for mosquitoes, female elimination prior to release is essential as they are the disease-transmitting sex. A genetic sexing strain (GSS) of Anopheles arabiensis was created based on resistance to dieldrin, and methods of sex separation at the egg stage were developed. The use of this strain for SIT will require sexually sterile males: useful radiation doses for this purpose were determined for pupae and adults. Methods For {{the creation of the}} sexing strain, dieldrin-resistant males were irradiated with 40 [*]Gy using a 60 Co source and were subsequently crossed to homozygous susceptible virgin females. Individual families were screened for semi-sterility and for male resistance to dieldrin. For sex separation, eggs of a resulting GSS, ANO IPCL 1, were exposed to varying concentrations of dieldrin for different durations. Percent hatch, larval survival, and male and female emergence were recorded. Radiation induced sterility was determined following adult and pupa exposure to gamma rays at 0 – 105 [*]Gy. Mortality induced by dieldrin treatment, and levels of sterility post radiation were investigated. Results ANO IPCL 1 contains a <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> that pseudo-links the male-determining Y chromosome and dieldrin resistance, conferring high natural semi-sterility. Exposure of eggs to 2, 3, and 4 [*]ppm dieldrin solutions resulted in complete female elimination without a significant decrease of male emergence compared to the controls. A dose of 75 [*]Gy reduced the fertility to 3. 8 and 6. 9 % when males were irradiated as pupae or adults respectively, but the proportions of progeny of these males reaching adulthood were 0. 6 and 1. 5 % respectively Conclusion The GSS ANO IPCL 1 was shown to be a suitable strain for further testing for SIT though high semi-sterility is a disadvantage for mass rearing. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relative}} influence of linear energy transfer (LET) of α-particles on <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> complexity in the absence of significant other track structure differences. To do this we irradiated human haemopoietic stem cells (CD 34 +) with The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the relative influence of linear energy transfer (LET) of α-particles of various incident LET values (110 - 152 keV/µm, with mean LETs through the cell of 119 – 182 keV/µm) at an equi-fluence of approximately 1 α-particle/cell and assayed for <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> by m-FISH. Based on a single harvest time to collect early division mitosis, complex aberrations were observed at comparable frequencies irrespective of incident LET, however when expressed as a proportion of the total exchanges detected, their occurrence was seen to increase with increasing LET. Cycle analysis to predict theoretical DNA double strand break rejoining cycles was also carried out on all <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> detected. By doing this we found that the majority of complex aberrations are formed in single non-reducible cycles that involve just 2 or 3 different chromosomes and 3 or 4 different breaks. Each non-reducible cycle is suggested to represent ‘an area’ of finite size within the nucleus where double strand break repair occurs. We suggest that local density of damage induced and proximity of independent repair areas within the interphase nucleus determine the complexity of aberration resolved in metaphase. Overall, the most likely outcome of a single nuclear traversal of a single α-particle in CD 34 + cells is a single <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> per damaged cell.

40|$|Carcinomas of {{the head}} and neck {{typically}} exhibit <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> but the underlying mutational mechanisms remain obscure. Evaluation of cell division dynamics in low-passage cell lines from three benign and five malignant head and neck tumours revealed a strong positive correlation between multipolarity of the mitotic spindle and the formation of bridges at anaphase in both benign and malignant tumours. Cells exhibiting a high rate of mitotic abnormalities also showed several chromosome termini lacking TTAGGG repeats and a high frequency of dicentric chromosomes. Multicolour karyotyping demonstrated a preferential involvement in structural rearrangements of chromosomes with deficient telomeres. The majority of malignant, mitotically unstable tumours expressed the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase. These data indicate that some of the genomic instability in head and neck tumours is initiated by telomere dysfunction, leading to the formation of dicentric chromosomes. These form chromosome bridges at mitosis that could prevent the normal anaphase-telophase transition. In turn, this may cause an accumulation of centrosomes and mitotic multipolarity. Telomerase expression does not confer total stability to the tumour genome but could be crucial for moderating the rate of chromosomal evolution...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia {{is a rare}} form {{of mature}} leukemia which occurs in adults and in younger {{patients}} suffering ataxia telangiectasia. Among others, <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> of <b>chromosome</b> 12 have been described in this disease. We searched for deletions of the 12 p 13 region {{as the result of}} these chromosome rearrangements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired leukemic and non-leukemic cells were obtained from a series of 21 patients suffering T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Loss of heterozygosity was searched for by microsatellite typing using a fluorescent automated laser DNA sequencer to analyze the amplification products. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Southern blot analysis of one patient was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Loss of heterozygosity of the 12 p 13 region, including the ETV 6 and CDKN 1 B genes, was detected in nine of these 21 cases (43 %). Western and Southern blot analyses of one case demonstrated a biallelic deletion which did not include ETV 6. Taken together, our results defined a minimal region of deletion of less than one Mb flanked by the markers b 312 C 2 T 7 and D 12 S 320, excluding ETV 6 as a candidate gene. Deletion of the 12 p 13 region is thus a highly recurrent genetic event in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{thymidine}} analogue, 5 ’-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), is a known mutagen that {{is routinely}} introduced into culture media for subsequent Harlequin stain analysis and determination of cell cycle status. Previously, {{we examined the}} induction of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) known {{to be in their}} 1 st cell division following exposure to a low dose (0. 5 Gy, average one -particle per cell) of high-LET α-particles. We found <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> to be characteristic of exposure to high-LET radiation and suggested the features of complex exchange to reflect qualitatively the spatial deposition of this densely ionising radiation. To exclude the possibility that BrdU addition post-irradiation influenced the complexity of chromosomal damage observed by m-FISH, the effect of increasing BrdU concentration on aberration complexity was investigated. Comparisons between BrdU concentration (0, 10, and 40 M) and between sham- and α-particle irradiated PBL, were made both independently and in combination to enable discrimination between BrdU and high-LET radiation effects. Aberration type, size, complexity and completeness were assessed by m-FISH, and the relative progression through cell division was evaluated. We found no evidence of any qualitative difference in the complexity of damage as visualized by m-FISH but did observe an increase in the frequency of complex exchanges with increasing BrdU concentration indicative of altered cell cycle kinetics. The parameters measured here are consistent with findings from previous in vitro and in vivo work, indicating that each complex aberration visualised by m-FISH is characteristic {{of the structure of the}} high-LET α-particle track and the geometry of cell irradiated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBlastic {{plasmacytoid}} {{dendritic cell}} neoplasm (BPDCN) is an exceedingly rare disorder categorized under {{acute myeloid leukemia}} by the World Health Organization. Phenotypically, malignant cells coexpress CD 4 + and CD 56 + without coexpressing common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers. BPDCN frequently expresses CD 123, TCL 1, BDCA- 2, and CD 2 AP. Restriction of CD 2 AP expression to plasmacytoid dendritic cells makes it a useful tool to help confirm diagnosis. Clonal <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> are described in two-thirds of cases. Eighty percent of BPDCN cases present with nonspecific dermatological manifestations, prompting inclusion in the differential diagnosis of atypical skin rashes refractory to standard treatment. Prognosis is poor, with a median survival of less than 18 months. No prospective randomized data exist to define the most optimal frontline chemotherapy. Current practice considers acute myeloid leukemia-like or acute lymphoblastic leukemia–like regimens acceptable for induction treatment. Unfortunately, responses are short-lived, with second remissions difficult to achieve, underscoring the need to consider hematopoietic cell transplantation early in the disease course. Allografting, especially if offered in first remission, can result in long-term remissions. Preclinical data suggest a potential role for immunomodulatory agents in BPCDN. However, further research efforts are needed to better understand BPDCN biology and to establish evidence-based treatment algorithms that might ultimately improve overall prognosis of this disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} {{space environment}} includes particles such as protons and multiple species of heavy ions, {{with much of}} the exposure to these radiations occurring at extremely low average dose-rates. Limitations in databases needed to predict cancer hazards in human beings from such radiations are significant and currently do not provide confidence that such predictions are acceptably precise or accurate. In this article, we outline the need for animal carcinogenesis data based on a more sophisticated understanding of the dose-response relationship for induction of cancer and correlative cellular endpoints by representative space radiations. We stress the need for a model that can interrelate human and animal carcinogenesis data with cellular mechanisms. Using a broad model for dose-response patterns which we term the "subalpha-alpha-omega (SAO) model", we explore examples in the literature for radiation-induced cancer and for radiation-induced cellular events to illustrate the need for data that define the dose-response patterns more precisely over specific dose ranges, with special attention to low dose, low dose-rate exposure. We present data for multiple endpoints in cells, which vary in their radiosensitivity, that also support the proposed model. We have measured induction of <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in multiple cell types by two space radiations, Fe-ions and protons, and compared these to photons delivered at high dose-rate or low dose-rate. Our data demonstrate that at least three factors modulate the relative efficacy of Fe-ions compared to photons: (i) intrinsic radiosensitivity of irradiated cells; (ii) dose-rate; and (iii) another unspecified effect perhaps related to reparability of DNA lesions. These factors can produce respectively up to at least 7 -, 6 - and 3 -fold variability. These data demonstrate the need to understand better the role of intrinsic radiosensitivity and dose-rate effects in mammalian cell response to ionizing radiation. Such understanding is critical in extrapolating databases between cellular response, animal carcinogenesis and human carcinogenesis, and we suggest that the SAO model is a useful tool for such extrapolation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare the {{cytogenetic}} effects of densely and sparsely ionizing radiations in vitro and in vivo. To achieve this, chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to different doses of X-rays and C-ions with different energies; furthermore, lymphocytes were obtained from prostate-cancer patients before, during and after radiotherapy and analyzed using the multiplex {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (mFISH) technique. These cancer patients were either treated with C-ion boost irradiation {{in the course of a}} conventional photon intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or solely with IMRT. Blood samples were taken from each patient before, during, at the end of and one year after the therapy. In the in vitro experiments, an increase in the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for the induction of chromosomal aberrations with increasing linear energy transfer (LET) of the C-ions was observed in the investigated energy range (270 MeV/u C-ions, LET= 14 keV/µm; 100 MeV/u C-ions, LET= 29 keV/µm; extended Bragg peak of C-ions, LET= 60 - 85 keV/µm). The ratio of complex to simple exchanges, the C-ratio, which is discussed as a biomarker for densely ionizing radiation, was calculated and a LET- and dose-dependent increase was found. Likewise, the complexity of <b>complex</b> <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> increased with LET and dose. For prostate-cancer patients, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations found in the peripheral blood lymphocytes increased during the radiotherapy course; but after the C-ion boost, the frequency was lower than in patients treated with comparable doses of IMRT. No significantly increased C-ratio was found in the patients treated with the C-ion boost compared to the patients treated with IMRT. A higher frequency of aberrations was measured in patients who were exposed to an increased target volume. The aberration frequency decreased significantly in two out of 16 patients in the year after therapy. The study shows that the reduced integral dose applied to normal tissue during the C-ion boost is reflected in a lower chromosomal aberration frequency compared to IMRT. While the in vitro experiments showed an enhanced C-ratio for densely ionizing radiation, no increased C-ratio was observed in the patients' samples after C-ion boost therapy. As mFISH allows identification of individual <b>chromosomes</b> involved in <b>aberrations,</b> the distribution of breakpoints among individual chromosomes and the frequencies of pairwise chromosomal exchanges were analyzed in addition...|$|R

Methods DNA damage was evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 oropharyngeal cancer patients using alkaline comet assay, analysis of structural <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations,</b> and micronucleus assay. Blood samples were taken 2 hours before irradiation on day 1 of the first radiotherapy cycle, 2 hours after the application of the first dose, {{in the middle of the}} radiotherapy cycle, within 2 hours after the last received radiotherapy dose, and after 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Results In most participants, the highest level of primary DNA damage was recorded in blood samples collected after the administration of first radiation dose (mean tail length 25. 04 ± 6. 23 μm). Most patients also had increased frequency of comets with long tail-nucleus (LTN comets) after the administration of the first radiation dose (mean, 10. 50 ± 7. 71 per 100 comets), which remained increased in the middle of radiotherapy (mean, 18. 30 ± 27. 62 per 100 comets). Later on, the levels of primary DNA damage as recorded by the comet assay, slightly diminished. The frequency of structural <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in lymphocytes gradually increased during the radiation cycle (26. 50 ± 27. 72 per 100 metaphases at the end of the therapy), as well as the frequency of micronuclei (mean total number of micronuclei 167. 20 ± 35. 69 per 1000 binuclear cells).

The implications of these specific repetitive DNA sequences and their organization for centromere function are still quite cloudy.

In the present work, we analyzed chromosome preparations from a fibrosarcoma, in comparison with nontumor cells (epithelial tissue) from the same individual, by in situ hybridization of the FA-SAT cat satellite DNA family.

The effect of potassium cyanide increases with increasing oxygen concentration up to 100 per cent oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, potassium cyanide was not completely inactive, but produced a low, though significant frequency of aberrations. Pretreatments with 2. 4 -dinitrophenol did not influence the effect of potassium cyanide. When bean roots were treated with potassium cyanide before a treatment with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, or {{at the same time as}} they were treated with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, the effect of 8 -ethoxycaffeine was almost completely suppressed. The effects of a number of other heavy metal complexing agents were also tested. Sodium fluoride, potassium thiocyanate, carbon monoxide, o-phenanthroline, 2. 2 -bipyridine, and sodium azide were without radiomimetic effect under the conditions employed, and so was a mixture of sodium azide and sodium fluoride. A low, but quite significant, radiomimetic effect was obtained after treatments with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, cupferron, and 8 -hydroxyquinoline. Under anaerobic conditions, the effects of cyanide and cupferron were both quantitatively and qualitatively indistinguishable. Unlike the effect of cyanide, the effect of cupferron was not enhanced by the presence of oxygen. The effects of the same heavy metal complexing agents were tested on the activities of the enzymes catalase and peroxidase. The activities of both of these enzymes were found to be totally inhibited only by potassium cyanide. In the other cases, little correlation was found between ability to inhibit the activities of these enzymes and ability to produce <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> In a number of experiments, hydrogen peroxide was found to be without radiomimetic effect, whether alone or in combination with potassium cyanide. t-Butyl hydroperoxide proved to be active. The effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide was substantially increased by pretreatments with 2. 4. -dinitrophenol. The results are discussed, and it is concluded that the observations made do not support the hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide is involved in the production of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> by potassium cyanide. The possibility that organic peroxides are involved cannot be excluded on the bases of the experimental results. As an alternative hypothesis, it is suggested that iron or other heavy metals are present in the chromosomes and that cyanide and other heavy metal <b>complexing</b> agents produce <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> by reacting with these metals...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with severe health problems, especially cancers. In addition, cigarette smoking causes different genotoxic effects. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> are one of well-known intermediate end points in carcinogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in peripheral blood lymphocytes between young smokers and non-smokes groups. Methods: The study was conducted with 30 smokers (average age 26. 93 years) and 30 non-smokers (average age 26. 96 years), and included the analysis of 100 metaphases per each blood sample. Differences in the arithmetic means of determined frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were tested by two-tailed t -test for independent samples with the significance level of p < 0. 05. Results: The results showed a significant increase in the frequencies of chromatid-type aberrations and total structural <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in smoker group. Frequencies of numerical aberrations did not differ significantly between two groups. Conclusions: This study confirmed genotoxicity of cigarette smoking and provided new evidence about its clastogenic activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{published}} {{studies have reported}} the RBE values for chromosome chromosomes induced by charged particles of different LET. The RBE for <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in human lymphocytes exposed ex vivo showed a similar relationship as the quality factor for cancer induction. Consequently, increased <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> in the astronauts' white blood cells post long-duration missions are {{used to determine the}} biological doses from exposures to space radiation. The RBE value is known to be very different for different types of cancer. Previously, we reported that the RBE for initial chromosome damages was high in human lymphocytes exposed to Fe ions. After multiple cell divisions post irradiation, the RBE was significantly smaller. To test the hypothesis that the RBE values for <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> are different between early and late damages and also different between different cell types, we exposed human lymphocytes ex vivo, and human fibroblast cells and human mammary epithelial cells in vitro to 600 MeV/u Fe ions. Post irradiation, the cells were collected at first mitosis, or cultured for multiple generations for collections of remaining or late arising <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were quantified using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome specific probes.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{generally}} accepted that chromosome exchanges in irradiated cells the formed through interactions between separate DNA doable-strand breaks (DSB). Here we tested whether non-irradiated DNA participate; {{in the formation}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> wen <b>complex</b> DNA DSB are induced elsewhere in the nucleus. Materials acid methods: Synchronized Chinese hamster cells containing an X chromosome with a late replicating q arm (X-q domain) were labelled with I- 125 -iododeoxyuridine ((125) IdUrd) in a period of S-phase when {{the vast majority of the}} X-q domain was not replicating. DNA damage froth I- 125 decay as accumulated at the G 1 /S border while the culls were stored in liquid nitrogen. Decay of I- 125 induced DSB in the immediate vicinity of the I- 125 atom. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> involving what is essentially the I- 125 -free X-q domain were scored at the first mitosis after cell thawing. As a positive control, cells were treated with (125) IdUrd at a later period in S-phase when the X-q domain replicates yielding a labelled X-q domain. Results: The I- 125 -free X-q domain exhibited <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> (exchanges and fragments). The frequency of these aberrations seas linearly dependent on the number of I- 125 decays elsewhere in the cell nucleus. The efficiency of formation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> by the I- 125 -free X-q domain teas approximately half of that observed in the I- 125 -labelled X-q domain. Conclusions: The involvement of the I- 125 -free X-q domain in <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration,</b> suggests that DNA trot damaged by the decay of incorporated I- 125 can interact with damaged DNA, indicating the existence of an alternative pathway fist, the formation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration...</b>|$|R

Analysis of chromosome structure in {{a large number of}} LOH clones by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR showed that chromosome loss, allelic recombination, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> were the major classes of genetic alterations leading to LOH. The frequencies of chromosome loss and <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> were significantly affected when the marker was located in different chromosomes, suggesting that chromosome-specific elements may affect the processes that led to these alterations. Aberrant-sized chromosomes were detected readily in approximately 8 % of LOH events when the URA 3 marker was placed in chromosome III. Molecular mechanisms underlying the <b>chromosome</b> <b>aberrations</b> were further investigated by studying the fate of two other genetic markers on <b>chromosome</b> III. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>aberration</b> caused by intrachromosomal rearrangements was predominantly due to a deletion between the MAT and HMR loci that occurred at a frequency of 3. 1 x 10 (- 6).
