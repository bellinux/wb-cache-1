40|$|Mountainous landscapes in Central Zagros {{are mainly}} used as grazing rangelands to feed animals and are heavily degraded. Overgrazing may impose a {{negative}} effect on rangeland productivity and sustainability through significant changes in soil properties. Soil nitrogen (N) mineralization {{is one of the key}} biological processes that might be affected by biotic and abiotic factors including range grazing regime or intensity. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of rangeland management (grazing and ungrazing regimes) on soil N mineralization in natural rangelands of Chaharmahal VA Bakhtiyari province. Three range management regimes including a) long-term ungrazed, b) <b>controlled</b> <b>grazed</b> and c) freely- (over) -grazed plots in a close vicinity were selected in three regions consisting of SabzKouh (protected from grazing for 18 years), Boroujen (protected from grazing for 23 years) and Sheida (protected from grazing for 2 years), and soil samples were collected from 0 - 15 cm depth for some physical and chemical properties. Soil N mineralization was measured under standard laboratory conditions. At SabzKouh, the effect of range management on the cumulative N mineralization and the proportion of N mineralized (%) was significant (P< 0. 05) and ungrazing regime resulted in 89 % and 96 % increases in soil N mineralization in ungrazed rangelands compared with <b>controlled</b> <b>grazed</b> and freely- grazed rangelands, respectively. Similarly, soil N mineralization was significantly greater (P< 0. 05) in ungrazed rangelands (3. 3 - to 3. 5 -folds) than in <b>controlled</b> <b>grazed</b> and freely-grazed rangelands at Boroujen site. However, at Sheida site with short-term ungrazing period and cropping history there were no significant and considerable differences in soil N mineralization among the three grazing regimes. Briefly, degraded rangelands at SabzKouh and Boroujen sites seem to recover rather quickly from long-term overgrazing with a proper grazing management, while rangeland ecosystems at Sheida site need a much longer period for steady-state conditions and for improvements in soil quality and fertility after long-term soil degradation and disturbance...|$|R

Thus it is not possible to define appropriate grazing management techniques for specific aims, yet there is an urgent need for this type of knowledge, especially in countries with little remaining natural forest. Gradients of primary productivity have been shown to affect grazing choice and species responses to damage in non-forest vegetation, yet few studies have explored these effects within forest systems. More research on plant-herbivore and herbivore-herbivore interactions is required at a range of both plant and animal densities. The increasing awareness of biodiversity issues has also highlighted deficiencies in our knowledge of forest systems.

40|$|Free and {{uncontrolled}} {{pasture grazing}} by animals may decrease soil aggregate stability through reductions in plant cover and subsequent soil organic C, and trampling. This could expose {{the soil surface}} layer to degradation and erosion. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of pasture management (free grazing, <b>controlled</b> <b>grazing</b> and long-term non-grazing regimes) on aggregate-size distribution and aggregation parameters by wet and dry sieving methods in two native pastures, protected areas in Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province. The studied pastures were 1) SabzKouh pastures protected from grazing for 20 years, and 2) Boroujen pastures protected from grazing for 25 years. Soil samples were collected from 0 - 15 cm depth during the grazing season in summer 2008. Samples (finer than 2 mm) were analyzed for aggregate-size distribution and aggregation parameters by wet and dry sieving methods. Results showed that pasture management had a significant influence on aggregate-size distribution and aggregation parameters in the two areas. The two methods indicated that macro-aggregates in non-grazing and <b>controlled</b> <b>grazing</b> regimes were higher than those in free grazing regime, whereas in free grazing management micro-aggregates showed an opposite trend, and were greater compared with the other grazing regimes. Similarly, soil aggregate stability indices (i. e. mean weight diameter, aggregate geometric and ratio mean diameter) were all improved by non-grazing regimes, suggesting that animal grazing and trampling break down large soil aggregates due largely to compaction and reduced plant coverage.
