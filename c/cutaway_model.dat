5|$|There is a <b>cutaway</b> <b>model</b> of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The {{model is}} at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E

5000|$|PacMin {{was founded}} in 1946 by two {{employees}} of Douglas Aircraft Company. The purpose was to create models for people to see the interior of aircraft {{in order to get}} nervous travelers to fly. The company created large <b>cutaway</b> <b>models</b> that became mainstays for travel agencies. PacMin began creating smaller models scaled to one hundredth of the aircraft size which became what the company was known for.|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum was}} opened as the Reuno Samseong Munhwagwan (Hangul:르노삼성 문화관) or Renault Samsung Culture Center in June 2001. It was renovated in September 2006, {{adopting}} its current name. [...] For its tenth anniversary were made further improvements. [...] The facilities feature SM7 / QM5 <b>cutaway</b> <b>models</b> to display, <b>cutaway</b> engines (M9R diesel, VQ, etc.), previous and special models (SM5, SM3, Seoul Motor Show exhibition cars, etc.) and diagrams of production process. The museum also displays various projects of the Renault-Nissan Alliance.|$|R
5000|$|In some Gibson guitars, <b>models</b> {{with two}} <b>cutaways</b> are {{abbreviated}} with a [...] "DC" [...] after the name, {{such as in}} the Les Paul Studio DC, the Les Paul Standard DC, the Les Paul Special DC, and the Les Paul Junior DC. Since more single cut versions of these guitars are produced than the doublecut versions, if the model name of these guitars is not followed by [...] "DC", [...] "double cut", or [...] "double cutaway", the assumed reference is to the single <b>cutaway</b> <b>models.</b>|$|R

50|$|George Washburn / Stephens Extended <b>Cutaway</b> {{electric}} <b>models</b> {{were introduced}} in 1987 and designed entirely by Stephen Davies. The EC series had 3 models in the series: the EC-26 Atlantis, the EC-29 Challenger, and the EC-36 Spitfire. The EC-29 and EC-36 were the first mass-produced guitars that had over 27 frets. The EC26 had 26 frets, {{was made in the}} U.S.A. and is a very rare model.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Gibson {{introduced}} the ES-150DC, {{which was a}} significantly different instrument, despite its similar model number. The ES-150DC was a hollowbody electric guitar with a double-cutaway body similar in appearance to the semi-hollow 335 guitars (except for a greater body thickness). It featured two humbuckers, a rosewood fingerboard with small block inlays, and a master volume knob on the lower <b>cutaway.</b> This <b>model,</b> however, was not particularly popular, and it was discontinued by Gibson in the mid-1970s.|$|R
40|$|The Purpose of {{this project}} {{was to create a}} PowerPoint that could be used by high school {{agricultural}} programs and small engine instructors to design and build a 3 -deminsional <b>cutaway</b> engine <b>model</b> and implement realia into the classroom. This project will serve a learning tool to help agriculture instructors to teach students the inner workings of an engine and the relationships between parts. This project should be taken under consideration by all agricultural mechanic programs that teach small engines. This project will be beneficial to all students that want to learn small engines...|$|R

40|$|In {{this brief}} paper we {{describe}} a conferenced environment {{that we have}} built in a client-server networked environment called SHASTRA to support distributed volume modelling and collaborative visualization. The SHASTRA environment allows multiple users to share and interact over extremely large volume data sets while viewing multiple isosurfaces and renderings with independent viewing directions and <b>cutaways.</b> The distributed <b>modelling</b> and visualization algorithms uses the computational power of multiple networked workstations to speedily produce piecewise trivariate polynomial finite elements (modelling) and translucent shaded images of isosurfaces as well as volume rayshaded renderings (visualization) of extremely large data sets. The color graphics in SHASTRA are built on top of XS, a machine independent 3 D-graphics and windows library, that runs on multiple platforms in a heterogeneous environment. 1 Introduction Measurement-based volumetric data sets arise for example from medical [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|From 1959 until 1961, the Melody Maker had {{a single}} cutaway slab body style similar to the early Les Paul Junior model but thinner. In 1961 the body style changed to a {{symmetrical}} double cutaway, resembling a Gretsch 6122 or a Danelectro Shorthorn; the single <b>cutaway</b> <b>model</b> was discontinued. The body style was changed in 1966 to a style similar to the SG, with pointed [...] "horns", a large white scratchplate, and white pickup covers instead of black. Note: Melody Maker [...] "D" [...] refers to the double pickup model of any vintage but is often mistakenly used for the double <b>cutaway</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
