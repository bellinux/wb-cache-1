In it’s development, this industry gets a little trouble cause of liquid waste problem, less in raw material for filling the capacity of industry’s machine and also low in yield and pulp’s characteristics that were produced. So, for solving these troubles, an alternative solution has been proposed. That alternative solution was biopulping. Biopulping has been tested at Thermomechanical pulp industry and it was feasible in financial and technical. But now there’s a question, how’s about the biopulping application in pulp industry which used the kraft method. The purposes of this research are studying the financial and technical of biokraft process in producing pulp (P. Chrysosporium addition before cooking) with three kinds of cooking <b>condition</b> <b>modification</b> (Alcaly active reducing, cooking time and energy reducing, and also reduce both of them) for changing kraft process (convensional method). This research was done on August until September 2011 in Bengkulu. The study instrument of financial and technical were used in this research. Even though the materials were used like pulp yield data, kappa number data, alcaly consume data and also the pulp production with three kinds of cooking <b>condition</b> <b>modification</b> costs data (pulp yield data, kappa number data, alcaly consume data were seconder data). Financial aspect was studied with present worth method or Capitalized Cost method. Even though the technical study of cooking <b>condition</b> <b>modification</b> was done by scoring the pulp’s characteristics (pulp yield data, kappa number data, alcaly consume data) that were produced. The scoring based on the tropical wood quality class in forestry vademecum (1976). The scoring result would be showed as the total point. The result of financial and technical study showed that biokraft process of P. Chrysosporium fungus with cooking time and energy reducing (M 2) was chosen as the alternative for replacing the kraft process with conventional cooking method (M 0). In financial aspect, M 2 had Capitalized Cost per Ton pulp smaller than M 0. The Capitalized Cost of M 2 was iii Rp. 54. 871. 962, 8 for each Ton of pulp, even though M 0 was Rp. 56. 603. 134, 67. This also was smaller than biokraft process with alcaly active reducing (M 1) and biokraft process with alcaly active, cooking time and energy reducing (M 3).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{key technology}} components {{required for the}} development of a self-powered, wireless, active acoustic liner system. The envisioned system consists of a tunable Helmholtz resonator for acoustic impedance boundary <b>condition</b> <b>modification</b> and an acoustic energy reclamation module as a system power supply. The common electroacoustic element for both of these components is an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator (EMHR) with the standard rigid backplate replaced by a compliant piezoelectric composite diaphragm. The acoustic impedance of the resonator is adjusted and additional degrees of freedom (DOF) added by coupling the EMHR to a passive electrical shunt network. Acoustic energy harvesting is achieved by connecting the EMHR to an energy reclamation circuit that converts the ac voltage signal across the piezoceramic to a conditioned dc signal. Experimental results for a non-optimized device in a normal incidence plane wave tube demonstrate ~ 9 % impedance tuning range for resistive and capacitive shunts. An inductive load results in a three-DOF system and an enhanced tuning range of over 20 %. Energy harvesting experiments yield 20 – 30 mW continuous power for an incident SPL of 151 dB. Such levels are sufficient to power a variety of low power electronic devices. 1...|$|E
