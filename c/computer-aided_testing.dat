40|$|The deflectometry {{provides}} a feasible way for surface testing {{with a high}} dynamic range, and the calibration is a key issue in the testing. A <b>computer-aided</b> <b>testing</b> method based on reverse Hartmann test, a fringe-illumination deflectometry, is proposed for high-accuracy testing of reflective surfaces. The virtual "null" testing of surface error is achieved based on ray tracing of the modeled test system. Due to the off-axis configuration in the test system, it places ultra-high requirement on the calibration of system geometry. The system modeling error can introduce significant residual systematic error in the testing results, especially {{in the cases of}} convex surface and small working distance. A calibration method based on the computer-aided reverse optimization with iterative ray tracing is proposed for the highaccuracy testing of reflective surface. Both the computer simulation and experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed measurement method, and good measurement accuracy has been achieved. The proposed method can achieve the measurement accuracy comparable to the interferometric method, even with the large system geometry calibration error, providing a feasible way to address the uncertainty on the calibration of system geometry.

40|$|The {{automated}} testing tools becoming a frequent practice require thorough <b>computer-aided</b> <b>testing</b> of large software systems, including system inter-component interfaces. To achieve a good coverage, one should overcome scalability problems of different methods of analysis. These problems arise from impossibility to analyze all the execution paths. The {{objective of this}} research is to build a method for inter-procedural analysis, which efficiency enables us to analyse large software systems (such as Android OS codebase as a whole) for a reasonable time (no more than 4 hours). This article reviews existing methods of software analysis to detect their potential defects. It focuses on the symbolic execution method since it is widely used both in static analysis of source code and in hybrid analysis of object files and intermediate representation (concolic testing). The method of symbolic execution involves separation of a set of input data values into equivalence classes while choosing an execution path. The paper also considers advantages of this method and its shortcomings. One of the main scalability problems is related to inter-procedural analysis. Analysis time grows rapidly if an inlining method is used for inter-procedural analysis. So this work proposes a summary-based analysis method to solve scalability problems. Clang Static Analyzer, an open source static analyzer (a part of the LLVM project), has been chosen as a target system. It allows us to compare performance of inlining and summary-based inter-procedural analysis.

40|$|The {{tests are}} an {{integral}} part of the wheeled vehicle design, manufacturing, and operation. The need for their conducting arises from the research and experimental activities to assess the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the vehicles in general, as well as the individual components and assemblies. It is obvious that a variety of design features of wheeled vehicles request a development of methods both for experimental studies and for creating the original bench equipment for these purposes. The main positive feature of bench tests of automotive engineering is a broad capability to control the combinations of traction loads, speed rates, and external input conditions. Here, the steady state conditions can be used for a long time, allowing all the necessary measurements to be made, including those with video and photo recording experiment. It is known that the benefits of test "M" type (using a roller dynamometer) include a wide range of test modes, which do not depend on the climatic conditions, as well as a capability to use a <b>computer-aided</b> <b>testing</b> programs. At the same time, it is known that the main drawback of bench tests of full-size vehicle is that the tire rolling conditions on the drum mismatch to the real road pavements, which are difficult to simulate on the drum surface. This problem can be solved owing to wheeled vehicle tests at the benches "Roller" to be, in efficiency, the most preferable research method.

40|$|Existing test compilers target stuck-at faults. Recent {{experimental}} evidence suggest targetting bridging faults (BF) because they model between 40 - 50 % of physical defects. For BFs, one suggestion {{has been to}} extract a small set of BFs using "layout analysis". We argue {{that this is not}} a feasible option for test compilers thereby making a case for "layout independent analysis" of BFs. Opting for "layout independent analysis" implies that <b>computer-aided</b> <b>test</b> tools target "all possible BFs". Targetting such a large number of faults is generally considered unreasonable.

40|$|Until now, {{a lot of}} <b>computer-aided</b> {{software}} <b>testing</b> tools {{have been}} developed. Most of them aim at the special support of several distinct test activities like test execution, monitoring, and test evaluation. Tools which cover {{a wider range of}} activities and test phases have the decisive shortcoming that there is no methodological support for the systematic design of test cases, particularly for the functional test. In summary, there is no sufficient overall support for all test activities. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the testing tool TESSY was developed. The most im-portant strength of TESSY is that it provides support for the whole testing life cycle, with the main emphasis on <b>computer-aided</b> <b>test</b> case determination, test data selection, expected results prediction, test execution, and test evaluation. Furthermore, there is powerful support for test organization and test documentation. An integral part of TESSY is the classification-tree edi-tor CTE, a graphical editor for the descriptive and systematic design of black-box test cases following the classification-tree method. Several other substantial components of TESSY are, for example, special window-based editors for the provision of essential environment informa-tion, for the graphical visualization of the test object’s interface {{as well as for the}} interactive input of test data and expected results. During test execution, several basic activities, such as test drivergeneration, coverage analysis, and regression testing, are performed automatically. For the test evaluation, different criteria can be defined for the comparison of actual and ex-pected results. Practical trials of the test system started in 1994. First promising results indicate that the test efficiency is enhanced significantly by using TESSY.

A mechanical “vibrating test bench”, which was developed by the aeronautical engineer Mr. Junkers, is being adapted, to suite the requirements of the automotive industry. It is designed according to DIN 65151 standards. The bolted connection is tightened to a specific torque to achieve the required preload forces and then exposed to an oscillating elastic shear force.

However, their widespread insertion in commercial products requires further improvements in their long-term reliability. Dielectric charging {{is one of the}} factors that impact switch reliability. Dielectric charging is understood to mean the accumulation of electric charge in the insulating dielectric layer between the two electrodes of the capacitive RF MEMS switch.
