5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is <b>called</b> <b>an</b> atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is <b>called</b> <b>an</b> ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function <b>called</b> <b>an</b> atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E

5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; you can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> doctor a physician, you got to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> doctor- too high falutin’. You can’t <b>call</b> <b>an</b> undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; you got to <b>call</b> him <b>an</b> undertaker. You can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> lawyer an attorney, you have to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can <b>call</b> <b>a</b> reporter a journalist." ...|$|R
5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or columns (or both) is <b>called</b> <b>an</b> infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, <b>called</b> <b>an</b> empty matrix.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity <b>called</b> <b>an</b> infundibulum and a central hollow cavity <b>called</b> <b>an</b> acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E

Making a plaster cast, <b>called</b> <b>an</b> endocast, of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about {{the shape of a}} Tarbosaurus brain. A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of Tarbosaurus brain structure and function.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is <b>called</b> <b>an</b> amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E

5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) <b>called</b> <b>an</b> envelope.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>called</b> <b>an</b> offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is <b>called</b> <b>an</b> archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
