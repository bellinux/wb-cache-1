5000|$|The {{process to}} {{generate}} text {{can be as}} simple as keeping a list of <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> that is copied and pasted, possibly linked with some glue text. The results may be satisfactory in simple domains such as horoscope machines or generators of personalised business letters. However, a sophisticated NLG system needs to include stages of planning and merging of information to enable the generation of text that looks natural and does not become repetitive. The typical stages of natural language generation, as proposed by Dale and Reiter, are: ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} SkillSum, a Natural Language Generation (NLG) {{system that}} generates a personalised feedback report {{for someone who}} has just completed a screening assessment of their basic literacy and numeracy skills. Because many SkillSum users have limited literacy, the generated reports must be easily comprehended by people with limited reading skills; this is the most novel aspect of SkillSum, and the focus of this paper. We used two approaches to maximise readability. First, for determining content and structure (document planning), we did not explicitly model readability, but rather followed a pragmatic approach of repeatedly revising content and structure following pilot experiments and interviews with domain experts. Second, for choosing linguistic expressions (microplanning), we attempted to formulate explicitly the choices that enhanced readability, using a constraints approach and preference rules; our constraints were based on corpus analysis and our preference rules were based on psycholinguistic findings. Evaluation of the SkillSum system was twofold: it compared the usefulness of NLG technology to that of <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> output, and it assessed the effectiveness of the readability model. Results showed that NLG was more effective than <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> at enhancing users' knowledge of their skills, and also suggested that the empirical 'revise based on experiments and interviews' approach made a substantial contribution to readability as well as our explicit psycholinguistically inspired models of readability choices...|$|E

40|$|Human {{produced}} route {{instructions are}} usually conveyed either verbally in spoken discourse or by written texts, or by graphical means, i. e. by illustrating the route in a map or by drawing sketch-maps, or by combining {{both kinds of}} external representations. Whereas verbal route instructions focus on the actions to be performed and take the spatial environment only as the frame for these actions, maps and other pictorial representations foreground the spatial environ-ment without possessing adequate means for representing the actions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current development {{status of a}} robot head with basic interactional abilities. On a theoretical level we propose {{an explanation for the}} lack of robustness implicit in the so-called social robots. The fact is that our social abilities are mainly unconscious to us. This lack of knowledge about the form of the solution to these abilities leads to a fragile behaviour. Therefore, the engineering point of view must be seriously taken into account, and not only insights taken from human disciplines like developmental psychology or ethology. Our robot, built upon this idea, does not have a definite task, except to interact with people. Its perceptual abilities include sound localization, omnidirectional vision, face detection, an attention module, memory and habituation. The robot has facial features that can display basic emotional expressions, and it can speak <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> through a TTS. The robot’s behavior is controlled by an action selection module, reflexes and a basic emotional module. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{first phase}} of the Intelligent Labelling Explorer project has built the ilex- 1. 1 system, which uses {{artificial}} intelligence technology to generate descriptions of objects displayed in a museum gallery. Each description appears on a World Wide Web page, and the user can move from page to page, viewing the objects in any order, mimicking the experience of someone walking through the museum. Crucially, these descriptions aren't simply retrieved from a storage space, but are generated on demand by combining <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> with fully generated text in a coherent way. This use of dynamic hypertext allows ilex- 1. 1 to generate descriptions appropriate to the expertise level of the user and to refer back to objects the user has already seen or to suggest objects the user might be interested in based on what objects they've chosen to look at so far. This paper discusses the advantages of dynamic hypertext and issues related to generating a text that hangs together well. Walking alone through [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, surface {{generation}} in dialogue systems has served {{the purpose of}} simply providing a backend {{to other areas of}} research. The generation component of such systems usually consists of templates and <b>canned</b> <b>text,</b> providing inflexible, unnatural output. To make matters worse, the resources are typically specific to the domain in question and not portable to new tasks. In contrast, domainindependent generation systems typically require large grammars, full lexicons, complex collocational information, and much more. Furthermore, these frameworks have primarily been applied to text applications and {{it is not clear that}} the same systems could perform well in a dialogue application. This paper explores the feasibility of adapting such systems to create a domain-independent generation component useful for dialogue systems. It utilizes the domain independent semantic form of The Rochester Interactive Planning System (TRIPS) with a domain independent stochastic {{surface generation}} module. We show that a written text language model can be used to predict dialogue utterances from an overgenerated word forest. We also present results from a human oriented evaluation in an emergency planning domain. ...|$|E
40|$|In Natural Language Generation (NLG), template-based surface {{realisation}} is {{an effective}} {{solution to the problem}} of producing surface strings from a given semantic representation, but many applications may not be able to provide the input knowledge in the required level of detail, which in turn may limit the use of the available NLG resources. However, if we know in advance what the most likely output sentences are (e. g., because a corpus on the relevant application domain happens to be available), then corpus knowledge may be used to quickly deploy a surface realisation engine for small-scale applications, for which it may be sufficient to select a sentence (in natural language) that resembles the desired output, and then modify some or all of its constituents accordingly. In other words, the application may simply 'point to ' an existing sentence in the corpus and specify only the changes that need to take place to obtain the desired surface string. In this paper we describe one such approach to surface realisation, in which we extract syntactically-structured templates from a target corpus, and use these templates to produce existing and modified versions of the target sentences by a combination of <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> and basic dependency-tree operations. 1...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{explanation}} capability of expert systems is usually listed {{as one of}} the distinguishing characteristics of these systems, {{the explanation}} facilities of most existing systems are quite primitive. Computer generated explanations are typically produced from <b>canned</b> <b>text</b> or by direct translation of the knowledge structures. Explanations produced in this manner bear little resemblance to those produced by humans for similar tasks. The focus of our research in explanation is the production of justifications for decisions by expert planning systems. An analysis of justifications written by people for planning tasks has been taken as the starting point. The purpose of this analysis is two-fold. First, analysis of the information content of the justifications will provide a basis for deciding what knowledge must be represented if human-like justifications are to be produced. Second, an analysis of the textual organization of the justifications will be used {{in the development of a}} mechanism for selecting and organizing the knowledge to be included in a computer-produced explanation. This paper describes a preliminary analysis done of justifications written by people for a planning task. It is clear that these justifications differ significantly from those that would be produced by an expert system by tracing the firing of production rules. The results from the text analysis have been used to develop an augmented phrase structured grammar (APSG) describing the organization of the justifications. The grammar was designed to provide a computationally feasible method for determining textual organization that will allow the necessary information to be communicated in a cohesive manner...|$|E
