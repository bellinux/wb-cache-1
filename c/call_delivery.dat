50|$|The Legacy PSAP Gateway is a {{functional}} {{element of the}} i3 Solution architecture that supports the interconnection of the i3 ESInet with legacy PSAPs. The Legacy PSAP Gateway is expected to provide interworking and other functionality necessary for emergency calls routed via an i3 Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) to be delivered to and handled by legacy PSAPs without requiring changes to legacy PSAP Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). Calls routed via an i3 ESInet and delivered to a legacy PSAP must undergo signaling interworking (i.e., at the Legacy PSAP Gateway) to convert the incoming IP-based (i.e., Session Initiation Protocol SIP) signaling supported by the ESInet to the traditional Multi-Frequency (MF) or Enhanced Multi-Frequency (E-MF) signaling supported by the legacy PSAP. Functionality must also be applied by the Legacy PSAP Gateway to emergency call originations to allow the legacy PSAP to experience <b>call</b> <b>delivery,</b> Automatic Location Identification (ALI) data retrieval, and feature activation {{the same way as}} they do today.|$|E

Public safety communications experts recognized that the nation's current 9-1-1 system was not capable of handling the text, data, images and video that are increasingly common in personal communications. The stated goal of a related USDOT project is: [...] "To enable the general public to make a 9-1-1 “call” (any real-time communication - voice, text, or video) from any wired, wireless, or IP-based device, and allow the emergency services community {{to take advantage of}} advanced <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> and other functions through new internetworking technologies based on open standards."

40|$|In {{next-generation}} wireless systems, one of {{the major}} features that is different from the current personal communication service systems is the seamless global roaming. The mobile subscribers will be allowed to move freely across different networks while maintaining their quality of service for a variety of applications. To meet this demand, the signaling protocol of mobility management must be designed, supporting location registration and <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> for roaming users who move beyond their home network. In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed, emphasizing the active location registration for ongoing services during the mobile subscribers ’ movement. Another important goal of this new protocol is to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management so that the signaling traffic load and consumption of network resources can be reduced. The new protocol efficiently reduces the latency of <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> and call loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards or signaling protocols. The numerical results reveal that the proposed protocol is effective in improving the overall system performance...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presenting}} a {{comparative study of}} existing location management scheme with its various variants in Personal Communication Services (PCS) network. The existing location management scheme is based on two tier database architecture; Home Location Register (HLR) and Visitor Location Register (VLR). In the existing location management scheme, {{there is a single}} HLR. In the HLR, profile of a Mobile Terminal (MT) is permanently stored. The VLR caches the profile of the MT from the HLR when it is providing the service to the mobile terminal. Mobile terminal, on move changes its location and comes under the Registration Area (RA) of new VLR. The MT profile should be removed from the VLR from where this MT is coming from and the HLR should have the information of current location of the MT. In the existing location management scheme this is done by the explicit deregistration scheme. In the existing <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> procedure of PCS network, the HLR is always consulted to get the current location of the MT. This <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> procedure supports an idea that is it necessary to inform the VLR that MT who was residing in its RA is now in the RA of another VLR? This paper has used other de-registration schemes as: Implicit deregistration, Polling de-registration, Timeout de-registration scheme and Group de-registration scheme in the variant of existing location management scheme. The single HLR architecture is prone to bottleneck and multi HLR architecture for PCS network is proposed for the efficient <b>call</b> <b>delivery.</b> Analysis done in this paper shows that we can significantly reduce the location management cost in the various variants of the existing location management schemes. This paper finally concludes that group de-registration scheme when implemented with the proposed multi HLR architecture gives better results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{current and}} latest schemes for location management in next generation wireless systems (3 G and 4 G). First, the hierarchical reference model of 3 G wireless systems is introduced. Then a dynamic inter-system location management technique is developed based on new concepts of boundary location area and boundary location register, which {{are suitable for}} inter-system roaming scenarios. Moreover, the corresponding mobility application part (MAP) protocol is designed for intersystem location registration and <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> procedures. The performance is evaluated in terms of signaling costs, latency of location registration and <b>call</b> <b>delivery,</b> as well as call losses due to the inter-system roaming. For the 4 G systems, a generic system model is introduced to incorporate the existing wireless local networks and cellular systems and so on. In particular, a new scheme for reducing costs in route optimization is introduced to solve the above problems. In this new scheme, route optimization is performed only when it minimizes the total cost function, which provides the optimal result {{from the viewpoint of}} link and signaling costs. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides the better performance. Keywords: L ocation Management, Location Update, Paging, Mobile IP, Routing. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{approach in}} this paper selects a fixed Visitor Location Register (VLR) as a Fixed Local Anchor (FLA) for each group of Registration Areas (RAs). During <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> process, the calling VLR/FLA caches are updated with the called Mobile Terminal’s (MT’s) location information and the called VLR and FLA caches are updated with the calling MT’s location information. Furthermore, the FLA and the old VLR caches are updated with MT’s new location information during inter-RA handoff {{as a part of}} informing this to the FLA of that region. But for another case, it updates the new FLA, old FLA, and old VLR caches with new location information together with directly informing this to the HLR. This location caching policy in local anchor strategy maximizes the probability of finding MTs’ location information in caches. As a result, it minimizes the total number of HLR access for finding MT’s location information prior to deliver a call. So, it significantly reduces the total location management cost in terms of location registration cost and <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> cost. The analytical and experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all other previous methods regardless of the MT’s calling and mobility pattern...|$|E

30|$|Two {{categories}} of routing schemes {{have been proposed}} for DTN. First one exploits the opportunistic contact, {{and the other one}} uses the source based routing. For both the approaches, decision to select next hop node is to be made. For opportunistic contact, a decision is to be made whether to forward or not to forward a message to an encountered node. Whereas, in case of source-based routing, a decision is to be made, to which neighbouring node the message should be forwarded. This decision depends upon a node’s capability (also <b>called</b> <b>delivery</b> probability) to deliver a message to destination. The routing schemes proposed in literature [4, 13] suggest various node attributes for determining its delivery probability.|$|R
