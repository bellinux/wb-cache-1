5|$|After seeing minor {{action in}} the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27, the 22nd {{remained}} in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond. The men of the 22nd <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> steeples of Richmond from their camp. By this time, the regiment {{had been reduced to}} roughly 750 men due to sickness {{over the course of the}} campaign and minor casualties in action.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site. This <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 degrees to the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments.|$|E

5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also {{had to find a way}} to co-mingle all the different ideas to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> performance from every angle.|$|E
5|$|From {{within the}} pocket, German {{formations}} seeking an escape route were filtering through {{gaps in the}} Allied lines between Trun and Chambois, heading towards the ridge from the west. The Poles <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> road from Chambois choked with troops and vehicles attempting to pass along the Dives valley. A number of columns moving down from the northeast that included tanks and self-propelled artillery were subjected to an hour-long bombardment from the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron, breaking them up and scattering their infantry.|$|E

During the period in which Hays led the GTR it saw its most prosperous era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the right}} {{rear of the}} French {{position}} was the substantial village of Plancenoit, and at the extreme right, the Bois de Paris wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> entire battlefield, but moved to a position near La Belle Alliance early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade.

5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, {{and for the next}} hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters at the head of Monash Valley, Maclagen <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E
60|$|He flung {{out of the}} house, and, side by {{side with}} the mate, fought his way down the beach toward the boat. They <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> boat.

5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 13 January 1798, Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay {{on the morning of}} 14 January, anchoring between Manila and Cavite. From his vantage point Cooke <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in Cavite, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and Montañés and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon, Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements from Romani, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Yorke, attacked the Ottoman {{force to the}} north of Katia, but were driven off. These five troops and a machine gun section of Gloucestershire Hussars moved out from Romani at 10:15 to intercept a column of 500 Ottoman soldiers retiring south-east from Dueidar. Shortly after leaving Romani, firing was heard from Katia, and from some high ground they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman artillery north of Er Rabah shelling the camp. When the Gloucestershire Hussars advanced towards the Ottoman artillery, it ceased fire, and fifteen minutes later was seen to withdraw some distance. The Gloucestershire Hussars pushed some Ottoman soldiers back to the high ground south of the Hod um Ugba, where Ottoman reinforcements stopped their advance. The strength of the Ottoman attacks made a gradual withdrawal necessary, but long halts were made to enable the wounded at Romani to retire also.|$|E
