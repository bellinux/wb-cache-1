50|$|The flatplane or flat-plane {{is a type}} of {{crankshaft}} for use in engines with a 180 Degree angle between <b>crank</b> <b>throws.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crossplane or cross-plane is a {{crankshaft}} design for piston engines with a 90° angle (phase in crank rotation) between the <b>crank</b> <b>throws.</b> The crossplane crankshaft {{is the most}} popular configuration used in V8 road cars.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Crank</b> <b>throw</b> {{orientation}} is up-left-right-down in this drawing {{in contrast to}} flatplane's up-down-down-up ...|$|R
50|$|The 2.5 L and 3.0 L engines {{share the}} same block, {{connecting}} rods and 93.66 mm bore, differing only in <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> and pistons, 3.0 L pistons have a length of 95mm and 2.5 L pistons have a length of 100 / 101mm.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{flat-twin}} engines with one crank pin shared by both connecting rods, thereby {{have only one}} <b>crank</b> <b>throw.</b> An experimental aircraft engine built before 1910 by Richard Pearse in New Zealand had both pistons and both connecting rods {{as part of a}} single rigid assembly that drove the crankpin through a sliding bearing contained within a crosshead.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] CB engine {{appeared}} in October 1977, for the then-new Daihatsu Charade. It features 120 degree <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> and a counter-rotating balance shaft. Bore and stroke are 76.0 mm and 73.0 mm respectively. It also incorporated mother concern Toyota's lean-burn design to run cleaner.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{two-stroke}} V4s {{have four}} <b>crank</b> <b>throws,</b> or crank pins, {{instead of the}} two that most four-stroke V4s have (two connecting rods sharing each pin). This is primarily because each piston needed its own sealed crankcase volume {{for the purposes of}} efficient induction, where in some cases separate crankshafts served each bank in order to achieve this.|$|E
50|$|So, an {{ordinary}} inline 4 cylinder engine with 180 degrees up-down-down-up <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> {{may look like}} cancelling the upward inertia created by the #1-#4 piston pair with the downward inertia of the #2-#3 pair and vice versa, {{but in fact the}} upward inertia is always stronger, and the vibration caused by this imbalance is traditionally called the Secondary Vibration.|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Fiat SOHC engine its massively over-square proportions. This over-square design allows large (within the constrains of a reverse-flow configuration) valve sizes relative to engine capacity. A secondary benefit is the short <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> reduces the accelerative forces on the con-rod allowing the engine to operate at significantly increased engine-speeds. The original engine's limit was only reached at 8000 rpm.|$|R
60|$|The settler {{represented}} the unflagging energy and fearless {{heart of the}} American pioneer. Narrow-minded, partly brutalized by hard labor and a lonely life, yet an admirable figure for all that. As {{he looked into the}} Indian's face he seemed to grow in height. He felt behind him all the weight of the millions of westward-moving settlers; he stood the representative of an unborn State. He took down a rifle from the wall--the magazine rifle, most modern of guns; he patted the stock, pulled the <b>crank,</b> <b>throwing</b> a shell into view.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of {{balancer}} shafts, the disadvantages include rotating plane imbalances on 1.rotating mass (crankshaft), 2.reciprocating mass (pistons and conrods), 3.torque generation and 4.compression, all of which generate rocking vibrations. [...] These imbalances can be countered to varying degrees with heavy counterweights on each <b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> so most crossplane V8s have very heavy crankshafts. Early Chrysler Hemi V8 had heavy counterweights, but the middle two positions {{on both sides of}} the center main bearing (the third of 5 mains) did not have any counterweight, as these positions are located close to the center of engine and deemed ineffective to counter rocking motions.|$|R
5000|$|... 7. Torsional balance - If the {{rigidity}} of <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> on {{an inline}} 4 cylinder engine is uniform, the crank throw farthest from the clutch surface (usually called cylinder #1) normally shows the biggest torsional deflection. It is usually {{impossible to make}} these deflections uniform across multiple cylinders except on a radial engine. See Torsional vibration ...|$|E
50|$|An even-firing six {{cylinder}} {{two-stroke engine}} requires ignitions at 60° intervals or else it would run with simultaneous ignitions and be no smoother than a triple in power delivery. As such, {{it also requires}} <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> at 60° - such designs {{appear to have been}} limited to Diesels such as the Detroit 71 series and some marine engines, as well as outboard motors.|$|E
50|$|Some {{variations}} of the opposed piston or OP designs use a single crankshaft. The Gobron-Brillié, and Doxford ship engines used a crankshaft {{at one end of}} the cylinders and a crosshead for the opposing piston. The <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> for each end were often unequal giving a shorter motion for the end having the higher reciprocating weight in order to help balance.|$|E
50|$|Another factor {{reducing}} {{the ability of}} the large six-cylinder engines to achieve high speed is the simple geometric reality of a relatively long stroke (undersquare) design. A straight-six is a long engine, and the designer is usually encouraged to make it as short as possible, while height is not usually a problem. Hence, the tendency to use a longer stroke and smaller bore than in a V engine to achieve a given capacity. By contrast, a long-stroke V engine tends to become too wide, which encourages increasing the bore rather than the stroke to increase displacement. The typically longer stroke of the straight-six increases <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> and piston speed, and so tends to reduce the rpm rating of the engine.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of engine}} has one or more rows of {{cylinders}} arranged around a centrally located crankcase. Each row generally has an odd number of cylinders to produce smooth operation. A radial engine has only one <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> per row and a relatively small crankcase, resulting in a favorable power-to-weight ratio. Because the cylinder arrangement exposes {{a large amount of}} the engine's heat-radiating surfaces to the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces, radials tend to cool evenly and run smoothly. The lower cylinders, which are under the crankcase, may collect oil when the engine has been stopped for an extended period. If this oil is not cleared from the cylinders prior to starting the engine, serious damage due to hydrostatic lock may occur.|$|R
50|$|Wankel engines can be {{classified}} by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (<b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3√3radius·offset·depth, multiplied {{with the number of}} rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.|$|R
5000|$|Note that typical 2-stroke V4s {{have four}} <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> or pins (see below) {{so it is}} {{important}} to stipulate all four crank pin phases with the two-stroke engines. The [...] "split" [...] in this case is referring to the difference in phase between piston pairs in [...] "opposite" [...] banks that would normally share a crank pin in a four-stroke engine.|$|E
5000|$|The pistons {{are usually}} {{mounted on the}} {{crankshaft}} so that opposing pistons {{move back and forth}} in opposite directions at the same time, somewhat like boxing competitors punching their gloves together before a fight, which has led to it being referred to as a [...] "boxer" [...] engine. The design is rarely seen with shared <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> (See Coventry Climax FWMW for such a non-boxer flat engine), so [...] "flat-four" [...] and [...] "boxer-four" [...] are usually used synonymously.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} layout {{was primarily}} chosen {{to reduce the}} impact of the inertial torsion inherent with <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> spaced 90° apart due to the pistons being accelerated (start-stop motion), given this engine was meant to be high revving and inertial forces scale as to the square of engine speed. The reduction in torsion was achieved by splitting the crank into two separate parts, geared together, from their respective midpoints, via a counter-shaft, from which power was delivered to the gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|The Commer TS3 3-cylinder truck engines (originally {{designed}} by Tilling-Stevens) {{have a single}} crankshaft beneath {{the centre of the}} cylinders with both pistons connected by levers. This type of engine configuration dates at least back as far as 1914, as a 2-stroke petrol engine referred to as the [...] "Simpson's balanced two-stroke" [...] was described in the Motor Cycle magazine of this date. This design used crankcase compression, and used one piston to uncover the transfer port, and another to open the exhaust port allowing the fresh charge to flow {{from one end of the}} cylinder to the other, thereby avoiding the need for deflector crowns for pistons used in most 2-strokes at that time. The levers operating the pistons allowed for a large piston travel with smaller <b>crank</b> <b>throw.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Undersquare {{engines are}} {{typically}} tuned to exhibit peak torque at lower RPM than an oversquare engine {{due to their}} longer <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> and high piston speed at high RPM. While the surface area of the cylinder in an undersquare engine may be {{higher than that of}} a square engine cylinder, heat exchange through the cylinder wall is lessened compared to heat exchange through the cylinder head and piston since the cylinder wall is not in constant contact with the expanding gasses. Since each unit of area of cylinder wall permits less heat loss to the engine than through the cylinder head or piston, undersquare engines generally exhibit improved thermal efficiency compared to oversquare engines. For these reasons, diesel truck engines which require low RPM torque and high thermal efficiency more than high power density most commonly adopt an undersquare engine geometry.|$|R
50|$|Wankel engines can be {{classified}} by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (<b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3√3radius·offset·depth, multiplied {{with the number of}} rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement, and is of course incorrect as there are three faces, equivalent to three piston faces, per rotor, i.e. equivalent to a three-cylinder radial piston motor per rotor). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.|$|R
50|$|Secondary {{imbalance}} {{is largely}} avoided because the crankshaft has six <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> arranged in three planes offset at 120°. The {{result is that}} the bulk of the secondary forces that are caused by the pistons' deviation from purely sinusoidal motion sum to zero. Specifically, the second-order (twice crank speed) and fourth-order inertial free forces (see engine balance article) sum to zero, but the sixth-order and up are non-zero. This is typically a tiny contribution in most applications, but may be significant with very large displacements, despite the usual and advantageous use of long connecting rods reducing the secondary (second-order and up) oscillation in the piston motion in those applications.|$|E
50|$|Inline five {{cylinder}} (L5) engine, with <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> at 72° {{phase shift}} to each other, {{is the common}} five cylinder configuration. Exceptions are Honda racing V5, and Volkswagen VR5 engine. These typical L5 engines have 13. Evenly spaced firing and perfect 3. Phase balance on reciprocating mass, with 4. Plane imbalance on reciprocating mass, 6. Plane imbalance on rotating mass, 14. Plane imbalance on torque generation, and 16. Plane imbalance on compression. Just like in inline 3 engines above, these first order rocking couples can be countered with heavy counterweights, and the secondary balance is comparable to, or better than an ordinary inline 6 {{because there are no}} piston pairs that move together.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{four-stroke}} cycle flat-fours {{have a problem}} common to all four-cylinder engines: the power strokes do not overlap. With a piston starting its power stroke every 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation, and the <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> 180 degrees apart, all the pistons finish their power stroke before the next piston starts its power stroke. This results in gaps between power strokes and a pulsating delivery of torque to the flywheel, causing a rotational vibration on the entire engine along the crankshaft axis. By contrast, in engines with more cylinders the power strokes overlap; the next piston starts its power stroke before the previous one has finished, and the delivery of power is much smoother.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small end}} {{attaches}} to the piston pin, gudgeon pin or wrist pin, which is currently most often press fit into the connecting rod but can swivel in the piston, a [...] "floating wrist pin" [...] design. The big end connects to the bearing journal on the <b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> in most engines running on replaceable bearing shells accessible via the connecting rod bolts which hold the bearing [...] "cap" [...] onto the big end. Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing and the big end of the connecting rod so that pressurized lubricating motor oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings. Most small two-stroke engines and some single cylinder four-stroke engines avoid {{the need for a}} pumped lubrication system by using a rolling-element bearing instead, however this requires the crankshaft to be pressed apart and then back together in order to replace a connecting rod.|$|R
5000|$|The trunk {{engine was}} largely {{replaced}} by the double piston-rod engine. [...] This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four piston rods were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to {{each side of the}} crank, as the <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> was wider than the vertical spacing of the piston rods. As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two piston rods would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double piston rods could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double piston rod engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.|$|R
30|$|Rychter et al. [14] {{evaluated}} {{the concept of}} varying rc to give different expansion and compression ratios {{by means of a}} theoretical simulation of a turbocharged diesel engine. They varied the ratio of connecting rod length to <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> to study the effect of rc on engine performance at a fixed load. The principal benefits, at 3 / 4 load and rc of 20, were a reduction in fuel consumption by about 2 % and a reduction in ignition delay that leads to an estimated 6 -dB reduction in combustion noise. Variable-stroke engine mechanism patented by Freudenstein and Maki [15] was used by Yamin and Dado [16] as it gives availability to change the stroke length and the corresponding rc in the range of 6.82 to 10. Their results showed a significant improvement in the engine's power and reduction in the fuel consumption, in addition to an increase in carbon monoxide and nitric oxides compared with the actual engine. Finally, they concluded that the engine performance can be optimized for a full range of driving conditions, such as acceleration, speed, and load. Such optimized performance was obtained by incorporating some means to suppress the increase in emission rate to be applicable in the automotive field due to the strict anti-pollution laws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{smooth running}} {{characteristics}} of the straight-eight made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past. However, the engine's length demanded {{the use of a}} long engine compartment, making the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles. Also, due to the length of the engine, torsional vibration in both crankshaft and camshaft can adversely affect reliability and performance at high speeds. In particular, a phenomenon referred to as [...] "crankshaft whip," [...] caused by the effects of centrifugal force on the <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> at high engine rpm, can cause physical contact between the connecting rods and crankcase walls, leading to the engine's destruction. As a result, the design has been displaced almost completely by the shorter V8 engine configuration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distance}} {{the axis of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>throws</b> from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston stroke measurement, and thus engine displacement. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine {{is to increase the}} stroke, sometimes known as [...] "shaft-stroking." [...] This also increases the reciprocating vibration, however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as [...] "over square" [...] or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the cylinder bore. As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.|$|E
50|$|Boxer engines tend to {{be better}} {{balanced}} than other four-cylinder configurations. The more common inline-four configuration suffers from a secondary balance problem caused {{by the fact that}} the pistons travel faster on the top half of the crank rotation than the bottom half, which causes the engine to vibrate up and down twice per crank rotation for a total of four times per crankshaft revolution for ordinary up-down-down-up <b>crank</b> <b>throws.</b> This problem becomes worse with increased piston speed and weight, effectively limiting the capacity of these engines. Inline-fours larger than 2.0 L usually have balance shafts whilst engines over 3.0 L are seldom used in passenger cars. In contrast, the flat-four has much less secondary imbalance at the expense of larger rocking vibrations, that cause it to rotate back and forth around a vertical axis. This is because the cylinders cannot be directly opposed, but must be offset so the connecting rods can be on separate crank pins, which results in the forces being slightly off-centre. The rocking vibration is usually not serious enough to require balance shafts.|$|E
5000|$|For in-line 4's {{there are}} 3 types of crankshaft. No counter weights, fully counter {{weighted}} (FCW) and semi-counter or half-counter weighted (SCW/HCW). Cranks without counter weights ("bent sticks") were used on in-line 4's {{up to the}} mid 1930s for auto-mobiles but are still {{to be found in}} agricultural use with attendant problems. Without counter weights an in-line 4 crank is balanced for primary forces, primary and secondary couples but not for secondary forces. Secondary force out balance can not be balanced on the crank, requiring 2 contra-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. These will only be fitted on premium quality cars that demand very smooth running or on large engines in excess of 2.4L where the level of secondary vibration becomes obtrusive. The primary couples bend the crank to a S shape with the deflection increasing with rpm. Without counter weights this deflection causes fatigue and main bearing failures when the deflection exceeds the bearing clearance resulting in rubs. These failures have resulted in a public perception that high rpm is bad for the engine that lingers to this day. FCW cranks have 2 counter weights on each <b>crank</b> <b>throw.</b> SCW <b>cranks</b> have one counter weight on each <b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> these are on each end of the crank and both sides of the centre main. The counter weights produce moment couples in the crank that counter the primary couple and pull the crank straighter to enable repeated and sustained high rpm with long fatigue and bearing life. The moment couple is proportional to mass x radius of centre of gravity x distance from pivot, the [...] "pivots" [...] being between 1-2 and 3-4. As they are close to the [...] "pivot", the counter weights adjacent to the pivots on a FCW crank only contribute about 1/4 to 1/3 of the moment. The counter weights balance each other completely for primary forces and couples and have no secondary forces/couple. Counter weights do not affect overall engine balance and vibration. There is no benefit in having FCW crank over SCW. The SCW crank is always lighter and allows more rapid engine and vehicle acceleration but may need a heavier flywheel. FCW cranks are used on engines to save space as the piston has to clear the counter weight at bottom dead centre, SCW although only 25-33% larger to obtain the required couple would make the engine taller and the crankcase wider. For automotive use the switch from SCW to FCW is typically around 1.8-2.2L engine capacity. There are a few [...] "hybrid" [...] cranks (Nissan Z22, LD20), these have large counter weights in the SCW position that are as big as the crankcase and piston clearance permits and small counterweights in the remaining positions to produce the required couple. This gives the lightest crank that the crankcase space permits.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for retrieving mathematical {{expressions of the}} mode shapes of a crankshaft based on numerical data yielded by a finite element model is presented and tested. The mode functions should be used as inputs to a finite-mode bond graph model of a crankshaft. The contents and results of two papers related to torsional vibration modelling and simulation were presented, and their relevancy to this work was briefly discussed. A relevant section from a book on bond graph modelling was also presented. This section described an approach called finite-mode bond graph modelling, in which a continuous dynamic system is reduced to a modal representation. In order for this approach to work, the mode shapes of the system must be orthogonal. A finite-mode IC-field bond graph representation of the crankshaft and crank mechanism were made using the Lagrange-Hamiltonian approach. However, this bond graph required {{the value of the}} mode shapes at the locations of torque input. These mode shapes were to be obtained from finite element models. Models of a simple shaft and a single <b>crank</b> <b>throw</b> were made in the finite element software Abaqus. To check that the models were made correctly and to gain some experience with the software, the inertia and stiffness parameters were also retrieved. They were found to match their analytical counterparts well. A frequency analysis was conducted in order to obtain the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. The modal displacements at different locations along the axial direction were exported into a spreadsheet and plotted. From these numerical values, a set three of equations were set up to obtain a mathematical expression for each mode shape. First a verification of the methodology was conducted on the simple shaft, as its analytical mode shapes and natural frequencies are well-known. The method worked well for this simple model. The resulting mathematical expressions for each mode shape were very close to the analytical form. For the single <b>crank</b> <b>throw,</b> the overall shape of the numerical mode shapes and their corresponding mathematical expressions matched well. However, there was a large spread between the displacement values. Moreover, the obtained mathematical mode shapes were non-orthogonal, which meant that they couldn't be used in the finite-mode bond graph model of the crankshaft. Another attempt was made at probing a different set of nodes from which the mathematical mode shape expressions could be obtained, but the resulting mode shape expressions still turned out to be non-orthogonal. It might be possible that the mathematical mode shape expressions could fit the numerical points better if more than three equations were used. However, the problem could also be {{the manner in which the}} numerical values are obtained from the finite element model. No simulations were run on the bond graph model. If a method is found to obtain orthogonal mode shapes for the crankshaft, the bond graph can get its required inputs. Simulations should then be run to verify its validity. The model could also be connected to existing models of a marine propulsion system...|$|R
500|$|When {{the lake}} first opened {{there were four}} Woolf {{compound}} rotative beam pumping engines, housed in two separate buildings.
