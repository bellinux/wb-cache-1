All editions included liner notes by author Bill Flanagan and previously unseen photographs by Anton Corbijn.

500|$|Edgeworth devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all {{schools of thought}} in economics. [...] While {{at the helm of}} The Economic Journal, he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers, [...] including Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, a noted skeptic of mathematical economics. [...] The articles focused on a back and forth over tax incidence and responses by producers. [...] Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied. [...] Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous. [...] Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation. [...] He suggested that the assumption of a <b>continuous</b> <b>demand</b> function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions. [...] Harold Hotelling later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a [...] "diminution of price {{as a result of the}} tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.|$|E
