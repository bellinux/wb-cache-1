500|$|The Chalice Well is a holy well at {{the foot}} of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron {{decoration}} made in 1919.

50|$|The Chalice Well is a holy well at {{the foot}} of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron {{decoration}} made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of 25000 imp gal per day and has never failed, even during drought.

6000|$|Spa, {{like most}} other places that possess <b>chalybeate</b> <b>waters,</b> stands in the centre {{of a country that}} can boast but little of its fertility. Still, time and {{cultivation}} have left it the character of pale verdure of which I have just spoken, and which serves for a time to please by its novelty. The hue looked neither withered nor sickly, but it was rather that of young grasses. It was a ghostly green. The eye wanders over a considerable extent of naked fields, when one is on the steep wooded hills, under whose very brows the village is built, and I scarcely can recall a spot where a stronger impression of interminable vastness is left, than I felt while gazing at the illimitable swells of land that stretch away towards France. The country is said to be in the mountains of the Ardennes, and once there was the forest through which the [...] "Boar of Ardennes" [...] was wont to roam; but of forest there is now none; and if there be a mountain, Spa must stand on its boundless summit. High and broken hills do certainly appear, but, as a whole, it is merely an upland region.|$|R
50|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Bailey Springs in 1854, and remained in operation {{until it was}} discontinued in 1901. The community was named for Jonathan Bailey, who started a resort on several mineral springs. The spring waters here have been classified as <b>chalybeate,</b> iron <b>water,</b> and alkaline-saline springs. A {{large number of people}} came from Memphis and surrounding areas for the purported healing qualities of the springs. At one point, the water at Bailey Springs was bottled and shipped around the United States. The springs were opened as a resort and hotel until 1910. A school for women, Bailey Springs University, was founded in 1893 on the resort grounds. It remained open until 1900.|$|R
500|$|Although [...] "difficult to grow under cultivation", The Royal Horticultural Society states Eriophorum angustifolium can be {{cultivated}} as a low-maintenance wildflower, {{suitable for}} meadows, ponds margins or bog gardens. This may {{be done in}} sheltered or exposed terrain, but best accomplished with full sun at a south- or west-facing aspect, in water up to [...] deep. Poorly-drained peat, sand, clay or loam with an acidic soil pH is required. Division in spring is the recommended form of propagation for the species, and regular deadheading is the recommended method of pruning. Narthecium ossifragum and Myrica gale are suitable for companion planting with E.angustifolium. Eriophorum angustifolium is [...] "generally pest free". As a seedling and young plant it is eaten by sheep and cattle, {{and a variety of}} goose species.

5000|$|Combe {{appears to}} have taken an early {{interest}} in diseases of the blood, presenting a case of anaemia to the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1822. In 1824 he published this in detail in a paper entitled History of a Case of Anaemia. Combe modestly starts {{with the statement that}} the case had already been presented by [...] "my distinguished preceptor and friend Dr Kellie". He goes on to credit continental writers with earlier descriptions of the condition. Combe then describes a patient with the typical features of a severe anaemia. Despite various treatments including iron, <b>chalybeate</b> (iron-containing) spa <b>water</b> and a nourishing diet, the patient died. At the autopsy, where he was assisted by Kellie, he found the stomach was [...] "thin, showing no vessels and transparent", a description of atrophic gastritis, which is a distinctive feature of pernicious anaemia, and preceded Dr Thomas Addison’s admittedly fuller account by 27 years. Although the condition bears Addison's name, Coombe's was the first accurate description and the first to link it to atrophic gastritis.|$|R
