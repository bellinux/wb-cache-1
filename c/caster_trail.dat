5000|$|The {{scientific}} and popular literature continued {{to report that}} positive trail, also called <b>caster</b> <b>trail,</b> was necessary for stability, although not always making {{a clear distinction between}} self-stability and controllability. The researchers who developed the two-mass skate bicycle focused solely on self-stability, although they do mention that [...] "rider-controlled stability of bicycles is indeed related to their self-stability." ...|$|E
40|$|As {{long as a}} tire steers about a titled kingpin pivot, {{the point}} coming {{in contact with the}} road moves along its perimeter. This {{movement}} affects the determination of kingpin moments caused by the tire forces, especially for large steering angles. The movement, however, has been neglected in the literature on the steerable-tire-kinematics-related topics. In this investigation, the homogeneous transformation is employed to develop a kinematic model of a steering tire in which the instantaneous ground-contact point on the tire is considered. The moments about the kingpin axis caused by tire forces are then computed based on the kinematics. A four-wheel-car model is constructed for determining the kingpin moment of steering system during the low-speed cornering maneuver. The result shows that the displacement of the ground-contact point along the tire perimeter is significant for large steering angles. It also indicates that, at the low-speed cornering, the moment about the kingpin axis caused by vertical forces benefits self-centering while those caused by longitudinal forces, lateral forces, and &# 039;aligning&# 039; torques facilitate the turn. A parameter study is also conducted to visualize the effects of wheel alignment parameters on the kingpin moment. It appears that an increase in kingpin offset or a decrease in caster angle affects the kingpin moment such that it supports the self-centering. The effects of kingpin inclination and <b>caster</b> <b>trail</b> on the moment, however, depend on the amplitude of steering angle. The result is compared to those derived from a multi-body model for validation...|$|E
2500|$|Like its predecessor, it had {{the engine}} mounted {{directly}} in front of the leading edge of the wing and the main undercarriage was also like that of the Type VIII, with the wheels [...] mounted in <b>castering</b> <b>trailing</b> arms which could slide up and down steel tubes, the movement being sprung by bungee cords. This simple and ingenious design allowed crosswind landings with less risk of damage. A sprung tailwheel was fitted to the rear fuselage in front of the tailplane, with a similar castering arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 October Blériot began taxying trials at Issy-les-Moulineaux. The {{aircraft}} {{was difficult to}} control on the ground, and the tests ended when the undercarriage collapsed. Bleriot addressed this issue by redesigning the undercarriage, {{coming up with the}} arrangement that was used on nearly all of his subsequent aircraft designs. Each wheel was mounted on a <b>castering</b> <b>trailing</b> arm which was free to slide up and down along the round cross-section vertical members of a fixed, four-sided [...] "bedstead" [...] frame, the movement being sprung by bungee cords. [...] The {{aircraft was}} first flown on 16 November, when Blériot made a flight of around 500 m, and further flights were made during November. At the end of November further modifictions were made: the wing was moved from its position immediately above the lower longerons to a position about two thirds of the way up the fuselage, and a tubular steel cabane structure was added to take the wing's bracing wires. In this configuration the aircraft was flown by Blériot on 6 December. On this occasion he succeeded in making a U-turn in the air, and the performance of the aircraft was impressive enough for Patrick Alexander to write [...] "I think Blériot is now leading the way". [...] However, the next flight trials, on 18 December, ended with a crash: the left wheel collapsed, causing the wing to dig in and the aircraft to turn over, resulting in its destruction. Blériot escaped without serious injury, his life possibly saved by the cabane structure, which acted as a roll bar.|$|R
50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in an inverted ball up position where objects are quickly moved across an array of units, known as a ball transfer table, a type of conveyor system. This permits manual transfer to and from machines and between different sections of another conveyor system. They are used in airports for luggage delivery, or in industry as part of manufacturing systems. Prior to {{the invention of the}} ball transfer unit, first patented by Autoset Production Ltd in 1958, these applications were solved by the use of inverted casters. However, <b>casters</b> recognise a <b>trail,</b> meaning that the wheels had to align before directional change could be achieved.|$|R
40|$|Nathan Cooper is an 8 -year old {{boy with}} Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA has {{affected}} Nathan’s muscle development and requires {{him to use}} the Standing Dani™ mobility device. The Standing Dani is a motorized standing wheelchair, or Wheelstand. Nathan controls and uses it to get around. Though the Standing Dani performs well for most functions, it has some distinct issues. The primary issue that this project addresses is its lack of suspension and the discomfort that Nathan feels as a result. After talking with our client, we developed several specifications generally related to geometry, safety, vehicle dynamics, and reliability. Many possible suspension solutions were developed using three methods of idea generation. A rear trailing arm suspension paired with pneumatic casters in the front {{was chosen as the}} final concept. From this concept, we designed a system that was made up of four basic components: front <b>casters,</b> frame, <b>trailing</b> arm linkages, and a spring-shock assembly. The final design is supported with hand calculations involving the static system and a dynamic analysis of the suspension behavior using MATLAB®. The manufacturing and testing portions of the final design were completed in the final three months of the project. We are confident that the design that has been developed will suit the needs of Nathan and make his daily activities all the more enjoyable...|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} axis (the red dotted {{line in the}} diagram above) {{does not have to}} pass through the centre of the wheel, so the caster can be set independently of the mechanical trail, which is the distance between where the {{steering axis}} hits the ground, in side view, and the point directly below the axle. The interaction between <b>caster</b> angle and <b>trail</b> is complex, but roughly speaking they both aid steering, caster tends to add damping, while trail adds 'feel', and returnability. In the extreme case, such as the caster wheel on a shopping trolley, the system is undamped but stable, as the wheel oscillates around the 'correct' path. The shopping trolley/cart setup {{has a great deal of}} trail, but (somewhat confusingly) no caster. Complicating this still further is that the [...] forces at the tyre do not act at the centre of the contact patch, but at a distance behind the nominal contact patch. This distance is called the pneumatic trail and varies with speed, load, steer angle, surface, tyre type, tyre pressure and time. A good starting point for this is 30 mm behind the nominal contact patch.|$|R
