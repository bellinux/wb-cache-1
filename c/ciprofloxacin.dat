5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of <b>ciprofloxacin.</b> It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of <b>ciprofloxacin</b> against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{detected}} compounds are polyols {{and have}} an antifungal and antibacterial effect, especially in connection with Gram-positive bacteria. H.olivaceoalbus is therefore {{an important source of}} antibiotics, especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are resistant against contemporary antibiotics such as methicillin, <b>ciprofloxacin</b> or vancomycin. The fungus has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known for its curing components, such as 4-, 6- or 4,5,6-tri-O-acetyl hygrophorones B14.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although <b>ciprofloxacin</b> {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone <b>ciprofloxacin</b> is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of CYP1A2 and clozapine {{is a major}} CYP1A2 substrate. Randomized {{study reported}} elevation in clozapine concentration in schizophrenia subjects concurrently taking <b>ciprofloxacin.</b> Thus, the prescribing information for clozapine recommends “reducing the dose of clozapine by one-third of original dose” when <b>ciprofloxacin</b> and other CYP1A2 inhibitors are added to therapy, but once <b>ciprofloxacin</b> is removed from therapy, it is recommended to return clozapine to original dose.|$|E
25|$|A major broad-spectrum {{fluoroquinolone}} used {{in humans}} is <b>ciprofloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Quinolone antibiotics: <b>Ciprofloxacin</b> (Cipro) {{was shown}} to {{significantly}} lower viral loads but no data on survival and graft loss exist.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} is rarely used. Frequently prescribed drugs are Avelox (moxifloxacin), Cipro (<b>ciprofloxacin),</b> Levaquin (levofloxacin), and, to some extent, their generic equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics improve {{outcomes}} {{in those who}} are both severely and not severely dehydrated. Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or <b>ciprofloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones have varying {{specificity}} for cytochrome P450, and so {{may have}} interactions with drugs cleared by those enzymes; the order from most P450-inhibitory to least, is enoxacin > <b>ciprofloxacin</b> > norfloxacin > ofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax {{vaccination}} {{is recommended}} {{for people who are}} at high risk. Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. Two months of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> after exposure can also prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{quinolone}} antibiotics {{in modern}} use are fluoroquinolones, which contain a fluorine atom in their chemical structure and are effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. One example is <b>ciprofloxacin</b> (Cipro), {{one of the}} most widely used antibiotics worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotics}} Metronidazole and <b>ciprofloxacin</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} Crohn's disease with colonic or perianal involvement, although this usage has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They are also used to treat complications, including abscesses and other infections.|$|E
25|$|If higher-than-recommended {{doses of}} garlic are taken with {{anticoagulant}} medications, this {{can lead to}} a higher risk of bleeding. Garlic may interact with warfarin, antiplatelets, saquinavir, antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, the quinolone family of antibiotics such as <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> and hypoglycemic drugs, as well as other medications.|$|E
25|$|Several {{classes of}} {{antibiotics}} {{are effective in}} treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone <b>ciprofloxacin.</b> Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1–15%, compared to a mortality of 40–60% in untreated cases.|$|E
25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).|$|E
25|$|FQs {{prolong the}} QT {{interval}} by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval {{can lead to}} torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon {{in part because the}} most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (<b>ciprofloxacin</b> and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, {{which probably}} comes from eating infected fish, {{poses a threat}} to belugas kept in captivity, causing anorexia and dermal plaques and lesions that can lead to septicemia. This condition can cause death if it is not diagnosed and treated in time with antibiotics such as <b>ciprofloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline is {{typically}} used first line, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics {{proven to be}} effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones, such as <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> also may be used, but resistance has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> {{levofloxacin}} {{does not}} appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics by mouth such as <b>ciprofloxacin</b> or {{azithromycin}} {{are given}} to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection. The aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. tobramycin) used can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney failure with long-term use. To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is metabolized by the {{cytochrome}} P450 system; principally by isozyme 1A2 and to {{a lesser}} extent by 2D6. By these mechanisms more than 40% of the oral dose, on average, is removed by the hepatic first-pass effect. Drugs or agents that increase the activity of CYP1A2, notably tobacco smoke, may significantly increase hepatic first-pass clearance of Olanzapine; conversely, drugs which inhibit 1A2 activity (examples: <b>Ciprofloxacin,</b> Fluvoxamine) may reduce Olanzapine clearance.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as <b>ciprofloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{quinolones}} exert an {{inhibitory effect}} on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>ciprofloxacin</b> and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), <b>ciprofloxacin</b> (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones are not {{licensed}} by the FDA for use in children due {{to the risk of}} fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. <b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine is {{extensively}} metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites {{suitable for}} elimination {{in the urine}} and feces. The major metabolite, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well. Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.|$|E
25|$|Consuming food {{prior to}} taking {{chlorpromazine}} orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Alcohol can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption. Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure. Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like <b>ciprofloxacin,</b> fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anaesthetics and hence increase {{the potential for}} adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.|$|E
25|$|Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone {{secretion}} (SIADH) in turn can {{be caused}} by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including <b>ciprofloxacin</b> and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{synthesized}} organofluorines {{have been}} found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a plant defence against herbivores in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde. Adenosyl-fluoride synthase is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond. Man made carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals because it adds stability to the carbon framework; also, the relatively small size of fluorine is convenient as fluorine acts as an approximate bioisostere of the hydroxyl group. Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using organofluorine chemistry, as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten. An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 3040% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), <b>ciprofloxacin</b> (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV <b>ciprofloxacin</b> and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include <b>ciprofloxacin</b> and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: fludrocortisone is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E
