50|$|The East-West Schism was {{the event}} that divided Chalcedonian Christianity into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Though {{normally}} dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually {{the result of an}} extended period of estrangement between the two Churches. The primary causes of the Schism were disputes over papal authority - the pope claimed he held authority over the four Eastern Greek-speaking patriarchs, and over the insertion of the filioque clause into the Nicene Creed by the Western Church. Eastern Orthodox today claim that the primacy of the Patriarch of Rome was only honorary, and that he has authority only over his own diocese and does not have the authority to change the decisions of Ecumenical Councils.

These <b>conflicting</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> legitimacy entailed a conceptual battle concerned with the construction and authorisation of political order.
