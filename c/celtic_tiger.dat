This period of growth {{became known as the}} <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger.</b> The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in {{the world in terms of}} GDP per capita.|$|E

It then jumps back in time as Tristram tells his story. In a review, Stevie Davies of The Guardian comments that while it does not show {{the effects of the}} economy's collapse on ordinary people, it is still [...] "powerful and poignant." [...] It has received praise from The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and The Independent, among other sources.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> {{started in}} the mid-1990s and boomed until 2001, when it slowed down, only to pick up again in 2003. It slowed again in 2007 and in June 2008 the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) {{predicted}} that Ireland would go into recession briefly before growth would resume.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment {{fell from}} 10% to 4.4%. Real GDP growth fell steadily, however, {{from a peak}} of over 11% in 1997 when McCreevy took office to just over 4% in 2004.

40|$|Whether or not {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) is essential for domestic technological and economic development remains a contentious question. The controversy is illustrated by comparing the <b>Celtic</b> and Asian <b>Tigers</b> experiences from 1995 to 2000. Based on IMF and World Bank data in constant prices, Ireland and China averaged an annual growth rate of 8 % in GDP per capita. However, FDI per capita grew at an average pace of 98 % per year in Ireland, while in China it decreased by 1 % [...] absolute values averaged US$ 3, 397 versus US$ 144, respectively. This suggests that, rather than a one-policy-fits-all approach, customized policies are more appropriate; and, if any generalization can be made, it {{should be based on}} a country’s stage of economic development...|$|R
25|$|Motorways link Dublin {{with all}} the major cities {{in the country and}} there are plans to extend the {{motorway}} system in the future. In recent years the quality of Irish roads has improved dramatically {{with the advent of the}} <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> and significant European Union funding, although outside the main routes, roads can be quite unpredictable in terms of quality and upkeep, especially in rural areas such as Co. Kerry and Co. Donegal.|$|E
25|$|Immigration to {{the town}} and {{surrounding}} areas began in the 1970s - in particular from the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. Immigration from these countries is still going on, including {{by people who are}} attracted to the relaxed pace of life in West Cork. Into the 2000s, immigration to Dunmanway took on a greater pace as the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> economy began to take hold. Today in Dunmanway there are Polish, Latvians and British inhabitants. In addition to these there are small groups of Czechs, Hungarians, Estonians, Germans, Austrian, Dutch and Chinese.|$|E
25|$|The post-2008 Irish {{economic}} downturn, {{coincided with}} a series of banking scandals, followed the 1990s and 2000s <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> period of rapid real economic growth fuelled by foreign direct investment, a subsequent property bubble which rendered the real economy uncompetitive, and an expansion in bank lending in the early 2000s. An initial slowdown in economic growth amid the international financial crisis of 2007–08 greatly intensified in late 2008 and the country fell into recession {{for the first time since}} the 1980s. Emigration, as did unemployment (particularly in the construction sector), escalated to levels not seen since that decade.|$|E
25|$|Although the Progressive Democrats {{never again}} {{won more than}} 10 seats in the Dáil, they formed {{coalition}} governments with Fianna Fáil during the 26th Dáil (1989–92), the 28th Dáil (1997–2002), the 29th Dáil (2002–07) and the 30th Dail (2007–09). These successive years as the government's junior coalition partner gave the party an influence on Irish politics and economics disproportionate to its small size. In particular, the party has been credited with shaping the low-tax, pro-business environment that contributed to Ireland's <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> economic boom during the 1990s and 2000s, as well as blamed for contributing to the subsequent Irish financial and economic crisis.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the country {{experienced}} unprecedented economic growth fuelled by a dramatic rise in consumer spending, construction and investment, which {{became known as the}} <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> period. The pace of growth slowed during 2007 and led to the burst of a major property bubble which had developed over time. The dramatic fall in property prices highlighted the over-exposure of the economy to construction and contributed to the Irish banking crisis. Ireland officially entered a recession in 2008 following consecutive months of economic contraction. GNP contracted by 11.3% in 2009 alone, the largest annual decline in GNP since 1950.|$|E
25|$|The Dublin {{region is}} the {{economic}} centre of Ireland, {{and was at}} the forefront of the country's economic expansion during the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by purchasing power and 10th richest by personal income. According to Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the European Union (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010). , approximately 800,000 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area, of whom around 600,000 were employed in the services sector and 200,000 in the industrial sector.|$|E
25|$|Most (47%) of {{the people}} {{employed}} in Galway work in either the commerce or professional sector, {{with a large number}} (17%) also employed in manufacturing. Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Soon Apple plans to build a massive data centre in Athenry outside Galway City. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over €400million.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{crisis of the}} late 1970s was fuelled by the Fianna Fáil government's budget, {{the abolition of the}} car tax, excessive borrowing, and global economic instability including the 1979 oil crisis. There were significant policy changes from 1989 onwards, with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> period, which lasted until the global Financial crisis of 2007–08. However, since 2014, Ireland has experienced strong economic growth.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Fianna Fáil governments {{attempted}} to create Irish domestic industries using subsidies and protective tariffs. In the late 1950s, these policies were dropped {{in favour of}} free trade with selected countries and encouraging of foreign investment with low taxes. This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1973. In the 1990s and 2000s, Ireland experienced an economic boom known as the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger,</b> in which the country's GDP surpassed many of its European neighbours. Immigration also surpassed emigration, bringing the state's population up to over 4 million. However, since 2008, Ireland has experienced a severe crisis in the banking sector and with sovereign debt. The resultant economic slump has deepened {{the effect of the}} world recession on Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{services}} have also become {{important to the}} city since the establishment of Dublin's International Financial Services Centre in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies. Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as Citibank and Commerzbank. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ), Internet Neutral Exchange (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. The <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the Dublin Docklands and Spencer Dock. Completed projects include the Convention Centre, the 3Arena, and the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the Republic of Ireland {{expanded}} rapidly during the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> years (1995–2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). At {{the end of the}} third quarter of 2010, German banks had between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. This led to an expansion of credit and a property bubble which petered out in 2007. Irish banks, already over-exposed to the Irish property market, came under severe pressure in September 2008 due to the global financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At {{the end of the}} 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845–1852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger).</b>|$|E

She portrayed Claire, a paralysed woman who wants to die, in the West End drama revival of Whose Life Is It Anyway?. In October 2006, {{she appeared}} in a West End production of David Mamet's The Cryptogram at the Donmar Warehouse in London. Since late 2005, she has appeared {{in a number of}} British television commercials for Tetley Tea. In July 2006, a commercial for Nissan cars, which featured Cattrall as Samantha Jones, was withdrawn from New Zealand television, apparently because of complaints about its innuendo. In 2006, she starred alongside Brendan Gleeson in John Boorman's 2006 film The Tiger's Tail, a black comedy that focuses on the impact of the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> economy on Irish people. On ITV, she starred alongside David Haig, Daniel Radcliffe and Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, the story of author Rudyard Kipling's search for his son lost in the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{ranks among}} the top twenty-five wealthiest {{countries}} in {{the world in terms of}} GDP per capita, and as the tenth most prosperous country in the world according to The Legatum Prosperity Index 2015. After joining the EEC, Ireland enacted a series of liberal economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country achieved considerable prosperity between the years of 1995 and 2007, which became known as the <b>Celtic</b> <b>Tiger</b> period. This was halted by an unprecedented financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent global economic crash. However, as the Irish economy was the fastest growing in the EU in 2015, Ireland is again quickly ascending league tables comparing wealth and prosperity internationally. For example, in 2015, Ireland was ranked as the joint sixth (with Germany) most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index. It also performs well in several national performance metrics, including freedom of the press, economic freedom and civil liberties. Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD. The Irish government has followed a policy of military neutrality through non-alignment since immediately prior to World War II and the country is consequently not a member of NATO, although it is a member of Partnership for Peace.|$|E
