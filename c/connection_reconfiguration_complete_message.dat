3000|$|Once the RN has {{achieved}} L 1 /L 2 synchronization with the target eNB (and {{in the second}} case, in addition to this, also when all the UEs have resynchronized with the RN), the RN sends a handover confirmation <b>message</b> (RRC <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>complete)</b> to the new donor eNB. This confirmation is a composite message that includes information about each UE that is being served through the RN. The new donor eNB then sends out a path switch request to the Mobility Management Entity (MME), which initiates a user plane update request to the serving gateway. User plane update is then performed by the serving gateway for each UE indicated in the composite handover confirmation message. A user plane update basically switches the downlink data path to the target eNB. The serving gateway then sends [...] "end marker" [...] packets to the source eNB, {{to indicate that the}} old path {{is not going to be}} used anymore for the concerned UEs. After the route update is performed, packets destined to the UEs served by the RN will be properly routed via the new donor eNB.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Look-ahead dynamic inter-processor <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> is a multi-processor {{architectural}} model, {{which has}} been proposed to eliminate <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> time overheads. It consists in preparing link connections in advance in parallel with program execution. An application program is partitioned into sections, which are executed using redundant communication resources. Parallel program scheduling in such a kind of environment incorporates graph partitioning problem. The paper presents a scheduling algorithm for look-ahead reconfigurable multi-processor systems. It is based on list scheduling and utilizes a fast section clustering heuristic for graph partitioning. The experimental results are compared with results of a genetic graph partitioning algorithm. ...|$|R

PSE {{is defined as}} the ratio of radio-off time. SignalDRX {{is defined as the}} rate of signaling messages (RRC <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration)</b> for configuring DRX parameters. SignalCQI is defined as the rate of signaling messages for sending CQI reports.|$|R

The source eNB then sends a handover command to the RN (RRC <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> including mobility control information), and from then on, the data destined to the RN is forwarded to the target eNB until the handover process is finalized.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to use a}} novel network {{architecture}} of multiple optical burst rings to improve the interpod communications of the internal networks of data centers. In the proposed network architecture, bursty and fast-changing interpod traffic is handled by the electrical core switches, while the relatively stationary traffic is handled via optical burst rings. Compared to previously proposed hybrid optical/electrical switching schemes of using optical circuit switches, the proposed scheme offers high interpod transmission bandwidth, supports large number of pods, requires smaller <b>connection</b> <b>reconfiguration</b> time, and has better bandwidth utilization. Moreover, the proposed scheme only employs relatively low-cost commercial optical components, making it more practical for near-term implementations.

50|$|Each GPS {{satellite}} continuously broadcasts a navigation {{message on}} L1 (C/A and P/Y) and L2 (P/Y) frequencies {{at a rate}} of 50 bits per second (see bitrate). Each <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to <b>complete.</b> The <b>message</b> structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are subcommutated 25 times each, so that a <b>complete</b> data <b>message</b> requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire almanac message (GPS). Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.|$|R
