40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} one decade {{there has been an}} increas-ing {{emphasis}} on driver-assistance systems for the automotive domain. In this paper we report our work on designing a camera-based surveillance system embedded in a “smart ” <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> Such a camera is used to monitor the ambient environment outside the car – e. g., the presence of obstacles such as approaching cars or cyclists who might collide with the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> if opened – and automatically control the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> operations. This is an enhancement to the currently available side-view mirrors which the driver/passenger checks before opening the <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> The focus of this paper is on fast and robust image processing algorithms specifically targeting such a smart <b>car</b> <b>door</b> system. The requirement is to quickly detect traffic objects of interest from gray-scale images captured by omnidirectional cameras. Whereas known algorithms for object extraction from the image processing literature rely on color information and are sensitive to shadows and illumination changes, our proposed algorithms are highly robust, can operate on gray-scale images (color images are not available in our setup) and output results in real-time. To illustrate these, we present a number of experimental results based on image sequences captured from real-life traffic scenarios. I...|$|R
25|$|Opening upwards, {{the doors}} evoke {{the image of}} a seagull's wings. In French they are portes {{papillon}} (butterfly doors). The papillon door, slightly different in its architecture from a gullwing door – designed by Jean Bugatti in 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300SL gullwing door – is a precursor, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design. Conventional <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> are typically hinged at the front-facing edge of the door and the door swings outward in a horizontal plane.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick {{itself is}} {{relatively}} flat and {{is ideal for}} cycling. Brunswick East is bounded by the Merri Creek Trail, and Brunswick West by the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, though neither of these {{can be described as}} flat. The Upfield Bike Path follows the Upfield railway line from Fawkner, through Coburg and Brunswick, joining the Capital City Trail at Park Street. Streets in Brunswick vary, from too narrow for two cars to pass, to reasonably wide. Not all of the wider streets have cycle lanes, though even riding in lanes in the narrower street often means riding close to parked cars, presenting a significant hazard to cyclists from opening <b>car</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
25|$|John Frye also {{describes}} how {{the format of the}} projects changed rapidly. Initially intended as two separate solo releases, they decided to merge their work and create a soundtrack album as André 3000 had initially intended. The duo then began preparing to work on a motion picture, but reconsidered and compromised by interpolating background noise into songs, such as the slamming of <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> and footsteps. They eventually settled on releasing a double album. Frye noted the end of the recording sessions as particularly stressful for André 3000, who he described as drained from working at four studios simultaneously. In total, an estimated 120 songs were recorded for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.|$|E
40|$|Serviceability is the {{capability}} to perform effective problem determination,diagnosis, and repair on a system or a product. The main problem of Kancil's <b>car</b> <b>door</b> is the service cost and time are less consideration due to its uneasy disassemble and complexity procedures to service a <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> Design for serviceability evaluation of <b>car</b> <b>door</b> is aim to search for shorter <b>car</b> <b>door</b> service cycles and lower cost {{has led to the}} emergence of DFA and DFS. Through this project, DFS is a tool that will allow estimating the times and the cost for the service tasks which carrying out on the products. DFA will be analysis the optimization design to ease for assembly. DFA and DFS is the practice whereby the design needs to simultaneously consider various dotnstrearn activities throughout the entire product service life cycle, in addition to meeting the products' functions. Furthermore, Pugh method is concerned with finding the optimal and evaluate redesign concepts and thus to meet the serviceability requirements. A <b>car</b> <b>door</b> redesign has been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme based on the easiest defect components on <b>car</b> <b>door.</b> The result shows that the service time of the current design, for instance door latch is 609. 90 s and after modification the service time reduces to 353. 70 s. While the service cost calculated with hourly labour rate before the modification is Rm 20. 85 and after modification is Rm 20. 49. Thus it can conclude that the proposed method can be applied on evaluating the product design at the early phase of the design...|$|R

25|$|In the Chinese {{province}} of Hebei, women's parking spaces {{have been established}} in shopping centers. These are wider and are clearly marked in different colors. This was made to ease parking for women, according to the representative of one shopping center. In the Wonder Mall in Hebei, one of three underground lots is designated for women. The spaces are between 3.2 and 3.3 meters wide, so that even when <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> are fully open, they do not touch neighboring cars, a measure intended {{to reduce the number}} of collisions. The Global Times daily newspaper, citing insurance company data, states that female drivers cause twice as many collisions in parking lots than in other places.|$|E

The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and should offer decent penetration performance on hard and combined targets like <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> or glass and body armour. The muzzle velocity V0 and V50 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.112 to 0.119 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2g Action projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.67 (586m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3).|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail <b>car</b> <b>doors</b> were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E
25|$|Starting in December 1959, {{the fully}} {{automatic}} train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train {{was equipped with}} a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the starting of the train, the acceleration, braking, and stopping of the train, {{as well as the}} opening and closing of the <b>car</b> <b>doors.</b> The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a punched tape. When operating at full speed, the train operated at 30 miles per hour, and the train slowed to 5.5 miles per hour when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the tripper arms would stay upright and the train's brakes would automatically be set.|$|E

A perceptual cartography of <b>car</b> <b>door</b> sounds is obtained from various listening tests aiming at revealing both ecological and analytical properties linked to evoked car quality. In the first test naïve listeners performed absolute evaluations of five ecological properties (i. e., solidity, quality, weight, closure energy, and success of closure). Then experts in the area of automobile doors categorized the sounds according to organic constituents (lock, joints, door panel), in particular whether or not the lock mechanism could be perceived. Further, a sensory panel of naïve listeners identified sensory descriptors such as classical descriptors or onomatopoeia that characterize the sounds, hereby providing an analytical description of the sounds. Finally, acoustic descriptors were calculated after decomposition of the signal into a lock and a closure component by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. A statistical relationship between the acoustic descriptors and the perceptual evaluations of the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> sounds could then be obtained through linear regression analysis...|$|R

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin auditioned fifteen drummers, of whom Chad Szeliga stood out for his ability as a stage performer {{and the fact that}} he had [...] "serious problem-solving skills", according to Burnley. The group's next album, Phobia, was again produced by Bendeth and was the first to be recorded with Szeliga. The concept of the album is dedicated to Burnley's various phobias. The cover of the album depicts a winged man suspended over a runway, which represents the singer's fear of flying. Burnley also suffers from death anxiety, a fear of the dark, driving anxiety, and hypochondriasis. Burnley cites his fear of flying as for why he did not perform overseas, saying, [...] "I'll go as far as a boat will take me", though at the time the band's record label had not facilitated travel by boat. Phobias [...] "Intro" [...] and [...] "Outro" [...] tracks feature sound effects of an airport intercom, airplane turbulance, <b>car</b> <b>doors,</b> and crowd panic.|$|E
500|$|Less melodic and hook-oriented than Nostalgia, Ultra, Channel Orange has soft melodies, gentle articulation, spatial arrangements, and mid-tempo drum beats, {{although}} the more ruminative songs feature slower tempos. Robert Christgau asserted that, without its predecessor's reliance on samples, [...] "Ocean resists making {{a show of}} himself—resists the dope hook, the smart tempo, the transcendent falsetto itself." [...] Ocean, a baritone, sings with casually expressive vocals, [...] flow, conversational crooning, and alternating falsetto and tenor registers. Similar to Nostalgia, Ultra, Channel Orange has interludes that feature sounds of organs, waves, tape decks, <b>car</b> <b>doors,</b> channel surfing, white noise, and dialogue. They exhibit an analog sound quality, and some end abruptly. Writers interpreted them to represent the limited attention span of listeners, moments in Ocean's life, the distortion inside his mind, nostalgic ephemera, or a synesthesia-inspired theme. Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine viewed that the segues, {{along with the other}} songs' disparate lengths, give the album the feel of a mixtape.|$|E
