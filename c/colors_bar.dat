50|$|The HMIS <b>Color</b> <b>Bar</b> {{is similar}} to the fire diamond, created by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Before 2002 the fire diamond and the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> both had {{sections}} colored blue, red, white, and yellow. After April 2002, with the release of HMIS III, yellow in the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> (which stood for reactivity) was replaced by orange, standing for physical hazard. The fire diamond is designed for emergencies when information about the effects of short, or acute, exposure is needed. The <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> is not for emergencies and is used to convey broader health warning information.|$|R

50|$|An {{extended}} version of SMPTE <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> signal, {{developed by the}} Japanese Association of Radio Industry and Businesses as ARIB STD-B28 and standardized as SMPTE RP 219:2002 (High-Definition, Standard-Definition Compatible <b>Color</b> <b>Bar</b> Signal) was introduced to test HDTV signal with an aspect ratio of 16:9 that can be down converted to a SDTV <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> signal with an aspect ratio of either 4:3 or 16:9. The <b>Color</b> <b>bar</b> signal is generated with unconventionally slow rise and fall time value to facilitate video level control and monitor color adjustments of HDTV and SDTV equipment. Digital test images generated following the SMPTE RP 219:2002 specifications and adapted to perfectly fit 114 standard and non-standard resolutions for both 16bpp and 8bpp, are freely available in the COLOR dataset of the TESTIMAGES archive.|$|R

50|$|When {{converting}} {{between the}} various HD and SD formats, it would be correct {{to compensate for the}} differences in the primaries (e.g. between the Rec. 709, EBU Tech 3213, and SMPTE C primaries). In practice, this conversion is rarely performed and such a conversion would create a liability for post production facilities as they would need to ensure that the <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on all the new masters are redone. Correcting for differences in the primaries would cause the resulting <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on the converted tape to be inaccurate. Incorrect <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> will cause a (sub)master to be rejected by quality control checks.|$|R

The 100% bars represent the maximum amplitude (of the composite signal) that composite encoding allows for. 100% bars are not suitable for broadcast and are not broadcast-safe. 75% bars have reduced amplitude and are broadcast-safe.|$|R

Required equipment consists of an unmodified color TV receiver, a <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> synthesizer and a stop watch (a wrist watch or clock with sweep second hand may be used with reduced precision). Measurement precision of 1 x 10 to the minus 10 th power can be realized in measurement times of less than two minutes. If the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> synthesizer were commercially available, user cost should be less than $ 200. 00, exclusive of the TV receiver.
