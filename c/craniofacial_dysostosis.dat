40|$|A seven {{year old}} male patient was {{referred}} by his dentist to {{a specialist in}} dental prothetics with a diagnosis of oligodontia. Examination of the orthopantomogram showed germs of only eight teeth. No teeth {{were present in the}} oral cavity. The first permanent molars had been esctracted because of caries. From the case history and a clinical examination, it was established that the boy had <b>craniofacial</b> dysmorphosis/ <b>dysostosis</b> and hypertelorizm with lower positioned and poorly formed ears. He had diagnosis of thickening of the right ventriculus. Kariotype normal. Also presented adactyly of digits II and III manus et pedis, clinodactyly of digit I, and syndactyly of digits IV and V was surgically treated. By examining the oral cavity, angulus infectiosus oris was diagnosed caused by lowered vertical dimension of occlusion and candidiasis lingue, and consequently the boy was referred to an oral pathologist for appropriate therapy.

Thus, we were faced with several problems including how to find impression trays of adequate size, and how to explain to the patient the procedure of functional movements, achievement of rest position, and the artificial teeth selection. Because of the small and narrow dental arches we decided for the smallest size of artificial teeth (D 28) and reduced occlusion. The artificial teeth were modified and reduced. The second molar took the place of the first molar. With color and shape we tried to imitate deciduous teeth.

In this study, 8 patients (n = 3 females, n = 5 males) affected by <b>craniofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> (Crouzon, n = 5; Apert, n = 3; Pfeiffer syndrome, n = 1; and other, n = 1) were {{selected on the basis}} of age and radiologic documentation. The mean age at the time of the procedure was 8. 6 years, and all the patients had at least 1 year of follow-up after distraction. The radiologic documentation of each case was composed of posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms preoperatively (T 1), at the time of removal of the distractor device (T 2), and at follow-up (T 3). The average latency period before activation of the distractor was 5 days. The device was activated on an average of 15 mm (range, 7 - 22 mm) as recorded on the device at a rate of 1 mm/d. Activation period ranged from 7 to 15 days, and the consolidation period was 8 to 12 weeks. Seven anatomic landmarks and 5 cephalometric measurements were identified on the lateral cephalograms at each of the 3 time periods. The cephalograms underwent digital analysis via Dolphin imaging digitalization software by 2 operators independently. The displacement of each identified landmark was recorded and examined in relation to their position at each time point. Cephalometric analysis revealed stability of Le Fort III midface advancement during follow-up. However, bone growth after midface advancement is limited, and as reported in the literature, almost no spontaneous growth is present because of the intrinsic nature of malformations.

Although it is uncommon, it has a transmission risk of 50 % {{when one of the}} parents is a carrier. Objective: Performing a literature review about the Crouzon Syndrome, with emphasis on the current aspects. Method: As a methodology, a search on databases on-line, such as Cochrane, LILACS, MEDLINE, OMIM and SciELO has been made, by applying for the search the key-word Crouzon's Syndrome for articles published until 2007, in addition to the literature already dedicated to the subject. Literature Review: This syndrome is characterized by craniofacial anomalies caused by the early loss of the cranium flexibility, and present since the birth with tendency to aggravation in time. The main clinic signs are craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, exophthalmia, external strabismus, "parrot-beaked nose", short upper lip, hypoplastic maxilla and a relative mandibular prognathism determining a mid-facial hypoplasia aspect. It is a hereditary affection with an autosomal dominant transmission with 100 % of penetrance and large phenotypic scale. Final Considerations: The genetic advising and an individual study of each case are essential to promote the improvement of the diagnosis. An early multidisciplinary approach is necessary, with specific therapeutic program aiming at the prevention of late diagnosis effects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Goldenhar's {{syndrome}} is a polymalformative condition {{consisting of a}} <b>craniofacial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> that determines difficult airway in up to 40 % of cases. We described {{a case of a}} newborn with Goldenhar's syndrome with esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula who underwent repair surgery. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 24 -h-old newborn with Goldenhar's syndrome. He had esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula. It was decided that an emergency surgery would be performed for repairing it. It was carried out under sedation, intubation with fibrobronchoscope distal to the fistula, to limit the air flow into the esophagus, and possible abdominal distension. Following complete repair of the esophageal atresia and fistula ligation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated under sedation and analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a patient with Goldenhar's syndrome and esophageal atresia assumes an exceptional situation and a challenge for anesthesiologists, since the anesthetic management depends on the patient comorbidity, the type of tracheoesophageal fistula, the usual hospital practice and the skills of the anesthesiologist in charge, with the main peculiarity being maintenance of adequate pulmonary ventilation {{in the presence of a}} communication between the airway and the esophagus. Intubation with fibrobronchoscope distal to the fistula deals with the management of a probably difficult airway and limits the passage of air to the esophagus through the fistula. </sec...|$|E
40|$|Apert syndrome, or acrocephalosyndactyly type I, is a <b>craniofacial</b> <b>dysostosis,</b> an {{autosomal}} dominant condition characterized by severe developmental disturbances of the craniofacial region including bilateral coronal synostosis associated with midface hypoplasia, exophthalmia, hypertelorism, and symmetric syndactyly {{of the hands}} and feet. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the clinical and computed tomography imaging patterns of non-operated patients with Apert syndrome, correlating the bone abnormalities of the cranium, face and the skull base. The study population consisted of 5 patients with Apert syndrome. As part of the craniofacial assessment of the imaging center's routine, all patients underwent clinical evaluation and CT (computed tomograph) exam. Three-dimensional images were generated from helical CT scans, using an independent workstation, to evaluate the craniofacial abnormalities of the syndrome. Clinical exam determined that syndactyly of the hands and feet, pseudocleft in the midline palate and midface hypoplasia were features observed in all of the Apert patients. 3 D-CT showed that some abnormalities such as bilateral coronal synostosis, calvarial midline defect and reduction in the antero-posterior dimension of the anterior, medial and posterior cranial fossae were present in all cases. In conclusion, the correlation of clinical and CT imaging findings can be useful to assess the main features observed in Apert patients, improving the criteria for examining the patient and diagnosing this condition, and contributing to the therapeutic planning and surgical follow-up...|$|E
40|$|In 1999 transpalatal {{distraction}} (TPD) {{has been}} implemented for the correction of transverse maxillary deficiency (TMD) by M. Mommaerts. Since 2007, this method {{has been used}} in the Department of Craniomaxillofacial Surgery, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin for that purpose. Within this thesis work a retrospective analysis of all patients that have been treated by transpalatal distraction from 2007 until May 2015 in order to correct their transverse maxillary deficiency has been performed focusing on indications, limitations and drawbacks of bony anchored maxillary expansion devices. Currently {{there is a lack of}} evidence based data concerning that issue. In- and out patient records of these patients as well as further patient documentation (dental casts, pre- and postoperative X-rays, surgical reports and distraction protocols) have been evaluated for this analysis. Apart from descriptive statistics, orthodontic situations of the patients with subsequent surgical therapy as well as all parameters of distraction (type of device, latency phase, length of distraction, width of resulting dental diastema, consolidation phase) as well as side effects and complications were recorded. From January until May 2015 80 transpalatal distraction procedures have been performed in order to correct a present transverse maxillary deficiency (TMD). Retrospective evaluation showed a very heterogeneous group of patients impeding evidence based conclusions. 42 female and 38 male patients have been treated according to a standardized surgical procedure by the same surgical team including interdisciplinary preoperative assessment, surgeries as well as the postoperative follow-up of the patients until the distraction devices have been removed. Mean age was 25, 6 years, the youngest patient was 6 years of age when TPD was performed, the oldest patient was 51 years of age. Mean width of interdental diastema was 10, 6 mm, varying from 5 - 23 mm. In 77 patients the distraction device “Surgitec All in one” (9051 -Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium) was inserted. It´s 2, 5 module proved to be the most usable model and was used in 46 patients. In order to present the findings of the analysis properly four group of patients have been composed: Group 1 - patients without further orthognathic surgery after TPD (n= 14) Group 2 - patients undergoing further orthognathic surgery after TPD (n= 36) Group 3 - patients affected by complex craniofacial anomalies (cleft-lip-and palate, <b>craniofacial</b> <b>dysostosis)</b> (n= 19) Group 4 - pediatric patients before 16 years of age (n= 11) – in this group preceding orthodontic maxillary expansion had failed. 38 patients had a class III malocclusion, 21 patients had a class II malocclusion, 17 patients had no skeletal malocclusion, and in four patients, no classification was applicable. In 79 of 80 procedures, the preexisting TMD could be corrected according to the preoperative surgical planning. Only one failure was documented, minor side effects that occurred proved to be manageable. An evolution of the surgical technique allowing for the individual correction of the present TMD by transpalatal distraction could be documented. Based on the extensive photo documentation of all of the patients that received TPD, typical treatment series for each patient group were created in order to illustrate the versatility of the technique for the surgical correction of a present TMD according to the individual needs especially in challenging conditions...|$|E
