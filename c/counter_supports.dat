40|$|Since {{the first}} Code of Practice was {{published}} in 2003, the COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of Networked Electronic Resources) standard has facilitated the recording and reporting of online usage statistics in a consistent and comparable way. The standard, now in its fourth iteration, has developed over time {{in response to the}} changing e‐resource environment and to evolving user requirements. Engagement with relevant initiatives and input from vendors is critical to COUNTER’s ongoing evolution. Amongst these, COUNTER has worked with NISO on SUSHI (Standardized Usage Harvesting Initiative) to develop a protocol to facilitate the automated harvesting and consolidation of usage statistics from different vendors. Both COUNTER and SUSHI form the basis of tools to facilitate the gathering and analysis of usage data, and they help support provision of efficient and cost‐effective services. One such tool is the Jisc funded JUSP (Journal Usage Statistics Portal), which provides a single point of access to data, enabling libraries to quickly and easily compare usage across a range of publishers and years. Accurate and comparable, usage statistics support analysis and evaluation of e‐resources and help to demonstrate their value and impact. JUSP is an important tool that aims to support libraries in this context. This session will outline how <b>COUNTER</b> <b>supports</b> development of tools and services with global reach and impact. It will highlight challenges and opportunities that exist with regard to metrics in terms of developing, gathering, and analyzing data, and will offer some shareable models of good practice...|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} works {{it has been}} observed that a frequent item set mining algorithm are supposed to mine the closed ones as the finish results in a compact and a complete progress set and enhanced potency. However, the latest closed item set mining algorithms works with both candidate maintenance and check paradigm hand in hand, which proves to be friendlier in runtime, as in case of area usage when support threshold is a reduced entity or the item sets gets long. In this paper, we have shown, CEG&REP with CSM (<b>Counter</b> <b>Support</b> Measurement) that {{is supposed to be a}} more efficient approach which can be utilized for mining articulate association rules from closed sequences. This approach outfits a exclusive rule coherency checking format with CSM, further that is laid mostly on another approach termed as Sequence Graph protruding which is termed as “Concurrent Edge Prevision and Rear Edge Pruning”, hereby referred as CEG&REP. Moreover, we have pronounced a novel CSM methodology to crop rules which in turn seems to formulate articulate rules. The performance of CEG&REP with CSM (<b>Counter</b> <b>Support</b> Measurement) is tested on a whole observation having scrubby and dense real-life information, the tests have shown that approach of CEG&REP performs in a more efficient manner as compared to {{the previous}} versions as the CEG&REP approach takes less memory space and is swifter than the algorithms which were used in past works...|$|R
