40|$|Noise {{transmission}} through flat, angular, fiber-reinforced composite panels is investigated experimentally and analytically. A modal decomposition {{technique was}} used to obtain solutions to the governing differential equation of motion. Experimental modal analysis was performed in order to confirm the theoretical results. The test specimens were cross-ply and angle-ply composite panels made of various concentrations of fiberglass, graphite, <b>or</b> <b>aramid</b> fibers embedded in epoxy resion. The experimental results showed good agreement with the theoretical calculations. Graphs of the transmission loss characteristics of the different composite panels are provided...|$|R

These tires have a wire <b>or</b> <b>aramid</b> (Kevlar <b>or</b> Twaron) fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.|$|R

Traditional bulletproof vests made of polyethylene <b>or</b> <b>aramid</b> fiber-based fabrics give acceptable protection against lead-core pistol ammunition and fragments but they are insufficient for AP steel core penetration. In such case, the use of ceramic materials is essential. The article presents results of ballistic tests of composite material sets involving silicon carbide (SiC) and boron carbide (B 4 C) ceramics against 5. 7 × 28 and 4. 6 × 30 mm projectiles. Primary aspects of concealed bulletproof vest construction are also described...|$|R
