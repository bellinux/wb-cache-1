5|$|Although {{probably}} {{outnumbered by}} a substantial margin, Julian's army won a complete victory after a hard-fought struggle. With negligible <b>casualties</b> <b>of</b> their own, the Romans drove the Alamanni beyond the river Rhine, inflicting heavy losses.

5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} <b>casualties.</b> <b>Of</b> these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the <b>casualties</b> <b>of</b> the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E

Altogether five Horsas and three Halifaxes were lost, but twenty-seven Horsas arrived in Tunisia in time {{to participate in the}} invasion of Sicily.

5|$|For the German part, the High Seas Fleet {{determined}} not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port {{for much of the}} remainder of the war. Other theatres showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in November 1918 were <b>casualties</b> <b>of</b> Italian torpedo boats and frogmen.|$|E
