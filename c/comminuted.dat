25|$|Inuit {{actually}} {{consume more}} carbohydrates than most nutritionists have assumed. Because {{some of the}} meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can. The Inuit practice of preserving a whole seal or bird carcass under an intact whole skin with {{a thick layer of}} blubber also permits some proteins to ferment, or hydrolyze, into carbohydrates. Furthermore, the blubber, organs, muscle and skin of the marine mammals that Inuit eat have significant glycogen stores, which assist those animals when oxygen is depleted on prolonged dives. For instance, when blubber is analyzed by direct carbohydrate measurements, it has been shown to contain as much as 8—30% carbohydrates. While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal. Additionally, in cold conditions, glycogen's depletion is halted at -18°C (-0.4°F) and lower temperatures in <b>comminuted</b> meat.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} on comminution of logging residues with a tub grinder {{was carried out}} in order to calculate the productivity and procurement cost of wood chips. At the investigated site, the tub grinder had a hammer mill crusher {{at the bottom of the}} tub, and a grapple loader and a bucket loader worked as auxiliary machines for the grinder. As a result, the productivity of the tub grinder was 60. 0 loose m 3 /PMH 0, and the total <b>comminuting</b> cost was calculated as 5. 637 US$/m 3, indicating that the <b>comminuting</b> cost of a large-sized crusher was lower than that of a small-sized chipper. The percentage of the cost of loaders, that of carrying in, installing, and carrying out the machines, and that of constructing a landing was 53 % of the total <b>comminuting</b> cost. When a truck with the capacity of 40 m 3 transported wood chips three times a day, the costs of comminution and transportation were 71. 2 US$/t (DM 1), which is almost on a par with those of European countries in which the energy utilization of logging residues is making steady progress. As a result of the discussion about the balance between the processing capacity of the tub grinder and that of other machines, it seemed reasonable for Japanese forestry to consider the use of one tub grinder at several logging sites...|$|R
