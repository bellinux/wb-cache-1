50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza schoeniclus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} bunting family Emberizidae, a group now {{separated by}} most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific schoeniclus is from Ancient Greek skhoiniklos, a now unknown waterside bird.|$|E

50|$|The marsh area attracts moorhen, <b>common</b> teal, <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> coot, mallard duck, sedge warbler, common snipe, little egret, {{northern}} lapwing, Eurasian oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, common redshank, dunlin, knot, and brent goose. Additional species breeding in {{the marsh}} or visiting from nearby breeding locations include common blackbird, dunnock and wren. Rarer visitors but sometimes sighted are grey heron, spotted redshank, ruff and little stint, and very rare but recorded have been sparrowhawk, {{one of the}} avocet breeds and the short-billed dowitcher (2004-2005). Along the Nutley Stream kingfisher appear, and greenshank and water rail are seen in the south eastern corner. From the shore, common gull, herring gull and black-headed gull visit.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} birds breed along the {{north-western}} shore, including Eurasian coot, common moorhen, mallard, and great crested grebe. Lesser spotted woodpecker {{have been reported}} in the surrounding forest and the lake is the home of a rare couple of marsh harriers. Black-headed gull, common gull, herring gull, common tern, osprey, heron, Canada goose, mute swan, and greylag goose have been sighted.

50|$|The island's flora include meadows, heath {{and forests}} of pine, birch and {{especially}} aspen. Around mid summer orchids and lily-of-the-valley bloom in the meadows.The island provides a varied habitat {{for over two}} hundred bird species, which use it for nesting or resting. Waders and ducks will {{be seen in the}} many shallow bays.The non-profit Haparanda Sandskär Bird Observatory on Sandskär was founded in 1981. Since then over 100,000 birds of 137 species have been ringed. The most common species are the willow warbler, redpoll, brambling and <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> but rarer eastern species such as the dusky warbler and yellow-browed warbler are often caught.|$|E
50|$|Witherby's {{crowning}} glory was The Handbook of British Birds (1938-1941). Spanning five volumes, it was reprinted {{a number}} of times, the later editions having a few pages devoted to corrections and additions to previous editions, but few of these are of great significance and the main text was left untouched. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1928 and was awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal by the BOU in 1937. Witherby's lark (Alaemon hamertoni) was named for him, in 1905, but is now more {{commonly known as the}} lesser hoopoe-lark. Two other bird sub-species have been named after him: Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi (<b>common</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bunting)</b> and Erithacus rubecula witherbyi (European robin).|$|E
5000|$|Kenbokki Island (Kenbokki-tō) is an {{uninhabited}} {{island in}} Hamanaka, Hokkaidō, Japan. It forms part of Akkeshi Prefectural Natural Park. The name {{is derived from}} the Ainu kene-pok or [...] "beneath the alder" [...] (Alnus japonica). During studies in 1999, four species of mammal (long-clawed shrew, grey-sided vole, harbour seal, and visiting sika deer) and forty-one species of birds were recorded on the island; there were no amphibians or reptiles. Of the birds, Leach's storm petrel (some twenty thousand pairs), Japanese cormorant, Japanese snipe, slaty-backed gull, and <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> were identified as breeding on Kenbokki. Flora include Gentiana triflora var. japonica (エゾリンドウ), Hemerocallis esculenta, and lily-of-the-valley. Masanori Hata founded Mutsugorō Animal Kingdom (ムツゴロウ動物王国) after his stay on the island.|$|E

50|$|The Pallas's <b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird, {{similar to}} a small <b>reed</b> <b>bunting.</b> It has a small seed-eater's bill. The male has a black head and throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked grey back (<b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> has a browner back).

40|$|Fifteen highly {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{were characterized}} in the <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> Emberiza schoeniclus. Eleven loci were autosomal and four {{linked to the}} Z chromosome. All loci were characterized and tested in 45 unrelated <b>reed</b> <b>buntings</b> from a Swiss population. Autosomal loci displayed seven to 17 and sex-linked loci displayed four to 13 alleles with heterozygosities ranging from 0. 756 to 0. 933 and from 0. 478 to 0. 957, respectively. These loci {{will be used in}} population genetic and mating system studies of <b>reed</b> <b>buntings...</b>|$|R
50|$|Tissø {{is home to}} a {{rich and}} varied birdlife and {{occasionally}} hunting white-tailed eagles or ospreys can be seen - a site rare in Denmark. On the lake itself great crested grebe, common merganser, various dabbling and diving ducks, greylag goose, bean goose, Canada goose, mute swan, whooper swan, tundra swan and Eurasian coot are usual residents. The beach meadows and reed beds house many foraging and breeding birds like pied avocet, little tern, <b>common</b> <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> Eurasian reed warbler and western marsh harrier in addition to Eurasian bittern, bearded reedling, Eurasian penduline tit and common grasshopper warbler. Almost all of the lakeside is on private hands, but there is a publicly accessible birdwatching tower near Fugledegård. Both the lake and the associated reed beds are of international importance to migratory birds, so hunting and ordinary traffic is strongly regulated in the eastern section.|$|E
