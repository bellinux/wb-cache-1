5|$|Contemporary sources also {{differed}} on his status. Foreign visitors often <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a chief, {{especially during}} his capacity as royal governor, {{but most of}} his contemporaries like Samuel Kamakau, missionary Hiram Bingham I, and even King Kamehameha III considered him a makaʻāinana or commoner.

It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his authority over the Angles of eastern England.|$|E

Their friendship is ultimately put to the test, which four black children witness. Later Mr. Tom Bee is shot by John Wallace. Mr. Tom Bee crawls away, cursing John Wallace and refusing to give up <b>calling</b> <b>him</b> John.|$|R
5|$|When Manchester City {{returned}} to the Premier League for the 2000–01 season, it appeared that Dickov's chances of playing would be limited as City signed former FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah and Costa Rican international Paulo Wanchope.

In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.|$|E
50|$|The {{contemporary}} writers <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a Serb, but do {{not mention}} his genealogy, while the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a later, more dubious source, <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> a cousin to previous ruler Jovan Vladimir (r. 990-1016).|$|R
50|$|His {{early history}} is {{preserved}} by Athenaeus, on {{the authority of}} Posidonius. Posidonius <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> Athenion and makes him a Peripatetic philosopher, whereas others, Pausanias, Appian, and Plutarch, <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Aristion, and Appian <b>calls</b> <b>him</b> an Epicurean philosopher.
