5|$|Robert Peel (1723– 12 September 1795), {{commonly}} known as Parsley Peel, was an influential cotton mill owner and grandfather to Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, future prime minister of Great Britain. Peel started life as a yeoman farmer but experimented with <b>calico</b> <b>printing,</b> eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark. Despite losing a number of machines during riots, Peel's company became {{the largest in the}} textile sector by the time of his death, with 23 factories.|$|E
25|$|The River Dean {{marks the}} post-1974 county {{boundary}} between Cheshire and Greater Manchester. The A5102, Wilmslow Road, crosses {{the river at}} the Deanwater bridge. It was at the crossing that James Andrew of Compstall Bridge built the Dean Water <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> mill in 1837, possibly {{on the site of}} an earlier <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> mill. Deanwater House was built as the manager's house. The mill closed in 1848. It was bought and resold to the Davenports on the conditions that it was demolished. It was a sizeable concern employing 172 people, of which half lived in the parish of Woodford. It was driven by water with a supplementary 25hp steam engine. It burnt down in 1851.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} {{northern}} English villages, the Industrial Revolution brought rapid expansion, chiefly {{the creation of}} several cotton mills within Hayfield, along with numerous fabric printing and dyeing businesses, as well as paper manufacture. Hayfield became known for spinning, weaving and <b>calico</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Calico</b> <b>Print</b> was a newspaper, {{established}} in 1882 and published during {{the heyday of}} the silver mining camp of Calico, California prior to 1902. The <b>Calico</b> <b>Print</b> was also the name of a monthly, later bi-monthly, periodical of the mid-20th century, and contained [...] "Tales and trails of the desert West." ...|$|R

25|$|The Baldwin Locomotive Works had {{a humble}} beginning. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder, was a {{jeweller}} and whitesmith, who, in 1825, formed {{a partnership with}} a machinist, and engaged {{in the manufacture of}} bookbinders' tools and cylinders for <b>calico</b> <b>printing.</b> Baldwin then designed and constructed for his own use a small stationary engine, the workmanship of which was so excellent and its efficiency so great that he was solicited to build others like it for various parties, and thus led to turn his attention to steam engineering. The original engine was in use and powered many departments of the works for well over 60 years, and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|E
25|$|John Wood of Marsden {{came from}} Manchester in 1819 and bought {{existing}} woollen mills which he expanded. These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard's agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit {{and the three}} mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2,500,000 pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the sulphite method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.|$|E
500|$|John Davenport {{returned}} to Bramall in 1876 {{at the age}} of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned, while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling [...] ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a Manchester property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £ in [...] ). According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from <b>calico</b> <b>printing,</b> for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing the coachman and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family.|$|E

500|$|Robert Peele {{was born}} in 1723 at Peele Fold in Oswaldtwistle to William Peele and Jane Anne Peele. His family were {{traditionally}} yeoman farmers, until his grandfather Robert Peele abandoned the trade in favour of making woollen cloth. Parsley's father, William, attempted to return the family to farming and after his education at Blackburn Grammar School, he initially joined his father in this pursuit. He inherited the woodblocks his grandfather used for printing on wool and started experimenting with them. When his wife's brother, William Haworth, returned from an apprenticeship to a calico-printer in London, the pair attempted {{to set up a}} business in <b>calico</b> <b>printing.</b> They received financial backing from William Yates, the landlord of the local public house and formed Haworth, Peel and Yates in 1750, consisting of a factory in Blackburn and a warehouse in Manchester. By this point, Peel had dropped the final 'e' from his surname, his reason being that [...] "it was of no use, as it did not add to the sound".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Francis Cabot Lowell {{and his friends}} and colleagues {{established}} in Waltham, Massachusetts, the Boston Manufacturing Company—the first integrated textile mill in the United States. [...] After Lowell's death in 1817, his partners searched for a new location with greater waterpower to expand textile production and add <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> to their capabilities. In 1821 they purchased property adjoining the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River, an area also served by the Middlesex Canal. In 1823 the Merrimack Manufacturing Company began producing cotton cloth in the [...] "Middlesex Village" [...] hamlet in East Chelmsford. In 1826, the area was incorporated as the town of Lowell, Massachusetts, {{named in honor of}} Francis Cabot Lowell.|$|E
2500|$|The churchyard {{contains}} the grade II* listed funerary monument to John Brooks (1788–1849) of Crawshaw Hall, {{the son of}} cotton entrepreneur and banker William Brooks. The monument was sculpted by John Thomas and cost approx £3000. John Brooks was {{a partner in the}} <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> firm of Cunliffe & Brooks who had a mill near Blackburn. He was also Secretary of the Anti-Corn Law League and a philanthropist. The monument comprises a panelled pedestal of granite set upon a large, square stone plinth and was originally enclosed by railings, which were removed as part of the war effort during World War II. It has a square aedicule of Sicilian marble above with niches to each face framed by decorated piers, each containing a life-size carved female figure in classical dress. Each face is pedimented [...] with a bracketed cornice beneath interspersed with carved medallions. The north face {{contains the}} figure 'Industry' depicted with a wheel, the west face the figure 'Commerce' depicted with bales of cotton/calico, the east face the figure 'Charity' depicted with babes in arms and the south face contains the figure 'Integrity' depicted holding a book. Carved decorations to the piers and spandrels include depictions of cotton and flax plants, roses, poppies and oak and laurel leaves. The figure of Charity was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} that, {{periodicity}} of <b>Calico</b> <b>Print</b> {{was changed to}} one every two months and the format was changed {{to that of a}} slick illustrated digest size magazine. Nine issues of <b>Calico</b> <b>Print</b> in magazine form were issued from June 1952 through November 1953 by the Weight's Calico Press in Twentynine Palms, California. These nine issues, packed with detailed desert history, are now highly prized by desert enthusiasts. In addition to articles authored by the Weights, there are contributions from other noted writers - Adelaide Arnold, L. Burr Belden, Ed Rochester, Edmund C. Jaeger, Jerry Laudermilk, Charles F. Lummis, Arthur Woodward, Senator Charles Brown, Harry Oliver, Ruth Kirk, and more.|$|R

60|$|Harvey {{retreated to}} the library and spent some thirty or forty minutes in {{wondering}} whether {{it would be possible to}} compile a history, for use in elementary schools, in which there should be no prominent mention of battles, massacres, murderous intrigues, and violent deaths. The York and Lancaster period and the Napoleonic era would, he admitted to himself, present considerable difficulties, and the Thirty Years’ War would entail something of a gap if you left it out altogether. Still, it would be something gained if, at a highly impressionable age, children could be got to fix their attention on the invention of <b>calico</b> <b>printing</b> instead of the Spanish Armada or the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

Perkins and his business partner, John Leighton, set out with the goal of creating a large scale lumbering and milling operation. Perkins believed that Williamsport could be a major center in the lumber business, as it was surrounded by a plentiful supply of old-growth forests of hemlock, white pine and various hardwoods.|$|R

Sometimes he would sit there by the hour while Wetherell wrote or read, and take his departure when he was so moved without saying good night. Presently Jethro lifted his chin, and dropped it again; there was a sound of wheels without, and, after an interval, a knock at the door.|$|R
