40|$|AbstractUltrasound is {{indispensable}} imaging modality for clinical diagnosis such as fetus assessment and heart assessment. Moreover, many ultrasound applications for image guided procedures {{have been proposed}} and attempted because US is less invasive, less cost, and high portability. However, to obtain US images, a US imaging probe has to be held manually and contacted with a patient body. To address the issue, we have proposed a robotic system for automatic probe scanning. The system consists of a probe scanning robot, navigation software, an optical tracking device, and an ultrasound imaging device. The robot, that is six degrees of freedom, is composed of a frame <b>mechanism</b> and <b>a</b> probe <b>holding</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The frame mechanism has six pneumatic actuators to reduce its weight, and the probe <b>holding</b> <b>mechanism</b> has one DC motor. The probe <b>holding</b> <b>mechanism</b> is connected with the pneumatic actuators using wires. Moreover, the robot can control the position and orientation of the B-scan plane based on the transformation between an optical tracker attached to the US probe and the B-scan plane. The navigation system, which is connected with the tracking device and an US imaging device via a VGA cable, computes the relative position between the positions of a therapeutic tool and the B-scan plane, and sends it to the robot. Then {{the position of the}} B-scan plane can be controlled based on the tool position. Also, the navigation system displays the plane with a texture of an actual echogram and a tool model three-dimensionally to monitor the relative position of the tool and the B-scan plane. To validate the basic system performance, phantom tests were conducted. The phantom was made of gelatin and poly(ethylene glycol). In the tests, the needle was inserted into the phantom, and the B-scan plane was controlled to contain a tracked needle in real-time. From the results, the needle was continuously visualized during needle insertion. Therefore, it is confirmed that the system has a great potential for automatic US image guided procedures...|$|R

Version: FinalIn 2010, the Managing Authority (MA) in Malta launched the first Financial Engineering Instrument (FEI) under Cohesion policy, taking the form of a loan guarantee scheme entitled the JEREMIE First Loss Portfolio Guarantee Product. This addresses a “financing gap” in Malta wherein enterprises, particularly micro and small, face difficulties in obtaining the necessary financing from banks due to their above-average credit risk and lack of collateral. The JEREMIE scheme utilises funds under Operational Programme (OP) I, Priority Axis (PA) 1 entitled “Enhancing Knowledge and Innovation”, and <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> fund of EUR 10 million to be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The current banking structure in Malta makes such forms of FEIs particularly successful. The JEREMIE scheme is currently the only FEI financed through ERDF in Malta. Although this is true, FEIs, financed through local funds, are not new to the Maltese economy. Unlike loan guarantee schemes, however, not all FEIs have proven to be suitable to the local economy. Venture Capital (VC) funds, for instance, are not economically viable for small ventures that are not engaged in cutting edge innovation. The local authorities realize that although FEIs may effectively generate growth potential for SMEs, non-refundable assistance is still necessary given Malta’s economic structure. Prior to EU accession, non-refundable assistance mainly took the form of tax credits which have been highly successful in retaining investment in Malta as well as attracting new investors to operate locally. Upon EU membership, through improved Community funding opportunities, Malta was better able to diversify its portfolio of assistance to industry and began to offer other forms of nonrefundable assistance, mainly grants. These may be more useful in helping businesses that need imminent and short-term assistance, such as start-ups and micro businesses. Since this type of assistance was lacking prior to EU accession, the authorities have focussed more of their resources on non-refundable assistance in the current programming period under OP IN/...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{investigation}} of laminar diffusion flames established {{on a flat}} plate in a parallel air stream is presented. A numerical model with a multi-step chemical kinetics mechanism, variable thermo-physical properties, multi-component species diffusion and a radiation sub-model is employed for this purpose. Both upward and downward injection of fuel has been considered in a normal gravity environment. The thermal and aerodynamic structure of the flame has been explained {{with the help of}} temperature and species contours, net reaction rate of fuel and streamlines. Flame characteristics and stability aspects for several air and fuel velocity combinations have been studied. An important characteristic of a laminar boundary layer diffusion flame with upward injection of fuel is the velocity overshoot that occurs near the flame zone. This is not observed when the fuel is injected in the downward direction. The flame standoff distance is slightly higher for the downward injection of fuel due to increase in displacement thickness of boundary layer. Influence of an obstacle, namely the backward facing step, on the flame characteristics and stability aspects is also investigated. Effects of air and fuel velocities, size and location of the step are studied in detail. Based on the air and fuel velocities, different types of flames are predicted. The use of a backward-facing step as <b>a</b> flame <b>holding</b> <b>mechanism</b> for upward injection of fuel, results in increased stability limits due to the formation of a recirculation zone behind the step. The predicted stability limits match with experimentally observed limits.
