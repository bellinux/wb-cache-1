5000|$|A {{bootable}} {{business card}} (BBC) is a CD-ROM {{that has been}} cut, pressed, or molded to {{the size and shape}} of a business card (designed to fit in a wallet or pocket). Alternative names for this form factor include [...] "credit card," [...] "hockey rink," [...] and [...] "wallet-size". The cards are designed to hold about 50 MB. The <b>CD-ROM</b> business <b>cards</b> are generally used for commercial product demos, are mailed to prospective customers, and are given away at trade shows.|$|R
25|$|PHR {{software}} can provide more sophisticated {{features such as}} data encryption, data importation, and data sharing with health care providers. Some PHR products allow the copying of health records to a mass-storage device such as a <b>CD-ROM,</b> DVD, smart <b>card,</b> or USB flash drive.|$|R
50|$|They were {{originally}} deployed {{in response to}} the problem of boot sector viruses on floppy discs. Subsequently, their scope has been expanded to include USB flash drives, portable hard discs, memory <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROMs</b> and other removable devices, all of which can potentially carry malware.|$|R
50|$|Removable {{media have}} become very common with {{microcomputer}} platforms. They allow programs and data to be transferred between machines without a physical connection. Common examples include USB flash drives, memory <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROMs,</b> and DVDs. Utilities have therefore been developed to detect the presence and availability of a medium and then mount that medium without any user intervention.|$|R
50|$|The {{virtual machine}} can {{interface}} with {{many types of}} physical host hardware. These include: hard disks, <b>CD-ROM</b> drives, network <b>cards,</b> audio interfaces, and USB devices. USB devices can be completely emulated (mass storage from image files, input devices), or the host's USB devices can be used (however, this requires administrator privileges and does not work with all devices).|$|R
50|$|The PC version had a {{relatively}} high conventional memory requirement which made the game difficult to run unless the user first edited the autoexec.bat and config.sys files and/or created a boot disk. The game was bundled with multimedia kits such as those by Reveal. At that time, many personal computers were not equipped with <b>CD-ROMs</b> and sound <b>cards</b> out of the box, and users wanting these features may have chosen their kit based on the pack-in software. The Reveal 4x CD-ROM kit featured the SC400 sound card, speakers, and a large bundle of multimedia software including games and educational titles. Besides Dragon Lore, this kit featured another Cryo Interactive game, MegaRace.|$|R
50|$|A digital minilab is a {{computer}} printer that uses traditional chemical photographic processes to make prints from digital images. Photographs are input to the digital minilab using a built-in film scanner that captures images from negative and positive photographic films (including mounted slides), flatbed scanners, a kiosk that accepts <b>CD-ROMs</b> or memory <b>cards</b> from a digital camera, or a website that accepts uploads. The operator can make many corrections such as brightness or color saturation, contrast, scene lighting color correction, sharpness and cropping. A laser, LCD/LED, or Micro Light Valve Array (MLVA) then exposes photographic paper with the image, which is then processed by the minilab just {{as if it had}} been exposed from a negative.|$|R
40|$|This is {{an era of}} SOC (System-on-Chip) based computing. Embedded systems play {{significant}} role in representing computing power in the smallest possible device that too in the most liberal way. Microcontroller is represented as a major embedded system product and is responsible to carry computing power on any-timeany-where basis. The modern PC or PC-based industrial applications use many small microcontroller circuits in keyboards, printers, modems, disk controller, sound <b>card,</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> drive, mouse, bar-code reader (printing industries), power drill machines (automobile industries), SCADA system (process industries), fire alarm system (security and safety engineering) and smart cards (banking industry) to name a few. Microcontroller {{makes it possible to}} empower the simplest application and the product with computing intelligence at an affordable cost. The selection of th...|$|R

Visitors to the site gain access to an exclusive database of Michelin Guide content and listings including 18,000 tourist site recommendations and ratings for 62,000 hotels and restaurants, as well as additional travel services including traffic and weather updates, on-line car-hire booking and a database of speed camera locations, updated regularly and available to download free of charge. The website also features an online store offering electronic updates of the Michelin Guide {{and a range of}} GPS accessories, as well as navigation-related software (SD <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROMs</b> etc.) designed for third-party GPS navigation devices and PDAs. ViaMichelin Labs is a website used to improve and test new products like Michelin iPhone-specific maps.|$|R
50|$|Multiuser DOS {{was also}} unable to use many common PC DOS {{additions}} such as network stacks, {{and it was}} limited {{in its ability to}} support later developments in the PC-compatible world, such as graphics adaptors, sound <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> drives and mice. Although many of these were soon rectified for example, graphical terminals were developed, allowing users to use CGA, EGA and VGA software it was less flexible in this regard than a network of individual PCs, and as the prices of these fell, it became less and less competitive, although it still offered benefits in terms of management and lower total cost of ownership. Unlike MP/M, it never became popular for single-user but multitasking use. It was priced as a multi-user operating system, of course, and required special device drivers, unlike single-user multitasking DOS additions such as Quarterdeck's DESQview.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Timess Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said of Disclosure that it is:an {{elaborate}} provocation of rage {{in which}} a thousand fragments of revenge finally fall into place, like acid rain on wildfire. Meanwhile, Mr. Crichton also irrelevantly entertains us with a complex vision of the digital future, complete with cellular phones the size of credit <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> players that can store 600 books and database environments you can virtually walk around in with the guidance of a helpful angel who cracks wise.In a review comparing the novel with the film adaptation, Nathan Rabin expressed a negative view: he described Disclosure as [...] "loathsome" [...] and [...] "borderline-unreadable", and inferior to its film version. Rabin also criticized the novel's characterization: [...] "Not since Atlas Shrugged has a novelist strayed so egregiously from plausible human behavior in dogged pursuit of making a muddled ideological point".|$|R
5000|$|Like the Amiga 600, the A1200 {{features}} a PCMCIA Type II slot and an internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers. The A1200 has internal housing for one 2.5" [...] {{internal hard disk}} drive connecting to the ATA controller, though {{it is also possible}} to accommodate slim 3.5" [...] drives with suitable cabling and fixings. The 16-bit PCMCIA Type II interface allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop market, though only 16-bit (Type II) PCMCIA cards are hardware compatible, newer 32-bit PC Card or CardBus peripherals are incompatible. The PCMCIA implementation is almost identical to the one featured on the earlier A600. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers and video capture devices. Later, a number of compatible laptop peripherals have been made to operate with this port including serial modems, network cards, and CompactFlash adapters.|$|R
25|$|The A600 is {{the first}} of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This {{connector}} allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop-computer market, though only 16-bit (Type II) PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit CardBus or PC Card peripherals are incompatible. The port is not fully compliant with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM <b>cards,</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore's expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and CompactFlash adapters.|$|R
