The sprawling of American alligators and other crocodilians is not {{similar to that}} of salamanders and lizards, being similar to walking. Therefore, the two forms of territorial locomotion can be termed the [...] "low walk" [...] and the [...] "high walk". Unlike most other land vertebrates, American alligators increase their speed through the distal rather than proximal ends of their limbs. In the water, American alligators swim like fish, moving their pelvic regions and tails from side to side. American alligators held the record as having the strongest laboratory-measured bite of any living animal, measured at up to [...] It should be noted that this experiment had not been, {{at the time of the}} paper published, replicated in any other crocodilians, and the same laboratory was able to measure a greater bite force in saltwater crocodiles; notwithstanding this very high biting force, the muscles opening the American alligator's jaw are quite weak, and the jaws can be held closed by hand or tape when an American alligator is captured. [...] During respiration, air flow is unidirectional, looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation; the American alligator's abdominal muscles can alter the position of the lungs within the torso, thus shifting the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> which allows the American alligator to dive, rise, and roll within the water.|$|E

50|$|Intact {{stability}} calculations {{are relatively}} straightforward and involve {{taking all the}} centers of mass of objects on the vessel which are then computed/calculated to identify {{the center of gravity}} of the vessel, and the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> of the hull. Cargo arrangements and loadings, crane operations, and the design sea states are usually taken into account. The photo at right illustrates a common misconception about vessels. In fact, {{in the vast majority of}} vessels, the center of gravity is well above the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy.</b> The ship is stable because as it begins to heel, one side of the hull begins to rise from the water and the other side begins to submerge. This causes the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> to shift toward the side that is lower in the water. The job of the naval architect is to make sure that the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> shifts outboard of the center of gravity as the ship heels. A line drawn from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> in a slightly heeled condition vertically will intersect the centerline at a point called the metacenter. As long as the metacenter is further above the keel than the center of gravity, the ship is stable in an upright condition.|$|E
40|$|As a {{case study}} of a {{particular}} control methodology and as a practical contribution in the area of underwater vehicle control, we consider the problem of stabilizing an underwater vehicle using internal rotors as actuators. The control design method comprises three steps. The first step involves shaping the kinetic energy of the conservative dynamics. For the underwater vehicle, the control term from this step may be interpreted as modifying the system inertia. In the second step, we design feedback dissipation using a Lyapunov function constructed in the first step. In the third step, we include a general model for the viscous force and moment on the vehicle and we show that these effects enhance stability. We first apply this method to a vehicle whose <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and gravity coincide and then to a vehicle with noncoincident <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and gravity...|$|R

50|$|However, if {{the center}} of gravity is high {{relative}} to the width of the vessel, and the pontoons on one side are unable to bear the vessel's complete weight, the lateral movement of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> will be restricted.

We apply this method to species in both high and low Reynolds number environments to elucidate different phenomena, including chemotaxing and species comparison in spermatozoa, gait changes in eels (steady versus accelerating), kinematic responses to viscosity and viscoelasticity in C. elegans (nematodes), and the Kirmin gait in trout.

5000|$|The {{orientation}} of a static and stable object in water, {{such as a}} diver, is determined by its <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and its center of mass.
