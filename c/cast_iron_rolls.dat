This midpoint of the mould thickness was treated as an operating point for the transition. A full accumulation of the heat in the mould was postulated for the transition. Thus, a plateau at the curve was observed at the midpoint. The range of the plateau existence corresponded to the incubation period, that appeared before fully equiaxed grains formation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of the {{microstructure}} in the tribological wear processes occurring in a <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> mill <b>roll.</b> For this purpose, a piece of a broken roll, made in Italy, was collected. Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed on the roll working surface in conjunction with metallographic tests effected within its surface layer. There was established the relation between the microstructure of the roll and the process of its tribological wear. The following was ascertained: micro-shrinkages or graphite precipitations nearby the working area cause cracks between those places and the working area; in the surface layer, cracks occur usually in the zone of ledeburitic cementite. At places of considerable precipitations of ledeburitic cementite, the tribological wear intensity of the roll is lower. A banded layout of precipitations of ledeburitic cementite facilitates a selective spalling of some parts of the roll material.

For example, {{features of the}} grain structure are revealed in different kind of steel on microstruc ture level, and its parameters greatly influences on the strength properties of the metal. Thus, to select the scale of representation of a fractal object, for instance the elements of structure of roll iron or steel is necessary to determine the interval (1), where observed its self-similarity, and on this interval should be selected the scale, the use of which will allow him to choose adequate fractal dimension. For optimal scale structure of repose is taken one in which at least two adjacent points of the series (2), the fractal dimension is minimal differences between them.

40|$|AbstractIn {{hot rolling}} mills, {{premature}} failure of rolls {{is a major}} concern as it adversely affects the mill operation as well as production. Analysis of failed roll materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life of rolls. The hot strip mill referred here consists of six stands wherein high chromium (Hi-Cr) iron rolls and Indefinite Chilled Double Poured (ICDP) <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> are being used for finishing rolling of the strips in the last two stands. The thin strip mill produces strips in the thickness range of 1. 0 – 12. 7 mm. This work describes two different types of roll failure cases and their analysis which was carried out using destructive as well as non-destructive testing techniques (NDT). The cases are as follows:(a) Case I: enhanced ICDP bottom roll of fifth stand (F# 5) which failed from the neck portion. (b) Case II: analysis of sub-surface defect of ICDP rolls of the last stand (F# 6). Destructive testing (including metallography and chemical analysis) was carried out on the failed roll samples in the first case and gross abnormality in microstructure was observed. Some foreign particle/entrapment was observed after dressing of the working surface of roll at 566 mm diameter (initial diameter of roll was 620 mm and scrap diameter was projected to be 540 mm). The chemical composition of the particle was analyzed by a portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) alloy analyzer and it was confirmed that the particle is basically a ferroalloy which was entrapped in the shell of the roll, probably during casting/manufacturing of roll...|$|E

That roll was made of mottled <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed nearby the fracture in the roll. Observations were conducted on polished sections, first not etched, and then etched, which allowed us to trace carefully the propagation of the fracture. There was found a strict correlation between the microstructure of the roll and the progress occurring in the crack. It was ascertained that the basic reason for the damage to the roll was banded precipitations of ledeburitic cementite. In addition, cementite formed a continuous network. Another microstructure defects of that roll are also precipitations of secondary carbides on the boundaries of former grain of austenite as well as the occurrence of upper bainite in its matrix.

40|$|At {{first step}} of {{simulation}} a temperature field for solidifying cast steel and cast iron roll has been performed. The calculation {{does not take into}} account the convection in the liquid since convection has no influence on the proposed model for the localization of the C-E (columnar to equiaxed grains) transformation. However, it allows to study the dynamics of temperature field temporal behavior in the middle of a mould. It is postulated that for the C-E transition a full accumulation of the heat in the mould has been observed (plateau at the T(t) curve). The temporal range of plateau existence corresponds to the incubation time for the full equiaxed grains formation. At the second step of simulation temporal behavior of the temperature gradient field has been studied. Three ranges within temperature gradients field have been distinguished for the operating point situated at the middle of mould: a/ for the formation of columnar grains zone, (and high temperature gradient 0 >>T& 0 //>>∂∂−∂∂ ∂∂−∂∂>EttEtrTrT). T - temperature, r - roll radius. It is evident that the heat transfer across the mould decides on the temporal appearance of incubation during which the solidification is significantly arrested and competition between columnar and equiaxed growth occurs. Moreover solidification with positive temperature gradient transforms into solidification with negative temperature gradient (locally) after the incubation. A simulation has been performed for the cast steel and <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> solidifying as in industry condition. Since the incubation divides the roll into to parts (first with columnar structure, second with equiaxed structure) some experiments dealing with solidification have been made in laboratory scale.

An equation for macrosegregation identification is suggested. Additionally, a new equation for redistribution studied across a given grain and its surrounding (precipitates) is also delivered.

40|$|Mill rolls {{are ones}} {{of the most}} {{expensive}} tools applied in plastic working processes and have to satisfy several criteria, which allow them to be used. <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> mill <b>rolls,</b> due to their fracture toughness and tribological properties, are the most often applied at hot-rolling in the last rolling stands. This results from the smallest dynamic loads of such rolling stands and the decisive influence of the surface quality of these tools on the surface quality of the rolled product. An improper microstructure of rolls can lead to their premature wearing, e. g. broken flanges, pivots twisting off etc. By means of the heat treatment the matrix microstructure and morphology of carbide precipitationscan be modified and this in-turn can influence <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> properties. Determination of the influence of microstructure changes, caused by the heat treatment, on the properties of EN-GJN-HV 300 low-alloycast iron, after its modification and spheroidization – is the aim of the present paper.

40|$|Summary. To {{study the}} {{structure}} of metals and alloys and its influence on their properties are widely used traditional methods of macro- and microanalysis, X-ray, spectral, thermal and inspection (X-ray, magnetic, ultrasonic). They have their own threshold, often narrowly focused and applied directly depending on {{the purpose of the}} research object (pipe, forming rolls, metal, etc.). Currently existing mathematical models of forecasting the qualitative characteristics of metal products based only on an analysis of statistical data do not provide physical-chemical interpretation of the processes that occur during the formation of the structure or who could definitely take into account the effect of the chemical composition and other parameters of the technology. Therefore, the forecast results can not always meet the requirements. In order to obtain acceptable quality results produced by the product specifications developed by the forecast methodology should include the use of both classical and modern methods of structure evaluation. So, to determine the relationship between mechanical properties and structure elements of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>roll</b> is planned to use the theory of fractals and multifractal. The proposed method is the most appropriate to quantify the majority of real structures, which the integer approximation of the figures of Euclid introduces some uncertainty, and therefore not always acceptable in practical problems of modern materials.

Part of M 23 C 6 carbide transforms to M 7 C 3 carbide and is dissolved in austenite during austenization at 1020 °C. Thus, the amount of M 23 C 6 carbide decreases, whereas that of M 7 C 3 carbide increases after quenching; the highest hardness is also obtained. After tempering, the martensite transforms to a tempered martensite, and some carbide precipitates in the martensite matrix. The hardness also changes from HRC 62. 1, which corresponds to quenching, to HRC 55. 2 and HRC 56. 3, which correspond to once and twice tempering, respectively.

40|$|Raising of problem. Recently, some {{articles}} {{devoted to}} the issues of materials, are examples of objects which are {{used to describe the}} language of fractal geometry. However, such an approach must be rigorously justified, as it should be {{based on the fact that}} the fractal dimension is inherent in the test material can be characterized by its high-quality properties. Until now, this problem was proposed to solve using the criterion of F. Takens. The prerequisites for satisfying this criterion is reduced to measuring any one characteristic of the system under study at different times at intervals. As a result of these measurements are obtained by a bounded sequence,. If this sequence is possible to construct a smooth deterministic model of the form [1], then we are dealing with a complex deterministic process and apply the language of fractal geometry is meaningless. An approach based on the use of multi-fractal theory [2, 3] to quantify the elements of the structure, allows the spectrum by comparing the statistical dimensions of its elements, identify sensitive indicators of qualitative characteristics, in particular the mechanical properties, describing the one-to-one correspondence data dimensional structures and these properties. This in turn reduces the incompleteness of formal axiomatic that occurs in the description of the elements of the metal structure through the traditional figures of Euclidean geometry by identifying structurally sensitive to the quality criteria of dimensional ratings. Purpose. To determine the sensitivity between the dimensional assessments of the structural elements of roll-iron and mechanical properties. Conclusion. To predict the mechanical properties of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> plate <b>roll</b> form graphite is advisable to use it with an increase in the dimensional assessment framework x 200.

High niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was prepared by adding pure niobium to a commercial <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Coarse primary niobium carbide crystals were observed in the microstructure of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The effect of the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as an inoculant on the grain size of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels was examined in various experimental conditions. When the amount of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> inoculant more than 3 mass% was added into the steel melt, fine equiaxed grains were observed and grain size was significantly reduced to 210 μm. The results indicate that the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is effective as a grain refiner for the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. From the dissolution rate measurement, the grain refining mechanism was proposed. 9 th International Symposium on Science and Processing of <b>Cast</b> <b>Iron,</b> SPCI- 9; Luxor; 10 November 2010 through 13 November 201...|$|R
