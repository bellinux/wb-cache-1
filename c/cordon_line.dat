50|$|Validating traffic {{simulation}} models requires comparing traffic {{estimated by the}} model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest.

These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. <b>Cordon</b> <b>lines</b> surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> around the central business district.|$|R

30|$|As can be noticed, the entry-based layout {{can affect}} OD pair B by {{deflecting}} flows from path 1 – 5 – 3 – 6 crossing the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> to path 1 – 5 – 6 which is {{external to the}} cordon. However, it cannot directly alter flow distribution of OD pair A, since all the paths between the OD pair are charged equally at the cordon stations. As a result, this plan is not fully efficient in diverting the traffic flow from the cordoned area. The distance-based scheme can obviously change the flow pattern among the routes of OD pair A, following their different traveling lengths inside the cordoned zone. On the other hand, it is unable to affect flow distribution between the paths of OD pair B, because none of them traverse the tolled links inside the zone. Hence, this toll design cannot optimally prohibit vehicles from entering the cordoned area. On the contrary, the hybrid regime yields the optimal state by diverting the flows of both OD pairs from passing over the <b>cordon</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
30|$|In reality, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to communicate the marginal costs of all roads of the network with the drivers (i.e., tolling all roads) and expect to see a full SO traffic flow (known as first-best congestion pricing [18]). Rather, a few roads, presumably the highly congested ones, are selected as tolled roads and some fairly consistent toll rates are assigned to them (known as second-best congestion pricing [19]. Examples are the imposition of tolls on the roads forming cordon lines encompassing a central business district (CBD) or on the roads forming some screen lines which bisect the road network. One of the main challenges in the pricing schemes is the equity [20]. Equity concern is associated with the distribution of costs and benefits among the members of the society. A policy can be called equitable if it meets a normative standard of fairness (so equity means fairness). Following is one of the typical complaints: “I am living just one block after the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> in the CBD and my office is in the outer CBD. Beside the fact that you put my house inside the <b>cordon</b> <b>line,</b> I have no business in the CBD, so it is totally unfair to tax me.” In the USA, many congestion pricing proposals have been rejected based on worries that they are inequitable [21].|$|E
30|$|High {{levels of}} traffic in {{metropolis}} areas {{have become a}} critical social problem of the twenty-first century. Congestion pricing, as part of traffic demand management (TDM) strategies, is a significant economic tool which has been implemented in several cities around the world [1]. It mitigates the congestion level by encouraging the commuters enough to alter their behavior, such as their departure time, route or mode of transport [2, 3]. Congestion pricing schemes can be categorized into two groups: the first-best and the second-best strategies. In the first-best strategy, the well-known Pigouvian formula [4] {{is used to calculate}} the negative externalities which should be paid by the drivers. It is applied by charging tolls over all links of the network, so that the user equilibrium flow pattern shifts toward a socially preferred pattern. However, this is not a practical strategy, because of the political and social resistance against all roads tolled. On the other hand, the second-best policy is more acceptable to the public since it settles charges on a limited subset of the links. First applied in Singapore in 1975, cordon pricing is the most appropriate second-best policy for network authorities due to its practicality, effectiveness and social acceptance. Cordon pricing follows three main objectives in general: alleviating congestion, enhancing the environmental indices and generating revenue [5]. In the conventional form of cordon pricing, the commuters are charged on entry into a specific zone, enclosed by a hypothetical <b>cordon</b> <b>line.</b> Mostly implemented on the central business districts, this second-best strategy can reduce the intensity of congestion within the cordoned area by deflecting the routes from entry or changing the mode of transport. May et al. [6], Shepherd et al. [7, 8], Santos et al. [9], May et al. [10], Zhang and Yang [11] and Gholami et al. [12] are among those who investigated the impact of the entry-based cordon pricing on the performance of transportation systems. Although a single layer cordon has a positive effect on reducing the congestion inside, it may cause unwilling congestion outside the cordoned area. In order to tackle this deficiency, some researchers suggested that using multilayer cordons can improve the geographical coverage of cordon pricing [10, 12, 13]. May et al. [10], Zou et al. [14] and Gholami et al. [12] argued against cordon pricing by showing that there may exist more effective toll points in the whole network than on the <b>cordon</b> <b>line,</b> providing that the total number of tolled links is not changed. Based on their experiments, relaxing the constraint of keeping the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> closed can increase the social benefits of community. However, implementation of such a strategy encounters practical issues since it does not form a coherent geographical district and is mentally hard to be perceived and accepted by the users. May et al. [6] pointed out that cordon pricing can affect only the trips with the origins outside and the destinations inside the cordoned area. They implemented a bidirectional charging plan which can enhance the overall performance of the pricing.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, {{establishment}} of <b>cordon</b> and screen <b>lines</b> for traffic volume studies is purely subjective, relying {{much on the}} political jurisdictions, natural boundaries or man-made barriers. Two conflict objectives are generally kept in mind in setting cordon and screen lines: obtaining as much and representative traffic information as possible and saving subsequent manpower requirement in data collection. This paper makes a first attempt to develop a systematic way for selecting <b>cordon</b> and screen <b>lines</b> for a given study area and road network. Two integer programming models are developed: one is to choose the optimal locations of a given number of survey stations to separate as many origin-destination pairs as possible {{and the other is}} to determine the minimum number of survey stations to separate all origin-destination pairs. Both models are solved by a genetic algorithm and illustrated with a numerical example...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, entry-based {{cordon pricing}} {{is not completely}} equitable {{in a sense that}} it does not consider the real externalities imposed by vehicles to the whole network. In this strategy, every vehicle is charged with the same toll while passing certain points at the cordon boundary, regardless of what the route of the travel is. On the other side, applying the distance-based pricing inside a cordoned area may cause unwanted congestion within the cordon around the boundary. These drawbacks limit the applicability and performance of this policy. In this paper, a hybrid entry- and distance-based strategy is proposed to circumvent these issues. In the hybrid layout, the toll consists of two parts: (1) a certain amount of charge for entering the cordon, and (2) a fee proportional to the distance travelled within the cordoned area. The first part prevents unnecessary trips into the cordoned area, while the second part provides more equity to the users traveling inside. This is further to note that the vehicle traveling outside the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> is free of charge.|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{planning}} in the Greater Copenhagen Region (have {{over the last}} 10 years mainly been supported by the so-called OTM traffic model. The behavioural models in OTM include advanced state-of-the-art utility-based formulations, which are combined with base-matrices in a pivot-correction procedure. Before and after studies of specific projects have shown, that these matrices might be the Achilles heal of the whole model system. Vuk and Hansen (2006) therefore validated the present version of the OTM traffic model (version 4. 0 from summer 2000) and concluded that a major drawback of the model was indeed outdated base 1992 matrices. From January 2005 to March 2007 the OTM model has therefore been in a large-scale process of updating where creation of new trip matrices has been the main focus. The article describes the undertaken methodology for constructing the travel matrices for Copenhagen, and how the improved matrices influence {{the performance of the}} model. A main focus in the work has been to utilise various data sources for estimation of the new matrices. This includes telephone survey data, <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> surveys and existing transport surveys to construct the base matrices, traffic counts to adjust these, and digital network databases. The article also demonstrates a new approach to adjust public transport matrices to counts...|$|E
30|$|We {{studied the}} idea of the TSS for {{congestion}} pricing. The element of subsidy is an appealing factor that can greatly compensate some shortcomings related to equity and acceptability in the previous schemes. A fully fledged TSS problem ought to be postulated as a bilevel programing problem which is highly intractable. Nonetheless, in practice, the problem is usually as simple as follows: The location of the tolled (or subsidized) roads is known; it could be a <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> surrounding a CBD or screen lines bisecting the urban network. Even—based on the traffic survey or historical data—the target traffic volume on the tolled road is also given. Therefore, the question of interest is: What is the best pricing regime, or, which road should be tolled and which ones should be subsidized and how much? To answer this question, given the capped values of the target roads, we first transformed the problem to a conventional CTAP. Second, the Lagrangian values of the respective capacity constraints are interpreted as the toll/subsidy. Third, we relaxed the capacity constraints by moving their Lagrangian values to the respective roads’ delay function. In other words, the delay functions receive an additional term to be iteratively updated in such a way the traffic volumes remain below the capped values. We referred to the process as “inflated travel time.” The algorithm was then applied to the real dataset of the Winnipeg, Canada, in which 11 river crossings bridges of the city of Winnipeg were subject to the TSS. The maximum values of toll and subsidy were found to be 4 and 0.2 Canadian dollars.|$|E

40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Interstate 35 W Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis resulted in unexpected loss of life and had serious consequences on mobility and accessibility in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In response to the network disruption caused by the bridge collapse, a number of traffic restoration projects were proposed and rapidly implemented by MnDOT. Selection and prioritization of these projects, however, was based mainly on engineering judgment and experience. The only decision-support tool available to traffic engineers was the regional transportation planning model, which is static in nature and decennial. In this work, the Twin Cities metropolitan area is simulated using a mesoscopic traffic simulator in the AIMSUN software. After establishing the mesoscopic simulation model, we attempt to utilize the calibrated mesoscopic simulation model to evaluate drivers’ perceived cost evolution to explain the traffic dynamics on the Twin Cities road network after the unexpected {{collapse of}} the I- 35 W Bridge over the Mississippi River. Given the observation of largely underutilized sections of network, it is proposed that the tragedy generated a perceived travel cost to discourage commuters from using these sections. Applying a mesoscopic simulation model provided by AIMSUN, the perceived costs on <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> after the I- 35 W Bridge collapse were suggested to be best described as an exponential decay cost curve. The proposed model is applicable to both practitioners and researchers in traffic-related fields by providing {{an understanding of how}} traffic dynamics will evolve after a long-term, unexpected network disruption...|$|R

40|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19 th century, very few {{references}} exist regarding the occurrence of animal diseases in Namibia. With the introduction of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in 1859, this picture changed completely and livestock owners implemented various forms of disease control in an effort to contain the spread of this disease and minimise its devastating effects. After the establishment of the colonial administration in 1884, the first animal disease legislation was introduced in 1887 and the first veterinarian, Dr Wilhelm Rickmann, arrived in 1894. CBPP and the outbreak of rinderpest in 1897 necessitated a greatly expanded veterinary infrastructure and the first veterinary laboratory was erected at Gammams near Windhoek in 1897. To prevent the spread of rinderpest, a veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> was established, which was {{the very beginning of the}} Veterinary Cordon Fence as it is known today. After the First World War, a small but dedicated corps of veterinarians again built up an efficient animal health service in the following decades, with veterinary private practice developing from the mid– 1950 s. The veterinary profession organised itself in 1947 in the form of a veterinary association and, in 1984, legislation was passed to regulate the veterinary profession by the establishment of the Veterinary Council of Namibia. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 1961 was instrumental in the creation of an effective veterinary service, meeting international veterinary standards of quality and performance which are still maintained today.

30|$|Congestion pricing {{is seen as}} an {{effective}} policy to address traffic congestion. In such policies where money, people and authorities are involved, the success generally hinges upon two factors: equity (being fair) and acceptability (to both people and authorities). The primary concern is the equity, for which “tradable credit scheme (TCS)” has been introduced and extensively studied in the literature. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the trading schemes, the TCS has yet to find any foot in the real world. To this end, a novel idea of rewarding has substituted the trading component to be known as toll-and-subsidy scheme (TSS). The idea is to charge the drivers on some roads (toll) while rewarding them to use other alternative—and perhaps underutilized—roads (subsidy). The research of the TSS is in its infancy stage. The problem to be tackled in this study is as follows: Given a set of roads constituting a <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> around the central business district (CBD) or across a screen line, how much toll or subsidy should be assigned to each road? The problem is first transformed into a capacitated traffic assignment problem. We employ a solution method based on augmenting the travel time of roads up to the level at which the traffic volumes do not exceed some target rates. A real dataset from the city of Winnipeg, Canada, is used as a pilot study. We then discuss policy-related applications of the TSS. It is proved in the literature that one can obtain optimal TSSs for various objectives and considerations. To this end, the non-negativity of the toll values is relaxed which results in a valid toll set. Nevertheless, the computational time is found to be of highest significance. Our method differs {{in the fact that the}} traffic volumes are bounded from the above and it is quite affordable. The main contribution is first to highlight the concept of subsidy along with traditional thought of merely toll. Second is to interpret the Lagrangian values of the capacity constraints as the values of the toll/subsidy.|$|E

Lt. Comdr. (then Lt.) Kelley was in charge of a column of 8 river assault craft which were extracting 1 company of U.S. Army infantry troops on the east bank of the Ong Muong Canal in Kien Hoa province, when 1 of the armored troop carriers reported a mechanical failure of a loading ramp. At approximately the same time, Viet Cong forces opened fire from the opposite bank of the canal. After issuing orders for the crippled troop carrier to raise its ramp manually, and for the remaining boats to form a protective cordon around the disabled craft, Lt. Comdr. Kelley realizing the extreme danger to his column and its inability to clear the ambush site until the crippled unit was repaired, boldly maneuvered the monitor in which he was embarked to the exposed side of the protective <b>cordon</b> in direct <b>line</b> with the enemy's fire, and ordered the monitor to commence firing. Suddenly, an enemy rocket scored a direct hit on the coxswain's flat, the shell penetrating the thick armor plate, and the explosion spraying shrapnel in all directions. Sustaining serious head wounds from the blast, which hurled him to the deck of the monitor, Lt. Cmdr. Kelley disregarded his severe injuries and attempted to continue directing the other boats. Although unable to move from the deck or to speak clearly into the radio, he succeeded in relaying his commands through 1 of his men until the enemy attack was silenced and the boats were able to move to an area of safety. Lt. Comdr. Kelley's brilliant leadership, bold initiative, and resolute determination served to inspire his men and provide the impetus needed to carry out the mission after he was medically evacuated by helicopter.
