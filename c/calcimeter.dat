40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{evaluate}} four methods of quantitative determination of soil carbonates. Calcium carbonates equivalent were determined by the acid neutralization, <b>calcimeter</b> and acetic acid methods. Also, it obtains by the fourth methods when the acid neutralization method is corrected against proton adsorption. The acid neutralization method gave significantly higher estimates of total carbonates and different from each of the others. The <b>calcimeter</b> method gave the lower estimates of CaCO 3 equivalent. The results showed that the corrected values of CaCO 3 equivalent did not differ significantly from other three methods but the overall mean tended to be higher than the acetic acid and <b>calcimeter</b> methods. It may be concluded that the acetic acid method is simple, can reasonably estimate the carbonate content and requires only a pH meter. It can be used for routine determination of soil carbonate...|$|E

This is performed by thoroughly describing {{the function of the}} apparatus. A literature study of Quaternary deposits and soils and how the different kinds of soil are divided is included in the work, to clarify the importance of soil analysis. A description of the analyzes used in terms of the grain size distribution and measuring calcium carbonate are included in the work to get a wider and clearer picture of how the analyzes of the new apparatus is to be used. The work ends with a test of the apparatus used for measuring calcium carbonate content. A discussion about pros and cons with the new equipment in relations to the old one is also included.   Key words: hydrometer, pipette, <b>calcimeter</b>   Independent Project in Earth Science, 1 GV 029, 15 credits, 2016 Supervisor: Magnus Hellqvist Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Villavägen 16, SE- 752 36 Uppsala (www. geo. uu. se...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} carbon cycle on arid land, there is an urgent need to quantify both soil organic carbon (SOC) and inorganic carbon (SIC) thus to assess various methods. Here, we present a study employing three methods for determinations of SOC and SIC in the Yanqi Basin of northwest China. We use an elemental analyzer for both SOC and SIC, the Walkley-Black method for SOC, a modified pressure <b>calcimeter</b> method for SIC, and a simple loss-on-ignition (LOI) procedure for determinations of SOC and SIC. Our analyses show that all three approaches produce consistently low values for SOC (1 - 14 g kg(- 1)) and high values for SIC (8 - 53 g kg(- 1)). The Walkley-Black method provides an accurate estimate of SOC with 100 % recovery for most soil samples. The pressure <b>calcimeter</b> method is as accurate as the elemental analysis for measuring SIC. In addition, SOC and SIC can be accurately estimated using a two-step LOI approach, i. e., (1) combustion at 375 °C for 17 hours to estimate SOC, and (2) subsequent combustion at 800 °C for 12 hours to estimate SIC. There are strong linear relationships for both SOC and SIC between the elemental analysis and LOI method, which demonstrates the capability of the two-step LOI technique for estimating SOC and SIC in this arid region...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of inhibition of the reaction of aluminium-phosphate binders with iron scale, which is contained in bauxite. This material is mixed with phosphate binders to form refractories. The hydrogen is produced by this reaction causing the mixture foaming. The amount of evolved hydrogen was observed by the measuring by the Jank's <b>calcimeter.</b> Also the shape of oxidation-reduction potential of the binders was measured before and after mixing with aggregate using potentiometer. The influence of the addition of various cations on the hydrogen evolution and on the oxidation-reduction potential was observed. The effectiveness of the inhibitors was studied also visually by forming test elements...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{germination}} requirements, plant-soil interactions and population biology of Centaurea kilaea was studied. The plant and soil {{samples were collected}} from Sofular Village (Şile District) and shore of Çatalca District (Istanbul) in Turkey by using standard methods. Methods like Scheibler, Wetdigestion, Kjeldahl and Olsen were employed for measurement of soil texture, structure and other physical and chemical characteristics (pH, total protein and electrical conductivity) using spectrophotometer, flame photometer, <b>calcimeter</b> and ICP. The results showed that ranges of different elements in the soil were 0. 007 - 0. 2 % for N, 0. 0007 - 0. 001 % for P, 0. 001 - 0. 01 % for K, 0. 0001 - 0. 0002 % for Na. N, P, K and Na values in the plants were 2. 17, 0. 005, 0. 1 and 0. 006 %, respectively. The data revealed that germination success of the seeds {{was influenced by the}} environmental factors such as pH, germination season and temperature...|$|E
30|$|The cation {{exchange}} capacity (CEC) value {{is the number of}} negative sites that can store cations such as K, Ca, Mg, Na, and H+. This index provides information about the amount of swelling clays that the rock contains, as the types of clays are known from XRD analyses. CEC analyses were performed on selected cutting samples from the GRT- 2 well to quantify the amount of swelling clays (Fig.  2). The measurement was performed on crushed cuttings with the standard cobaltihexamine chloride method NF X 31 – 130 (1999). Calcimetry was performed on samples from both wells during the drilling and provided information about the relative amount of calcite, dolomite, or total carbonates in the cutting samples (Fig.  3). More precisely, the use of a <b>calcimeter</b> on the crushed and dried cuttings measures the quantity of CO 2 released by the reaction of the carbonates with HCl. The quantity of CO 2 released after 1  min gives the percentage of calcite, and the quantity of CO 2 released after 15  min gives the percentage of total carbonates. The difference between the total carbonate quantity and the calcite quantity is the amount of dolomite. The two superimposed curves reveal that only calcite is present in the granitic sections of the GRT- 1 and GRT- 2 wells.|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{mortar and}} plaster samples {{excavated}} in the archaeological site of Barsinia were mineralogically and petrographically examined by XRay Diffraction (XRD) and Stereo and Polarized Light Microscopy, while the total carbonate content {{was measured using}} a DietrichFruhling <b>Calcimeter.</b> The physical properties of the samples, such as water uptake under atmospheric pressure and under vacuum, together with density and porosity, were measured. Only twelve samples were available {{for the purposes of}} this study: 8 plaster samples and 4 mortar samples. Eleven samples out of the total number of samples were mortars or plasters with lime binder and silica aggregate; calcite and quartz were identified in all of these samples. In most of the samples one or more pozzolanic components were detected; a hydraulic effect therefore exists in practically most of the studied mortars. Excluding the plasters taken from waterbearing constructions such as cisterns, and the mortar sample from the compact floor, the binder content is high; in general, the overall porosity of the studied samples is high. Porosity and petrographic investigation results suggest that the burning temperature of the limestone was low and/or the duration of the combustion was short; such preparation conditions produce a desirable quicklime. Owing to the significant compositional and textural differences between the samples that were reported, there is consequently no suitable general mortar that can be adopted for the restoration of the whole site...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the potential of mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (MIRS) to predict soil organic and inorganic carbon contents with a 2086 -sample set representative of French topsoils (030 cm). Ground air-dried samples collected regularly using a 16 x 16 -km grid were analysed for total (dry combustion) and inorganic (<b>calcimeter)</b> carbon; organic carbon was calculated by difference. Calibrations of MIR spectra with partial least square regressions were developed with 1080 % of the set and five random selections of samples. Comparisons between samples with contrasting organic or inorganic carbon content and regression coefficients of calibration equations both showed that organic carbon was firstly associated with a wide spectral region around 2500 - 3500 cm- 1 (which was a reflection of its complex nature), and inorganic carbon with narrow spectral bands, especially around 2520 cm- 1. Optimal calibrations for both organic and inorganic carbon were achieved by using 20 % of the total set: predictions were not improved much by including more of the set and were less stable, probably because of atypical samples. At the 20 % rate, organic carbon predictions over the validation set (80 % of the total) yielded mean R 2, standard error of prediction (SEP) and RPD (ratio of standard deviation to SEP) of 0. 89, 6. 7 g kg- 1 and 3. 0, respectively; inorganic carbon predictions yielded 0. 97, 2. 8 g kg- 1 and 5. 6, respectively. This seemed appropriate for large-scale soil inventories and mapping studies but not for accurate carbon monitoring, possibly because carbonate soils were included. More work is needed on organic carbon calibrations for large-scale soil libraries...|$|E
40|$|In {{the western}} {{sector of the}} Southern Alps, tuffaceous levels areoccasionally found in the Triassic {{sedimentary}} sequences. The direct agecharacterisation of these layers is very limited: in fact, a U-Pb zircon ageof 245 ± 1 Ma is available only for the tuffites from Mt. San Giorgio area(Lugano, CH: [1]), which results slightly older than that expectedaccording to the stratigraphic position. Besides, no geochemicalinformation is presently available for these layers and the geodynamicsetting of the related volcanism is still matter of debate. Thus, with the aim to place further constraints of the geodynamicevolution of the Southern Alps in Mesozoic times and increase theaccuracy of the age record of the sedimentary sequence, we haveperformed a mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological study ontuffaceous deposits outcropping within the Anisian-Ladinian succession ofthe sedimentary cover of the Strona-Ceneri Zone in the Borgosesia area[2, 3] and recovered at the same stratigraphic position in wells of theVillafortuna-Trecate oil field (western Po Plain, Piedmont region, NW Italy:[4]). CO 2 concentration was determined by Dietrich-Früling <b>calcimeter.</b> XRD data indicate that such tuffaceous deposits are constituted by avariable mixture of magmatic and sedimentary components. Major andtrace element compostions, assessed by means of XRF analysis, suggest acalc-alkaline affinity for the magmatic component. To provide accurategeochronological constraints, zircons have been separated withconventional methods from four tuffaceaous outcrops, namely "Lembo diSostegno", "Lembo di Crevacuore" and "Lembo di Monte Fenera"outcrops, {{as well as from}} a buried tuffaceous sample of theVillafortuna-Trecate oil field. Zircons were mounted in epoxy resin andcharacterised under cathodoluminescence (CL). Based on colour,morphology and internal structure, they have been divided in twopopulations. One group is constituted by light-pink coloured zircons withprismatic habits and tight oscillatory zoning suggesting growth undermagmatic conditions. The zircons from the second group are colourless,rounded in shape and with only relics of magmatic zoning, consistent withmetamorphic recrystallization. U-Pb ELA-ICP-MS data point to ages of 237 ± 8 Ma and 229 ± 9 Ma for the magmatic growth of the zircons from thetuffites of "Lembo di Crevacuore" and "Lembo di Sostegno", respectively,which are in agreement with their stratigraphic position. The volcanicactivity producing these layers might be linked to the intrusive Triassicmagmatism documented in the Finero Complex (NE Ivrea-Verbano Zone[5, 6]). Conversely, the zircons from the "Lembo di Monte Fenera" andVillafortuna-Trecate oil field produce a very large range ofcrystallisation-recrystallisation ages, which span from Proterozoic toPaleozoic to the Permian-Triassic boundary, thus indicating a dominantcontribution of the crystalline basement to the zircon population...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{stepwise}} method for {{assessment of the}} HP 12 is proposed and tested with 49 waste samples. The hazard property HP 12 is defined as “Release of an acute toxic gas”: waste which releases acute toxic gases (Acute Tox. 1, 2 or 3) in contact with water or an acid. When a waste contains a substance {{assigned to one of}} the following supplemental hazards EUH 029, EUH 031 and EUH 032, it shall be classified as hazardous by HP 12 according to test methods or guidelines (EC, 2014 a, 2014 b). When the substances with the cited hazard statement codes react with water or an acid, they can release HCl, Cl 2, HF, HCN, PH 3, H 2 S, SO 2 (and two other gases very unlikely to be emitted, hydrazoic acid HN 3 and selenium oxide SeO 2 – a solid with low vapor pressure). Hence, a method is proposed : - 1. Measurement of the volume of gases emitted into contact with water or an acid (solid/liquid ratio of 10 L water or acid/kg raw waste, acid 2. 5 M HNO 3). - 2. If gas is emitted at a rate higher than 0. 1 L of gas/kg waste in 5 min (limit of quantification of the automated calcimètre used here), checking if one of the cited gases is emitted with electrochemical detection probes or simple qualitative colorimetric methods. - 3. If one of these gases is detected, speciation of the emitting substance(s) (calculation by the “worst case” method from elements concentrations, or by specific analytic methods) and checking whether they have a hazard statement code EUH 029, EUH 031 or EUH 032 (a list is provided). For a set of 49 waste, water addition did not produce gas. Nearly all the solid waste produced a gas in contact with hydrochloric acid in 5 min in an automated <b>calcimeter</b> with a volume > 0. 1 L of gas per kg of waste. Since a plateau of pressure is reached only for half of the samples in 5 min, 6 h trial with calorimetric bombs or glass flasks were done and confirmed the results. Identification of the gases by portable probes showed that most of the tested samples emit mainly CO 2. Toxic gases are emitted by four waste: metallic dust from the aluminum industry (CO), two air pollution control residue of industrial waste incinerator (H 2 S) and a halogenated solvent (organic volatile(s) compound(s)). HF has not been measured in these trials started before the present definition of HP 12. According to the definition of HP 12, only the H 2 S emission of substances with hazard statement EUH 031 is accounted for. In view of the calcium content of the two air pollution control residue, the presence of calcium sulphide (EUH 031) can be assumed. These two waste are therefore classified potentially hazardous for HP 12, from a total of 49 waste. They are also classified as hazardous for other properties (HP 7, 10 and 14 for one of them, and HP 10 and 14 for the other one respectively). Given these results, it can be assumed that few common household and industrial waste will be classified hazardous only by HP 12...|$|E
