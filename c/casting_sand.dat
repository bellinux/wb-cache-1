5000|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>casting,</b> {{also known}} as <b>sand</b> molded <b>casting,</b> is a metal casting process {{characterized}} by using sand as the mold material. The term [...] "sand casting" [...] can also refer to an object produced via the <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process. <b>Sand</b> castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss {{research}} into bronze casting techniques as practiced during the XIXth and early XXth century. Both natural <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> (fonte au sable naturel) and {{lost wax casting}} (fonte à la cire perdue) were employed during this period and sometimes rivalled for commissions. Before the XIXth century {{the vast majority of}} sculpures were cast by the lost wax casting method. Innovations in <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> around 1800 changed this situation. The next decades would see a gradual shift away from lost wax <b>casting</b> towards <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and by the second quarter of the XIXth century <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> becomes the preferred casting method for the founding of sculture in France, Germany and Britain. This process of <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> was highly skilled and used piece moulds made from compacted natural clayey sand. Eventually innovations in lost wax casting {{during the first half of}} the XXth century shifted the balance from <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> to lost wax <b>casting</b> and natural <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> was gradually replaced between the 1950 s and 1970 s...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the {{sculpture}} (16 feet 8½ inches) the lost-wax casting method was not used. Instead, the statue was divided into ten sections. A mold {{for each of these}} segments was produced using the <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> method (<b>sand</b> mixed with epoxy forms to the outer shape of the statue and then hardens creating the mold). Graphite was dusted over the foam to prevent it from adhering to the <b>sand</b> <b>cast.</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> requires less welding and repairing {{at the end of the}} process.|$|R

50|$|A single {{consumer}} market demand can {{give rise to}} hundreds of business market demands. The demand for cars creates demands for castings, forgings, plastic components, steel and tires.

50|$|Patterns {{continue}} to be needed for <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> of metals. For the production of gray iron, ductile iron and steel castings, <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> remains {{the most widely used}} process. For aluminum castings, <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> represents about 12% of the total tonnage by weight (surpassed only by die casting at 57%, and semi-permanent and permanent mold at 19%; based on 2006 shipments).

5000|$|Unfortunately, {{producing}} {{an entirely new}} product from scratch is never without initial problems, and the Vision suffered from a few. An off-idle carburetion quirk, known as the [...] "Vision stumble", meant the first year machines were prone to initial stuttering on part and full-throttle takeoff.

The problem, it seemed, wasn't a Yamaha development problem at all, but was actually a lean spot, just off idle, caused by {{what appeared to be}} residual <b>casting</b> <b>sand</b> that filled the off-idle bleed holes at the throttle butterfly plate in the Weber-style Mikuni carb.

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{simplest}} types of casting, and has been used for centuries. <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> allows for smaller batches than permanent mold casting and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> such as very small-size operations. The process allows for castings small enough fit in the palm of one's hand to those large enough only for train beds (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car). <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.|$|R

50|$|The lost-wax {{process can}} be used with any {{material}} that can burn, melt, or evaporate to leave a mould cavity. Some automobile manufacturers use a lost-foam technique to make engine blocks.

The metal is poured in, vaporizing the foam with its heat.|$|E

5000|$|Shell molding {{is similar}} to sand casting, but the molding cavity is formed by a {{hardened}} [...] "shell" [...] of sand instead of a flask filled with sand. The sand used is finer than sand <b>casting</b> <b>sand</b> and is mixed with a resin {{so that it can}} be heated by the pattern and hardened into a shell around the pattern. Because of the resin and finer sand, it gives a much finer surface finish. The process is easily automated and more precise than sand casting. Common metals that are cast include cast iron, aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. This process is ideal for complex items that are small to medium-sized.|$|E
50|$|The ionic {{surface of}} {{bentonite}} has a useful property {{in making a}} sticky coating on sand grains. When {{a small proportion of}} finely ground bentonite clay is added to hard sand and wetted, the clay binds the sand particles into a moldable aggregate known as green sand used for making molds in sand casting. Some river deltas naturally deposit just such a blend of clay silt and sand, creating a natural source of excellent molding sand that was critical to ancient metalworking technology. Modern chemical processes to modify the ionic surface of bentonite greatly intensify this stickiness, resulting in remarkably dough-like yet strong <b>casting</b> <b>sand</b> mixes that stand up to molten metal temperatures.|$|E
50|$|With a {{completed}} mold {{at the appropriate}} moisture content, the box containing the sand mold is then positioned for filling with molten metal - typically iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, magnesium alloys, or various pot metal alloys, which often include lead, tin, and zinc. After being filled with liquid metal the box is set aside until the metal is sufficiently cool to be strong. The sand is then removed, revealing a rough casting that, {{in the case of}} iron or steel, may still be glowing red. In the case of metals that are significantly heavier than the <b>casting</b> <b>sand,</b> such as iron or lead, the casting flask is often covered with a heavy plate to prevent a problem known as floating the mold. Floating the mold occurs when the pressure of the metal pushes the sand above the mold cavity out of shape, causing the casting to fail.|$|E
50|$|The {{process can}} be used for both small {{castings}} of a few ounces and large castings weighing several hundred pounds. It can be more expensive than die <b>casting</b> or <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> but per-unit costs decrease with large volumes. Investment casting can produce complicated shapes that would be difficult or impossible with other casting methods. It can also produce products with exceptional surface qualities and low tolerances with minimal surface finishing or machining required.|$|R
