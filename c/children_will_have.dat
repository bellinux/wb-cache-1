5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E

As {{a significant part}} of his philanthropic contributions, the organization was formed to develop self-esteem and focus in at-risk children as a tactic to keep them away from drug-related pressure by training them in martial arts. Norris hopes that by shifting {{middle school and high school}} children's focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavour, these <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to build a better future for themselves.|$|E
25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (I {{had read}} / I will have read). They {{are used in}} various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book because I had already read it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> badly missed their parents.|$|E

5000|$|Baller-Gerold {{syndrome}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that an affected child gets one mutant allele from each parent {{to produce the}} syndrome. [...] A carrier is someone who has one mutant allele but does not does have any symptoms. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance the <b>child</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> BGS. There is also a 50% chance the <b>child</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> one mutant copy (be a carrier) and be asymptomatic and a 25% chance the <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be asymptomatic and not a carrier. In order for someone to have BGS, {{they need to have}} two mutant copies of the gene. Adults may pursue genetic counselling to understand the syndrome, as well as the risks and choices regarding family planning.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{attempting}} VBAC {{reduces the risk}} that the <b>child</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> respiratory problems after birth such as infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), as rates are estimated at 2-3% with planned VBAC and 3-4% with ERCS.|$|R
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{development}} of CF in the fetus requires each parent {{to pass on}} a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that parent is a CFTR gene mutation carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> CF. CF can result {{from more than a}} thousand different mutations. As of 2016, typically only the most common mutations are tested for, such as ΔF508 Most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.|$|E

2500|$|In 1852, the Utah {{legislature}} passed Act in Relation to Service which carried {{penalties for}} whites who had {{sexual relations with}} blacks.

He then prophesied that if the Church were approve of intermarriage with blacks, that the Church {{would go on to}} destruction and the priesthood would be taken away. The seed of Cain generally referred to those with dark skin who were of African descent. In 1863 during a sermon criticizing the federal government, Young said that the penalty for interracial reproduction between whites and blacks was death.|$|E

The United Nations coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry condemned the decision: [...] "These actions heighten tensions and undermine international efforts to create conditions for fruitful negotiations to achieve peace." [...] The US State Department called it a [...] violation of Israel's obligations under the Road map for peace. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said [...] "Tonight, while these new settlers from abroad will be accommodating themselves and their belongings in these Palestinian houses, 19 newly homeless <b>children</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> nowhere to sleep." [...] Yakir Segev of the Jerusalem municipal council responded: [...] "This {{is a matter of}} the court.
