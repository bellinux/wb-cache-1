The {{concentration}} of <b>cetiedil</b> required for 50 % inhibition of erythrocyte sickling was about 140 micro M. An antisickling effect was achieved {{regardless of whether}} <b>cetiedil</b> was added before or after deoxygenation.

40|$|<b>Cetiedil</b> is a {{potential}} antisickling agent whose major effect appears {{to be at the}} erythrocyte membrane. To test the hypothesis that <b>cetiedil</b> alters cation transport, we studied the effect of the drug in promoting changes in cell water (Wc), cell sodium (Nac), and cell potassium (Kc). Results are quite different depending on the presence or near absence of intracellular ATP. With fresh cells, 100 microM <b>cetiedil</b> causes little in the net cation or water movements compared with control cells incubated for 2 h. At <b>cetiedil</b> concentrations greater than 100 microM, however, net movements of sodium and potassium increase considerably, and cell swelling results from a net Nac gain that exceeds a net Kc loss. All water movements can be accounted for by cetiedil-induced net cation movements. When 100 microM ouabain is added along with <b>cetiedil,</b> net Nac gain, net Kc loss, and net Wc gain are all increased compared with results obtained with <b>cetiedil</b> alone. External calcium inhibits cetiedil-induced changes in cation transport. With cells depleted of their ATP, <b>cetiedil</b> inhibits the typical potassium loss that occurs in the presence of external calcium; net sodium uptake changes little under these conditions, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} external calcium. Our findings indicate a complex mode of action for <b>cetiedil</b> on the erythrocyte membrane, and support the hypothesis that the erythrocyte membrane, and support the hypothesis that the antisickling effect of the drug observed in vitro results from dilution of intracellular hemoglobin secondary to net salt and water gain...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cetiedil</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to relieve painful crises in sickle cell anemia and to have antisickling properties in vitro. The drug alters neither oxygen affinity nor the solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S. Because the viscosity of the erythrocyte interior and the kinetics of gelation are dependent on the concentration of hemoglobin, we postulated that <b>cetiedil</b> might inhibit sickling by modifying erythrocyte sodium or potassium movements in a manner that would increase cell water content and thus dilute the cell hemoglobin. The drug has two such effects: it inhibits the specific increase in potassium permeability that follows a rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration and it causes a rise in passive sodium movements. These effects are further evidence that cell ion and water movements may be important in the process of sickling and suggest a mechanism for the results reported with <b>cetiedil...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{actions of}} some inhibitors of the Ca 2 +-activated K+ {{permeability}} in mammalian red cells have been compared. Block of the permeability was assessed from {{the reduction in}} the net loss of K+ that followed the application of the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 (2 [*]μM) to rabbit red cells suspended at a haematocrit of 1 % in a low potassium solution ([K] 0 0. 12 – 0. 17 [*]mM) at 37 °C. Net movement of K+ was measured using a K+-sensitive electrode placed in the suspension. The concentrations (μM±s. d.) of the compounds tested causing 50 % inhibition of K+ loss were: quinine, 37 ± 3; <b>cetiedil,</b> 26 ± 1; the <b>cetiedil</b> congeners UCL 1269, UCL 1274 and UCL 1495, ∼ 150, 8. 2 ± 0. 1, 0. 92 ± 0. 03 respectively; clotrimazole, 1. 2 ± 0. 1; nitrendipine, 3. 6 ± 0. 5 and charybdotoxin, 0. 015 ± 0. 002. The characteristics of the block suggested that compounds could be placed in two groups. For one set (quinine, <b>cetiedil,</b> and the UCL congeners), the concentration-inhibition curves were steeper (Hill coefficient, nH, ⩾ 2. 7) than for the other (clotrimazole, nitrendipine, charybdotoxin) for which nH≈amp; 1. Compounds in the first set alone became less active on raising the concentration of K+ in the external solution to 5. 4 [*]mM. The rate of K+ loss induced by A 23187 slowed in the presence of high concentrations of <b>cetiedil</b> and its analogues, suggesting a use-dependent component to the inhibitory action. This was not seen with clotrimazole. The blocking action of the <b>cetiedil</b> analogue UCL 1274 could not be overcome by an increase in external Ca 2 + and its potency was unaltered when K+ loss was induced by the application of Pb 2 + (10 [*]μM) rather than by A 23187. These results, taken with the findings of others, suggest that agents that block the red cell Ca 2 +-activated K+ permeability can be placed in two groups with different mechanisms of action. The differences can be explained by supposing that clotrimazole and charybdotoxin act at the outer face of the channel whereas <b>cetiedil</b> and its congeners may block within it, either at or near the K+ binding site that determines the flow of K+...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} relaxants, bepridil and <b>cetiedil,</b> {{were found to}} possess specific CaM-inhibitory properties which resembled those of trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine, bepridil, and <b>cetiedil</b> inhibited Ca 2 +-dependent 125 I-CaM binding to erythrocyte membranes and CaM activation of membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase with IC 50 values of approximately 12, approximately 17, and approximately 40 microM, respectively. This {{does not appear to}} be the result of a nonspecific hydrophobic interaction since inhibition was not observed with micromolar concentrations of many other hydrophobic agents. The predominant inhibition of binding and Ca 2 +-ATPase activation was competitive with respect to CaM. Bepridil and <b>cetiedil</b> bind directly to CaM since these drugs displaced [3 H]trifluoperazine from sites on CaM. Inhibition of Ca 2 +-ATPase and binding by the drugs was not due to interference with the catalytic activity of this enzyme since: (a) neither inhibition of CaM-independent basal Ca 2 +-ATPase activity nor inhibition of proteolytically-activated Ca 2 +-ATPase activities were produced by these agents, and (b) no drug-induced inhibition of CaM binding was detected when membranes were preincubated with these agents but washed prior to addition of 125 I-CaM. Thus, bepridil and <b>cetiedil</b> competitively inhibit Ca 2 +-dependent interactions of CaM with erythrocyte membranes, most likely by a direct interaction between these drugs and CaM. The principal clinical actions of these drugs may be explained by their interactions with CaM or CaM-related proteins leading to reduced activation of Ca 2 +-regulated enzymes in certain other tissues, such as myosin light chain kinase in vascular smooth muscle. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the pharmacology of three inwardly rectifying K+-channels in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, IKAch, IKI, IKAtp- using whole cell voltage clamp techniques. Cells were held at - 50 mV. A previous study has shown that clotrimazole, an antimycotic agent, and <b>cetiedil,</b> an antisickling agent are potent against the IKACch in atrial myocytes. Structural analogues of these compounds were tested on the three inward rectifiers. UCL 1880, an analogue of clotrimazole was found to be potent on the G-protein gated channel, IKACh (with an IC 50 of 0. 18 μM. Concentrations which caused an almost maximum block of this current were relatively ineffective on the IK 1 and IKATP. UCL 1495, an analogue of <b>cetiedil,</b> had an IC 50 of 0. 46 μM against the Gprotein gated current. It was ineffective on the IK 1 and the IKATP current. Both of the compounds exhibited use-dependence but not voltage dependence. Glibenclamide, a sulphonylurea, was tested on IKATP and IKACh as it has been suggested that the adenosine activation of IKACh includes the activation of IKATP. Glibenclamide was found to be far more effective on the IKATP The concentrations which were effective on IKAtp did not block the IKACh or the IK 1. Barium was also tested on these three channels to see if there was any selectivity in its action. It had IC 50 values of 34. 9 μM on IKACh, 16. 8 μM on IK 1 and 164. 5 μM on IKATP. The block on IKAch was voltage dependent, increasing at negative potentials, with an IC 5 o of 3. 8 μM at - 120 mV. UCL 1880 and UCL 1495 are selective for IKACh and may be used as pharmacological tools to compare and contrast other G-protein gated currents to the native atrial channel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing superfused mouse liver slices {{combined}} with a conventional microelectrode technique, we investigated: (1) the ionic mechanisms involved in the hyperpolarization of the hepatocyte membrane induced by lactate and other gluconeogenic substrates; (2) whether these mechanisms {{are similar to those}} underlying the hyperpolarization induced by cell swelling in hypo-osmotic medium; and (3) whether the hyperpolarizing effect of lactate on the hepatocyte membrane is related to gluconeogenesis. Lactate (5 mmol/l) hyperpolarized the hepatocyte membrane after an exposure of 10 – 20 min, and the hyperpolarization was still present after 70 min. The hyperpolarization induced by lactate, pyruvate (5 mmol/l) and fructose (10 mmol/l), and by exposure to hypo-osmotic medium (250 mosmol/l) was antagonized by ouabain, tetraethylammonium (TEA), and <b>cetiedil</b> (lactate; hypo-osmotic medium). Hyperpolarization induced by lactate was eliminated or attenuated by agents impairing activation of Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels, by amiloride, and by a blockade of non-selective cation channels with flufenamic acid and gadolinium. Thapsigargin, increasing cytosolic Ca 2 +, mimicked lactate’s hyperpolarizing effect. Lactate’s effect was dependent on extracellular Ca 2 +. Finally, lactate’s hyperpolarizing effect was reduced by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. These findings suggest that metabolism of lactate hyperpolarizes hepatocytes by mechanisms analogous to those underlying the hyperpolarization induced by cell swelling in hypo-osmotic medium. Gluconeogenesis from lactate may cause cell swelling, subsequent activation of Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels and of the Na+/K+-ATPase, and thus hyperpolarize the hepatocyte membrane...|$|E
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (PBL), when placed into hypotonic media, first swell and then shrink {{back to their}} original volumes because of a rapid KCl leakage via volume-activated K+ and anion permeation pathways. By using gramicidin, a cation channel-forming ionophore, cation transport through the cell membrane can be shunted so that the salt fluxes and thus the volume changes are limited by {{the rate of the}} net anion movements. The "gramicidin method," supplemented with direct measurements of volume-induced ion fluxes, can be used to assess the effects of drugs and of various treatments on cation and anion permeabilities. It is demonstrated that quinine and <b>cetiedil</b> are much more effective blockers of volume-induced K+ transport than of Cl- transport, while dipyridamole, DIDS, and NIP-taurine inhibit only volume-induced Cl- movement. Oligomycins block both cation and anion transport pathways, oligomycin A being more effective in inhibiting K+ transport and oligomycin C preferentially blocking Cl- movement. Ca depletion of PBL abolishes volume-induced K+ transport but has no effect on Cl- transport. Repletion of cell calcium by ionophore A 23187 immediately restores rapid K+ transport without significantly affecting volume-induced Cl- transport. These observations, taken together with other reported information, can be best explained by a model in which cell swelling activates independent Cl- and K+ conductance pathways, the latter being similar in properties to the Ca 2 +-activated K+ transport observed in various cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|Nine bis-quinolinyl and bis-quinolinium {{compounds}} {{related to}} dequalinium, and previously shown to block apamin-sensitive small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels (SKCa), {{have been tested}} for their inhibitory effects on actions mediated by intermediate conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels (IKCa) in rabbit blood cells. In most experiments, a K+-sensitive electrode was employed to monitor the IKCa-mediated net loss of cell K+ that followed {{the addition of the}} Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 (2 [*]μM) to red cells suspended at an haematocrit of 1 % in a low K+ (0. 12 – 0. 17 [*]mM) solution. The remainder used an optical method based on measuring the reduction in light transmission that occurred on applying A 23187 (0. 4 or 2 [*]μM) to a very dilute suspension of red cells (haematocrit 0. 02 %). Of the compounds tested, the most potent IKCa blocker was 1, 12 bis[(2 -methylquinolin- 4 -yl) amino]dodecane (UCL 1407) which had an IC 50 of 0. 85 ± 0. 06 [*]μM (mean±s. d. mean). The inhibitory action of UCL 1407 and its three most active congeners was characterized by (i) a Hill slope greater than unity, (ii) sensitivity to an increase in external [K+], and (iii) a time course of onset that suggested use-dependence. Also, the potency of the nonquaternary compounds tested increased with their predicted lipophilicity. These findings suggested that the IKCa blocking action resembles that of <b>cetiedil</b> rather than of clotrimazole. Some quaternized members of the series were also active. The most potent was the monoquaternary UCL 1440 ((1 -[N-[1 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) - 2 -methylquinolinium- 4 -yl]amino]- 10 -[N′-(2 -methylquinolinium- 4 yl) amino] decane (trifluoroacetate) which had an IC 50 of 1. 8 ± 0. 1 [*]μM. The corresponding bisquaternary UCL 1438 (1, 10 -bis[N-[1 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) - 2 -methylquinolinium- 4 -yl]amino] decane bis(trifluoroacetate) was almost as active (IC 50 2. 7 ± 0. 3 [*]μM). A bis-aminoquinolium cyclophane (UCL 1684) had little IKCa blocking action despite its great potency at SKCa channels (IC 50 4. 1 ± 0. 2 [*]nM). The main outcome is the identification of new intermediate-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel blockers {{with a wide range of}} IKCa/SKCa selectivities...|$|E
