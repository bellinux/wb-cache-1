An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} least squares estimation of the parameters of two–dimensional (2 -D) exponential signals observed {{in the presence of}} an additive noise field, when the assumed number of exponentials is incorrect. We consider both <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> number of exponential signals is underestimated, and <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> number of exponential signals is overestimated. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> number of exponential signals is underestimated, we prove the almost sure convergence of the least squares estimates (LSE) to the parameters of the dominant exponentials. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> number of exponential signals is overestimated, the estimated parameter vector obtained by the least squares estimator contains a subvector that converges almost surely to the correct parameters of the exponentials.

However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium.
