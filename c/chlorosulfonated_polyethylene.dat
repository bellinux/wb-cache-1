It appeared that zinc oxide deposed on the silica surface is more effective cross-linking agent than ZnO introduced alone into the rubber mix during its preparation. Using silica modified with zinc oxide for <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> curing led to formation non-covalent network bonds.

40|$|Polymers and polymer-based {{composite}} materials with electrically-conductive properties are materials with various potential uses. Novel materials are becoming available in each field and new products are continuously being produced. Amid these new materials, conductive elastomers are presently being employed as antistatic {{materials in the}} carpets, antistatic coatings, sensors and electromagnetic screening. One promising method for making this type of material is to introduce carbon black or metal fillers, or more currently conducting polymer powders into natural or synthetic rubbers. Several polyaniline-rubber blends, mostly with poor electrical conductivity, {{have been reported in}} the literature. An important aim of this work was to improve the compatibility, thermal stability, electrical and mechanical properties of this kind of blend, produced by different mixing techniques for instance solution and thermo-mechanical with further methodical mixing processes and greater improved mixing circumstances. Polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene rubber, <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> rubber and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA) were selected for study as blends in this project, since the solubility parameters of polyepichlorohydrin rubber, polychloroprene, chlorosulfonated polethylene and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate were calculated to be well-matched, and also because the polyepichlorohydrin rubber (PECH), polychloroprene rubber (PCR) and <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSPE) were thermally stable and easily obtainable. No previous literature was discovered in relation to the electrical properties of the polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene or <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> blends with polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA). Hence, the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers were also chosen in this work with the purpose of studying them. Non-vulcanised PECH/P Ani-DBSA, non- vulcanised PCRlPAni-DBSA and non-vulcanised CSPEIPAni-DBSA blends with appropriate electrical conductivities were produced by solution mixing for the first time in this project. Blends of the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers and polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, consisting of various proportions of P Ani- DBSA, were cast from solution onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates with the aim of making electrically conductive films. Electrical conductivities of the cast films of non-vulcanised blends were calculated. Decomposition steps of electrical conductive polymer blends were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stabilities of the PECHlPAni-DBSA, PCRJPAni-DBSA and CSPEIP Ani-DBSA blends were affected by the proportion of polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate to the rubbers. The influence of composition on the glass transitions in the blends was defined by the use of thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Electrically conductive polymer blends of vulcanised PECHIPAni-DBSA were prepared by the use of an internal mixer for the first time. A remarkable agreement was seen in that both the vulcanised and the nonvulcanised blends had the electrical conductivities of the order of 10 - 8 S. cm- 1 with approximately 20 wt...|$|E
40|$|Current and {{projected}} rigorous environmental regulations are forcing {{the aerospace industry}} to investigate and implement safer stripping alternatives to conventional processes. Naval Aviation Depot Jacksonville has taken a lead in implementing and exploring new and innovative alternatives to non-compliant processes during aircraft maintenance and overhaul. Faced with such a task in a limited time frame (laws are changing dynamically), often technical people overlook simple solutions and seek more complicated chemically-based stripping mechanisms. The sealantlrubber stripping alternative investigated and presented here is based on basic thermodynamic principles and inherent materials behavior. The process involves a low temperature bath using a heat transfer medium for means of stripping a <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> rubber off a fighter plane transmission hinge. Stripping mechanism was achieved via {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} differentials and low-temperature materials behavior. Favorable results were obtained. BACKGROUN...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{for using}} {{modified}} single wall carbon nanotubes ("SWCNTs") to detect presence and/or concentration {{of a gas}} component, such as a halogen (e. g., Cl. sub. 2), hydrogen halides (e. g., HCl), a hydrocarbon (e. g., C. sub. nH. sub. 2 n+ 2), an alcohol, an aldehyde or a ketone, to which an unmodified SWCNT is substantially non-reactive. In a first embodiment, a connected network of SWCNTs is coated with a selected polymer, such as <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> hydroxypropyl cellulose, polystyrene and/or polyvinylalcohol, and change in an electrical parameter or response value (e. g., conductance, current, voltage difference or resistance) of the coated versus uncoated SWCNT networks is analyzed. In a second embodiment, the network is doped with a transition element, such as Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru, Os and/or Au, and change in an electrical parameter value is again analyzed. The parameter change value depends monotonically, not necessarily linearly, upon concentration of the gas component. Two general algorithms are presented for estimating concentration value(s), or upper or lower concentration bounds on such values, from measured differences of response values...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the effect of {{conductive}} carbon black (Ensaco 350 G) on the physico-mechanical and electrical properties of <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM) rubber vulcanizates. The physico-mechanical properties like tensile strength, tear strength, elongation at break, compression set, hardness and abrasion resistance have been studied before and after heat ageing. Up to 30 parts per hundred rubber (phr) filler loading both tensile and tear strength increases beyond which it {{shows a decreasing trend}} whereas modulus gradually increases with the filler loading. Incorporation of carbon black increases the hysteresis loss of filled vulcanizates compared to gum vulcanizates. Unlike gum vulcanizate, in filled vulcanizates the rate of relaxation shows increasing trend. The bound rubber content is found to increase with increase in filler loading. Dielectric relaxation spectra were used to study the relaxation behavior as a function of frequency (100 to 106 Hz) at room temperature. Variation in real and imaginary parts of electric modulus has been explained on the basis of interfacial polarization of fillers in the polymer medium. The percolation limit of the conductive black as studied by ac conductivity measurements has also been reported...|$|E
40|$|A rubbery ionomer of {{zinc salt}} of {{sulfonated}} natural rubbers (Zn-SNR) was synthesized {{and used as}} a new compatibilizerfor the blends of natural rubber (NR) and <b>chlorosulfonated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CSM). Epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) was also used for the preparation of NR/CSM blends. The effect of ionomer concentration on melt viscosity of the 50 / 50 (%wt/wt) NR/CSM blends at different constant shear rates was characterized. It {{was found that the}} incorporation of ionomerincreased shear viscosity of the blends, indicating an increase in interfacial interaction between the NR and CSM. Themaximum shear viscosity was observed when the ionomer of 10 % by weight of NR was added into the blends. The tensile,tear, oil resistant properties and morphology of the various 20 / 80 NR/CSM blends with and without the Zn-SNR and ENR atthe 10 % wt of NR were examined. The 100 % modulus, tensile strength, tear strength and oil resistance of the compatibilizedblends improved over those of the uncompatibilized blends. The blends compatibilized with the Zn-SNR showed higher levelsof improvement in modulus, tensile and tear strength than those of ENR. The tensile strength of 20 / 80 blends with the Zn-SNRand ENR compatibilizers increased by 38 and 30 % over the corresponding neat blends. Furthermore, the addition of ionomerand ENR resulted in decreased domain of dispersed NR phase size and improved interfacial adhesion between the NR andCSM, indicating enhanced blend compatibility. These results suggest that the Zn-SNR is a new effective compatibilizer forNR and CSM blends...|$|E
