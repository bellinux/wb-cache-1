5|$|SR 177 {{begins at}} I-10 near Desert Center and briefly travels north, {{intersecting}} with CR R2. At this intersection, SR 177 turns northeast and travels across the Mojave Desert, through the <b>Chuckwalla</b> Valley.

SR 177 briefly turns northeast again before intersecting with SR 62 and defaulting onto SR 62 eastbound.|$|E

500|$|Attending {{high school}} in Wadsworth and Reno and college at Nevada State University (now known as the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant {{developed}} interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball. She edited the [...] "Young Ladies Edition" [...] of the Student Record in 1905, wrote a short story, [...] "The Way of a Flirt", for a literary magazine, <b>Chuckwalla,</b> and contributed sketches to it and another publication, Artemisia. Depressed {{after the death of}} her step-grandfather in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in Jolon, California, where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans. [...] That summer she moved to Eugene, Oregon, where her brother Louis worked for the Southern Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|The genus Sauromalus {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in biomes of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts. [...] The common <b>chuckwalla</b> (S. ater) is the species with the greatest range, found from southern California east to southern Nevada and Utah and western Arizona, and south to Baja California and northwestern Mexico. The peninsular <b>chuckwalla</b> (S. australis) is found on the eastern portion of the southern half of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|Chuckwallas are stocky, wide-bodied lizards with {{flattened}} midsections {{and prominent}} bellies. Their tails are thick, tapering to a blunt tip. [...] Loose folds of skin characterize {{the neck and}} sides of their bodies, which are covered in small, coarsely granular scales. The common <b>chuckwalla</b> (Sauromalus ater) measures 15 3/4 inches long, whereas insular species such as the San Esteban <b>chuckwalla</b> of San Esteban Island (Sauromalus varius) can measure as long as 30 in.|$|E
2500|$|Harmless to humans, these lizards {{are known}} to run from {{potential}} threats. [...] When disturbed, a <b>chuckwalla</b> [...] wedges itself into a tight rock crevice and inflates its lungs to entrench itself.|$|E
2500|$|The Comca’ac (Seri) {{considered}} the Angel Island species of <b>chuckwalla</b> an important food item. [...] They {{are believed to}} have translocated the lizards to most of the islands in Bahia de los Angeles for use as a food source in times of need.|$|E

50|$|The Montserrat <b>chuckwalla</b> prefers {{dwelling}} in {{lava flows}} and rocky areas with {{nooks and crannies}} available for a retreat when threatened. These areas are typically vegetated by creosote bush and cholla cacti, which form the staple of its diet as the <b>chuckwalla</b> is primarily herbivorous. The <b>chuckwalla</b> also feeds on leaves, fruit and flowers of annuals, perennial plants, and even weeds; insects represent a supplementary prey if eaten at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} <b>chuckwalla</b> {{derives from the}} Shoshone word tcaxxwal or Cahuilla caxwal, {{transcribed}} by Spaniards as chacahuala. The Seri people named originally the island for this species: Coftécöl lifa or the Peninsula of the Giant <b>Chuckwalla.</b>|$|E
50|$|The peninsular <b>chuckwalla</b> (Sauromalus australis) is {{a lizard}} {{belonging}} to the family Iguanidae. It {{is in the same}} genus as the other <b>chuckwalla</b> species. S. australis inhabits southeastern Baja California and eastern Baja California Sur in Mexico.|$|E

50|$|The Comca’ac {{considered}} this species of <b>chuckwalla</b> an important food item. So much so, a few lizards were cross-bred with San Esteban chuckwallas and translocated {{to most of}} the islands in Bahia de los Angeles: Isla San Lorenzo Norte, Isla San Lorenzo Sur, and Tiburón Island by the Seri people for use as a food source in times of need. This was before the founding of America and most of these populations appear to have died out, but the process was repeated by herpeticulturalists in the early 2000s as a way of legally producing a San Esteban-like <b>chuckwalla</b> that the average reptile enthusiast could keep. The crosses are fertile and seem to have the best traits of both species - the brighter coloration of the San Esteban <b>chuckwalla</b> with the calmer temperament of the Angel Island <b>chuckwalla.</b>|$|E
