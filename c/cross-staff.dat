5|$|Gotland, {{as a free}} {{republic}} loosely {{associated with}} the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with a banner (Agnus Dei) as a well-known city seal by 1280. Although the island belonged to Denmark at the time, its arms were present at Gustav Vasa's funeral procession in 1560; the arms of Gotland disappeared from the Swedish rolls in 1570 but returned with the transfer of Gotland to Sweden in 1645. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: Azure, a ram statant argent armed Or, bearing on a <b>cross-staff</b> of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third. The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same arms on a red field, influenced by the arms of Visby.|$|E
25|$|In {{the thirteenth}} century {{celestial}} navigation was already known, guided by the sun position. For celestial navigation the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used Arab navigation tools, like the astrolabe and quadrant, which they made easier and simpler. They also created the <b>cross-staff,</b> or cane of Jacob, for measuring at sea {{the height of the}} sun and other stars. The Southern Cross become a reference upon arrival at the Southern hemisphere by João de Santarém and Pedro Escobar in 1471, starting the celestial navigation on this constellation. But the results varied throughout the year, which required corrections.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{technological}} inventions of the period– {{whether of}} Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations– {{were to have}} great influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the <b>cross-staff,</b> the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had a greater impact on everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.|$|E

25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral <b>cross-staff,</b> used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the devices}} used for {{astronomy}} was gnomon, known as Sanku, {{in which the}} shadow of a vertical rod is applied on a horizontal plane in order to ascertain the cardinal directions, the latitude of the point of observation, and the time of observation. This device finds mention in the works of Varāhamihira, Āryabhata, Bhāskara, Brahmagupta, among others. The <b>Cross-staff,</b> known as Yasti-yantra, was used by the time of Bhaskara II (1114–1185 CE). This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles {{with the help of a}} calibrated scale. The clepsydra (Ghatī-yantra) was used in India for astronomical purposes until recent times. Ōhashi (2008) notes that: [...] "Several astronomers also described water-driven instruments such as the model of fighting sheep." ...|$|E

Strategically located {{throughout the}} city are 6 frontline engines, 2 <b>cross-staffed</b> trucks, two frontline ambulances, and a battalion chief per shifts. County wide mutual aid provides relief and additional support during large scale incidents and during high call volume. Because the majority (70%) of calls are EMS related, a paramedic is onboard all engines. Also, additional ambulances are stored at station 55 (medic 55) and 56 (medic 56). While these units are not staffed full-time, they are cross staffed by {{the crew of the}} Engine company and can respond if Medics 51 and 53 are committed to calls.|$|R

By keeping buildings up to code, controlling illegal occupancies, monitoring the safety of living areas and issuing licenses and permits, the department works to limit the potential for dangerous situations and the occurrences of fire hazards. The PFD operates out of three fire stations, located throughout the city, and operates and maintains a fire apparatus fleet of four engines, including one reserve engine; two trucks; one rescue vehicle, <b>cross-staffed</b> as needed; and one fireboat. The Arlington Fire District, Fairview Fire District, and New Hamburg Fire Department cover the surrounding town of Poughkeepsie.

5000|$|HAZ-MAT - The Baltimore City Fire Department {{utilizes}} two first-line Hazardous Materials (HAZ-MAT) response units. HAZMAT-1 is {{a full-service}} response unit {{equipped with an}} extensive cache of equipment {{for all types of}} hazards, including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) incidents. Equipment includes computerized sensors and databases for identifying unknown potentially hazardous substances; static and dynamic air sampling and monitoring equipment; personnel protective equipment for all levels of incidents; spill control and overpack equipment; damming and diking supplies; personnel decontamination supplies; command and control equipment, including an indoors command post. Alternatively, HAZMAT-3 is a spill control unit, built on a commercial [...] "plumbers body" [...] utility truck. HAZMAT-3 responds to the bulk of HAZMAT requests, and carries bulk absorbent and spill control supplies for hydrocarbon spills (ruptured fuel tanks, heating oil spills, etc.). HAZMAT-3 is also equipped with a pump-off device for removing remaining hydrocarbon fuel from a damaged storage vessel. HAZMAT-1 and HAZMAT-3 are <b>cross-staffed</b> by a single HAZMAT-trained Emergency Vehicle Driver. If both units are needed simultaneously, the on-duty HAZ-MAT coordinator, or a member of the HAZ-MAT task force will bring the second unit to the scene.|$|R
2500|$|King John II of Portugal {{continued}} this effort, {{forming a}} committee on navigation. [...] This group computed tables of the sun's declination and improved the mariner's astrolabe, believing {{it a good}} replacement for the <b>cross-staff.</b> [...] These resources improved {{the ability of a}} navigator at sea to judge his latitude. Castilian Jew Abraham Zacut, the author of an exceptional treatise on astronomy/astrology in Hebrew, with the title Ha-jibbur Ha-gadol, fled to Portugal in 1492. He published in the printing press of Leiria in 1496, the book Biur Luhoth, or in Latin Almanach Perpetuum, which was soon translated into Latin and Spanish. In this book were the astronomical tables (ephemerides) for the years 1497 to 1500, which may have been instrumental, together with the new astrolabe, made of metal and not wood as before (created and perfected {{at the beginning of the}} Portuguese discoveries), to Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral in their voyages to India (also passing through South America) around the open Atlantic ocean (including the Southwest Atlantic) and in the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, the Portuguese had to hire local pilots in the Indian Ocean for several decades to guide their ships.|$|E

He rubbed his eyes, looked again, adjusting his observation by a <b>cross-staff</b> which had been placed so as to bear upon the point.

For I have a project to bring down a leat of fair water from the hill-tops right into Plymouth town, cutting off the heads of Tavy, Meavy, Wallcomb, and West Dart, and thereby purging Plymouth harbor from the silt of the mines whereby it has been choked of late years, and giving pure drink not only to the townsmen, but to the fleets of the queen's majesty; which if I do, I shall both make some poor return to God for all His unspeakable mercies, and erect unto myself a monument better than of brass or marble, not merely honorable to me, but useful to my countrymen."* Whereon Frank sent Drake a pretty epigram, comparing Drake's projected leat to that river of eternal life whereof the just would drink throughout eternity, and quoting (after the fashion of those days) John vii. 38; while Amyas took more heed of a practical appendage to the same letter, which was a list of hints scrawled for his use by Captain John Hawkins himself, on all sea matters, from the mounting of ordnance to the use of vitriol against the scurvy, in default of oranges and [...] "limmons;" [...] all which stood Amyas in good stead during the ensuing month, while Frank grew more and more proud of his brother, and more and more humble about himself.|$|E
