5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment.

5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at this point that the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have been officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau hiked to {{the radio}} tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating {{distress}} call. Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be safe with them, and that she was lucky for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E

She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her <b>child</b> <b>would</b> never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

5|$|Michael's mother, Dowager Empress Marie, {{moved back}} to Anichkov Palace with Michael and Olga. Like most male members of his family, Michael was {{enrolled}} in the military. He completed training at a gunnery school and joined the Horse Guards Artillery. In November 1898, he attained legal adulthood and, just eight months later, became heir presumptive to Nicholas as the middle brother, George, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident. George's death and the subsequent change in the line of succession highlighted that Nicholas lacked a son. As the succession was limited to males, his three daughters were ineligible. When Nicholas's wife, Alexandra, became pregnant in 1900 she hoped that the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be male. She manoeuvred to get herself declared regent for her unborn child in the event of Nicholas's death, but the government disagreed and determined that Michael would succeed regardless of the unborn child's gender. She was delivered of a fourth daughter the following year.|$|E
5|$|Paul Mansfield {{hoped the}} birth of their <b>child</b> <b>would</b> {{discourage}} her interest in acting. When it did not, he agreed to move to Los Angeles in late 1954 to help further her career. In 1952, she juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas. Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While he served in the army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul's army allotment. Coming back from the Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and lived in a small apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets— a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a poodle dyed pink, and a rabbit. While in California, she left Jayne Marie with her maternal grandparents and spent the summer semester at UCLA.|$|E
5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king seated on the Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E

25|$|During {{the birth}} of a child, men were rarely present. Women from the {{neighbourhood}} or family would join in on the process of birth and assist in many different ways.
