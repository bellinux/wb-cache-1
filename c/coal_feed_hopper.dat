40|$|The {{objective}} of the hot-gas cleanup (HGC) work on the transport reactor demonstration unit (TRDU) located at the Environmental Research Center is to demonstrate acceptable performance of hot-gas filter elements in a pilot-scale system prior to long-term demonstration tests. The primary focus of the experimental effort in the 2 -year project will be the testing of hot- gas filter elements {{as a function of}} particulate collection efficiency, filter pressure differential, filter cleanability, and durability during relatively short-term operation (100 - 200 hours). A filter vessel will be used in combination with the TRDU to evaluate the performance of selected hot- gas filter elements under gasification operating conditions. This work will directly support the Power Systems Development Facility utilizing the M. W. Kellogg transport reactor located at Wilsonville, Alabama and indirectly the Foster Wheeler advanced pressurized fluid-bed combustor, also located at Wilsonville and the Clean Coal IV Pinon Pine IGCC Power Project. This program has a phased approach involving modification and upgrades to the TRDU and the fabrication, assembly, and operation of a hot-gas filter vessel (HGFV) capable of operating at the outlet design conditions of the TRDU. Phase 1 upgraded the TRDU based upon past operating experiences. Additions included a nitrogen supply system upgrade, upgraded LASH auger and 1807 coal feed lines, the addition of a second pressurized <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> and a dipleg ash hopper, and modifications to spoil the performance of the primary cyclone. Phase 2 included the HGFV design, procurement, and installation. Phases 3 through 5 consist of 200 -hour hot-gas filter tests under gasification conditions using the TRDU at temperatures of 540 - 650 {degrees}C (1000 - 1200 {degrees}F), 9. 3 bar, and face velocities of 1. 4, 2. and 3. 8 cm/s, respectively. The increased face velocities are achieved by removing candles between each test...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} efficiencies of carbonizers, operation at high pressures is needed. In addition, waste biomass fuels of opportunity {{can be used to}} offset fossil fuel use. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Fluidized Bed Gasifier/Combustor (FBG/C) was used to gasify coal and mixtures of coal and biomass (sawdust) at 425 psig. The purpose of the testing program was to generate steady state operating data for modeling efforts of carbonizers. A test program was completed with a matrix of parameters varied one at a time in order to avoid second order interactions. Variables were: coal feed rate, pressure, and varying mixtures of sawdust and coal types. Coal types were Montana Rosebud subbituminous and Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous. The sawdust was sanding waste from a furniture manufacturer in upstate New York. Coal was sieved from - 14 to + 60 mesh and sawdust was sieved to - 14 mesh. The FBG/C operates at a nominal 425 psig, but pressures can be lowered. For the tests reported it was operated as a jetting, fluidized bed, ash-agglomerating gasifier. Preheated air and steam are injected {{into the center of the}} bottom along with the solid feed that is conveyed with cool air. Fairly stable reactor internal flow patterns develop and temperatures stabilize (with some fluctuations) when steady state is reached. At nominal conditions the solids residence time in the reactor is on the order of 1. 5 to 2 hours, so changes in feed types can require on the order of hours to equilibrate. Changes in operating conditions (e. g. feed rate) usually require much less time. The operating periods of interest for these tests were only the steady state periods, so transient conditions were not monitored as closely. The test matrix first established a base case of operations to which single parameter changes in conditions could be compared. The base case used Montana Rosebud at a coal feed rate of 70 lbm/hr at 425 psig. The coal sawdust mixtures are reported as percent by weight coal to percent by weight sawdust. The mixtures of interest were: 65 / 35 subbituminous, 75 / 25 subbituminous, 85 / 15 subbituminous, and 75 / 25 bituminous. Steady state was achieved quickly when going from one subbituminous mixture to another, but longer when going from subbituminous to bituminous coal. The most apparent observation when comparing the base case to subbituminous coal/sawdust mixtures is that operating conditions are nearly the same. Product gas does not change much in composition and temperatures remain nearly the same. Comparisons of identical weight ratios of sawdust and subbituminous and bituminous mixtures show considerable changes in operating conditions and gas composition. The highly caking bituminous coal used in this test swelled up and became about half as dense as the comparable subbituminous coal char. Some adjustments were required in accommodating changes in solids removal during the test. Nearly all the solids in the bituminous coal sawdust were conveyed into the upper freeboard section and removed at the mid-level of the reactor. This is in marked contrast to the ash-agglomerating condition where most solids are removed at the very bottom of the gasifier. Temperatures in the bottom of the reactor during the bituminous test were very high and difficult to control. The most significant discovery of the tests was that the addition of sawdust allowed gasification of a coal type that had previously resulted in nearly instant clinkering of the gasifier. Several previous attempts at using Pittsburgh No. 8 were done only at the end of the tests when shutdown was imminent anyway. It is speculated that the fine wood dust somehow coats the pyrolyzed sticky bituminous coal particles and prevents them from agglomerating quickly. As the bituminous coal char particles swell, they are carried to the cooler upper regions of the reactor where they re-solidify. Other interesting phenomena were revealed regarding the transport (rheological) properties of the coal sawdust mixtures. The coal sawdust mixtures segregate quickly when transported. This is visibly apparent. To prevent bridges and ratholes from developing in the lowest <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> <b>hopper,</b> it is normally fluidized. When feeding the coal sawdust mixtures the fluidizing gas was turned off to prevent segregation. The feed system worked as well with no fluidizing gas when using the mixtures as it did with fluidizing gas and only coal. In addition, it was inadvertently discovered that greatly increased pressure above the feeder resulted in greatly increased flow with the mixtures. Increased pressure above the feeder with coal only results in quickly plugging the feed system. Also, it was learned that addition of sawdust reduces the system loss during conveying compared to coal only. This is in spite of overall smaller particle sizes with the coal sawdust mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the thermal}} Power Plants in the Kyushu Districts {{are obliged to}} use low quality coal for fuel, they have no {{alternative}} but to utilize combustion of pulverized coal. The Unit System Tube Mill is a low costing Pulveruzer, but this system has its difficulties with automatic <b>coal</b> <b>feeding.</b> The reason being that as the feed control is carried out by interlinking the draft of the exhauster which blows the pulverized coal into the furnace with the feed rate of the coal feeder, after operation over a long period，excessive quantities of coal accumulates within the mill causing Mill- over or shortage of pulverized coal comes about decreasing the load of the Power Plant. With such difficulties constantly happening, perfect automatic combustion cannot be obtained. These defects can be corrected by disconnecting the interlink between the coal feeder and the exhauster, and controlling the feed rate of the coal feeder so that a fixed quantity of coal is constantly retained within the Tube Mill. Since a detector is necessary to determine the quantity of coal retained in the Tube Mill, the Author has invented and developed an Electro-acoustic Mill Level Meter which is quick responding and enables the operator to accurately detect the quantity of coal retained within the Mill. Recently the Unit System Tube Mill <b>coal</b> <b>feeding</b> system of the No. 2 Minato Power Plant of the Kyushu Power Company was completely switched to automatic operation by the use of this invention.

40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.
