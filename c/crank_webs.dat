50|$|Several {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the locomotives by the IMR and CSAR. The original <b>crank</b> <b>webs</b> had solid crank-pin collars. New <b>crank</b> <b>webs</b> were fitted, which enabled solid bushed connecting and coupling rods to be fitted in place of the original split brass type. The original unbalanced slide valves were replaced with balanced slide valves.|$|E

50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights. The big end bearings were flanged over {{the sides of the}} crankshaft to locate the rods against the <b>crank</b> <b>webs,</b> which reduced engine noise.|$|E
40|$|DE 102006049806 A 1 UPAB: 20080615 NOVELTY - The device has {{first and}} second {{elements}} (1. 1, 1. 2) with contact surfaces (8, 10) on facing lateral surfaces (7, 9). The contact surfaces extend from their associated lateral surfaces {{so as to be}} raised with respect to the lateral surfaces and the {{first and second}} elements of the <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> can be joined at the contact surfaces. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (A) a method of manufacturing a <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> (B) and a method of mounting a crankshaft with at least one <b>crank</b> <b>web.</b> USE - For a lifting piston engine crankshaft. ADVANTAGE - Overcomes certain disadvantages of conventional arrangements, e. g. cost-intensive machining to meet the tolerance plan before the <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> elements can be joined together...|$|R

5000|$|Tunnel {{crankshaft}}, another crankshaft {{design that}} makes engines shorter overall {{by combining the}} <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> and main bearing ...|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a precision}} forged unit running in seven three-layer bearings, with counterweights bolted onto the <b>crank</b> <b>webs,</b> much {{like any other}} diesel motor of its vintage. The middle bearing is also the thrust bearing. The connecting rods are of a split design, with bronze bushings for the piston pin.|$|E
50|$|The valvegear {{actuating}} the valve was very simple. Each piston had two parallel connecting rods, working on separated crankpin journals between the same <b>crank</b> <b>webs.</b> An eccentric {{between the two}} crankpins drove the centrally-mounted valve spindle by another short connecting rod. Because {{of the need to}} allow the valve rod to pass through between them, the piston had two overhung stub gudgeon pins, rather than a single through pin.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this seems}} {{impossible}} at first glance, {{the geometry of}} the engine does permit this overlap. The big-end bearings of connecting rods are wider (along the crank axis) than {{the thickness of the}} rod itself. By making the <b>crank</b> <b>webs</b> with an offset to them, it is possible to place the main bearings closer together, closely sandwiching the rod passing between them, where this is now a narrower gap than the bearing size. The main bearings are similarly confined and each main bearing can be supported by only a thin wall across the crankcase.|$|E
5000|$|A later {{development}} was {{to enlarge the}} main bearings sufficiently to be larger than the entire <b>crank</b> <b>web.</b> This now permitted {{the use of a}} one piece crankshaft ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the proper functioning of a marine diesel engine, respectively the crankshaft bearing condition and uniformity of thermal processes taking place in each cylinder, a study was made over the crankshaft of a MAN B&W 7 K 80 MC - C engine, ov er {{a period of about}} four years by measuring the <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> deflections during overhauls or various repairing operations on board. The study includes measurements made by the crew of the ship and related graphics recording the <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> deflections evolution depending on the number of engine operation hours...|$|R
5000|$|Eccentric, {{a similar}} {{approach}} for cranks that are driven by the axle, particularly for steam locomotive valve gear. The eccentric is enlarged in diameter until it too is bigger than the overall diameter of the <b>crank</b> <b>web.</b>|$|R
50|$|A tunnel crankcase, tunnel {{crankshaft}} or disc-webbed crankshaft {{engine is}} a diesel engine where the crankshaft is {{designed so that}} the main bearings (the bearings that support the crankshaft within the crankcase) are enlarged in diameter, such {{that they are now}} larger than the <b>crank</b> <b>webs</b> (the radial arms that link the big end bearings to the main bearings). They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name.|$|E
50|$|The SP5 was the {{top-of-the-range}} engine {{when it was}} introduced. It had {{a longer}} boiler - 6 x 2 in - and a twin-cylinder engine unit with a reverse control. The engines could easily drive several workshops due to their bigger boiler and twin cylinders. The engine, like the SP4, had the exhaust to chimney with condensate collector {{at the base of}} the chimney. The engine unit, like the SP4 was mounted on a plinth, a possible throw back to the SE4 prototype of 1946. The <b>crank</b> <b>webs</b> had the word Mamod stamped into them like the old SE3 it replaced. The boiler was heated using a 3-tablet burner pan, a whistle was also included in the specification.|$|E
5000|$|... 19. Kinetic {{resistance}} - Oil, water, vapor, gas and air do have mass, {{that needs}} to be accelerated in order to be moved for the operation of an engine. Rolls Royce Merlin and Nakajima Sakae received rear-facing stub exhaust pipes in their development, resulting in a measurable increase in the maximum speed of Supermarine Spitfire, De Havilland Mosquito and Mitsubishi A6M Zero. This is a form of jet propulsion using kinetic energy in the exhaust, implying that the balancing of kinetic resistance arising from fluid components of an engine is not insignificant. <b>Crank</b> <b>webs</b> partially hitting the oil in oil pan (accelerating the oil mass rapidly) could be a big source of vibration.|$|E
50|$|Numbered as FC Turda 764.425 {{and painted}} {{in a black}} livery, the {{locomotive}} was regularly used to haul trains on the W&LLR. During 2011 the locomotive {{was taken out of}} service for an extensive overhaul. The overhaul was completed in time for the 2012 gala but in June 2013 the locomotive sheared the RHS driving axle <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> leaving Welshpool. Following this serious failure the locomotive was stored.|$|R
5000|$|... 60° V6 is compact in length, {{width and}} height, which is {{advantageous}} for rigidity and weight. The short crankshaft length mitigates the torsional vibration problem, and secondary balance {{is better than}} in an inline 6 {{because there is no}} piston pair that move together. Furthermore, each bank of three cylinders have evenly spaced induction/ignition interval, so the intake/exhaust system advantage is shared with inline 3. However, these advantages come at the price of having plane imbalances on 4. rotating mass, 6. reciprocating mass, 14. torque generation, and 16. compression. Also, {{the left and the right}} banks being staggered (for the thickness of a conrod plus the thin <b>crank</b> <b>web)</b> makes the reciprocating mass plane imbalance more difficult to be countered with heavy counterweights than in inline 3, but when the engine and engine mounts are properly designed, it makes a smooth powerplant like Alfa Romeo V6 engines which have counterweighted webs in between the 'split' crank pins that are as thick as crank arms.|$|R
5000|$|A boxer {{engine is}} a type of flat engine in which each of a pair of {{opposing}} cylinders is on separate crank throws, offset at 180° to its partner, with 13. an evenly spaced firing. If the pistons could lie on the same crank rotational plane, then the design is inherently balanced for the momentum of the pistons. But since they cannot, the design, despite having a perfect 3. phase balance largely cancelling the non-sinusoidal imbalance, inherently has 4., 6., 14. and 16. imbalances due to the crank pin rotating planes being offset.This offset, the length of which partly determines the strength of the rocking vibration, is the largest on the parallel twin with a 180° crankshaft, and does not exist on a V or a flat engine that has a shared crank pin with [...] "fork and blade" [...] conrods (e.g. Harley-Davidson V-twin engine. See illustration on right). Other configurations fall in between, depending on the bigend thickness, <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> thickness, and the main bearing width (if they exist in between the throws).|$|R
5000|$|Hirth's joints {{were first}} used in {{aircraft}} engine crankshafts. A {{large number of}} cylinders and often the need for reduction gears and supercharger drives made it impractical to manufacture a one-piece crankshaft, so Hirth joints were used to couple the sections. They have used in complex crankshafts for many years afterward, particularly where the output power was taken from a central drive gear. As a large gear could neither be formed-in-place nor passed over the <b>crank</b> <b>webs,</b> it could be machined separately and placed between two half-crankshafts with Hirth's joints. They are also used in gas turbine shafts, in accessories for surgical operating tables, in agricultural machines for fixing tools etc., and in bike parts and frames, such as Campagnolo's [...] "Ultra-Torque" [...] bicycle crankset, and in Bicycle Torque Couplings.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the need for Surface Hardening in Crankshafts and establishing Induction Hardening as the most practically viable process for the same. Crankshaft is one of the largest components in the internal combustion engine that has a complex geometry consisting of cylinders as bearings and plates as the <b>crank</b> <b>webs.</b> Geometry section changes in the crankshaft cause stress concentration at fillet areas where bearings are connected to the <b>crank</b> <b>webs.</b> In addition, this component experiences both torsional and bending load during its service life. The crankshaft must be capable of withstanding the intermittent variable loads impressed on it. The principal purpose of Surface Hardening is to increase the hardness, wear resistance and endurance limit of the surfaces of metal components. The core remains tough and can withstand impact loads. Prior to the advent of Induction Hardening methods such as furnace hardening, flame hardening and liquid nitriding were used. However each of these processes presented problems such as inadequate or non-uniform hardening and distortion. Induction Hardening overcomes many of these problems through rotation of the part during heat-treating and selection of frequency and power to obtain adequate case depth and uniform hardness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A failure {{investigation}} for a diesel engine crankshaft {{has been conducted}} which was used for truck in this paper, which is made from 42 CrMo steel. The fracture occurred on the <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> between the 4 th crankpin and the 4 th journal, the fracture section indicates that fatigue is the dominant mechanism. The dimensions, chemical compositions of material and surface hardness were evaluated {{in order to find}} the failure causes. Chemical compositions, the depth of hardness layer and surface hardness are qualified; however, there are transition zone of hardness layer on the journal boss fillet, the dimensions of journal boss is not qualified, it less than specified dimension, and many non-metallic inclusions aggregate zones and heavy segregation were found from metallographic photo, these would reduce the tensile strength. FEA analysis is also used to analysis the strength of this crankshaft, and the results suggest that the dimension of journal boss fillet is the key dimension, which has an important effect on the strength of the crankshaft. So the disqualified machining dimensions, material property are the main reasons for the fraction of this crankshaft...|$|R
50|$|V6 engines with un-split shared {{crank pin}} can have equally spaced firing when the V-angle is at 120° (60° or 120° for 2-stroke). However, the 120° bank angle makes the engine rather wide, so {{production}} V6 {{tend to use}} 60° angle with a crank pin that is offset 60° for the opposing cylinders. As offsetting the crank pin {{for as much as}} 60° no longer provides overlap in the diameter of the crank pin, the actual pin is not really an offset 'split' pin, but normally is completely separate in two parts with a thin <b>crank</b> <b>web</b> connecting the two individual pins. This makes the crankshaft structurally weaker, much more so than in the crankshaft with slight offset seen on the Lancia Fulvia V4 with 10.5° to 13° offset, so racing V6 engines from Carlo Chiti-designed 1961 Ferrari 156 engine to Cosworth GBA for Formula One often used the 120° bank angle to avoid this weakness, unless required by the formula as in all the 2014 - 2015 Formula One 1.6 Liter turbo V6 engines that has 90° bank angle according to the regulation.|$|R
