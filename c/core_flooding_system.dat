30|$|First, a clean-dry {{core plug}} is 100 % {{saturated}} (by vacuum) with the doped crude oil and later <b>flooded</b> in the <b>core</b> <b>flood</b> <b>system</b> at reservoir temperature and pressure. Several X-ray scans are recorded to represent 100 % oil saturation. The core is then re-cleaned with solvents and dried {{by following the}} standard procedure. The core is then saturated with FW to determine brine absolute permeability and scan to represent 100 % water saturation. Absolute permeability is determined by injecting formation brine at different flow rates. Based on the differential pressures at each flow rate, absolute permeability is calculated from Darcy’s law as shown in (Eq.  2). Drainage experiment is then initiated to reach initial water saturation Swi. Similarly, several scans are recorded, the last scan is considered as the Swi. To reach Swi, Primol followed by crude oil are injected at different flow rates until water production from the core is negligible and steady state conditions are achieved. Swi is calculated {{with the help of}} (Eq.  3). The core is then aged for 1  month to restore reservoir conditions and wettability (Shaker and Skauge 2013). Oil effective permeability is re-calculated after ageing and to account for any change in Swi. Imbibition is then initiated afterwards by injecting brine(s) followed by polymer (in accordance with the injection scenarios). In the process, X-ray scan is constantly monitoring the fluids saturations as fluids injection and displacement is taking place. It is important to state that, the above steps and experiments are all conducted at 120  °C and back pressure (BP) of 750 psi to mimic the reservoir conditions.

In order to verify the functionality of the passive components requiredfor the transient and accident management, the test facility INKA (Integral-Versuchstand Karlstein) is build in Karlstein (Germany). The key elements of the KERENA™ passive safety concept -the Emergency Condenser, the Containment Cooling Condenser, the Passive <b>Core</b> <b>Flooding</b> <b>System</b> and the Passive Pressure Pulse Transmitter - will be tested at INKA. The Emergency Condenser system transfer heaty form the reactor pressure vessel to the core flooding pools of the containment. The heat introduced into the containment during accidents will {{be transferred to the}} main heat sink for passive accident management (Shielding/Storage Pool) via the Containment Cooling Condensers. Therefore both systems are part of the passive cooling chain connecting the heat source RPV (Reactor Pressure Vessel) with the heat sink. At the INKA test facility both condensers are tested in full scale setup, {{in order to determine the}} heat transfer capacity as function of the main input parameters. For the EC these are the RPV pressure, the RPV water level, the containment pressure and the water temperature of the flooding pools. For the Containment Cooling Condenser the heat transfer capacity is a function of the containment pressure, the water temperature of the Shielding/Storage Pooland the fraction of non -condensable gases in the containment.

40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) {{have been}} {{recently}} proposed to stabilize microemulsions (MEs) {{to improve their}} stability under harsh conditions, i. e., high temperature and high salinity as in hydrocarbon reservoirs. This work developed a novel method to produce iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in-situ in oil-in-water (o/w) MEs, and examined their performance in improving oil recovery. IONPs were in-situ synthesized in MEs containing brine, n-hexane, mixture of SDS and Span 80 as the surfactants, and propyl alcohol as the co-solvent. The enhanced oil recovery (EOR) potentials of MEs and MEs containing different concentrations of IONPs (MEIN) were investigated in a <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>system.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} use of MEIN can significantly increase the oil recovery efficiency, i. e., jumping from 10 % for ME without being stabilized NPs to 28. 9 % at a NPs concentration of 6400 ppm. Moreover, MEIN achieved much lower and more stable pressure profile (i. e. nearly one order of magnitude smaller) during the flooding and post-flooding stage, showing its excellent injection applicability. Four potential EOR mechanisms were examined and the formation of stable MEs synergistically stabilized by NPs and surfactants was considered as the main reason, supplemented by less formation of viscous phase, more stable IFT and increased viscosity for better mobility control...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects {{is directly related}} to the long term sealing {{efficiency of}} barrier systems and of wellbore cement in wellbores penetrating storage reservoirs. The microfractures inside the wellbore cement provide possible pathways for CO 2 leakage to the surface and/or fresh water aquifers, impairing the long-term containment of CO 2 in the subsurface. The purpose of this experimental study is to understand the dynamic alteration process in the cement caused by the acidic brine. The first experiment, at ambient temperature and pressure, was conducted by flowing CO 2 -rich brine through 1  in. by 2  in. (25. 4  mm by 50. 8  mm) cement cores for 4 and 8 weeks durations.

40|$|AbstractLaboratory <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> {{experiments}} {{coupled with}} CT scanning {{has been shown}} to be very useful for examining CO 2 -brine displacement processes. These experiments can be used to measure core average properties such as absolute and relative permeability, and also to examine sub core-scale saturation and porosity distributions. By examining the sub core scale fluid distributions during the displacement process, it is possible to study the displacement efficiency of CO 2 -brine drainage processes, residual trapping and fluid saturation at the millimeter to sub-millimeter scale. One potentially useful tool for studying CO 2 -brine systems is using numerical simulation to replicate and study these <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>systems.</b> This could be used to study the interactions and relative impact of different parameters such as capillary pressure, relative permeability and heterogeneity on brine displacement by CO 2 under various flow conditions. One challenge to successfully conducting such numerical experiments has been accurate representation of the permeability distribution inside the core at the millimeter and sub-millimeter scale. Other simulation parameters can all be measured using laboratory experiments, but permeability must be derived from other properties at the core and sub core-scale. Previous work has shown that predicting sub core-scale permeability distributions based on porosity does not result in accurate representation of permeability at such a small scale. To improve these predictions, a new method based on capillary pressure and was developed and used to accurately predict sub core-scale permeability distributions in a relatively homogeneous Berea sandstone. The work presented in this paper uses the same method to calculate permeability in a strongly heterogeneous sandstone core from the Otway Basin Pilot Project in Australia. Simulations show that the results are consistent with previous results in the homogeneous cores, with statistically significant capability to predict sub core-scale CO 2 distributions in the core. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of the core used in this study, the average match is not as good as for a relatively homogeneous rock core, however, a visual comparison shows that the results are still very good, and that the new method used to calculate permeability may still be valid even in the presence of strong heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{experimental}} study {{of the effects of}} contact condensation of steam–gas mixture on the operation of VVER passive safety systems and steam generator in emergency condensation mode are presented. Contact condensation takes place when subcooled liquid is supplied in the accumulator tank of VVER reactor auxiliary passive <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>system</b> (the HA- 2 system) in the presence of accumulated non-condensable gases. Water supplied to hydro accumulators can be used for increasing the operating time of VVER steam generator in the emergency condensation mode and for ensuring core cooling during longer time. Low liquid outlet velocity (less than 1 m/s) caused by the necessity to ensure safety systems operation in passive mode constitutes the distinguishing feature of the investigated processes. Experiments were conducted on the test facility with parameters typical for the primary cooling loop of the reactor facility 24 h after the accident initiation for different concentrations of gas in the steam–gas mixture. Nitrogen and helium, which replaces hydrogen for the purposes of safety assurance, were used as the non-condensable gases. It was established according to the results of experiments that the increase of concentration of non-condensable gas within the volume of HA- 2 hydro accumulator model up to 45 % leads to the reduction of intensity of contact condensation of steam from the steam–gas mixture by ∼ 29 % in the experiment with nitrogen and by ∼ 57 % in the experiment with helium.

40|$|An {{advanced}} laboratory {{facility has}} been designed, developed and commissioned which offers an extensive capability for {{detailed study of}} various aspects of geoenergy problems in fractured rocks. It comprises i) a high pressure manometric sorption apparatus, ii) a high pressure triaxial <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>system</b> and iii) an ancillary system including pure and mixed gas supply and analysing units. The manometric sorption apparatus is capable of measuring adsorption/desorption isotherms of various gas species on powdered and intact samples. The triaxial <b>core</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>system</b> is capable of measuring the gas flow properties and deformation behaviour of coal samples, up to 0. 1 m diameter and 0. 2 m length. Deep underground conditions in terms of pore pressure and confining pressure can be replicated using the high pressure triaxial cell for depths up to 2000 m. The laboratory facility has been designed and developed to produce high resolution data for {{a broad range of}} gas injection pressures (up to 20 MPa) and temperature values (up to 338 K). Appropriate pressure transducers and flow meters were selected and have been incorporated into the system following a series of detailed and thorough analyses performed to define and optimise the specifications of the measurement devices. Anthracite coal samples from the South Wales coalfield (6 -ft seam measure) have been characterised and tested. Equilibrium and kinetic phenomena of the adsorption and desorption of different gases, i. e. nitrogen (N 2), methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), at injection pressures up to 7 MPa have been studied. A series of core flooding experiments have been carried out on samples of 0. 07 m diameter and 0. 12 m length, at gas injection pressures up to 5. 5 MPa and confining pressures up to 6 MPa. The absolute and relative permeability of the samples, to different gases and the permeability evolution with changes in the gas pressure and confining stress condition have been studied. The fate of adsorbed CO 2 was studied via a sequential series of N 2 and CH 4 flooding experiments. The storage and displacement of N 2 and CO 2 in a sample saturated with CH 4 at 5 MPa pressure was investigated via another series of flooding tests. During the injection of the gases, the composition of the outflow gas was analysed. Modelling work has been carried out to further investigate the experimental results and processes involved in gas transport and reactions. The numerical model used, includes a theoretical approach for modelling the permeability evolution in coal. The results of the gas adsorption tests indicated a higher adsorption capacity to CO 2 compared to CH 4 and N 2, i. e. 1. 3 and 2. 5 times higher, respectively. Also, different hysteresis behaviours were observed during the adsorption and desorption measurements, for the different gases studied. An improved understanding of the controlling mechanisms of gas adsorption rate and the kinetics of the processes has thus been achieved. From the results of the core flooding experiments, {{it was found that the}} permeability evolution of the coal sample to CO 2, due to an increase in gas pressure, exhibited a different pattern compared to the other gases. A considerable reduction above a certain gas pressure value was observed. This was found to be related to coal matrix swelling induced by CO 2 adsorption. The results of following N 2 and CH 4 flooding experiments showed a partial restoration of the initial permeability of the coal sample, indicating the stability of the adsorbed CO 2 in the coal matrix during the period of analysis. The results of N 2 and CO 2 storage and displacement in coal showed that CO 2 injection into coal was more efficient in terms of total CH 4 recovery, gas displacement ratio, breakthrough time and amount of the gas storage than achieved through N 2 displacements. The effect of swelling on the coal permeability however was found to be considerable. The application of the experimental results in the adopted theoretical model led to the identification of the major mechanisms controlling the behaviour of coal during gas displacement, together with the influential factors on flow behaviour. The results also highlighted coupled physico-chemical effects during carbon dioxide sequestration in coal. It is claimed that the work presented in this thesis has provided a new and comprehensive set of high resolution data. Various aspects related to high pressure flow and reaction of various gas species in coal have been studied. A detailed set of benchmarks have been produced that can be used for the development and validation of theoretical models. New insights into several phenomena related to carbon sequestration in coal are thus claimed to have been achieved...|$|E
40|$|KERENA is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} concept with passive safety systems (Generation III+) of AREVA. The reactor is an evolutionary design of operating BWRs (Generation II). In order to verify the functionality and performance of the KERENA safety concept required for the transient and accident management, the test facility "Integral Teststand Karlstein" (INKA) was built at Karlstein (Germany). It is a mock-up of the KERENA boiling water reactor containment, with integrated pressure suppression system. The complete chain of passive safety components is available. The passive components and the levels are represented in full scale. The volume scaling of the containment compartments is approximately 1 : 24. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is simulated via the steam accumulator of the Karlstein Large Valve Test Facility. This vessel provides an energy storage capacity of approximately 1 / 6 of the KERENA RPV and is supplied by a Benson boiler with a thermal power of 22 MW. With respect to the available power supply, the containment- and system-sizing of the facility {{is by far the}} largest one of its kind worldwide. From 2009 to 2012, several single component tests were conducted (Emergency Condenser, Containment Cooling Condenser, <b>Core</b> <b>Flooding</b> <b>System</b> etc.). On March 21 st, 2013, the worldwide first large-scale only passively managed integral accident test of a boiling water reactor was simulated at INKA. The integral test measured the combined response of the KERENA passive safety systems to the postulated initiating event was the "Main Steam Line Break" (MSLB) inside the Containment with decay heat simulation. The results of the performed integral test (MSLB) showed that the passive safety systems alone are capable to bring the plant to stable conditions meeting all required safety targets with sufficient margins. Therefore the test verified the function of those components and the interplay between them as response to an anticipated accident scenario. The test provided evidence that the INKA is worldwide the first large scale test facility to perform integral verification tests of passive safety concepts under plant-like scaling and thermodynamic conditions. Hence, the test facility also shows that it is capable to perform containment response tests for existing Generation II BWRs (with active safety systems) and advanced (passive) reactor designs besides KERENA. These test results can be used to strengthen existing containment codes with regard to heat transfer, natural circulation, gas- and temperature stratification and others.
