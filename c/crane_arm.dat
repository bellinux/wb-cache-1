40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the large}} {{deflection}} deformation of <b>crane’s</b> main <b>arm,</b> {{it is difficult to}} display the real-time shape of the <b>crane’s</b> main <b>arm</b> and also is necessary to display the deformed main arm to increase the realism of the system {{in the development of a}} system platform to simulate crane operation in practical situation. There is a few research in this area, therefore the study of the flexural deflection of the main <b>arm</b> of <b>crane</b> modeling method has important practical significance for engineering. This paper first briefly introduces the main <b>arm</b> of <b>crane's</b> deflection numerical calculation theory, then explores the application of OSG through three different ways to establish the occurrence of deformation model of the <b>crane’s</b> main <b>arm,</b> then compares their advantages and disadvantages, and finally finds that the display effect by the wire frame method to establish the occurrence of flexural deformation model of the <b>crane’s</b> main <b>arm</b> is the best, and gives a simple example to illustrate that...|$|R

2500|$|The Quantum-class {{of ships}} debuted {{as the second}} largest class of cruise ships in the world. The Quantum-class ships were the first ships built for Royal Caribbean by Meyer Werft since the Radiance class and share many {{features}} with those ships, including indoor pools with retractable roofs, vast expanses of glass, outdoor seating in the Windjammer buffet, and self-leveling pool tables. Other distinctive features of the Quantum-class include the [...] "North Star" [...] observation capsule mounted {{on the end of}} a [...] <b>crane</b> <b>arm,</b> [...] "RipCord by iFLY" [...] a skydiving simulator, the three-deck-high Two70° lounge and performance venue at the aft of the ship featuring panoramic windows that convert into projection screens, and the multi-purpose SeaPlex facility which hosts activities such as basketball, roller skating, bumper cars, and a trapeze school. The Quantum class was the first class designed specifically for Dynamic Dining, and feature several separate complementary dining facilities instead of a single main dining room. [...] Each venue will maintain the same menu and staff throughout the cruise. Unlike the earlier Voyager, Freedom, and Oasis class, Quantum-class ships do not feature a Viking Crown Lounge or ice skating rink, and the Royal Promenade mall down the center of the ship is not featured in its traditional form.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{recovery}} systems designed for open water {{can not be}} used efficiently or at all during wintertime, Louhi is also equipped with two recovery systems capable of collecting spilled oil from the sea in difficult ice conditions and clean ice blocks covered in oil.

50|$|Titans cantilever-jib arm {{could reach}} 190 ft {{above the surface}} at maximum extension. The crane could lift up to 150 t at an arm radius of 90 ft, or 125 t at 125 ft.

40|$|Cable-actuated {{manipulators}} (or 'cable robots') {{constitute a}} relatively new classification of robots which use motors, located at fixed remote locations, to manipulate an end-effector by extending or retracting cables. These manipulators possess a number of unique properties which make them proficient with tasks involving high payloads, large workspaces, and dangerous or contaminated environments. However, a number of challenges exist which have limited the mainstream emergence of cable robots. This thesis addresses {{two of the most}} important of these issues [...] workspace analysis and disturbance compensation. Workspace issues are particularly important, as many large-scale applications require the end-effector to operate in regions of a particular shape, and to exert certain minimum forces throughout those regions. The 'Force-Feasible Workspace' represents the set of end-effector positions, for a given robot design, for which the robot can exert a set of required forces on its environment. This can be considered as the robot's 'usable' workspace, and an analysis of this workspace shape for point-mass cable robots is therefore presented to facilitate optimal cable robot design. Numerical simulation results are also presented to validate the analytical results, and to aid visualization of certain complex workspace shapes. Some cable robot applications may require mounting motors to moving bases (i. e. mobile robots) or other surfaces which are subject to disturbances (i. e. helicopters or <b>crane</b> <b>arms).</b> Such disturbances can propagate to the end-effector and cause undesired motion, so the rejection of motor mount disturbances is also of interest. This thesis presents a strategy for measuring these disturbances and compensating for them. General approaches and implementation issues are explored qualitatively with a simple one-degree-of-freedom prototype (including a strategy for mitigating accelerometer drift), and quantitative simulation results are presented as a proof of concept.
