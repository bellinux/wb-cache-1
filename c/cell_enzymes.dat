25|$|This {{question}} has been studied in isolated populations where antimalarial drugs were not used in Tanzania, East Africa and in the Republic of the Gambia, West Africa, following children during the period when they are most susceptible to falciparum malaria. In both cases parasite counts were significantly lower in G6PD-deficient persons than in those with normal red <b>cell</b> <b>enzymes.</b> The association has also been studied in individuals, which is possible because the enzyme deficiency is sex-linked and female heterozygotes are mosaics due to lyonization, where random inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red blood cells. Malaria parasites were significantly more often observed in normal red cells than in enzyme-deficient cells. An evolutionary genetic analysis of malarial selection of G6PD deficiency genes has been published by Tishkoff and Verelli. The enzyme deficiency is common in many countries that are, or were formerly, malarious, but not elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Mast <b>cells</b> {{contain an}} <b>enzyme</b> which hydrolyzes 3 -chloroacetoxy- 2 -naphthoic acid anilide. By using highly {{purified}} mast cells isolated by differential centrifugation in high density sucrose solutions {{we have been}} able to study this enzymatic activity in more detail. The enzyme has properties similar to those of chymotrypsin: Chymotrypsin will hydrolyze the histochemical substrate, and the chymotrypsin and mast cell activities with this substrate are similarly inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate. The mast <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> is capable of hydrolyzing the N-acetyl esters of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, the relative rates of hydrolysis being similar to those seen with chymotrypsin. A characteristic trypsin substrate, p-toluenesulfonyl arginine methyl ester, is not acted upon by the mast <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> or chymotrypsin. The pH activity curve of the new <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> is similar to that of chymotrypsin as determined with N-acetyl-L-tryptophan ethyl ester as substrate...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} that distinct genetic factors may concur, {{in association with}} diabetes, to increase susceptibility to vascular morbidity, including hypertension, has been evaluated in ninety-four normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients by testing both the frequency and prevalence of hypertension in parents and by measuring membrane red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities. Parental hypertension was present in a significantly higher proportion of diabetic compared to control subjects. A significant decrease in basal membrane red blood cell (Na(+) -K+), (Mg 2 +) and (Ca 2 +) ATPase activities was also related to the disease and was apparently uninfluenced by short [...] or long term metabolic control. In contrast with what was observed in the control group, sex caused in diabetic subjects significant variations in red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities, with women showing the lowest mean basal values of all enzyme activities. Parental hypertension {{turned out to be}} an independent risk factor in significantly reducing red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities both in diabetic and control subjects. However, whereas in diabetic subjects sex interacted strongly with parental hypertension in causing reduction of enzyme activities, in controls the effect of parental hypertension was sex-independent and significantly reduced basal enzyme activities, thus rendering subjects similar to diabetics. It is concluded that both sex and parental hypertension in association with diabetes, are predictors of further damage to red blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities, which may thus be linked to increased risk of susceptibility towards vascular complications...|$|R

The {{envelope}} glycoprotein of subgroup A is called EnvA and its env gene codes for precursor protein known as Pr95. This precursor is cleaved by host <b>cell</b> <b>enzymes</b> to yield the surface protein subunit, gp85, and the transmembrane protein subunit, gp37, which heterodimerize and then form a trimer. The virus cannot infect cells before {{the processing of}} the envelope precursor protein is completed. For the virus to penetrate the cytosol of a host cell, a low pH is necessary.|$|E
50|$|During mitosis, tiny {{fragments}} of “scrap” single strand DNA naturally occur inside the <b>cell.</b> <b>Enzymes</b> find {{and destroy the}} “scrap” DNA. The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this single strand “scrap” DNA. A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the single strand DNA {{to be less than}} completely effective. The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows “scrap” single strand DNA to build up in the cell. The buildup of “scrap” single strand DNA alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal.|$|E

In this study, 10 additional serum protein polymorphisms for AHSG, C 3, C 6, C 7, GC, HP, ITIH 1, PI, TF and ZAG were typed. Common and variant alleles prevail ingin East Asian populations were found together with several new variants. The distribution of allele frequencies differed markedly among the nine aboriginal groups and from that in East Asian populations. The large diversity among the aboriginal groups was confirmed by analysis of the genetic affinity {{on the basis of}} Nei's standard genetic distance and Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance, which were calculated using the present and previous data from 27 red <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> and serum protein loci. The analysis based on 15 red <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> and serum protein loci revealed that they, in particular the Puyuma and Ami, had strong affinity with Filipino among several East Asian populations...|$|R
40|$|An RNA-directed DNA {{polymerase}} {{was isolated}} from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia by successive purification of a particulate cytoplasmic fraction with endogenous, ribonuclease-sensitive DNA polymerase activity. Like RNA-directed DNA polymerase from mammalian type-C virus, the human leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> efficiently utilized (A) n·(dT) 12 - 18 and (C) n·(dG) 12 - 18 and had an approximate molecular weight of 70, 000. Further, the leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> was strongly inhibited by antisera to RNA-directed DNA polymerase of primate type-C virus in a fashion similar to that noted with an extensively purified RNA-directed DNA polymerase from a person with acute myelogenous leukemia [Todaro, G. J. & Gallo, R. C. (1973), Nature 244, 206]. By these biochemical and immunological results the leukemic <b>cell</b> <b>enzyme</b> could be differentiated from all other known cellular DNA polymerases but could not be distinguished from RNA-directed DNA polymerase of primate type-C virus. We interpret these data, combined with observations published elsewhere, to indicate that human acute myelogenous leukemia cells contain components related to primate type-C virus. The parameters {{used in this study}} may provide the specificity and sensitivity required for determining the presence or absence and (if present) the relatedness of RNA-directed DNA polymerase in other cases and types of human leukemia...|$|R

5000|$|Typical {{of later}} stages of {{follicle}} {{development is the}} appearance of cumulus cells. [...] GDF9 causes the expansion of cumulus cells, a characteristic process in normal follicular development. GDF9 induces hyaluronanic synthase 2 (Has2) and suppresses urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA synthesis in granulosa cells. This allows an extracellular matrix rich in hyaluronic acid, allowing the expansion of cumulus cells. Silencing of GDF9 expression results {{in the absence of}} cumulus cell expansion, this highlights the integral role of GDF9 signaling in altering granulosa <b>cell</b> <b>enzymes</b> and therefore allowing cumulus cell expansion in late stages of folliculogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Enzyme {{therapy is}} being {{actively}} studied for genetic metabolic diseases where an enzyme is over-expressed, under-expressed, defective, {{or not at}} all there. In the case of under-expression or expression of a defective enzyme, an active form of the enzyme is introduced in the body to compensate for the deficit. On the other hand, an enzymatic over-expression may be counteracted by introduction of a competing non-functional enzyme; that is, an enzyme which metabolizes the substrate into non-active products. When placed within an artificial <b>cell,</b> <b>enzymes</b> can carry out their function for a much longer period compared to free enzymes and can be further optimized by polymer conjugation.|$|E

50|$|Following {{receptor}} activation by the ligand, {{several steps}} can sequentially ensue. For example, the 3D shape {{changes to the}} intracellular domain may render it recognizable to catalytic proteins (enzymes) that are located inside the cell and have physical access to it. These enzymes may then induce chemical changes to the intracellular domain of the activated receptor, including the addition of phosphate chemical groups to specific components of the receptor (phosphorylation), or the physical separation (cleavage) of the intracellular domain. Such modifications may enable the intracellular domain {{to act as an}} enzyme itself, meaning that it may now catalyze the modification of other proteins in the <b>cell.</b> <b>Enzymes</b> which catalyze phosphorylation modifications are termed kinases. These modified proteins may then also be activated and enabled to induce further modifications to other proteins, and so on. This sequence of catalytic modifications is termed a “signal transduction pathway” or “second messenger cascade”. It is a critical mechanism employed by cells to sense their environment and induce complex changes to their state. Such changes may include, as noted, chemical modifications to other molecules, as well as decisions concerning which genes are activated and which are not (transcriptional regulation).|$|E
