30|$|IDEA {{states that}} the FAPE needs to be {{available}} to all {{children between the ages of}} 3 and 21. But when parents and a public agency disagree about the availability of appropriate programs for the child and when there is a disagreement about financial reimbursement, this disagreement goes before the courts resulting in <b>case</b> <b>laws.</b> The general language of FAPE has resulted in several <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> that have provided more guidance into the interpretation about conditions under which FAPE prevails. For example <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> have been related to when schools cannot expel students for behaviors related to their handicaps and under what circumstances parents can be reimbursed for the cost of a private education for a child qualified to receive special education services (Wright & Wright, 2007).|$|R

3000|$|IDEA {{has proven}} to be a major {{legislation}} having a large influence on the government’s work on providing education to young children. However, there have been many <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> that have further interpreted the legislation. While IDEA helps pave the road to inclusive practices, the interpretation of the law has led to the greatest conflict between parents and schools.. Courts have helped to define what FAPE is, through the passage of <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> that have emerged. For example, in Board of Education v. Rowley 1, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that IDEA does not require states to develop IEPs that ‘maximize the potential of handicapped children.’ Another case, Walczak v. Florida Union Free School District in 1998 asserts that children are not entitled to the best education that money can buy; they are only entitled to an appropriate education. Since there is no clear definition provided on what an ‘educational benefit’ is, this too has been further defined through <b>case</b> <b>laws.</b> A number of courts have struggled with the question of how much progress is sufficient, yet the standards are still somewhat vague. For example, <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> have better defined areas such as ‘educational benefit’ in N.R. v. Kingwood Township 2, and ‘mainstreaming’ in Florence County School District IV v.

5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of <b>case</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v.

5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in <b>case</b> <b>law</b> about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E

Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted.

5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish <b>case</b> <b>law</b> extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the <b>case</b> <b>law</b> that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E

40|$|This study {{promotes}} ‘functional {{concept of}} jurisdiction’ {{by examining the}} extraterritorial jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, how the court exercises its authority when violation takes place outside {{the territory of the}} violating State. This is done with the aid of doctrinal analysis, by relying on international <b>law,</b> <b>case</b> <b>laws,</b> legal principles and concepts and the writings of scholars as its material basis. The aim is to make the <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> of the European Court of Human Rights much clearer and hence minimize the frustration occasioned by the inconsistency of its <b>case</b> <b>laws</b> in the national courts of the Council of Europe members. Reflection into the basic human rights jurisdictional clauses shows that there is a lacuna in the jurisdictional clause of the European Convention on Human Rights in Article 1 which requires the State parties to secure to everyone ‘within their jurisdiction’ the rights in the convention. This provision is anachronistic since it encourages territorial focus in this age of globalization. It is time to revise this provision so that it will be in tune with the contemporary jurisdictional clause that requires States to secure the convention rights to everyone ‘subject to their jurisdiction’ broadly speaking as found in more recent human rights treaties...|$|R
