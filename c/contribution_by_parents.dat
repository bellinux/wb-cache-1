40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an empirical analysis of international joint venture activities in Taiwan. The primary {{purpose is to}} examine control and its antecedents in terms of ownership, bargaining power, resources contribution, and motivation for forming international joint ventures. Primary data collected by a mail questionnaire is analysed along five core dimensions of international joint venture activities. First, the mechanism, focus, and extent of parent control is identified and tested {{in a number of}} sample characteristics. These empirical results also reveal that most joint ventures in Taiwan have higher autonomy and have more autonomy on the appointment of key function managers. Parent firms seek to focus their control over specific activities of the joint ventures rather than attempting to control the entire range of joint venture activities. Second, the results of equity shares held by the host country parents and foreign parents show that both parents have minority shareholding in the joint ventures. A higher ownership by the parents in joint ventures indicates that they have a higher percentage of board members. Third, the relative importance of a set of bargaining power is identified with hypothesis testing of the relationship between control and bargaining power. There is little evidence that the relationship between bargaining power and control is not closely associated. Fourth, the relative importance of resource <b>contribution</b> <b>by</b> <b>parents</b> is identified and hypotheses are tested on the relationship between control and resource contribution factors. The results are strongly supported that the relationships between resource contributions in terms of physical, invisible, financial, human, and organizational ability of parents and their control has significant and positive associations. Fifth, the relative importance of a set of motives for international joint venture formation is identified and hypotheses are tested on the relationship between control and motivation factors in terms of technological acquisition, knowledge learning, risk sharing, competitive strategy consideration, resource complementarily, market expansion. The findings reveal a limited number of significant correlations between motivation factors and control. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{idea in the}} decentralisation {{and development}} literature is that decentralisation leads to deeper and stronger community participation. This thesis seeks to examine this argument by investigating the practice of community participation in the Indonesian decentralisation context, focusing on parental participation through access to and control over school financial resources. Drawing on {{a case study in}} Depok city, the practice of parental involvement has been explored by identifying the characteristics and the extent of parents’ participation in school management. School Committees (SCs), as a mechanism of community involvement provided by the decentralised education policy, were also examined in this research to develop an understanding of parental representation in school management. The study found that the characteristics and the extent of parents’ participation in school management have changed and decreased significantly {{as a result of a}} new Free School Programme (FSP) introduced by the government in 2009 which freed parents from school operational cost. Prior to FSP, parents actively participated in terms of supplying resources and involvement in school meetings, had some access to financial information, and had limited engagement with school budgeting through representation in SCs. However, the new absence of financial <b>contribution</b> <b>by</b> <b>parents</b> has affected parental participation by transforming it into a weaker form of participation where parents act as mere beneficiaries. The study also revealed that in the Indonesian context, the SCs, as institutional channels for community involvement in education provided by the education decentralisation policy, are not effective in terms of representing and engaging parents in school management. Based on the evidence above, this thesis concluded that in the context of the Indonesian education system, decentralisation has not necessarily enhanced community participation. In this respect, decentralisation is not the only possible answer for achieving a meaningful and empowering parental participation in education. Furthermore, other contextual factors surrounding participation also have to be taken into account. While FSP brings the benefit of allowing students to access education freely, the absence of parental financial contribution has been proved to impact parental participation in a way that is contradictory to one of the purposes of decentralisation policy, which is to engage the community in educational management...|$|E

40|$|The {{study focused}} on {{assessing}} the role that parents were playing in developing â€˜fast-trackâ€™ schools in the newly resettled commercial farms under the fast-track Land Reform Programme in the Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe. Data were collected during focus group discussions and interviews with parents and on site observations {{of what was going}} on at the schools. A convenient sample of 58 newly-established primary schools was used for the study. This sample was chosen mainly because the schools were easily accessible to the researchers. The data collected were analyzed using content analysis. The study established that parents were instrumental in getting the schools established because they wanted their children to be able to access schools that were nearer their places of residence and to reduce the walking distances traveled by the children to and from school. Parents chose school sites that they considered central to where they lived and that had physical infrastructure that could easily be converted into classrooms. The <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> <b>parents</b> included setting up school committees that assisted in mobilizing the parents to assist in the development and administration of the schools, supplying building materials and providing teaching and learning materials.

Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} negative impact of divorce on children's welfare {{as a consequence of}} the reduction in monetary and time <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> the non-custodian <b>parent.</b> When the custody arrangement is sole custody, the variables that link the absent parent to the child are visitations and child support transfers. We explain visitations and child support transfers using a behavioral model of competitive equilibrium in which both variables are the results of competitive allocations realized in a decentralized non-cooperative manner. In our framework the mother has control over visitations and the father has control over child support. Estimates of the model are used to simulate the effects of alternative endowment levels on the proportion of time spent with the noncustodial parent and the ex-post parental income distribution. Our results show that a more equal allocation of time with the child, though beneficial to the children, may have a negative effect for the mother's welfare, increasing the income gap between ex-spouses.

40|$|Associations between {{parenting}} {{style and the}} quality of child attachment to mother were investigated in middle childhood and adolescence. Two hundred and two children in middle childhood (grades 4 - 6) and 212 adolescents (grades 7 - 11) participated. In the younger group, secure attachment was assessed by the Network of Relationships Questionnaire (NRI; Furman & Buhrmester, 1985) and two types of insecure attachment by the Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ; Finnegan et al., 1996). In adolescence, secure attachment and three types of insecure attachment were measured by the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ; Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991). All participants provided ratings on three dimensions of {{parenting style}} characteristic of their families (parental involvement, psychological autonomy granting, and behavioral control) using the Steinberg Parenting Styles Questionnaire (Lamborn et al., 1991). As predicted, the three parenting factors successfully differentiated between different styles of attachment to mother. At both ages authoritative parenting (i. e., higher levels of all three parenting dimensions) was positively associated with secure attachment to mother, whereas negligent parenting (i. e., lower levels on all three parenting dimensions) predicted insecure attachment, although results were less straightforward for preoccupied attachment. Further, unique patterns of <b>contributions</b> <b>by</b> the <b>parenting</b> dimensions distinguished between different types of insecure attachment. Specifically, parental involvement and psychological autonomy granting uniquely predicted secure and fearful attachment but in opposite directions; parental involvement and behavioral control made independent negative contributions to avoidant/dismissing attachment; and psychological autonomy granting uniquely contributed to preoccupied attachment in adolescence. Findings on the whole were consistent across the two age groups except for preoccupied attachment in middle childhood, for which results were non-significant. Validity of the measure for insecure attachment in middle childhood was also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Parental care (any non-genetic <b>contribution</b> <b>by</b> a <b>parent</b> {{that appears}} likely to {{increase}} the fitness of its offspring) is a widespread trait exhibited by {{a broad range of}} animal taxa. In addition to influencing the fitness of parent(s) and offspring, parental care may be inextricably involved in other evolutionary processes, such as sexual selection and the evolution of endothermy. Yet, recent work has demonstrated that bias related to taxonomy is prevalent across many biological disciplines, and research in parental care may be similarly burdened. Thus, I used parental care articles published in six leading journals of fundamental behavioral sciences (Animal Behaviour, Behavioral Ecology, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, Ethology, Hormones and Behavior, and Physiology & Behavior) from 2001 – 2010 (n =  712) to examine the year-to-year dynamics of two types of bias related to taxonomy across animals: (1) taxonomic bias, which exists when research output is not proportional to the frequency of organisms in nature, and (2) taxonomic citation bias, which is a proxy for the breadth of a given article—specifically, the proportion of articles cited that refer solely to the studied taxon. I demonstrate that research on birds likely represents a disproportionate amount of parental care research and, thus, exhibits taxonomic bias. Parental care research on birds and mammals also refers to a relatively narrow range of taxonomic groups when discussing its context and, thus, exhibits taxonomic citation bias. Further, the levels of taxonomic bias and taxonomic citation bias have not declined over the past decade despite cautionary messages about similar bias in related disciplines— in fact, taxonomic bias may have increased. As in Bonnet et al. (2002), my results should not be interpreted as evidence of an ‘ornithological Mafia’ conspiring to suppress other taxonomic groups. Rather, I generate several rational hypotheses to determine why bias persists and to guide future work...|$|R

40|$|In Moçambique, the {{inclusion}} of external communities within schools became evident in the post-independence period when the first experiments were undertaken to include parents and guardians through parents’ committees and strengthen the linkage between {{the school and the}} community. The law 6 / 92 of 6 th of May, re-enforces this inclusion and recognizes the participation of other entities, including that of communities, in the management of 2 the educational process and gives incentive to a greater connection between the community and the school. School councils are born from the need for openness between the school and the local community. The Ministerial Diploma 54 / 2005, 28 th of May, accordingly seeks to create a greater degree of flexibility, via administrative decentralization, in the decision-making process in schools through participative management. This article, as part of the author’s doctoral studies, aims to understand how the actors who constitute a secondary school’s council perceive their participation in its decision-making process. A qualitative, exploratory approach was adopted in order to interpret the reality within a complex vision. Data was collected via interviews, analysis of minutes of council meetings and observation of the School Council in session. Results indicate that there is a good relationship between the members of the council and the school and, that the school encourages participation of external parties in the meetings. Results also show that the council meetings deal with pedagogic issues, principally with questions related to the behaviour of pupils and teachers and that the external members are concerned with these issues and seek to contribute ideas, opinions and solutions. These <b>contributions</b> made <b>by</b> <b>parents</b> and guardians are accepted and valued when they are in accordance with the established order of school governance. However, results also indicate that as far as decision-making is concerned, it is the school director who makes the final decision and controls the discussions thereby leaving the external members of the school council with little impact on the decision-making process. Data collected indicates that school councils operate under the influence of organizational bureaucracy, micro-politics, anarchy and hypocrisy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a {{powerful}} anti-malarial drug, {{has been used}} as monotherapy and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for more than decades. So far, however, the tissue distribution and metabolic profile of DHA data are not available from animal and humans. Methods Pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, mass balance, and elimination of [14 C] DHA have been studieded in rats following a single intravenous administration. Protein binding was performed with rat and human plasma. Drug concentrations were obtained up to 192 hr from measurements of total radioactivity and drug concentration to determine the <b>contribution</b> <b>by</b> the <b>parent</b> and metabolites to the total dose of drug injected from whole blood, plasma, urine and faecal samples. Results Drug was widely distributed after 1 hr and rapidly declined at 24 hr in all tissues except spleen until 96 hrs. Only 0. 81 % of the total radioactivity was detected in rat brain tissue. DHA revealed a high binding capacity with both rat and human plasma proteins (76 – 82 %). The concentration of total radioactivity in the plasma fraction was less than 25 % of that in blood total. Metabolism of DHA was observed with high excretion via bile into intestines and approximately 89 – 95 % dose of all conjugations were accounted for in blood, urine and faeces. However, the majority of elimination of [14 C] DHA was through urinary excretion (52 % dose). The mean terminal half-lives of plasma and blood radioactivity (75. 57 – 122. 13 h) were significantly prolonged compared with that of unchanged DHA (1. 03 h). Conclusion In rat brain, the total concentration of [14 C] was 2 -fold higher than that in plasma, indicating the radioactivity could easily penetrate the brain-blood barrier. Total radioactivity distributed in RBC was about three- to four-fold higher than that in plasma, suggesting that the powerful anti-malarial potency of DHA in the treatment of blood stage malaria may relate to the high RBC binding. Biliary excretion and multiple concentration peaks of DHA have been demonstrated with high urinary excretion due to a most likely drug re-absorption in the intestines (enterohepatic circulation). The long lasting metabolites of DHA (> 192 hr) in the rats may be also related to the enterohepatic circulation. </p...|$|R
