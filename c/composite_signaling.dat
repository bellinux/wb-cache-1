We will first consider a metagame that evolves to track the successful and unsuccessful use of a coevolving base language, then we will consider a metagame that evolves to track the truth of expressions in a coevolving base language. We will see how a metagame that tracks truth provides an endogenous way to break the symmetry between indicative and imperative interpretations of the base language.

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in recent years toward realizing the potential of natural killer (NK) cells for cancer immunotherapy. NK cells can respond rapidly to transformed and stressed cells and have the intrinsic potential to extravasate and reach their targets in almost all body tissues. In addition to donor-derived primary NK cells, also the established NK cell line NK- 92 is being developed for adoptive immunotherapy, and general safety of infusion of irradiated NK- 92 cells has been established in phase I clinical trials with clinical responses observed in some of the cancer patients treated. To enhance their therapeutic utility, NK- 92 cells have been modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) composed of a tumor-specific single chain fragment variable antibody fragment fused via hinge and transmembrane regions to intracellular signaling moieties such as CD 3 ζ or <b>composite</b> <b>signaling</b> domains containing a costimulatory protein together with CD 3 ζ. CAR-mediated activation of NK cells then bypasses inhibitory signals and overcomes NK resistance of tumor cells. In contrast to primary NK cells, CAR-engineered NK- 92 cell lines suitable for clinical development can be established from molecularly and functionally well-characterized single cell clones following good manufacturing practice-compliant procedures. In preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, potent antitumor activity of NK- 92 variants targeted to differentiation antigens expressed by hematologic malignancies, and overexpressed or mutated self-antigens associated with solid tumors has been found, encouraging further development of CAR-engineered NK- 92 cells. Importantly, in syngeneic mouse tumor models, induction of endogenous antitumor immunity after treatment with CAR-expressing NK- 92 cells has been demonstrated, resulting in cures and long-lasting immunological memory protecting against tumor rechallenge at distant sites. Here, we summarize the current status and future prospects of CAR-engineered NK- 92 cells as off-the-shelf cellular therapeutics, with special emphasis on ErbB 2 (HER 2) -specific NK- 92 cells that are approaching clinical application...|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, a new algorithm, time–frequency {{component}} analyzer (TFCA), is proposed to analyze <b>composite</b> <b>signals,</b> whose components have compact time–frequency supports. Examples {{of this type}} of signals include biological, acoustic, seismic, speech, radar and sonar signals. By conducting its time–frequency analysis in an adaptively chosen warped fractional domain the method provides time–frequency distributions which are as sharp as the Wigner distribution, while suppressing the undesirable interference terms present in the Wigner distribution. Being almost fully automated, TFCA does not require any a priori information on the analyzed signal. By making use of recently developed fast Wigner slice computation algorithm, directionally smoothed Wigner distribution algorithm and fractional domain incision algorithm in the warped fractional domain, the method provides an overall time-frequency representation of the <b>composite</b> <b>signals.</b> It also provides time–frequency representations corresponding to the individual signal components constituting the <b>composite</b> <b>signal.</b> Since, TFCA based analysis enables the extraction of the identified components from the <b>composite</b> <b>signals,</b> it allows detailed post processing of the extracted signal components and their corresponding time–frequency distributions, as well.

40|$|In {{continuation}} {{to earlier}} works {{where the problem}} of joint information embedding and lossless compression (of the <b>composite</b> <b>signal)</b> was studied in the absence [8] and in the presence [9] of attacks, here we consider the additional ingredient of protecting the secrecy of the watermark against an unauthorized party, which has no access to a secret key shared by the legitimate parties. In other words, we study the problem of joint coding for three objectives: information embedding, compression, and encryption. Our main result is a coding theorem that provides a single–letter characterization of the best achievable tradeoffs among the following parameters: the distortion between the <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> and the covertext, the distortion in reconstructing the watermark by the legitimate receiver, the compressibility of the <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> (with and without the key), and the equivocation of the watermark, {{as well as its}} reconstructed version, given the <b>composite</b> <b>signal.</b> In the attack–free case, if the key is independent of the covertext, this coding theorem gives rise to a threefold separation principle that tells that asymptotically, for long block codes, no optimality is lost by first applying a rate– distortion code to the watermark source, then encrypting the compressed codeword, and finally, embedding it into the covertext using the embedding scheme of [8]. In the more general case, however, this separation principle is no longer valid, as the key plays an additional role of side information used by the embedding unit...|$|R

30|$|Typically, {{time-varying}} {{channels are}} characterized by time and frequency dispersions.

For narrow bandwidth <b>composite</b> <b>signals,</b> this approximation may be practically true and the presentations in [2], sufficient. However, for wide-bandwidth signals, the Doppler approximation wholly fails since the <b>composite</b> <b>signals</b> experience different Doppler shifts. This is the case of ultrawideband (UWB) and underwater acoustic (UWA) channels.

40|$|In many {{applications}} one may acquire a composition of several signals {{that may be}} corrupted by noise, {{and it is a}} challenging problem to reliably separate the components from one another without sacrificing significant details.

The Dantzig selector is a statistical approach to finding a solution to a noisy linear regression problem by minimizing the ℓ_ 1 norm of candidate coefficient vectors while constraining the scope of the residuals. If the underlying coefficient vector is sparse, then the Dantzig selector performs well in the recovery and separation of the unknown <b>composite</b> <b>signal.</b> In the following, we propose a proximity operator based algorithm to recover and separate unknown noisy undersampled <b>composite</b> <b>signals</b> through the Dantzig selector.
