To verify {{the existence of this}} effect in living tissue, we measured <b>CV</b> <b>in</b> macroscopically anisotropic monolayers of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with controlled fiber curvature. A novel growthdirecting substrate was used to produce fiber fields with significant curvature (78 ˚/cm to 333 ˚/cm). Anisotropy ratios (longitudinal CV / transverse <b>CV)</b> measured <b>in</b> cultures grown using this method (n= 32) were 2. 3 ± 0. 3, which is similar to the anisotropy exhibited by human ventricular myocardium. Propagating wavefronts were initiated transverse to fiber orientation in two alternating directions (with respect to fiber curvature) using unipolar stimulation. Action potentials were recorded using a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye (di- 4 -ANEPPS) and a high speed digital video camera. A statistically significant (p= 0. 00033) <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> was observed when propagation direction was reversed with respect to the direction of fiber curvature. The measured <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> was 0. 38 ± 0. 44 cm/s for all samples (n= 24). A control group of cultures with uncurved transverse fiber orientation was also studied, and a 0. 06 ± 0. 18 cm/s (p=NS) difference <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> was measured for propagation in both directions in this group (n= 8). We conclude that fiber curvature can affect CV and may be involved in arrhythmiogenesis, for example, by promoting wavebreak or conduction block. ii DEDICATION To my parents and my sister for their encouragement and support, to Jack Roger...|$|R

MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference, plasma creatine kinase activity (CK), myoglobin concentration (Mb) and muscle soreness were assessed before, immediately after, 1 h and 1 - 5 days following both exercise bouts. Force fluctuations during 30, 50 and 80 % MVC were quantified by coefficient of variation (CV) of the force data (sampling frequency: 100 Hz) for 4 s.

40|$|AbstractReduced {{conduction}} velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>in</b> the myocardium {{is well known}} to increase the probability of arrhythmia and {{can be caused by}} structural changes, reduced excitability of individual myocytes, or decreased electrical coupling in the tissue. Recently, investigators have developed antiarrhythmic drugs that target the connections between individual myocytes with the goal of restoring tissue CV, specifically through increasing gap-junction coupling. In a simple but qualitatively relevant mathematical model, we show here that the introduction of a drug that improves intercellular conductance will indeed increase the CV. However, conditions that would require such a drug, such as fibrotic remodeling, may also increase the load of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts may couple to myocytes {{in much the same way}} as myocytes couple to each other, and therefore the use of such an agent may also improve coupling between myocytes and fibroblasts. We present numerical examples illustrating that when the load of coupled fibroblasts on myocytes is low or nonexistent, the drug works as expected, i. e., the drug increases CV. On the other hand, when the fibroblast load is high, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> are nonmonotonic, i. e., the CV first increases and then decreases with an increase in dosage. The existence of coupled fibroblasts may therefore impair the effect of the drug, and under unfortunate conditions may be proarrhythmic...|$|R

Integrated backscatter (IB) from a myocardial region, calculated from radiofrequency echocardiographic data, has been proposed as a useful parameter for investigating <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> myocardial tissue induced by ischemia. In 10 closed-chest dogs, 5 minutes of myocardial ischemia was induced by either a proximal occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery (CX) (5 dogs), resulting in extensive ischemia in the posterior wall, or by occluding the distal CX vessel (5 dogs) to produce a small localized ischemic zone in the posterior wall. High-resolution digital radiofrequency data from the whole left ventricular myocardium, in the imaging plane during one complete heart cycle, were acquired with a whole-image real-time acquisition approach. Regions in the septum and posterior wall (both ischemic tissue and, {{in the case of}} distal occlusions, tissue surrounding the ischemic zone) were chosen for analysis, and IB and cyclic variation (CV) of IB were calculated.

The current recommendations by all United States guideline committees, including the American Diabetes Association and the JNC 7, include screening for microalbuminuria {{in those with}} diabetes or evidence of kidney disease, but not the general population. Internationally, both the Canadian and European Guidelines have concurred with this approach. This recommendation {{is due in part}} to the findings from long-term outcome studies that measurement of microalbuminuria, while a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk, fails to shows <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> events if reduced. Unfortunately, this conclusion may be wrong because no randomized trial has examined the question of whether a reduction in microalbuminuria does correlate with a reduction <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> events. Thus, we don't know the answer to this question. Additionally, a recent cost-effective analysis was just published, suggesting it is not worth measuring urinary albumin because it is too expensive for the information obtained. Unfortunately, these conclusions were based on the same faulty logic that relates <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> microalbuminuria to cardiovascular events. It is clear that microalbuminuria is a cardiovascular risk factor, acknowledged by both the JNC 7 and the European Guidelines. Moreover, presence of microalbuminuria correlates strongly with elevated levels of C-reactive protein and abnormal vascular responsiveness to vasodilating stimuli. Thus, its presence indicates abnormal responses by vascular tissue, perhaps due to underlying inflammatory responses. Every clinical trial that has assessed <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria as a secondary end point with clinical outcomes has shown a strongly positive correlation between reduction in albuminuria and greater protection of a given end organ; this effect is, in part, independent of blood pressure reduction. Thus, what is needed is a clinical trial in people at high cardiovascular risk, such as those in the INVEST or ALLHAT trials where the primary end point is <b>change</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria and its relationship to cardiovascular outcomes. Likewise, a cardiovascular primary end point could relate to the secondary end point of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> microalbuminuria, and the latter powered appropriately to make stronger statements about albuminuria and cardiovascular outcomes.

It has been shown that dual-task induced gait changes that could be related to (1) the efficiency of executive function, (2) the level of difficulty involved in the walking-associated task, or (3) the articulo-motor components comprised in the walking-associated task. A better understanding of dual-task related <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> demented subjects with frontal lobe dysfunction could help us to clarify the role of the frontal lobe in motor gait control. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the effects of two mental arithmetic tasks involving similar articulo-motor components but different level of difficulty on the mean values and coefficient of variation (CV) of stride time among demented older adults with impaired executive function. METHODS: The mean values and coefficients of variation of stride time were measured using a GAITRite((R)) -System among 16 demented older adults with impaired executive function while walking with and without forward counting (FC) and backward counting (BC). RESULTS: The mean values and CV of stride time were significantly higher under both dual-task conditions than during a simple walking task (p< 0. 05). The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> of stride time during BC was significantly higher when compared with the change during FC (p= 0. 015), whereas the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> mean value was not significant (p= 0. 056).

Results: Mean increase in CCT on postoperative Day 1 was 58 &#x 00 B 5;m and 97 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 01). Increase in CCT at one month was 10 &#x 00 B 5;m and 11 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 99); increase in CCT at three months was 3 &#x 00 B 5;m and 6 &#x 00 B 5;m in Groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0. 86). Number of eyes with flare grades in a range of 0 to 3 was statistically higher in Group 2 on postoperative Day 1 (P = 0. 004, 0. 016, &# 60; 0. 001, 0. 047 for Grade 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively). Number of eyes with cells of Grade 3 on first postoperative day was significantly higher in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (P = 0. 004). Three months postoperatively, endothelial cell loss was 5. 5 &#x 0025; and 7. 8 &#x 0025; in Groups 1 and 2 (P = 0. 21) and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> was 3 and 5. 4 in Groups 1 and 2 (P = 0. 20) respectively. Conclusion: BSS offers a significant advantage over RL in terms of increase in corneal thickness and postoperative inflammation on the first postoperative day in patients undergoing phacoemulsification...|$|R

40|$|Oxycodone (OXY) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused opiates during pregnancy. Perinatal opiate exposure (POE) is associated with neurobehavioral and hormone changes. Little is known about the effects of perinatal OXY on the cardiovascular (CV) responses to stress. Objectives: to determine the effects of POE on: (1) CV responses to acute stress and ability to discriminate using a classical conditioning paradigm; (2) <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>CV</b> response to the paradigm and retention of the ability to discriminate from postnatal day (PD) 40 to young adulthood. Methods: Pregnant rats were given i. v. OXY or vehicle (CON) daily. OXY and CON males were fitted with BP telemetry units. Offspring were classically conditioned by following a pulsed tone (CS+) with tail shock. A steady tone (CS-) was not followed by shock. BP and HR were recorded during resting periods and conditioning. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> BP, HR from composite analysis were compared. The paradigm was repeated on PD 75. Results: At PD 40, OXY rats had a lower baseline mean BP (OXY: 114. 8 &# 177; 1. 0 vs CON: 118. 3 &# 177; 1. 0 mm Hg; mean &# 177; SEM) but larger amplitude of the conditional BP increase during the stress response (OXY + 3. 9 &# 177; 0. 4 vs CON + 1. 7 &# 177; 0. 4 mm Hg.) Both OXY and CON rats were able to discriminate between CS+ and CS-. At PD 75, the effects of OXY on the increased amplitude of the conditional BP had dissipated (CON: + 3. 4 &# 177; 2. 3 vs OXY: + 4. 5 &# 177; 1. 4 mm Hg). BP responses to the stress and non-stress stimuli did not differ in the OXY group, suggesting that OXY may have decreased the ability of the offspring to discriminate (OXY: CS+: 147. 1 &# 177; 1. 6, CS-: 145. 9 &# 177; 1. 6 mm Hg vs CON: CS+: 155. 4 &# 177; 2. 7, CS-: 147. 8 &# 177; 2. 7 mm Hg). Conclusion: POE is associated with subtle alterations <b>in</b> stress <b>CV</b> responses <b>in</b> weanling rats which dissipate when the conditioning is repeated at an early adult age. Although POE effect on the ability to discriminate at weanling age could not be detected, POE may impair retention of this ability in adulthood...|$|R

However, it is unclear whether a reduction in CRP is associated with a reduction in risk of clinical events. Therefore we sought to investigate, in a meta-regression analysis of randomized studies enrolling patients treated by statins, whether <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> CRP are associated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> risk of <b>CV</b> events or overall survival. METHODS: Randomized trials enrolling patients treated by statins, reporting CRP at baseline and at end of follow-up, CV events [myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke], CV and all-cause mortality were selected. RESULTS: Twenty-two trials enrolling 54, 213 participants were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis showed that active treatment significantly reduced risk of all-cause death by 8...|$|R

40|$|Banana {{fruit of}} cv. Gros Michel (Musa acuminata, AAA Group, locally called cv. Hom Thong) and cv. Namwa (Musa x paradisiaca, ABB Group) were {{immersed}} for 5, 10 and 15 min in water at 42 degrees C, or in water at 25 degrees C (control), and were then stored at 4 degrees C. Hot water treatment for 15 min delayed peel blackening during cold storage by about 4 days <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Gros Michel and by 2 days <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Namwa. <b>In</b> both cultivars the delay of blackening {{was correlated with}} an increase in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Hot water treatment <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Gros Michel but not cv. Namwa was correlated with lower lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and lower levels of thiobarbitutic acid-reactive compounds. The results suggest that the rapid peel blackening of cv. Gros Michel is related to detectable membrane degradation, whereas the membrane-associated changes might be below the detection limit in the slower blackening cv. Namwa. The delay of peel blackening <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Gros Michel was associated with reduced expression of a catechol oxidase gene, which might partially explain the lower catechol oxidase activity after hot water treatment. The hot water treatment also increased the abundance of a Hsp 70 transcript.

An increase in temperature firstly resulted in the cessation of leaf elongation in both genotypes; however, later <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Steptoe plants, as distinct from mutants, the rate of leaf length increment was completely restored. Before air warming, transpiration was more intense in mutant plants; at increased temperature, transpiration was activated in both genotypes. After growth resumption, the water potential <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Steptoe plants somewhat increased as compared with initial level (before warming). In AZ 34 leaves, in contrast, the water potential, which was initially below that <b>in</b> <b>cv.</b> Steptoe leaves, reduced after temperature increase.
