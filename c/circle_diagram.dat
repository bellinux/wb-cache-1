40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{brushless}} {{doubly fed}} machine (BDFM), or self-cascade single-frame machine, can operate asynchronously or synchronously {{over a wide}} speed range. In this sense the machine becomes an adjustable speed synchronous machine. Such machines may become unstable in certain regions of operation. Analyzing its steady-state performance and determining its stable operating regions are very important efforts to pursue. This thesis presents the theory and its verification in order to predict the steady-state operating performance of the BDFM using a method based on <b>circle</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The stable regions and the loci of operating points for different mechanical input characteristics are presented...|$|R
5000|$|In the blocked rotor test, {{the rotor}} is locked. A low voltage is applied on the stator {{terminals}} {{so that there}} is full load current in the stator winding, and the current, voltage and power input are measured at that point. When the rotor is stationary, the slip, [...] The test is conducted at [...] the rated frequency as recommended by IEEE, because the rotor's effective resistance at low frequency may differ at high frequency. The test can be repeated for different values of voltage to ensure the values obtained are consistent. As the current through the stator may exceed the rated current, the test should be conducted quickly. By using the parameters found by this test, the motor <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of increasingly complex hilts, Thibault's ideal hilt was relatively simple. It featured straight quillons, equal in length to the sole of the swordsman's foot, as well as finger rings and side rings, with little else. Thibault gives proportional measurements for the various components of the hilt, each based on his <b>circle</b> <b>diagram.</b> These measurements dictate that the sword's quillons are to equal the length of one's foot, the combined length of pommel and grip should equal exactly twice {{the length of the}} guard from the quillons forward, and so on. Most notably, Thibault's sword lacks a knuckle bow in order to allow his unorthodox method of gripping the sword. The knuckle bow interferes with the wrist when holding the sword in Thibault's primary straight arm grip.|$|E
40|$|Already, we {{reported}} the <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> methods of analyzing {{the characteristics of}} a static Kramer system by using an L-type equivalent circuit and a T-type equivalent circuit. In order to calculate the characteristics, it is necessary to separate the primary leakage reactance from the secondary leakage reactance. But, in case of determining the constants of the equivalent circuits by the experimental results, it is theoretically impossible to separate the leakage reactances. Then, we analyzed the characteristics by a new T-type <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method by applying the new T-type equivalent circuit suggested by Dr. Yamamura to the static Kramer system. As a result of the analysis, we pointed out that the values obtained from the results using this new T-type <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method give fairly good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|A static　Kramer　system　having　a constant　output　characteristic　has　the {{weak point}} {{that it can not}} change the {{supplementary}} machine to a static system. However, recently, this system has widely received practical application for minute speed control because it is composed of simple equipment, and it is able to be controlled stably and efficiently by adjusting the exciting current of the d-c motor. 　Already, we proposed the new <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method of analyzing the characteristics of a static Kramer system by using a simple equivalent circuit considering the effect of d. c. voltage drop to be caused by the commutating period, forward voltage drop of the receifier, and brush voltage drop. 　In a wound-type induction motor, a no-load current is generally 30 to 50 per cent rated current. Therefore, it is inaccurate to calculate the characteristics by using an L-type equivalent circuit. Then, we applied a T-type equivalent　circuit　to the static Kramer　system　and analyzed the characteristics by a T-type <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method. 　As a result of the analysis, we pointed out that this T-type <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method can derive sufficiently precise results in the practical region of slip from no load to full load, by considering the effect of overlapping angle and using coefficients dｅpending on the commutating period...|$|E

40|$|The optical coating {{design of}} beamsplitters and anti-reflection {{coatings}} that are non-polarizing, {{those that have}} the same reflection for both s- and p-polarizations at specified angles, is a challenge. This is because the effective indices of refrac-tion for the media and coating layer materials have a different function of the angle of incidence for each polarization. This limits what can be achieved. Specific materials {{can be used to}} design reasonable non-polarizing coatings at only certain angles, whereas other materials can be made to serve for other angles. The choice of materials seems to be {{critical to the success of}} any particular requirement. Since the range of practical coating materials and substrates is limited for most applications, non-polarizing solutions seem to be quantized in reflectance and angle.

40|$|Logicians {{commonly}} {{speak in}} a relatively undifferentiated way about pre-euler diagrams. The thesis of this paper, however, {{is that there were}} three periods in the early modern era in which euler-type diagrams (line diagrams as well as <b>circle</b> <b>diagrams)</b> were expansively used. Expansive periods are characterized by continuity, and regressive periods by discontinuity: While on the one hand an ongoing awareness of the use of euler-type diagrams occurred within an expansive period, after a subsequent phase of regression the entire knowledge about the systematic application and the history of euler-type diagrams was lost. I will argue that the first expansive period lasted from Vives (1531) to Alsted (1614). The second period began around 1660 with Weigel and ended in 1712 with lange. The third period of expansion started around 1760 with the works of Ploucquet, euler and lambert. Finally, it is shown that euler-type diagrams became popular in the debate about intuition which took place in the 1790 s between leibnizians and Kantians. The article is thus limited to the historical periodization between 1530 and 1800...|$|R

40|$|Because the <b>circle</b> <b>diagram</b> method (JEC- 37 - 1961) {{being used}} now, is using Z_so {{which has been}} presumed by {{proportional}} method {{from the results of}} Rock-test in rated frequency and 1 / 2 -rated frequency, the characteristics of deep-slot-squirrel-cage induction motor which is calculated by this method (JEC- 37 - 1961), has some errors. This paper shows these errors which are made theoretically. As results, the writer has known that these errors are negligiblly small in the scope whose depth of slot is under two centimeter, but are very large in the scope whose depth of slot is over two centimeter. In the scope whose depth of slot is over two centimeter, maximum torque and power factor and slip are calculated in larger values than in true ones, and efficiency and rated current are calculated in smaller values than true ones. And the error in the maximum torque is paticularly large. 現在深溝かご形誘導電動機の特性算定に特殊円線図手法を用いているが，これはZ_{SO}を比例推定によって求めるもので，一般に最大値特性が実測値より大きくなって求まる傾向があるといわれている。筆者はこの点に着目し理論上比例推定法によって特性算定を行なうと定格周波数が商用周波数の場合に算出された特性にどのような誤差を伴なうのか明らかにしてみた。この結果，溝深さ約 2 cm近辺に誤差の正負変位点があり， 2 cm以下では真値に比べて最大トルク，力率，滑りは小さく，定格電流，効率は大きくなって求まり， 2 cm以上の範囲に於ては逆に最大トルク，力率，滑りは真値より大きく，定格電流，効率は小さくなって求まることがわかった。また，これ等の誤差は溝深さ 2 cm以下の範囲では無視できる程小さいが，溝深さ 2 cmを超える範囲では溝深さが大きくなればなる程大で無視することはできない。またこの誤差は最大トルク特性に於て特に著しくあらわれかなり大きな値となることがわかった。この問題は重慣性負荷用電動機の特性算定に重要な役割をはたすものと思われ，また電動力応用上参考になると考えられるのでここに報告する...|$|E

The conventional materials like tungsten carbide(WC), titanium carbide(TiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN) and diamond used as cutting tools for turning operations on lathe are expensive.
