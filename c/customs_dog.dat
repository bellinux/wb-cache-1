Today, many other agencies use <b>dogs</b> bred by <b>Customs.</b> <b>Customs</b> bred <b>dogs</b> have been deployed in a variety of fields including arson detection, food detection or explosives/firearms detection. Australian Drug Detector Dogs have been provided to various nations under Regional Assistance Programs managed by AusAID (the Australian Federal Government Overseas Aid Agency).|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the birth}} of Jennifer’s first child Shane, Jennifer began {{to look for a}} piece of jewelry that not only had her son’s name on it but also {{expressed}} her own personal style. Unable to find anything unique and not mass-produced, she designed her own special piece that reflected the significance of his birth. Jennifer designed a <b>custom</b> <b>dog</b> tag which she styled with a long thick chain. Friends, family, and strangers saw this piece and began requesting their own. As a result, Jennifer Fisher Jewelry was founded in 2005.|$|R

2500|$|Although it was {{nominally}} a customs service, the Bundeszollverwaltung (BZV) {{was responsible}} for policing much of the inner German border. Its original duties focused on stopping smuggling across the border, though this task virtually ceased after the border was fortified in 1952. The BZV continued to man the few remaining border crossings but its duties now evolved into the policing of the border zone {{to a depth of}} about [...] Unlike the BGS, which was based in barracks located further back from the border, BZV personnel lived with their families in communities along the border. They carried out regular policing tasks with the power to arrest and search suspects in their area of operations (with the exception of the section of border in Bavaria). They regularly patrolled the border line– including the river border along the Elbe, where they maintained a fleet of patrol boats– in two-man patrols or with the iconic Zollhunde, trained <b>customs</b> <b>dogs</b> wearing a Zoll ("Customs") strap. The BZV was, in effect, West Germany's eyes and ears on the border.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{the growth in}} the Detector Dog Program had led to {{difficulties}} in sourcing sufficient quality dogs to supply the program. The solution was the development of the <b>Customs</b> detector <b>dog</b> breeding program to produce a reliable, high quality supply of dogs. This development included research by Mr John Vanderloo, into the best dog breed to meet the requirements of Customs across a range of criteria, with the Labrador breed being selected for their focus, versatility, temperament, and strong hunt and retrieve drives.|$|R

50|$|While some Asian {{cultures}} practise the <b>custom</b> {{of eating}} <b>dogs,</b> this is strictly forbidden to the Mosuo. In Mosuo culture, a myth describes that long ago, dogs had life spans of 60 years while humans had life spans of thirteen years. Humans felt their life span was too short, so they traded {{it with the}} dogs in exchange for paying homage to them. Therefore, dogs are valued members of the family. They are never killed, and they most certainly are never eaten. During the initiation rites into adulthood, Mosuo adolescents pray before the family dogs.|$|R
60|$|The bee-hunter {{had some}} {{difficulty}} in finding {{his way across}} the marsh; but floundering through the impediments, and on the whole preserving the main direction, he got out on the firm ground quite as soon as he had expected to do. It was necessary for him to use extreme caution. The Indians according to their <b>custom</b> had <b>dogs,</b> two of which had been in sight, lying about half-way between the prisoner and the door of the hut. Boden had seen a savage feeding these dogs; and it appeared to him at the time as if the Indian had been telling them to be watchful of the Chippewa. He well knew the services that the red men expected of these animals, which are kept rather as sentinels than for any great use they put them to in the hunts. An Indian dog is quick enough to give the alarm, and he will keep on a trail for a long run and with considerable accuracy, but it is seldom that he closes and has his share in the death, unless in the case of very timid and powerless creatures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{completely}} different principle of hanging is to hang the convicted person from his legs, {{rather than from}} his neck, either {{as a form of}} torture, or as an execution method. In late medieval Germany, this came to be primarily associated with Jewish thieves, called the [...] "Judenstrafe". The jurist Ulrich Tengler, in his highly influential [...] "Layenspiegel" [...] from 1509, describes the procedure as follows, in the section [...] "Von Juden straff": [...] About dragging the Jew to the ordinary execution place between two mad or biting dogs. After dragging, to hang him from his feet by rope or chain at a designated gallows between the dogs, and in such inverted manner to be executed, from life to death Guido Kisch showed that originally, this type of inverted hanging between two dogs was not a punishment specifically for Jews. Esther Cohen writes: The inverted hanging with the accompaniment of two dogs, originally reserved for traitors, was identified from the fourteenth century as the [...] "Jewish execution", being practised in the later Middle Ages in both northern and Mediterranean Europe. The Jewish execution in Germany has been thoroughly studied by G. Kisch, who has argued convincingly that neither the inverted hanging nor the stringing up of dogs or wolves beside the victim were particularly Jewish punishments during the High Middle Ages. They first appeared as Jewish punishments in Germany only {{towards the end of the}} thirteenth century, never being recognized as exclusively Jewish penalties. In France the inverted, animal-associated hanging came to be connected with Jews by the later Middle Ages. The inverted hanging of Jews is specifically mentioned in the old customs of Burgundy in the context of animal hanging. The <b>custom,</b> <b>dogs</b> and all, was still in force in Paris shortly before the final expulsion of the Jews in 1394 In Spain 1449, during a mob attack against the Marranos (Jews nominally converted to Christianity), the Jews resisted, but lost and several of them were hanged up by the feet. The first attested German case for a Jew being hanged by the feet is from 1296, in present-day Soultzmatt. Some other historical examples of this type of hanging within the German context are 1 Jew in Hennegau 1326, two Jews hanged in Frankfurt 1444, 1 in Halle in 1462, 1 in Dortmund 1486, 1 in Hanau 1499, 1 in Breslau 1505, 1 in Württemberg 1553, 1 in Bergen 1588, 1 in Öttingen 1611, 1 in Frankfurt 1615 and again in 1661, and 1 condemned to this punishment in Prussia in 1637.|$|R
60|$|Another {{instance}} of similar sagacity, {{a friend of}} mine discovered in a beautiful little spaniel, which he had purchased from a dealer in the canine race. When he entered a shop, he was not long in observing that his little companion made it a rule to follow at some interval, and to estrange itself from his master so much as to appear totally unconnected with him. And when he left the shop, it was the <b>dog's</b> <b>custom</b> to remain behind him till it could find an opportunity of seizing a pair of gloves, or silk stockings, or some similar property, which it brought to its master. The poor fellow probably saved its life by falling into the hands of an honest man.|$|R
2500|$|In recent years, some Korean {{people have}} changed their attitudes towards eating dog meat from [...] "personal choice" [...] to [...] "unnecessary cruelty." [...] Animal rights activists in South Korea protest against the <b>custom</b> of eating <b>dog</b> meat. Since 1988, {{international}} animal welfare activists – most notably, French actress Brigitte Bardot – have campaigned against dog meat consumption in South Korea. However, Korean nationalists on the internet have defended the consumption of dog meat, accusing animal welfare activists of forcing [...] "Westernization" [...] on Korea. A 2007 survey by the Korean Ministry of Agriculture showed that 59% of Koreans aged under 30 would not eat dog. Some 62% {{of the same age}} group said they regard dogs as pets, not food. Many young Koreans think those who eat dog are anachronists.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{a village}} at the Great Slave Lake, that, {{in the course of}} resenting the evil of the hands of the man-animals, he came to modify the law that he had learned from Grey Beaver: namely, that the unpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods. In this village, after the <b>custom</b> of all <b>dogs</b> in all villages, White Fang went foraging, for food. A boy was {{chopping}} frozen moose-meat with an axe, and the chips were flying in the snow. White Fang, sliding by in quest of meat, stopped and began to eat the chips. He observed the boy lay down the axe and take up a stout club. White Fang sprang clear, just in time to escape the descending blow. The boy pursued him, and he, a stranger in the village, fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank.|$|R
5000|$|Borat Sagdiyev {{is another}} {{character}} featured frequently on the show, introduced as someone Ali G came across on obscure satellite TV [...] "whilst {{waiting for the}} 10-minute free preview on the Fantasy Channel". He comes from Kazakhstan, and travels around the United Kingdom and United States interviewing people and engaging in their activities. Though well-intentioned, Borat often makes his guests feel uncomfortable by introducing them to [...] "Kazakh" [...] customs, or by making misogynistic, anti-Semitic, or other comments based on his unfamiliar culture, which are often undercut by {{various aspects of the}} film, e.g., Borat's hometown being a gypsy village and Hebrew being his native language (rather, the actual village shown in the films is a Roma village but is presented as a [...] "typical Kazakh village", and the foreign language he speaks is Hebrew, but the character of Borat dislikes gypsies, and claims to have once been a [...] "gypsy catcher", while people are led to believe that he is speaking in Kazakh, because they don't recognize the Hebrew language he is actually speaking). Borat makes references to his favourite sport called [...] "shurik", a [...] "Kazakh" [...] <b>custom</b> where <b>dogs</b> are shot and killed in a field. He also makes references to his dead wife, his brother Bilo and his desire to have [...] "sexy time" [...] with many of his interviewees. A highly successful film based on the Borat character, titled Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, was released by 20th Century Fox on 3 November 2006. In the film, Borat travels from Kazakhstan to learn more about American culture for his country.|$|R
40|$|A {{century ago}} Iceland {{had the highest}} {{prevalence}} of human hydatid disease ever recorded anywhere. Since 1864 the disease has been gradually controlled, and today there is less than one new case per decade. The sheep population of about one million, over 95 % of which is subject to inspection at slaughter, has yielded only 15 infected animals in the last 20 years. In most districts farm slaughtering still persists, though on a very limited scale, and farm dogs are subjected to very little control. The main credit for the remarkable control of E. granulosus is given to education, but many accidental social and environmental factors, peculiar to Iceland, contributed to the result. Of these, the most notable were the small human population and high rate of literacy; the very high dog mortality from distemper in the 19 th century, which coincided with a major export trade in live sheep; the <b>custom</b> of feeding <b>dogs</b> on cooked household scraps, the risk of infection being confined to the short sheep slaughtering season and the rare occasions when a cow or pig is slaughtered; the absence of employed labour on Icelandic farms, all slaughtering being done by the owner, an educated man with middle-class values; the change in animal husbandry since 1920 towards the slaughter of 5 -month-old lambs, {{too young to have}} viable cysts; and the meat subsidy, which since 1947 has led to the use of abattoirs for all but a handful of uneconomic animals kept for slaughter on the farm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The article {{presents}} and discusses the <b>custom</b> of kynomartyrion (<b>dog</b> torture) {{which took place}} in the Greek lands until the 1980 s. In many areas it stopped in the 1930 s because of its cruelty. The author begins his discussion with the presentation of some elements that are related to the dog. More spe-cifically, the dog is an animal that entered the humanized environment long ago and belongs to the creatures whose nature is twofold because {{it is part of the}} human and the non-human worlds and it has been treated as twofold by at least the Indo-Europeans. It is also maintained that the liminal Hellenistic period was decisive for the formation of folk worship because of the religious syncre-tism and the invasion of demons that dominated in the Eastern Mediterranean. The author points out its remarkable similarities to ancient Greek and Roman (and Indo-European) fertile, cathartic and other sacrificial practices. Due to industrialization of agriculture and rationalization of the magical way of thought of the “traditional ” peasant, performance of the custom was transformed into a folkloric, spectacular one with intensely violent and sadistic behaviour on the part of humans in the places where it still took place after 1960. The writer argues that violence was always an inherent characteristic of the custom. None-theless, the archaic, and later folk thinking ritualized the performance and attributed to it a different facet, devoid of any sacred elements, during the 20 th century where its inherent violence was manifested in its raw essence...|$|R
60|$|There are a {{great many}} dogs in shy neighbourhoods, who keep boys. I have my eye on a mongrel in Somerstown who keeps three boys. He feigns that he can bring down sparrows, and unburrow rats (he can do neither), and he takes the boys out on {{sporting}} pretences into all sorts of suburban fields. He has likewise made them believe that he possesses some mysterious knowledge {{of the art of}} fishing, and they consider themselves incompletely equipped for the Hampstead ponds, with a pickle-jar and wide-mouthed bottle, unless he is with them and barking tremendously. There is a dog residing in the Borough of Southwark who keeps a blind man. He may be seen, most days, in Oxford-street, haling the blind man away on expeditions wholly uncontemplated by, and unintelligible to, the man: wholly of the dog's conception and execution. Contrariwise, when the man has projects, the dog will sit down in a crowded thoroughfare and meditate. I saw him yesterday, wearing the money- tray like an easy collar, instead of offering it to the public, taking the man against his will, on the invitation of a disreputable cur, apparently to visit a dog at Harrow--he was so intent on that direction. The north wall of Burlington House Gardens, between the Arcade and the Albany, offers a shy spot for appointments among blind men at about two or three o'clock in the afternoon. They sit (very uncomfortably) on a sloping stone there, and compare notes. Their dogs may always be observed at the same time, openly disparaging the men they keep, to one another, and settling where they shall respectively take their men when they begin to move again. At a small butcher's, in a shy neighbourhood (there is no reason for suppressing the name; it is by Notting- hill, and gives upon the district called the Potteries), I know a shaggy black and white dog who keeps a drover. He is a dog of an easy disposition, and too frequently allows this drover to get drunk. On these occasions, it is the <b>dog's</b> <b>custom</b> to sit outside the public-house, keeping his eye on a few sheep, and thinking. I have seen him with six sheep, plainly casting up in his mind how many he began with when he left the market, and at what places he has left the rest. I have seen him perplexed by not being able to account to himself for certain particular sheep. A light has gradually broken on him, he has remembered at what butcher's he left them, and in a burst of grave satisfaction has caught a fly off his nose, and shown himself much relieved. If I could at any time have doubted {{the fact that it was}} he who kept the drover, and not the drover who kept him, it would have been abundantly proved by his way of taking undivided charge of the six sheep, when the drover came out besmeared with red ochre and beer, and gave him wrong directions, which he calmly disregarded. He has taken the sheep entirely into his own hands, has merely remarked with respectful firmness, 'That instruction would place them under an omnibus; you had better confine your attention to yourself--you will want it all;' and has driven his charge away, with an intelligence of ears and tail, and a knowledge of business, that has left his lout of a man very, very far behind.|$|R
40|$|The use of drug {{dogs in the}} United States {{began in}} 1970 when the United States <b>Customs</b> started using <b>dog</b> sniffs to detect the {{presence}} of contraband. This practice raised the Fourth Amendment issue of whether {{the use of a}} dog sniff required probable cause and a warrant. In United States v. Place, the United States Supreme Court found that a dog sniff is not a Fourth Amendment search because it is “less intrusive than a typical search” and because it reveals only “the presence or absence of narcotics. ” Since that decision, some State courts have interpreted their constitutions to hold that a dog sniff is an unreasonable search. However, under Article I, Section 12 of the Florida Constitution, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures 2 ̆ 2 shall be construed in conformity with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. 2 ̆ 2 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: “The {{right of the people to}} secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. 2 ̆ 2 	The purpose of this Note is to address the recent Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals decision State v. Rabb. In Rabb, the court held that a dog sniff conducted in the exterior of the home is a Fourth Amendment search. The court distinguished the factual scenario in Rabb from Place by focusing on the fact that in Place the use of the dog sniff was on baggage at an airport, while in Rabb, the use of the dog sniff was at a private residence. The court referred to the long-standing proposition that one 2 ̆ 7 s home is given extraordinary protection under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and cited Kyllo v. United States as the controlling case in Rabb, stating that a dog sniff at the home violates the Fourth Amendment because: 2 ̆ 2 [A]ny physical invasion of the structure of the home, 2 ̆ 7 by even a fraction of an inch, 2 ̆ 7 was too much, and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the officer who barely cracks open the door and sees nothing but the nonintimate rug on the vestibule floor. In the home, our cases show, all details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes. 2 ̆ 2 This Note argues that a dog sniff, as conducted in Rabb, is not a Fourth Amendment search. Ultimately, this Note will contend that a dog sniff conducted in the exterior of a home open to public use does not violate a legitimate expectation of privacy at the home, and thus, is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Part II will briefly review relevant precedent on Fourth Amendment searches and dog sniffs. Part III will address the relevant precedent on dog sniffs at a dwelling place in Florida, namely the decision in Nelson v. State. Part IV will explain the court’s reasoning in Rabb from both the majority’s perspective and the dissent’s perspective. Part V will explain my criticisms and concerns of the Rabb decision. I will then conclude with why the decision in Rabb unduly burdens law enforcement and must be overturned...|$|R
