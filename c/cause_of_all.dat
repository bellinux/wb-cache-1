50|$|Prep’s Collegio {{model is}} illustrative of this unique approach. Collegio synthesizes the core {{humanities}} - English, history and theology - into one class taught by two instructors. What would this mean, for example, in a Sophomore Collegio? In one unit, students analyze The Tale of Two Cities while exploring broader historical and religious movements in 18th century Europe. The learning experience transitions from fact mastery to connecting ideas, from the {{specific to the}} general: What are the root <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> revolutions? And back from general to specific: How do the root <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> revolutions apply to the recent uprisings in the Middle East? What religious movements contributed to these revolutions? This integration happens within a spirit of collaboration as students and teachers work together toward the common goal of deeper understanding.|$|R

It is also most {{difficult}} karma to destroy. If mohaniya karma is destroyed fully, the self becomes free from all Kasayas and liberation is assured.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of a strong {{national}} police force or regular military forces, a White Terror began in western Hungary by half-regular and half-militarist detachments that spread throughout the country.

25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E
25|$|In , Raziel {{discovers that}} it was prophesied {{in the distant past}} that two champions would battle to decide the fate of Nosgoth. Raziel seeks to revive Janos, but learns that he must kill Kain to do so. Coaxed into believing that they are the champions, Raziel and Kain fight, with Raziel the victor. He resurrects Janos, who enables him to enhance the wraith-blade with spiritual powers, but to little avail; Raziel is trapped by The Elder God. While in captivity, he reaches the epiphany that he is both champions (Kain was neither); his free will allows him to {{determine}} Nosgoth's ultimate future. He reflects that the Elder is the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the conflict and strife throughout history, and when Kain re-emerges, alive, with the Reaver, Raziel reconciles with him and willingly surrenders to the sword. Before his soul is consumed, he disperses the wraith-blade into Kain, simultaneously curing Kain's corruption, dooming himself to thousands of years of torment in the Reaver, and releasing his future self from that same imprisonment. Kain uses the newly created Soul Reaver to battle The Elder God, and concludes that Raziel's sacrifice has offered him hope.|$|E

25|$|Much of the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> {{this may}} {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and now that they were once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E
500|$|Two {{concepts}} {{that are of}} paramount importance in the Upanishads are Brahman and Atman. The Brahman is the ultimate reality and the Atman is individual self (soul). Brahman is the material, efficient, formal and final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that exists. It is the pervasive, genderless, infinite, eternal truth and bliss which does not change, yet is the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> changes. Brahman is [...] "the infinite source, fabric, core and destiny of all existence, both manifested and unmanifested, the formless infinite substratum and from which the universe has grown". Brahman in Hinduism, states Paul Deussen, as the [...] "creative principle which lies realized in the whole world".|$|E

This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared {{that he did not know}} whether he would be allowed to speak in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> our miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall never go out with honour, or sit with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> our disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E
