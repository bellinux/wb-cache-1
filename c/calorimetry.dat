5|$|In {{experimental}} particle physics, liquid krypton is used {{to construct}} quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the calorimeter of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since liquid argon is less expensive. The advantage of krypton is a smaller Molière radius of 4.7cm, which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for <b>calorimetry</b> are: radiation length of X0=4.7cm, and density of 2.4 g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and <b>calorimetry</b> in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy {{change can be}} determined by <b>calorimetry</b> or by using the van 't Hoff equation, though the calorimetric method is preferable. When both the {{standard enthalpy}} change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of pKa and ΔH. The data were critically selected and refer to 25°C and zero ionic strength, in water.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
25|$|This {{alternative}} approach admits <b>calorimetry</b> {{as a primary}} or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat. It relies on temperature {{as one of its}} primitive concepts, and used in <b>calorimetry.</b> It is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies. Such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work. They include <b>calorimetry,</b> which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences. The needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic.|$|E
25|$|Quantity of heat {{transferred}} {{can be measured}} by <b>calorimetry,</b> or determined through calculations based on other quantities.|$|E
25|$|Cyclohexane is {{also used}} for {{calibration}} of differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC) instruments, because of a convenient crystal-crystal transition at −87.1 °C.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Lavoisier Medals {{have been named}} and given in Lavoisier's honour, by {{organizations}} including the Société chimique de France, the International Society for Biological <b>Calorimetry,</b> and the DuPont company.|$|E
25|$|Respirometry is {{a general}} term that {{encompasses}} a number of techniques for obtaining estimates of the rates of metabolism of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, tissues, cells, or microorganisms via an indirect measure of heat production (<b>calorimetry).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Calorimetry</b> is the {{empirical}} {{basis of the}} idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process. The transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties, for example, temperature rise, change in volume or length, or phase change, such as melting of ice.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{scanning}} <b>calorimetry</b> {{can be used}} {{to measure}} a number of characteristic properties of a sample. Using this technique it is possible to observe fusion and crystallization events as well as glass transition temperatures Tg. DSC {{can also be used to}} study oxidation, as well as other chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{analytical}} instruments and techniques used to characterized and monitor the different properties of lipids; X-ray diffraction, differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC), {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} which include 2HNMR and 31PNMR, thin layer chromatography (TLC), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), nearest-neighbor recognition (NNR), and atomic molecular dynamics simulations (AMDS).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted {{just above}} {{does not use}} <b>calorimetry</b> or {{temperature}} in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards <b>calorimetry</b> only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference {{is supposed to have}} been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to <b>calorimetry</b> for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.|$|E
25|$|A Kofler bench is a {{metal strip}} with a {{temperature}} gradient (range from room temperature to 300°C). Any substance {{can be placed}} on {{a section of the}} strip revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point. Differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> gives information on melting point together with its enthalpy of fusion.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} derives {{the notions}} of transfer of energy as heat, and of temperature, as theoretical developments, not taking them as primitives. It regards <b>calorimetry</b> as a derived theory. It has an early origin in the nineteenth century, for example {{in the work of}} Helmholtz, but also in the work of many others.|$|E
25|$|Freezing-point {{depression}} {{can be used}} as a {{purity analysis}} tool when analysed by differential scanning <b>calorimetry.</b> This is possible because the temperature range over which a mixture of compounds melts is dependent on their relative amounts. Consequently, less pure compounds will exhibit a broadened melting peak that begins at lower temperature than a pure compound.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{experimental}} {{data that are}} used for the determination of solution equilibrium constants. Potentiometric data obtained with a glass electrode are {{the most widely used}} with aqueous solutions. The others are Spectrophotometric, Fluorescence (luminescence) measurements and NMR chemical shift measurements; simultaneous measurement of K and ΔH for 1:1 adducts in biological systems is routinely carried out using Isothermal Titration <b>Calorimetry.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these restrictions, most {{generally}} used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for <b>calorimetry,</b> which contributed greatly {{to the discovery of}} thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.|$|E
25|$|Using {{differential}} scanning <b>calorimetry</b> {{to study}} the stability to oxidation of samples generally requires an airtight sample chamber. Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing {{the atmosphere of the}} sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen. Then, oxygen is added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound.|$|E
25|$|The first {{substantial}} experimental {{challenges to}} caloric theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, {{when he showed}} that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, and his work {{was among the first}} to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on <b>calorimetry</b> and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{scanning}} <b>calorimetry,</b> or DSC, is a thermoanalytical {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.|$|E
25|$|According to Planck, {{there are}} three main {{conceptual}} approaches to heat. One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example {{in the work of}} Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy. This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by <b>calorimetry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Differential {{scanning}} <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC) is {{an analytical}} technique {{used to examine}} thermodynamic properties of molecules. It can study the thermal behavior of materials as they undergo physical and chemical changes during heat treatment. The parameters that are measured {{are referred to as}} the glass transition value (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm). These values are measured over time and are comparable between an inert reference sample and the analyte. Changes in the (Tm) and (Tg) values evaluate phase changes (solid, liquid-gel, liquid, etc.) in which an endothermic or exothermic process occurs. This technique is useful for monitoring the phase changes in phospholipids by providing information such as the amount of heat released or absorbed and time for phase transitions to occur, etc. DSC monitoring can occur at slow rates which is a disadvantage in monitoring fast phase transitions within phospholipids.|$|E
25|$|Cold fusion setups utilize {{an input}} power source (to ostensibly provide {{activation}} energy), a platinum group electrode, a deuterium or hydrogen source, a calorimeter, and, at times, detectors {{to look for}} byproducts such as helium or neutrons. Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there {{has not yet been}} a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation that cold fusion researchers have made in <b>calorimetry</b> analyses and energy budgets.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} {{based on}} an extension of Zwanzig's model of protein folding indicates that global downhill folding proteins should reveal different apparent melting temperatures (Tms) when monitored by different techniques. This was experimentally confirmed in the protein BBL mentioned above. The unfolding followed by differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence all revealed different apparent melting temperatures. A wavelength-dependent melting temperature was also observed in the CD experiments. The data analyzed with a structure-based statistical mechanical model resulted in a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures, indicating a structurally uncoupled continuous unfolding process. The crucial issue in such experiments is to use probes that monitor {{different aspects of the}} structure. For example, DSC gives information on the heat capacity changes (and hence enthalpy) associated with unfolding, fluorescence on the immediate environment of the fluorophore, FRET on the average dimensions of the molecule and CD on the secondary structure.|$|E
500|$|Isothermal {{titration}} <b>calorimetry</b> studies {{performed with}} Mups and associated ligands (pyrazines, alcohols, thiazolines, 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone, and N-phenylnapthylamine,) revealed an unusual binding phenomena. The active site {{has been found}} to be suboptimally hydrated, resulting in ligand binding being driven by enthalpic dispersion forces. This is contrary to most other proteins, which exhibit entropy-driven binding forces from the reorganisation of water molecules. This unusual process has been termed the [...] "nonclassical hydrophobic effect." ...|$|E
500|$|As noted above, {{an enzyme}} {{inhibitor}} is characterised by its two dissociation constants, Ki and Ki', to the enzyme {{and to the}} enzyme-substrate complex, respectively. The enzyme-inhibitor constant Ki can be measured directly by various methods; one extremely accurate method is isothermal titration <b>calorimetry,</b> in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured. However, the other dissociation constant Ki' is difficult to measure directly, since the enzyme-substrate complex is short-lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product. Hence, Ki' is usually measured indirectly, by observing the enzyme activity under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and fitting the data to a modified Michaelis–Menten equation ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008 a team {{of seven}} {{researchers}} conducted tests at Rice University, including Peter Weyand, Hugh Herr, Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected metabolic and mechanical data by indirect <b>calorimetry</b> and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius' performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, {{and found that the}} energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the Journal of Applied Physiology. Kram also stated that Pistorius' [...] "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of its similar sugar {{profile and}} lower price, HFCS {{has been used}} {{illegally}} to [...] "stretch" [...] honey. Assays to detect adulteration with HFCS use differential scanning <b>calorimetry</b> and other advanced testing methods.|$|E
2500|$|Black's distinction, between {{sensible}} and latent heat, {{was a step}} in the generation of the analytic method of thermodynamics, such as the distinction and relation between heat and work. [...] It is examined in the Wikipedia article on <b>calorimetry.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Historically, many energy {{units for}} {{measurement}} of heat have been used. The standards-based {{unit in the}} International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). Heat is measured by {{its effect on the}} states of interacting bodies, for example, by the amount of ice melted or a change in temperature. [...] The quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called <b>calorimetry,</b> and is widely used in practice. [...] In <b>calorimetry,</b> sensible heat is defined with respect to a specific chosen state variable of the system, such as pressure or volume. Sensible heat causes a change of the temperature of the system while leaving the chosen state variable unchanged. Heat transfer that occurs at a constant system temperature but changes the state variable is called latent heat with respect to the variable. For infinitesimal changes, the total incremental heat transfer is then the sum of the latent and sensible heat.|$|E

Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of [...] Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from , depending on atactic material and crystallinity. Syndiotactic PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of [...] Below 0°C, PP becomes brittle.|$|E
2500|$|It {{contains}} subsystems {{which are}} designed to measure the energy and momentum of photons, electrons, muons, and other products of the collisions. [...] The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker. [...] Surrounding it is a scintillating crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, which is itself surrounded with a sampling calorimeter for hadrons. [...] The tracker and the <b>calorimetry</b> are compact enough to fit inside the CMS Solenoid which generates a powerful magnetic field of 3.8 T. [...] Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the return yoke of the magnet.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons {{published}} a [...] "preliminary note" [...] in the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding Compton edge, which indicated {{they had made}} a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts. Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique, but the only thing left clear was that no gamma ray had been registered and that Fleischmann refused to recognize any mistakes in the data. A much longer paper {{published a}} year later went into details of <b>calorimetry</b> but did not include any nuclear measurements.|$|E
2500|$|Determination of {{thermodynamic}} data by {{high accuracy}} <b>calorimetry.</b> Heats of formation and free energies of formation were {{needed for the}} assessment of potential rocket fuels. Fulmer established equipment and skills for very accurate measurement of heats of formation and heats of reaction.

Over the many years that this work continued, Fulmer established thermodynamic data {{for a wide range of}} metal halides, intermetallics, mixed oxides and other compounds.|$|E
2500|$|A {{respected}} modern author {{states the}} {{first law of thermodynamics}} as [...] "Heat {{is a form}} of energy", which explicitly mentions neither internal energy nor adiabatic work. Heat is defined as energy transferred by thermal contact with a reservoir, which has a temperature, and is generally so large that addition and removal of heat do not alter its temperature. A current student text on chemistry defines heat thus: [...] "heat is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference." [...] The author then explains how heat is defined or measured by <b>calorimetry,</b> in terms of heat capacity, specific heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and temperature.|$|E
