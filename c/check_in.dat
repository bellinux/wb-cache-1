5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds <b>check)</b> <b>in</b> the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E

5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security <b>check.</b> <b>In</b> late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E

5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute <b>check</b> <b>in</b> the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

5|$|After this, Estelle is {{kidnapped by}} Raven, {{revealed}} to be an agent of Commandant Alexei, leader of the Knights and the mastermind behind the blastia thefts: Alexei intends to use Estelle's power and the replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called the Enduring Shrine of Zaude and remake the world, erasing the harmful blastia. After Raven decides to remain with Brave Vesperia after helping Estelle to escape with them, the group travel to Zaude to stop Alexei. They fail, and as Zaude is activated, it is {{revealed to be}} a barrier generator which kept the Adephagos sealed off from the world. As the Adephagos is released, Alexei is killed as Zaude collapses and Yuri is separated from the group after one of Flynn's subordinates attempts to kill him without Flynn's knowledge. Rescued by Duke, Yuri decides to stop the Adaphagos. During his absence, Rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits, which can process aer into a less-dangerous alternate energy called mana, stabilizing the aer krene and keeping Estelle's powers in <b>check.</b> <b>In</b> turn, the mana could power a weapon capable of destroying the Adephagos. After receiving permission from the world's leaders {{to carry out their}} plan, Brave Vesperia must confront Duke aboard the city-sized weapon Tarqaron. Duke intends to convert all of human life, including himself, into energy to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos, returning the world to a more primal state of being. While they share some goals, they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods. After defeating Duke, Yuri attempts to use the converted blastia energy against Adaphagos, but it proves insufficient. Moved by Brave Vesperia's efforts, Duke provides the extra power and Adaphagos is destroyed. The Entelexeia that formed the Adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize the planet. A post-credits scene shows Brave Vesperia continuing their adventures.|$|E
