40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out the {{possibility}} to predict the compression properties of orthopaedic knits by inlay-yarn properties. For this purpose, six groups of elastic double covered threads with different raw material were investigated. It was established that in area of low elongation, the <b>covering</b> <b>threads</b> practically don't have significant influence on tensile force values. Also results demonstrate that by increasing the number of tested threads, the elongation value has a higher impact on tensile force. The influence of linear density of elastic PU core on tensile force increases by increasing elongation value of threads. When influence of inlay-yarn linear density and number of threads on tensile force is determined it is possible to predict influence of inlay-yarn properties on compression properties of knitted orthopaedic supports.

5000|$|Bucanellidae is an extinct {{family of}} Paleozoic {{molluscs}} of uncertain position, belonging either to Gastropoda (snails) or Monoplacophora. The family lived {{from the upper}} Cambrian to middle Permian and the shells are characterized by a relatively small median sinus in the upper margin of the aperture, and collabral (transverse) or spiral (longitudinal) <b>threads</b> <b>covering</b> the shell. [...] The shells are planispirally coiled (flat coiled) rather than trochospirally with a spire {{as is the case}} with most shelled gastropods.|$|R
50|$|The thread {{used for}} {{stitching}} may be wool, silk, cotton or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers {{may also be}} used, such as metallic cord, metallic braid, ribbon, or raffia. Stitches may be plain, <b>covering</b> just one <b>thread</b> intersection with a single orientation, or fancy, such as in bargello or other counted-thread stitches. Plain stitches, known as tent stitches, may be worked as basketweave, continental or half cross. Basketweave uses the most wool, but does not distort the rectangular mesh and makes for the best-wearing piece.|$|R
30|$|On SEM analysis, {{we found}} the {{presence}} of large number of cuboidal shaped crystals on the outer surface of silk fibers (Fig.  3 b–d). These varied size crystals were randomly stacked over one another like tiles <b>covering</b> the silk <b>thread</b> and later identified as the crystals of calcium oxalate monohydrate by XRD and FTIR studies. In contrast, the inner surface of the cocoon {{was found to be}} extremely smooth (Fig.  3 a) with intertwined cross-network of the fibers (Fig.  3 e, f). Hardly any crystals were observed on the inner surface of the cocoon.|$|R
5000|$|Eyelash yarn is {{made from}} a {{polyester}} fiber with a furry texture resembling eyelashes. These novelty yarns are made of a thin central ply surrounded by short [...] "hairs". This yarn differs from [...] "fur" [...] type yarn in that it contains evenly spaced threads at intervals between lengths of bare core thread, whereas fur yarns have an abundance of <b>threads</b> <b>covering</b> {{the entirety of the}} core thread. Eyelash yarn comes {{in a wide range of}} colors, with the [...] "hairs" [...] sometimes being made of multicolored or metallic fibers.|$|R

40|$|Para avaliar o compósito hidroxiapatita-lignina na osseointegração entre implante metálico e o tecido ósseo, foram utilizados 20 coelhos adultos, nos quais foi realizada uma falha óssea na face lateral {{proximal}} de ambas as tíbias. Na tíbia esquerda, introduziu-se, no canal medular, um pino intramedular de Schanz revestido com o compósito em sua parte rosqueada, após o preenchimento daquele com 1000 mg do compósito. A falha cortical foi preenchida com o compósito. O mesmo foi feito na tíbia direita, porém sem a utilização do compósito, servindo como controle. A avaliação clínica baseou-se na deiscência, claudicação, sensibilidade dolorosa e circunferência tibial. Foram realizadas radiografias imediatamente após a cirurgia e aos oito, 30, 60, 90 e 120 dias do pós-operatório. A maioria dos animais apresentou evolução clínica normal. Nas radiografias do grupo tratado, houve decréscimo da radiopacidade no defeito e no espaço medular até tornar-se semelhante à do osso circunvizinho, quadro inverso ao do grupo-controle. Conclui-se que o compósito hidroxiapatita-lignina não mostrou indícios clínicos de rejeição e que o tecido visualizado na altura da falha óssea e ao redor do pino intramedular tinha radiopacidade semelhante à do osso circunvizinho, o que sugere que o material promoveu a integração com o tecido ósseo. This study evaluated a sinthetic hydroxyapatite-lignin composite for osseoingration between {{metallic implant}} and bone tissue. Twenty New Zealand rabbits were used. A defect {{was made a}} the proximal region of lateral surfaces of both tibias. An intramedullary pin was inserted in the medullary cavity of the left tibia after filling the cavity with 1, 000 mg of the composite and <b>covering</b> the <b>thread</b> part of the pin with the composite. The same procedure was made in control tibias without the composite. Clinical evaluation was based on inflammatory reaction, dehiscence, lameness, pain, and tibial circumference. Radiographs were made immediately after surgery and then on days eight, 30, 60, 90, and 120. Most of the animals presented normal clinical progression. Radiographies of treated group showed decrease in the defect and medullary cavity radiopacity to {{the same pattern of}} the surrounding bone, while the contrary happened in control group; but, in this group, the medullary cavity remained radioluscent at the last observation date. It can be concluded that the hydroxyapatite-lignin composite did not show clinical signs of rejection and that radiopacity of the tissue in the bone defect and surrounding the pin was similar to bone radiopacity, suggesting that the material promoted osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{clinical}} studies regenerative procedures for periodontal disease treatment were evaluated. A reproducibility study of probing measurements using a manual periodontal probe and 3 pressure-sensitive probes showed that measurements obtained using the manual probe were the most repeatable. This probe was therefore selected for treatment evaluation. The outcome following surgical treatment of intraosseous periodontal defects with and without EDTA root conditioning did not show any significant clinical advantage of EDTA application. Guided tissue regeneration at intraosseous periodontal defects, using a bioabsorbable membrane, {{did not result in}} predictably more probing attachment gain nor probing bone gain than conventional flap therapy. Radiographic analysis confirmed these results. Regenerative techniques may also be applied in conjunction with endosseous implant treatment. Bioabsorbable membranes were applied <b>covering</b> exposed fixture <b>threads</b> at peri-implant dehiscence and fenestration defects at the time of fixture installation. Following six months of healing, surgical re-entry demonstrated a significant {{reduction in the number of}} exposed fixture threads. Clinical and radiographic conditions were evaluated approximately 2 years following incorporation of fixed reconstructions at these fixtures. Radiographs revealed significantly less marginal bone at membrane treated fixtures than at control fixtures. This was evident from abutment connection radiographs indicating that optimal bone regeneration was not achieved at all defects. However, no significant difference in the rate of radiographic bone loss following loading between control and membrane treated fixtures was observed. All fixtures were clinically stable and peri-implant tissues healthy. The results of these studies demonstrate that clinical attachment gain and bone gain is possible but not predictable following EDTA root surface conditioning and guided tissue regeneration using a bioabsorbable membrane. Guided bone regeneration, using a bioabsorbable membrane, applied at the time of titanium fixture installation resulted in predictable bone regeneration...|$|R
