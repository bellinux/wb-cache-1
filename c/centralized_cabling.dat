50|$|Because of {{its high}} {{capacity}} and reliability, multi-mode optical fiber generally is used for backbone applications in buildings. An increasing number of users are taking the benefits of fiber closer to the user by running fiber to the desktop or to the zone. Standards-compliant architectures such as <b>Centralized</b> <b>Cabling</b> and fiber to the telecom enclosure offer users the ability to leverage the distance capabilities of fiber by centralizing electronics in telecommunications rooms, rather than having active electronics on each floor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventional {{structural}} {{monitoring systems}} are <b>centralized,</b> employ <b>cables</b> for measurement transfer, and perform all data processing at the centralized server. A major drawback {{of these systems}} is their high installation and maintenance costs. To eradicate the need for expensive cable installations, wireless communications is proposed for the transfer of measurements between sensors. In addition, system functionality is improved by coupling embedded microcontrollers with the sensor for localized interrogation of raw measurements. The design of a wireless sensing unit that has been optimized for structural monitoring is proposed. The performance of the sensing unit is validated in the field using the Alamosa Canyon Bridge in southern New Mexico. A statistical time-series damage detection procedure has been embedded in the sensing unit to illustrate the energy saved by local data interrogation compared to communication of time-history response records. ...|$|R
