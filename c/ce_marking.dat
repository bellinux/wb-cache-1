25|$|In 2013, {{multiple}} firms announced {{devices that}} could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery. The devices are roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pill, much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker. Once implanted, the device's prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats. Engineers and scientists are currently working on this type of device. In November 2014 a patient, Bill Pike of Fairbanks, Alaska, received a Medtronic Micra pacemaker in Providence St Vincent Hospital in Portland Oregon. D. Randolph Jones was the EP doctor. In 2014 also St. Jude Medical Inc. announced the first enrollments in the company’s leadless Pacemaker Observational Study evaluating the Nanostim leadless pacing technology. The Nanostim pacemaker received <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> in 2013. The post-approval implants have occurred in Europe. The European study was recently stopped, after there were reports of six perforations that led to two patient deaths. After investigations St Jude Medical restarted the study. But in the United States this therapy is still not approved by the FDA. While the St Jude Nanostim and the Medtronic Micra are just single-chamber pacemakers it is anticipated that leadless dual-chamber pacing for patients with atrioventricular block will become possible with further development.|$|E
