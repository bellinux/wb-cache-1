The EPA said it continued [...] "to try to reduce unwarranted claims of confidentiality and has taken a number of significant steps that have had dramatic results... tightening policies for CBI claims and declassifying unwarranted confidentiality claims, challenging companies to review existing CBI claims to ensure that they are still valid and providing easier and enhanced access to a wider array of information." ...|$|E

Based on this approach, we introduce an (ε 1, ε 2) -privacy model that allows a user to stipulate that topics relevant to her intention at ε 1 level should appear to any adversary to be innocuous at ε 2 level. We then present a Top Priv algorithm to achieve the customized (ε 1, ε 2) -privacy requirement of individual users through injecting automatically formulated fake queries.

40|$|Abstract There are {{demands for}} secure group {{communication}} on the internet, such as pay-per-view type broadcasting, <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> sharing and teleconference. Secure communication inside a groups {{on an open}} network is critical to enhance the internet capability. The public key system {{is not sufficient to}} support the group security, since it is not scalable for large groups. Some researchers propose a scalable group security model, managing several common keys for encryption and decryption sharing inside the community. In this paper, we will evaluate the performance of these group security model. Using M/G/ ∞ queueing models and the basic queueing theory, we show how to find the optimal condition of the allocation of the common keys if the joins to group is a Poisson process. In addition, we show our optimal condition may work for more general arrival processes by using the cross covariance formula (a variant of Papangelou’s formula) for the stochastic intensity of departure process...|$|R

40|$|Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries (PTDLs) in the United States are {{observing a}} {{noticeable}} {{decline in the}} number of inventors and other library users who visit a PTDL for the purposes of conducting a patent or trademark search. PTDL Librarians are also aware that most users are trying to conduct patent/trademark searches on their own on the Internet. Because patent searching involves use of scientific and technical language and intricate patent classification systems which are not straightforward to a novice user, PTDL librarians and information professionals need to come up with a way of continuing to provide expert patent search assistance and reference support to inventors and other patent researchers when these users are at remote computer sites. InfoChat, an interactive virtual chat reference system used for answering general reference questions online, may have some potential applications to the provision of patent and trademark search assistance and guidance. This paper explores possible uses of InfoChat for providing patent search support remotely. We show some sample patent searches that can be supported via InfoChat, present advantages and disadvantages of digital reference systems, and discuss the chances of such systems being accepted by the users and librarians. Implications of using a virtual reference system for searching <b>confidential</b> patent and <b>business</b> <b>information</b> over insecure Internet lines are also presented...|$|R

As cloud computing technology is becoming popular, SQLJ is considered as a flexible and user friendly language for developing distributed applications in grid architectures. SQLJ source codes are translated to java byte codes and decompilation is generation of source codes from intermediate byte codes. The intermediate SQLJ application byte codes are open to decompilation, allowing a malicious reader to forcefully decompile it for understanding <b>confidential</b> <b>business</b> logic or data from the codes.

40|$|Introduction Is cybercrime, cyber espionage, {{and other}} {{malicious}} cyber activities {{what some call}} “the greatest transfer of wealth in human history,” or is it what others say is a “rounding error in a fourteen trillion dollar economy?” The wide range of existing estimates of the annual loss—from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions—reflects several difficulties. Companies conceal their losses and some {{are not aware of}} what has been taken. Intellectual property is hard to value. Some estimates relied on surveys, which provide very imprecise results unless carefully constructed. One common problem with cybersecurity surveys is that those who answer the questions “self-select,” introducing a possible source of distortion into the results. Given the data collection problems, loss estimates are based on assumptions about scale and effect— change the assumption and you get very different results. These problems leave many estimates open to question. The Components of Malicious Cyber Activity In this initial report we start by asking what we should count in estimating losses from cybercrime and cyber espionage. We can break malicious cyber activity into six parts: 	The loss of intellectual property and <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> 	Cybercrime, which costs the world {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} every year 	The loss of sensitive <b>business</b> <b>information,</b> including possible stock market manipulation 	Opportunity costs, including service and employment disruptions, and reduced trust for online activities 	The additional cost of securing networks, insurance, and recovery from cyber attacks 	Reputational damage to the hacked company Put these together and the cost of cybercrime and cyber espionage to the global economy is probably measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. To put this in perspective, the World Bank says that global GDP was about $ 70 trillion in 2011. A $ 400 billion loss—the high end of the range of probable costs—would be a fraction of a percent of global income. But this begs several important questions about the full benefit to the acquirers and the damage to the victims from the cumulative effect of cybercrime and cyber espionage...|$|R
