5000|$|In the fifties, Verona's focus {{switched}} {{to the theory of}} alphabetical catalogues. She published multiple papers on this subject, and soon became the leading international expert. Her papers published in [...] "Vjesnik bibliotekara Hrvatske", [...] "Libri", and [...] "Library Resources and Technical Services" [...] examined her comparisons of different approaches practiced by individual foreign catalogues and cataloging codes in cataloging anonymous works and corporate headings. She also studied the history of these cataloging practices. Using her experience in cataloguing rules she wrote <b>Cataloguing</b> <b>Code,</b> published in 1970 and 1983.|$|E
5000|$|We {{can trace}} {{the origins of}} modern library {{cataloging}} practice back to the 1830s and Anthony Panizzi’s 91 rules. Panizzi’s singular insight was that a large catalog needed consistency in its entries if it was to serve the user. The first major English-language <b>cataloguing</b> <b>code</b> was that developed by Sir Anthony Panizzi for the British Museum catalogue. Panizzi’s 91 rules were approved by the British Museum in 1839, and published in 1841. [...] The British Museum rules were revised up until 1936. The library departments of the British Museum {{became part of the}} new British Library in 1973.|$|E

The IFLA FRBR Library Reference Model is being developed as a consolidation of the three previous FR models. As the models are intended as high-level conceptual models, not full data models, some adaptation is inherent in developing a <b>cataloguing</b> <b>code</b> around the LRM, as with its predecessors. Two opposite mechanisms {{can be used in}} adapting a <b>cataloguing</b> <b>code</b> around a conceptual model: omission of specific attributes, relationships, or even entities, or expansion of any of these elements in the model.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is the {{comparison}} of rules about forming and using uniform titles in PPIAK, AACR 2, RICA and RAK-WB. Uniform title is the title which we form for works that are published under different titles. It has been used more widely {{and it has been}} more clearly articulated since its appearance in Pannizzi’s rules. The comparison between different national cataloguing rules shows that all four cataloguing rules arose from Paris principles. Their differences originate in different needs of cataloguing experts, users and characteristics of particular state.

40|$|IFLA study Functional {{requirements}} for bibliographic records (FRBR) {{set a new}} frame for both <b>cataloguing</b> <b>codes</b> and subject analysis. The Paris Principles defined {{the functions of the}} catalogue followed by both <b>cataloguing</b> <b>codes</b> used in Slovenia: P. Kalan’s Abecedni imenski katalog and E. Verona’s Pravilnik i priručnik za izradbe abecednih kataloga. Functional {{requirements for}} bibliographic records define the functions for records themselves,irrespective of the type of the database consisted of these records. Compared to the requirements for the national bibliographic records as defined by FRBR, the records belonging to the Slovenian national bibliography show more descriptive elements and less notes on bibliographic history, which reflects in lack of uniform titles. As the uniform title itself enables the identification of related works and their expressions,this practice does not satisfy the FRBR requirements. Differences in the extent of records for different types of material derive from decentralised processing at the National and University Library. It is therefore necessary to establish uniform criteria for both materials included into the Slovenian national bibliography, and the extent of data elements...|$|R
