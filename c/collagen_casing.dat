50|$|Although the saveloy was {{traditionally}} {{made from}} pork brains, {{the ingredients of}} a shop-bought sausage are typically pork (58%), water, rusk, pork fat, potato starch, salt, emulsifiers (tetrasodium diphosphate, disodium diphosphate), white pepper, spices, dried sage (sage), preservatives (sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate), and beef <b>collagen</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sausage rolls are {{a popular}} snack and party food, as are saveloys, cheerios, and locally {{manufactured}} cabanossi. Traditional sausages similar to English bangers are eaten throughout the country; these are usually made of finely ground beef or mutton with breadcrumbs, very mildly spiced, stuffed into an edible <b>collagen</b> <b>casing</b> which crisps and splits when fried. These may be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. In recent years, many international and exotic sausages have also become {{widely available in}} NZ.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{hydrophobic}} group content in gelatin on the bonding strength of novel tissue–penetrating tissue adhesives was evaluated. The hydrophobic groups introduced into gelatin were the saturated hexanoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl groups, and the unsaturated oleoyl group. A <b>collagen</b> <b>casing</b> was employed as an adherend to model soft tissue for the in vitro determination of bonding strength of tissue adhesives composed of various hydrophobically modified gelatins and disuccinimidyl tartrate. The adhesive composed of stearoyl-modified gelatin (7. 4 % stearoyl; 10 Ste) and disuccinimidyl tartrate showed the highest bonding strength. The bonding strength of the adhesives decreased as the degree of substitution of the hydrophobic groups increased. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 10 Ste was integrated {{onto the surface of}} smooth muscle cells and showed no cytotoxicity. These results suggest that 10 Ste interacted with the hydrophobic domains of collagen casings, such as hydrophobic amino acid residues and cell membranes. Therefore, 10 Ste–disuccinimidyl tartrate is a promising adhesive for use in aortic dissection...|$|E
50|$|The latest {{generation}} of <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> are usually more tender than natural casings {{but do not}} exhibit the “snap” or “bite” of natural casing sausages. The biggest volume of <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> are edible, but a special form of thicker <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> is used for salamis and large caliber sausages where the casing is usually peeled off the sausage by the consumer. <b>Collagen</b> <b>casings</b> are less expensive to use, give better weight and size control, and are easier to run when compared to natural casings.|$|R

50|$|Collagen has a {{wide variety}} of applications, from food to medical. For instance, it is used in {{cosmetic}} surgery and burn surgery. It is widely used in the form of <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> for sausages, which are also used in the manufacture of musical strings.|$|R
40|$|Portuguese dry {{fermented}} sausages {{are traditionally}} processed through direct drying/smoking, making them susceptible to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) contamination. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of added fat (20 % and 40 %), casing type (hog and collagen) and smoking procedures (direct and indirect exposure) on the 16 EPA priority PAHs in dry fermented sausages manufactured according traditional processing. The total PAHs content (sum of 16 PAHs) found in whole product (casing included) varied between 150 and 870 lg kg 1, with more than 99 % of this content corresponding to harmless low molecular weight compounds. Concerning benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) and PAH 4, the respective maximum contents (0. 32 and 10. 35 lg kg 1, respectively) did not exceed the imposed limits regulated by the European Union. According to our results, casing type was the most influential factor. For hog samples, fat content and smoking regime alone did not influenced the total PAHs amount. However, significantly higher (p < 0. 05) contamination levels were detected in hog casing samples combining high fat content and direct smoking procedures. In opposition, irrespective of the fat content and smoking regime, safer products, with significantly lower (p < 0. 001) contamination levels, were obtained when <b>collagen</b> <b>casing</b> was used...|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} a great need for tissue adhesives, which adhere inside the body very fast and possess good {{mechanical}} strength and excellent biocompatibility. The requirements for materials {{to be used in}} tissue adhesion (e. g. bonding of collagen hernia meshes) are diverse and sometimes conflicting. The resulting bond has to be mechanically strong but simultaneously elastic; it has to be durable and biodegradable at once. The process of adhesion has to be fast without generating too much heat. That is why medical adhesives are intended to be reactive. At the same time, they need to be storable and sterilizable. Currently, commercially available tissue adhesives represent a compromise of all these different requirements and are used very specifically for each individual case. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential of different adhesive principles taken from the literature or from our own developments by bonding collagen-based surfaces in a standard test procedure. Commonly used tissue glues based on cyanoacrylate or fibrin serve as reference materials for comparison and <b>collagen</b> <b>casing,</b> pigskin as well as a commercially available collagen matrix (Xenoderm®) are used as tissue-like surfaces to be sticked together. Three groups of potential adhesives were analyzed: polymers that contain catechol-groups and are oxidatively activated (keyword: mussel glue), acrylic compounds that are photo-crosslinkable and thiol-containing so-called "mucoadhesives". By means of tensile force measurements immediately after bonding and after a time period of 24 h, values for the adh esive forces of the different materials are obtained. The commercial cyanoacrylate-based product as well as a photo-crosslinkable oligo ester shows the best adhesion results. In contrast, {{it was not possible to}} achieve the desired adhesive effects by applying catechol-containing polymers or other acrylic compounds. However, promising results are also obtained by thiol-containing polymers. After fine-tuning the latter, those polymers should have great potential as glues in specific applications...|$|E
50|$|<b>Collagen</b> <b>casings</b> {{are mainly}} {{produced}} from the collagen in beef or pig hides, and {{the bones and}} tendons. It can also be derived from poultry and fish. They have been made for more than 50 years and {{their share of the}} market has been increasing. Usually the cost to produce sausages in collagen is significantly lower than making sausages in gut because of higher production speeds and lower labor requirements.|$|R

In the same year, Viscofan Bioengineering (VBE) was constituted as a business unit that combines biosciences and engineering to supply collagen-based products which {{can be applied to}} repair damaged tissues in patients. The Viscofan Group's Bioengineering unit is located in Weinheim (Germany), a benchmark centre for the company's <b>collagen</b> <b>casings,</b> where it has an additional cleanroom to produce collagen products for medical use.|$|R
50|$|Natural sausage casings {{are made}} from the sub-mucosa, a layer of the {{intestine}} that consists mainly of naturally occurring collagen. This {{should not be confused}} with <b>collagen</b> <b>casings,</b> which are artificially processed from collagen derived from the skins of cattle. Natural casings are derived from the intestinal tract of farmed animals, are edible and bear a close resemblance to the original intestine after processing. The outer fat and the inner mucosa lining are removed during processing.|$|R
40|$|Chicken <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> {{could be}} an {{alternate}} source of <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> that are manufactured for sausages. The overall objective of this project was to extract chicken collagen from by-products of the broiler processing industries and to explore the possibility of making films. Chicken skin was washed, ground, and pretreated to remove the noncollagenous compounds. Collagen was extracted using acetic acid and pepsin. Solubilized collagen was salted-out and centrifuged at 20, 000 [*]×g at 4 °C for one hour. The precipitates were dissolved in 0. 5 [*]M acetic acid and dialyzed against 0. 1 [*]M acetic acid and distilled water before freeze-drying. Molecular weight, collagen solubility at different pH values, and NaCl concentrations were determined. TA-XT 2 texture analyzer was used to characterize mechanical properties of collagen films. The highest collagen solubility was obtained at pH 2 and 2 % NaCl. Hand-homogenized, nonfiltered, and conditioned samples had the highest hardness (3, 262 [*]g) and the least brittleness (30. 5 [*]mm). These results demonstrate that chicken collagen extracted from chicken by-products {{has the ability to}} form films and could be considered for making casings or be used in various other industries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{ripening}} process of fermented sausages {{is affected by}} diameter and type of sausage casings, and depends on changes in the microflora, important from hygienic and technological aspects. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the bacteriological status sausages which were stuffed in artificial <b>collagen</b> sausage <b>casings</b> of different diameters (35 mm and 60 mm) during ripening and drying. The sausage stuffing was the same, as was the uncontrolled ripening conditions. In bigger diameter sausages, significantly higher average total bacterial count, enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria counts were found than in smaller diameter sausages...|$|R
40|$|Responses of the {{mosquitoes}} Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex nigripalpus to volatiles and compounds associated with bovine and avian blood that {{were presented in}} collagen membranes were evaluated in olfactometer and landing assays. The presence of attractants produced by blood was supported by more attraction of all species to blood than water controls in the olfactometer. Females of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus were more attracted to bovine blood than to avian blood, {{but there was no}} difference in Cx. nigripalpus responses. In landing assays, significantly more females of all species landed on casings with blood than on water controls. There was no difference in landing of Ae. aegypti on bovine or avian blood. However, significantly more females of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. nigripalpus landed on avian blood compared to bovine blood. Blood presented in <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> was an effective method for evaluating in-flight attraction and landing in all three species. In the olfactometer, several individual compounds elicited attraction in all species, but none were as attractive as blood for all species. In landing assays, several organic acids and sulfides elicited landing, with Ae. aegypti responding to the greatest number of compounds. These assay methods are effective for evaluation of volatile compounds from blood, and although responses were obtained to several compounds, none were as effective as blood in the olfactometer and landing assays...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine physical, mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan-laminated collagen film. Commercial collagen film, which is used for making <b>collagen</b> <b>casings</b> for dry fermented sausage production, was laminated with chitosan film layer in order to improve the collagen film barrier properties. Different volumes of oregano essential oil per 100 mL of filmogenic solution were added to chitosan film layer: 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 mL to optimize water vapour barrier properties. Chitosan layer with 0. 6 or 0. 8 % of oregano essential oil lowered the water vapour transmission rate to (1. 85 ± 0. 10) · 10 – 6 and (1. 78 ± 0. 03) · 10 – 6 g/(m 2 ·s·Pa) respectively, compared to collagen film ((2. 51 ± 0. 05) · 10 – 6 g/(m 2 ·s·Pa)). However, chitosan-laminated collagen film did not show improved mechanical properties compared to the collagen one. Tensile strength decreased from (54. 0 ± 3. 8) MPa of the uncoated collagen film to (36. 3 ± 4. 0) MPa when the film was laminated with 0. 8 % oregano essential oil chitosan layer. Elongation at break values of laminated films did not differ from those of collagen film ((18. 4 ± 2. 7) %). Oxygen barrier properties were considerably improved by lamination. Oxygen permeability of collagen film was (1806. 8 ± 628. 0) · 10 – 14 cm 3 /(m·s·Pa) and values of laminated films were below 35 · 10 – 14 cm 3 /(m·s·Pa). Regarding film appearance and colour, lamination with chitosan reduced lightness (L) and yellowness (+b) of collagen film, while film redness (+a) increased. These changes were not visible to the naked eye...|$|R
50|$|The <b>collagen</b> for {{artificial}} <b>casings</b> {{is processed}} extensively and, as a raw material, it {{is similar to}} bread dough prior to final production. It is then extruded through a die to the desired diameter, dried and shirred into short sticks up to 41 cm long that contain as much as 50 m of casing. In a newer process, a form of dough is coextruded with the meat blend, and a coating is formed by treating the outside with a calcium solution to set the coating.|$|R
