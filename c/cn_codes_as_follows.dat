30|$|The reform {{variable}} R is <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> As {{was explained}} above the regime decreased access to secondary education in 1971 and then increased {{it again in}} 1980. As the secondary school entry age in the Tunisian system is 12, without any grade repetition this variable would take values one for cohorts born between 1959 and 1968 and zero otherwise. However, due to widespread grade repetition some cohorts born before 1959 were also affected by the stricter access requirements of 1971. In the same way, parts of the cohorts born between 1964 - 1968 were affected by the more lenient regime. In order {{to take into account}} repetition rates in this manner, we use information detailing the year-of-birth composition of each primary school grade in (Ministรจre de lโEducation Nationale 1983) and extrapolate this information to the two instances of policy change. We end up with exposure equaling one for the cohort reaching 12 in 1971 (born in 1969), and decreasing almost linearly for 4 older cohorts (0.8 for those born in 1958, 0.53 for those born in 1957, etc.).

40|$|The aglutenics {{biscuits}} {{are intended}} to those persons who are suffering due to gluten intolerance, also named celiac disease. The fabrication technologies of the aglutenics products can be developed in on two ways: by separating the gluten from the grain or by replacing the grain flour {{with other types of}} gluten less flour, in case of bakery and pastry products. In this experiment, the gluten-free biscuits were obtained from the following flours mixture: maize flour (MF), rice flour (RF) and soybeans flour (SF). Other raw materials were used, such as: palmtree oil, honey, maize starch, eggs, sugar powdered, vanilla essence and sodium bicarbonate. Four experimental variants (gluten-free biscuits) were obtained by varying the proportion of flours; these variants were <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> T 1, T 2 T 3 and T 4. The optimization of the aglutenics biscuits manufacture recipe was realized through sensory analyze, using the hedonic test (9 point scale). Samples of biscuits was subjected to the following physico-chemical analysis: moisture content, alkalinity, total carbohydrate content, total fat and protein content. Also the physical properties (length, width, thickness, weight and spread ratio) were determined in order to asses the blending influence on the biscuits quality. The blend with flour levels 30 : 30 : 40 (MF:RF:SF) led to the highest acceptability. </p...|$|R
