25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. <b>Certification</b> <b>services</b> can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.|$|E
500|$|The board assigns {{ratings to}} games {{based on their}} content, using {{judgment}} similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, {{using a combination of}} six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of [...] "content descriptors" [...] which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the IARC, this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> for online privacy on websites and mobile apps.|$|E
