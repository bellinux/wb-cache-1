5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in San Francisco Bay. Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E

25|$|The dam poses an impassable {{barrier to}} {{migrating}} salmonids which {{is significant because}} the San Francisquito Creek watershed hosts the most viable remaining native steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) population in the South San Francisco Bay. Although anadromous or seagoing steelhead trout still spawn below Searsville Dam, {{they can no longer}} run above Searsville Dam to spawn. <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek was described as an historic steelhead trout spawning stream by Skinner in 1962. However stream resident coastal rainbow trout, run up from Searsville Reservoir to spawn in upper <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek and its tributaries, enabling this native fish to survive above the dam as well. A May 2002 steelhead trout migration study reported Searsville Dam as the only complete barrier to migration on mainstem San Francisquito Creek (construction of a fishway in 1976 resolved passage at the Lake Lagunita diversion dam 2.5 miles below Searsville Dam), and that elimination of the Searsville dam could restore ten miles of anadromous steelhead habitat.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, Sausal Creek {{also had}} the names Arroyo Sausal, Arroyo del Sanjon and Sanjon Creek. On the 1899 Palo Alto Topo Map its mainstem was called <b>Corte</b> de <b>Madera</b> Creek and its Neils Gulch {{tributary}} was called Sausal Creek. Sausal Creek flows through the Rancho Cañada del <b>Corte</b> de <b>Madera</b> meaning [...] "a place where wood is cut", reflecting {{the importance of the}} timber industry {{in the early days of}} Portola Valley. [...] "Sausal" [...] is derived from the Spanish word [...] "Sauce" [...] or [...] "Sauz" [...] and mean [...] "willow grove", a name that appears as early as 1853.|$|R
25|$|In a 1996 biotic {{assessment}} of upper Searsville Lake {{and the lower}} floodplain of <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek, Stanford biologists wrote that the native species likely included coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), sculpin, California roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), hitch (Lavinia exilcauda), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), and perhaps three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidontus), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). They noted that the only native species observed with any regularity {{in the study area}} are Sacramento sucker and rainbow trout, and attributed the now depauperate native fish fauna to dislocation of hydrologic connectivity due to the dam, transformation of the habitat above the dam from lotic to lentic, and the fact that Searsville Reservoir harbors many non-native species of centrarchid fishes (sunfish, black bass, and crappie) which prey on virtually all historically native fishes. They noted that federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) occur in the lotic portions of <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek below the dam but not above, likely due to depredation by non-native fish and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus).|$|E
25|$|Searsville Dam is a {{masonry dam}} in San Mateo County, California that was {{completed}} in 1892, {{one year after the}} founding of Stanford University, and impounds <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek (in the San Francisquito Creek watershed) to form a reservoir known as Searsville Lake. Searsville Dam is located in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and is owned and operated by Stanford University. Neighboring cities include Woodside and Portola Valley, California.|$|E
25|$|A {{coalition}} {{of environmental and}} conservation groups, and fishermen, argue that the dam should be removed. In addition to concerns about access to upstream salmonid spawning grounds, Searsville Dam inundated former wetlands formed by the confluence of <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek, Sausal Creek, Dennis Martin Creek and Alambique Creek. These wetlands likely served a valuable historical function by removing sediment and pollutants from the San Francisquito Creek mainstem. Anti-dam proponents point to a growing trend in habitat restoration nationally with over 500 dams removed in recent years.|$|E

5000|$|Rancho <b>Corte</b> de <b>Madera</b> was a 13316 acre Mexican land {{grant in}} present day Santa Clara County, California given in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Máximo Martínez. [...] The name {{translates}} as [...] "the place where lumber is cut". The roughly triangular shaped grant was west of today's I-280, and bounded {{on the north}} by Alambique Creek and San Francisquito Creek, on the south by Los Trancos Creek and Matadero Creek, and on the west by what is now Skyline Boulevard. The grant surrounded Rancho Cañada del <b>Corte</b> de <b>Madera</b> which extended along the Portola Valley. The land grant included parts of present day Woodside, Ladera and Stanford University.|$|R
25|$|Due to ease {{of access}} {{provided}} by the ferry and rail service, entrepreneurs realized the potential for transforming the sleepy hills north of San Francisco into a recreational destination. Sidney B. Cushing was one such individual. He had recently acquired the Blithedale Hotel summer resort just north of downtown Mill Valley in <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Canyon. The hills surrounding Mill Valley were rather steep—requiring a dependable means of transportation for them to become a vacation spot. Rail was the most logical means at the time, and Mount Tamalpais was the most attractive destination for such a line.|$|E
25|$|Louis L. Janes was {{the initial}} impetus behind {{creating}} a railroad at Mount Tamalpais. Janes was the resident {{director of the}} Tamalpais Land & Water Co. and first town clerk of Mill Valley. Sidney B. Cushing, president of the San Rafael Gas & Electric Co., was chosen as President of the corporation. It was initially named the Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway {{due to the fact}} the Muir Woods branch had not yet been planned. Funding came from several sources, provided to the corporation in exchange for stock in the company. One influential resident, A. E. Kent, gave the corporation right-of-way through his property in <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Canyon in exchange for $10,000 in stock. A. E. Kent and his son, William, were early Marin residents who foresaw the region's appeal to visitors from the Bay Area and beyond. William Kent was a Progressive Republican Congressman representing California from 1911–1917. Considering his family's financial interests in the railway, {{it is interesting to note}} that Kent spearheaded the movement to form the Muir Woods National Monument, a popular destination on the line.|$|E
25|$|Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans {{were drawn}} to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver (Castor canadensis), river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris). This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the nearby Farallon Islands from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. By 1818 the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands until they began to recolonize the islands in 1996. Although 20th-century naturalists were skeptical that beaver were historically extant in coastal streams or the Bay itself, earlier records show that the California golden beaver (Castor canadensis ssp. subauratus) {{was one of the most}} valued of the animals taken, and apparently was found in great abundance. Thomas McKay reported that in one year the Hudson's Bay Company took 4,000 beaver skins on the shores of San Francisco Bay. Recently, beaver have recolonized the brackish Napa Sonoma Marsh in north San Pablo Bay and its Sonoma Creek and Napa River tributaries. Also recently re-colonizing the Bay and its tributaries, the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, and recently in <b>Corte</b> <b>Madera</b> Creek, and in the south Bay on Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina.|$|E

The next survey in August 1965 concluded that the habitat was an excellent resource, with deep shaded pools and an average of 75 steelhead per 100 ft of lineal stream. In 1984, steelhead were still found to be present. A 1991 stream survey documented the historical presence of Coho salmon.
