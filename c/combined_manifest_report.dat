Each participant reported between six and seven side-effects on average, which were often pronounced and had a major disruptive impact on their lives. Of these effects, the most commonly mentioned was sedation, which the participants described as leaving them in a 'zombie'-like state. Most participants expressed an attitude of acceptance about the side-effects. The participants' most common strategy to manage side-effects was to change the dosage of the medication. Other common side-effect management strategies involved using other medications to control side-effects, and diverse self-help techniques, the most common of which was relaxation/distraction techniques...|$|R

40|$|The pH {{response}} of the dental biofilm after a sugar challenge can be considered to mirror the acidogenic potential and thereby the caries risk of an individual. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between plaque pH and different caries variables in adolescents with varying caries prevalence. One hundred individuals, aged 14 - 15 years, were examined regarding different caries-related variables: (i) caries score (DS m, DS i, DS m + i, DT m), (ii) salivary secretion rate and buffer capacity, (iii) oral microflora of plaque and saliva, (iv) plaque amount, (v) plaque pH and (vi) dietary intake, oral hygiene habits and fluoride use. Plaque pH was assessed using the microtouch method before and after a 1 -min mouthrinse with 10 ml 10 % sucrose. Depending on the minimum pH, the participants were divided into three groups: low pH (&# 8804; 5. 3), medium pH (&# 62; 5. 3 - 6. 3) and high pH (&# 62; 6. 3). Statistically {{significant differences between the}} three groups (p &# 60; 0. 01) were found for initial caries (DS i) and <b>combined</b> <b>manifest</b> and initial caries (DS m + i). A statistically significant difference was also found in the log values for salivary lactobacilli (p = 0. 02) within the three groups, and for the total number of bacteria in plaque (p = 0. 04); for both variables, the low-pH group had the highest values. The only covariate significantly associated was the Cariogram score in the medium-pH group (p &# 60; 0. 01) and the number of meals per day in the high-pH group (p = 0. 02). To conclude, plaque pH measured by the microtouch method is a method {{that can be used for}} discriminating between individuals with varying caries prevalence...|$|R

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} organic {{chemicals}} that had become widely used in industrial applications due to their practical physical and chemical properties. Historical uses of PCBs include dielectric fluids (used in utility transformers, capacitors, etc.), hydraulic fluids, and other applications requiring stable, fire-retardant materials. Due to findings that PCBs may cause adverse health effects and due to their persistence and accumulation in the environment, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), enacted on October 11, 1976, banned the manufacture of PCBs after 1978 [Section 6 (e) ]. The first PCB regulations, promulgated at 40 CFR Part 761, were finalized on February 17, 1978. These PCB regulations include requirements specifying disposal methods and marking (labeling) procedures, and controlling PCB use. To assist the Department of Energy (DOE) {{in its efforts to}} comply with the TSCA statute and implementing regulations, the Office of Environmental Guidance has prepared the document ``Guidance on the Management of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). `` That document explains the requirements specified in the statute and regulations for managing PCBs including PCB use, storage, transport, and disposal.
