Numerous variations exist, including printing the marks using a raster of lines in one direction on a background of lines in another direction, or using fine line patterns that alias into a visible moire pattern when copied.|$|E

5000|$|Not {{long after}} the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, the scope of {{contributory}} infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device - the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the Betamax, the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The Supreme Court of the United States held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the Sony exception with regard to new technologies: [...] "The sale of <b>copying</b> <b>equipment,</b> like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the accuracy of Slovenian method for meat percentage evaluation of pig carcasses (fat and muscle measurements {{at the level of}} m. gluteus medius at the carcass split-line using electronic caliper). The study was performed within EU funded project EUPIGCLASS {{as a part of the}} study of the accuracy of the on-line methods used in European countries. Therefore, the common experimental plan and ISO 5725 standard were respected. According to later, the accuracy refers to the closeness of agreement between test results under repeatability or reproducibility conditions, and is expressed as standard deviation (sd). The aim was to assess the repeatability sd and reproducibility sd of meat percentage evaluation, and to identify influence of the <b>copy</b> of the <b>equipment</b> and of the operator. For Slovenian method, repeatability sd was 0. 4 %, indicating we can expect 1 % difference for the same carcass made by the same operator with the same copy of the equipment; reproducibility sd was 0. 7 %, indicating 1. 8 % difference can be expected for the same carcass due to factors related to the abattoir. The variation due to the <b>copy</b> of the <b>equipment</b> was minor (sd= 0. 1 %) compared to the operator’s effect (sd= 0. 5 %). Slovenian results are situated somewhere in the middle, if related to the results for other methods (an article in preparation).

40|$|The {{expert report}} {{commissioned}} by the Open Archives Forum discusses {{the relationship between the}} Open Archives Initiative and Intellectual Property. There is considerable confusion over the nature of the Open Archives Initiative and the open access movement, which confuses much of the discussion surrounding OAI. So far as possible, we try to distinguish between these, although both are discussed. Many of the issues which this raises have {{as much to do with}} commercial considerations as with legal ones, and it is inevitable that there should be some cross over between these different perspectives since "the content industry" is dependent on copyright for the security of its business model. Intellectual property is an essentially utilitarian concept, designed to maximise the value of creative effort for society as a whole as well as for individual creators. Intellectual property is governed by national law, drawn up in accordance with international conventions and treaties. National law has two distinctively different traditions: the continental European tradition is based on the "droit d'auteur", the inalienable right of the creator over the creation; the Anglo-Saxon tradition is more explicitly commercial, seeing copyright as predominantly a property right, something that can be traded. These differences in outlook sometimes lead to substantially different attitudes to Intellectual Property issues, although the difference in their practical impact is relatively limited. Copyright provides creators with an exclusive right to control the copying and publication of their work for a limited period of time. This right may be assigned or licensed to others. Moral rights provide additional rights to creators, including the right to be identified as the creator of a work, and the right to object to derogatory treatment of the work; moral rights carry significantly different weight in different national legislative frameworks. All copyright legislation includes certain limited exceptions. These must (under international treaty) pass a "three step test" which ensures that the exceptions do not unduly interfere with the normal exercise of the creator’s rights. Exceptions are normally limited by a test of "substantiality" which cannot be objectively measured. Additional rights exist in many countries to protect databases which may not be protected by copyright law because they exhibit insufficient creativity. The development of the global network has not altered the law of copyright - all existing legislation applies equally to content on the network as elsewhere. However, new legislation has been necessary to reflect changed circumstances, creating new exceptions to copyright and new protections for copyright owners. Because of the ease with which intellectual property can be copied and distributed over the network, some owners of intellectual property rights believe that the law is not able to provide sufficient protection and are seeking to develop and implement technical measures to protect their content. Some believe that there can be no effective technological measures for the protection of copyright, and that other ways will have to be found to compensate owners for casual copying. In some countries, this includes the introduction of levies on either <b>copying</b> <b>equipment</b> or media. The existence of the network is also encouraging the development of new ways of licensing intellectual property, based on the "open software" model. These licences selectively assert creators’ rights under copyright law, but permit users wide licence to copy and distribute without payment. Individual items of metadata may not be protected by copyright, to the extent that they are simply facts intrinsic to the resources that they describe. However, metadata records which include elements of significant creativity - including abstracts - may be "works" in their own right and protected by copyright. Collections of metadata may be covered by database right, even if the metadata records themselves are not covered by copyright. The resources described by the metadata are likely themselves also to be subject to copyright protection, unless they have passed into the public domain because of their age. Our focus in this report is on academic journal articles, since these are the main subject of current Open Archives activity. Although it might be assumed that academic institutions would in general own copyright in journal articles (the normal rule for employers whose employees create intellectual property), it is custom and practice, and often explicit in employment contracts, that academics retain rights in journal articles. We believe this is highly unlikely to change to any great extent in the foreseeable future. Journal publishers have traditionally insisted on a full assignment of rights in articles that they publish. However, many are now content to accept an exclusive licence to publish. However, an exclusive licence may be just as restrictive as an assignment. Many journal publishers do not seek (at least at the present time) to restrict authors from posting copies of journal articles (either before or after formal publication) to the eprint archives. However, authors should ensure that they have an explicit understanding of the rights and the contractual situation, which may be complex. Those who manage eprint servers are publishers, and will need to be aware of their responsibilities as such. This implies that they should ensure that they received proper warranties that an author has the right to post an eprint of a paper. Non-textual resources are more complicated than text resources from the point of view of rights clearance and ownership; the owners of the rights in these resources are often much more rigorous about their enforcement. Repositories that include non-textual materials will have to be very careful to ensure that they do not infringe any rights. It is clear that authors’ attitudes to questions of intellectual property and Open Archives are substantially coloured by the value that they seek from publication (which is not directly monetary). Their behaviour indicates that, even in those disciplines where Open Archives have been long established, formal publication in the peer-reviewed literature remains essential. This is always likely to mean giving up some rights over the content. Publishers' current attitudes to the Open Archives Initiative have been much affected by the confusion between the Open Archives Initiative and the open access movement. It is hardly surprising that publishers show little enthusiasm for what is often openly portrayed to them as an attempt to undermine their business. It would be equally unsurprising if academic institutions did not favour a mechanism which might make the acquisition of journals content less expensive (or indeed anything else). This is the other side of the coin. However, they will have to take on considerable responsibilities if they are themselves to become publishers on a large scale. We recommend that those involved as data providers and service providers in the OAI model should develop mechanisms to make explicit their understanding of the use to which harvested metadata will be put. To this end, we recommend that metadata harvested under the OAI protocol should include information about the permitted uses of the metadata itself and the rights and permissions status of the resource which it describes. We believe that those operating eprint archives - or any other online resource repository - will need to take their responsibility as publishers seriously. This will include developing "notice and takedown" procedures for dealing with situations when notice is given of alleged infringements of copyright. There is ultimately no conflict between Open Archives and Intellectual Property - but Open Archives exist within the framework of Intellectual Property law, and would be advised to recognise this in the way that they operate...|$|E

Many American engineers and skilled auto workers moved to the Soviet Union to work on the plant and its production lines, which was named Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ), or Gorki Automotive Plant in 1932. A few American workers stayed on after the plant's completion, and eventually became victims of Stalin's Great Terror, either shot or exiled to Soviet gulags. In 1933, the Soviets completed construction on a production line for the Ford Model-A passenger car, called the GAZ-A, and a light truck, the GAZ-AA. Both these Ford models were immediately adopted for military use. By the late 1930s production at Gorki was 80,000-90,000 [...] "Russian Ford" [...] vehicles per year.

In the Soviet Union, most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the Soviet Union in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being <b>copied,</b> using primitive <b>equipment.</b> The quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations. In modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (for instance The Legend of Spyro trilogy, Skylanders series, Assassin's Creed saga, Halo or Harry Potter series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language. Releases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On films, TV series, cartoons and animated series are shown as a dubbing and voiceover. Subtitles are not used at all.|$|R
40|$|Following the Information Society Directive of 2001 (introducing {{the concept}} of “fair compensation” for private copying into EU Law), total {{collection}} from levies on <b>copying</b> media and <b>equipment</b> in the EU tripled, from about € 170 m to more than € 500 m per annum. Levy schemes exist now in 22 out of 27 Member States (with only the UK, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg remaining outside). Despite their wide adoption, levy systems are little understood, both in respect of their rationale and their economic consequences. Tariffs are increasingly contested in court, leading to a large gap between claimed and collected revenues. The European Commission has announced “comprehensive legislative action” for 2012. This report offers the first independent empirical assessment of the European levy system as a whole. The research consolidates the evidence on levy setting, collection and distribution; reviews the scope of consumer permissions associated with levy payments; and reports the results of three product level studies (printer/scanners, portable music/video/game devices, and tablet computers), analysing the relationship between VAT, levy tariffs and retail prices in 20 levy and non�levy countries. Key findings: There are dramatic differences between countries in the methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and allocating beneficiaries of the levy. There are levies on blank media in 22 EU countries, on MP 3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries, on personal computers in 4 countries. Revenues collected per capita vary between € 0. 02 (Romania) and € 2. 6 (France). The distribution of levy revenues to recording artists is less than € 0. 01 per album These variations cannot be explained by an underlying concept of economic harm to rightholders from private copying The scope of consumer permissions under the statutory exceptions for private copying within the EU vary, and generally do not match with what consumers ordinarily understand as private activities In levy countries, the costs of levies as an indirect tax are not always {{passed on to the}} consumer. In competitive markets, such as those for printers, manufacturers of levied goods appear to absorb the levy.
