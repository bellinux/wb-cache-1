40|$|Proceedings, Wim Blockmans et al. (eds), Portland Press, 2014 International audienceThe head of {{a prestigious}} {{scientific}} institution recently said, by paraphrasing a famous quotation: "we solve problems that are posed, not that we pose". This view totally misses the history and role of human knowledge construction and prepares wrong ways for evaluating it. Science is not problem solving, it is theory building. Any relevant, difficult problem requires {{the construction of a}} new theoretical frame to deal with the problem in an original and effective way. Moreover, problems follow from the proposal of a theory. Animals continually solve problems that are posed to them by events. We, the humans, by language, in our <b>communicating</b> <b>community,</b> we looked at the Moon, at the Stars, which pose no problem, and invented Myths and Theories, and derived from them countless problems. We also looked at inert matter, a stone, some sand on a Greek beach, and proposed the atomistic theory. Science originated by these attempts to organize the world by concepts and theories. Later, it was radically renewed by looking again at planets, but from a different perspective: from the point of view of the Sun, on the grounds of a different metaphysics, which lead to a theoretical revolution. It was also renewed by looking at two falling stones in an original way and at physical trajectories as inertial, at the infinite limit of a non-existing frictionless movement [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Multimedia Information Networking and Security {{include a}} number of related topics such as {{information}} networking, communication, security and sharing services, etc., Significant {{attention has been paid}} in the past years to design flexible and powerful solutions to this field, as the rapid development of communication technology, utilizing network to realize global communications has become the trend of information exchange. Although the Internet has reached great success in contributing to communications between people, it has been under almost constant attack by hackers. Many attacks seek to exploit vulnerabilities of software systems like application programs or other computer programs. In other words, shared network resources also bring a variety of risks. This special issue aims to expose the readership to the latest research results on multimedia information networking and security. It is composed of 12 papers, including {{a number of}} related topics, demonstrate pioneer work, investigate novel solutions and discuss the future trends in this field. The first paper, “Extensive Design for Attack’s Recognition and Resistance of Survivable Network” by Hui Xu and Xiang Gu, gives a solution of attack defense of survivable network based on extentics. The basic knowledge of extension theory is introduced and the inspiration from it to problem in this paper is illustrated. The contradictory characteristic of survivability of borderless network is explained. The extension model and algorithms of recognition and resistance of attacks is presented. The definitions of element, including message matter-element, defense affair-element, node relation-element and inform mixture-element, are given. The dependent function based on lateral distance with the most advantage point occurs in the left common endpoint, is constructed to solve the problem and its properties are discussed. Finally, an application of worm’s warning by this method is illustrated. In the second paper, “A Graph Clustering Algorithm Providing Scalability” by Lei Huang, Jiabing Wang and Xing He, proposes a new scalable graph clustering method called APANC (Affinity Propagation And Normalized Cut) based on the current studies on the algorithms of the affinity propagation and normalized cut. During the APANC process, the authors firstly use the “Affinity Propagation” (AP) to preliminarily group the original data {{in order to reduce the}} data-scale, and then they further group the result of AP using “Normalized Cut” (NC) to get the final result. Through such combination, the advantages of AP in time costs and the advantages of NC in accuracy have been adopted. The experimental results show that even though APANC includes two clustering processes, this two-phase algorithm helps to reduce the experiment time compared to NC, and meanwhile, maintain the accuracy. Furthermore, the advantages of APANC in time costs could be greater when data scale increases. The third paper, “A Novel Turbo-Based Encryption Scheme Using Dynamic Puncture Mechanism” by Qian Mao and Chuan Qin, proposes a novel encryption method based on Turbo code. In most communication systems, information encryption and error correction are always independent. While joint encryption and error correction codes combine these two processes into one. In order to provide information encryption and error correction simultaneously, the authors generate a normal random sequence that controls the puncturing mechanism by a secret key in the Turbo encoder. The puncturing mechanism is dynamic and controlled by the secret key. On the other hand, the keycontrolled puncturing mechanism deletes the parity bits randomly, which ensures a high error correction capability for the Turbo code. When decoding, only the legal receiver can generate the same normal random sequence using the secret key, then classify and decrypt the received sequence correctly. While for the illegal receivers, because a wrong secret key results in a wrong puncturing mechanism, and the Turbo decoder is sensitive to the puncturing mechanism, they will get a totally wrong decoding result. Meanwhile, this coding scheme also provides good error correction capability for the encrypted information while it is transmitted in a noisy channel. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of both security and error-immunity. In the fourth paper, “A Statistical Amalgamation Approach for Ontologies” by Peng Liu et al., put forward another way of ontology merging. After statistic machine learning on concept relations, the frequency of different ontologies appeared in concept relations reveals certainty factor and help to build a large-scale concept relations network including the statistic information and domain categories, so that the conceptions convey ed by different ontologies can be fused together and the merging concept space turns to be relatively objective. And the experiments results also help to demonstrate the feasibility of the ontology merging. The fifth paper, “Adaptive Ant Colony Clustering Method Applied to Finding Closely Communicating Community” by Yan Liu, Lian Liu and Junyong Luo, investigate community structures in networks. This paper points out that losely <b>communicating</b> <b>community</b> is different from the traditional community which emphasize particularly on structure or context. The authors’ previous method played more emphasis on the feasibility that ant colony algorithm applied to community detection. However the essence of closely <b>communicating</b> <b>community</b> did not be described clearly. In this paper, the definition of closely <b>communicating</b> <b>community</b> is put forward firstly, the four features are described and corresponding methods are introduced to achieve the value of features between each pair. Meanwhile, pair propinquity and local propinquity are put forward and used to guide ants’ decision. Based on the previous work, the closely <b>communicating</b> <b>community</b> detection method is improved in four aspects of adaptive adjusting, which are entropy based weight modulation, combining historical paths and random wandering to select next coordination, the strategy of forcing unloading and the adaptive change of ant’s eyesight. The value selection of parameters is discussed in the portion of experiments, and the results also reveal the improvement of our algorithm in adaptive adjusting. In the sixth paper, “Applying Stylometric Analysis Techniques to Counter Anonymity in Cyberspace” by Jianwen Sun et al., proposes a framework for online writeprint identification. Variable length character n-gram is used to represent the author’s writing style. The technique of IG seeded GA based feature selection for Ensemble (IGAE) is also developed to build an identification model based on individual author level features. Several specific components for dealing with the individual feature set are integrated to improve the performance. The proposed feature and technique are evaluated on a real world data set encompassing reviews posted by 50 Amazon customers. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with accuracy over 94 % for 20 authors and over 80 % for 50 ones. Compared with the baseline technique (Support Vector Machine), a higher performance is achieved by using IGAE, resulting in a 2 % and 8 % improvement over SVM for 20 and 50 authors respectively. Moreover, it has been shown that IGAE is more scalable in terms of the number of authors, than author group level based methods. The seventh paper, “A Secure Mutual Authentication Protocol for Roaming in Wireless Mesh Networks” by Peng Xiao, Jingsha He and Yingfang Fu, proposes a new protocol based on multi-signature and three-party key agreement with a zone-based hierarchical network topology and prove the security properties of the protocol through formal analysis that is based on the strand space model after analyzing some current authentication protocols for roaming in wireless mesh networks. It also demonstrates the reliability and performance of the proposed protocol through network simulations. In the eighth paper, “Fake BTS Attacks of GSM System on Software Radio Platform” by Yubo Song, Kan Zhou, and Xi Chen, presents an implement of fake BTS based on software radio technologies. This paper also discusses two types of fake BTS attacks on our software radio platform. The first attack is IMSI/IMEI catch attack, which can get the mobile phone’s IMSI and IMEI. With this information, attacker can got the track of the man with this phone. The second attack is selective jamming attack. After get the IMSI and IMEI of the mobile phone, the attackers can decide whether the mobile phone is blocked or not. The authors will analyze the GSM protocol which is relevant to the interception system and later present the performance of such a system by real tests and demonstrate its feasibility. The ninth paper, “Lower Bounds of Differential and Linear Active S-boxes for Generalized Feistel Network with SP Type F-function” by Ting Cui and Chenhui Jin, studies the minimum number of differential/linear active S-boxes for a class of generalized Feistel cipher with SP type F-function (GFNSP for short). The authors prove that m rounds m-GFNSP guarantee one differential active S-box and one linear active S-box, and 2 m(m≥ 3) rounds guarantee differential active S-boxes and linear active S-boxes, where and are the differential and the linear branch number of the diffusion layer in F-function respectively. Hence, lower bound of the number of differential active S-boxes and that of linear active S-boxes for GFNSP with arbitrary round are deduced respectively, moreover, the previous one could be reachable for and as well as the latter one be reachable for and, where denotes the number of rounds. In the tenth paper, “Distributed Hash Tables for Peer-to-Peer Mobile Ad-hoc Networks with Security Extensions” by Grant P. Millar, Emmanouil A. Panaousis and Christos Politis, describes peer-to-peer distributed hash table (DHT) architecture entitled Reliable Overlay Based Utilisation of Services and Topology (ROBUST) firstly. This is designed to be efficiently applied to MANETs. Additionally, it proposes security extensions to protect the ROBUST signalling messages against malicious activities. This paper evaluates the ROBUST performance as well as the security extensions under varying levels of mobility and network sizes by building a custom DHT module for the network simulator ns- 2. The outcome of the results show negligible overhead introduced by the extensions giving credence to their application in security sensitive scenarios. In the eleventh paper, “The Probability of Trojan Attacks on Multi-level Security Strategy based Network” by Lansheng Han et al., discusses that the Trojan horses’ attacks have a dependency on data path in the network and establishes three attacking probability models of single source node to single target node by single-path, single source node to single target node by multi-path and multi-source nodes to single target node by multi-path considering the relationship between defend ability and security levels, the paper. Furthermore, the paper describes the defend ability of the non-adjacent nodes with a new model. Finally the model is applied to a military network information system, and the results are reasonable. In the twelfth paper, “A Review on Cloud Computing Development” by Sugang Ma, cloud computing can provide critical services for business management, reducing IT costs and maintenance costs of hardware and software effectively. In the meanwhile, it can enable enterprises to access to professional IT solutions with less IT investment. Cloud computing is of great significance for the ICT industry of each country. It is now bringing enormous impact to the human society, especially the business world. In this paper, the basic concepts and the development of cloud computing were introduced, and then the current situation and development of cloud computing research from two aspects of technology and business were illustrated. Finally future trends of cloud computing were discussed.

We study two potential, cognitively inspired models of human behavior: 1) categorization (quantized memorization and communication), which dampens communication and belief adoption, but leads to undesired oscillations and lower performance. 2) Instance-based blending with memory decay, which achieves good dynamics and near-optimal performance without the same bandwidth needs.

Portland, OR’s Metro regional government has developed investment scenarios {{designed to reduce}} light vehicle carbon emissions. Adopting a regional scenario requires public review and consultation with local governments who will implement the comprehensive plans and land-use regulations. Decision makers and residents need to understand potential benefits: ways in which targeted investment could generate more livable urban spaces while reducing greenhouse gases. Illustrations can show how the investments could shape the pedestrian experience through trees, street furniture, buildings, open spaces, etc. This report explains a new workflow to illustrate urban development possibilities that can be adjusted according to evolving forecasts. Developing accessible scenario illustrations from city and regional planning forecasts requires sound analysis and thoughtful graphics to effectively communicate the analysis results.

40|$|In late 2002, Ailsa Weazel, Co-ordinator of Gumbi Gunyah Women’s Shelter {{met with}} Heather Nancarrow {{who was working}} on a project {{concerned}} with justice strategies to deal with family violence. Ailsa expressed her grave concerns about increased violence in Woorabinda and a lack of respect for culture and elders among the community’s children. Ailsa saw this as a consequence of violence, including family violence, being an accepted ‘norm’ in the community and she identified a desperate need for intervention to bring peace and hope for the children’s future and that of their community. Ailsa had a vision of a program for young children incorporating traditional story-telling methods to <b>communicate</b> <b>community</b> values and respect for culture to respond to the need she had identified. In early 2003, Heather became the Director of the Queensland Centre for Domestic and Family Violence Research (CDFVR), Central Queensland University, and in this role, she offered Ailsa assistance to develop and evaluate the program she envisioned. This offer resulted in a collaborative project between Ailsa, Centre for Domestic and Family Violence Research and the Woorabinda State School (WSS).

40|$|Landslides are an {{increasing}} problem in Nepal's Middle Hills due to {{both natural and}} human phenomena: mainly increasingly intense monsoon rains and a boom in rural road construction. This problem has largely been neglected due to underreporting of losses and the dispersed nature of landslides. Understanding how populations cope with landslides {{is a first step}} toward developing more effective landslide risk management programs. The present research focuses on two villages in Central-Eastern Nepal, both affected by active landslides but with different coping strategies. Research methods are interdisciplinary, based on a geological assessment of landslide risk and a socio-economic study of the villages using household questionnaires, focus group discussions and transect walks. Community risk maps are compared with geological landslide risk maps to better understand and <b>communicate</b> <b>community</b> risk perceptions, priorities and coping strategies. A modified typology of coping strategies is presented, based on previous work by Burton, Kates, and White (1993) that is useful for decision-makers for designing more effective programs for landslide mitigation. Main findings underscore that coping strategies, mainly seeking external assistance and outmigration, are closely linked to access to resources, ethnicity/social status and levels of community organization. Conclusions include the importance of investing in organizational skills, while building on local knowledge about landslide mitigation for reducing landslide risk. There is great potential to increase coping strategies by incorporating skills training on landslide mitigation in existing agricultural outreach and community forest user group training...|$|R
