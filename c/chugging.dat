500|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{prominently}} {{features a}} sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", for which Madonna personally sought permission from ABBA's songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. Musically {{the song is}} influenced by 1980s pop, with a <b>chugging</b> groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles.|$|E
500|$|Eric Greenwood for Drawer B called [...] "Cool" [...] "a {{retrofitted}} [...] with stale synths and <b>chugging</b> guitars" [...] with [...] "dorkier lyrics {{than even}} Cyndi Lauper would dare".

Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne described Stefani, in [...] "Cool" [...] {{and in another}} song ("The Real Thing"), as [...] "a glacial '80s synthpop zombie". Krissi Murison from NME found Stefani's performance reminiscent of [...] "Madonna's breathless purr".

500|$|Musically, [...] "Hung Up" [...] is a dance-pop and disco song. According to The New York Times, {{the song}} has vaguely {{familiar}} hooks, sustained overlays of the string arrangement and acoustic guitar enfolding {{the music to}} create a haze like sound. Billboard described the music as frothy, nonsensical and joyous. The instant familiarity of the sampled music is changed by Stuart Price and Madonna by adding a <b>chugging</b> groove and a chorus which singles it out as an independent song. Besides the ABBA sample, Rolling Stone said that the song also incorporated Madonna's older songs like [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] and features fleeting quotes from bands like S.O.S. and the Tom Tom Club.|$|E

Of [...] "Meteorite", he wrote [...] "The <b>chugging</b> midnight soul train to gorgeous 'Meteorite' burns bright on the still-potent embers of Eddie Kendricks's urgent masterpiece 'Goin' Up in Smoke. PopMatters writer Devone Jones complimented Carey taking [...] "a brave step into untouched territory" [...] in recording a 1980s style song.

500|$|While {{reviewing}} The Fame on {{its fifth}} anniversary, Bradley Stern from Idolator noted that [...] "LoveGame" [...] could [...] "easily be erased from Gaga's back catalog with little consequence" [...] since {{he felt it}} {{to be nothing more}} than an [...] "electro-dance" [...] track. But Stern believed that [...] "LoveGame" [...] was an important component of Gaga's career trajectory, since it was the last testament of her image as [...] "that of the disco-stick wielding pop star from out of space"—the image was later deconstructed as the doomed starlet in the music video of [...] "Paparazzi". He concluded by saying that the song [...] "is a wonderful moment of pop frivolity which served to keep the upstart Lady Gaga machine <b>chugging</b> along at the beginning of her career." ...|$|E
500|$|Their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, {{prominent}} {{electric guitar}} riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune.

[...] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album [...] "far more mechanical" [...] than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar. The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

500|$|In Jamaica in 1967, Penn {{recorded}} a song titled [...] "You Don't Love Me", which [...] "she first sang for Studio One, although the song itself {{originated in the}} American south, courtesy of R singer Willie Cobbs". Cobb himself had based his song on blues singer Bo Diddley's 1955 recording [...] "She's Fine, She's Mine".

[...] Dodd, who had lived {{for a while in}} the United States, imported American rhythm and blues records to play for his sound system entertainment businesses.

[...] The opening guitar riff of [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go", by some critics. According to Petridis, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. [...] "Rock Me" [...] has a clapping, mid-tempo beat that has been likened to that [...] "We Will Rock You", a 1977 single by Queen.|$|E

The lyrics of both [...] "Son of Three" [...] and [...] "The She" [...] suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, [...] "Put on a Side", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's [...] "voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain," [...] as she repeats twelve words {{over the course of the}} song: [...] "Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side." ...|$|E

Having {{elements}} of soul and urban contemporary music, its Instrumentation includes tumbling R piano lines and a pulsating, driving backbeat. The song begins with an emotionally frayed spoken-word introduction by Leigh-Anne Pinnock, [...] "She captures her reflection then she throws the mirror to the floor/ Her image is distorted, screaming 'Is it worth it anymore?" [...] 4Music said that the spoken-word introduction is reminiscent of All Saints' 1997 single, [...] "Never Ever". The chorus, [...] "Change, change your life, take it all/We gonna stick together, know we get through it all", is pledged by the group in harmony over a spiralling piano lines, cascading keyboard lines and rousing, <b>chugging</b> strings. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to E5.

A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place.

Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one {{will come to the}} rescue, the person helplessly awaits {{impending}} doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett's former band Exodus had demoed called [...] "Impaler", which was later released on that band's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. [...] "Escape" [...] was originally titled [...] "The Hammer" [...] and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a <b>chugging</b> guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-stroked riff. Authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome felt the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio.
