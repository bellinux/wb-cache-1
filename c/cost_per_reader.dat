40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{electronic toll collection}} on the eight bridges crossing San Francisco Bay has provided the means for a relatively simple and low cost system for measuring travel times on many Bay Area bridges and roads. The toll tags sued for electronic toll collection can be read by readers at various locations on congested roads. The time of reading is recorded so that the time difference between when a vehicle passes one reader and passes the next can be computed. Such a system is already operating in Houston, where it is {{the primary source of}} travel time data. Capital <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>reader</b> site where such systems have been implemented range from $ 18, 000 -$ 38, 000 and for the operations center from $ 37, 000 -$ 86, 000. Annual operating costs range from $ 4, 000 -$ 6, 000 per detector site and $ 48, 000 -$ 96, 000 for the operations center. The Bay Area bridges and their approaches are prime candidates for such a system. Most of the congested freeways and a few arterials near the Bay are also good candidates. The extent of the area for which toll tags would provide satisfactory travel time estimates will depend on how many vehicles choose to use electronic toll collection. This, in turn, will depend on Caltrans policies on tolls and the number of lanes available for toll tags and cash payment. Key words: Vehicle probes Travel time measurement Toll tag...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of secondary prevention with pravastatin in Hong Kong patients with {{coronary heart disease}} and average cholesterol levels. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on published results of the CARE study. PATIENTS: Men and women post-myocardial infarction with average cholesterol levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness analysis: <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> life saved, <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal coronary event prevented, <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> procedure prevented, and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal stroke prevented. Cost-utility analysis: gross cost and net <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> quality-adjusted life year gained calculated using two alternative models. RESULTS: <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> life saved or death prevented was HK$ 4, 442, 350 (non-discounted); <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal cardiac event prevented HK$ 1, 146, 413; <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> procedure prevented HK$ 732, 759; and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal stroke prevented HK$ 2, 961, 566. Net <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> quality adjusted life year gained was HK$ 73, 218 and HK$ 65, 280 non-discounted, respectively using the two alternative models. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of this study}} can assist in prioritising the use of health care resources in Hong Kong but should be considered alongside the benefits and costs of alternative interventions for coronary heart disease. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
