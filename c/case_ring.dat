50|$|A cable color scheme, {{known as}} even-count color code, is {{determined}} for 25 pairs of conductors as follows: For each ring, the primary, more prominent color is chosen {{from the set}} blue, orange, green, brown, and slate, in that order, and the secondary, thinner stripe color from the set of white, red, black, yellow, and violet colors, in that order. The tip conductor color scheme uses the same colors as the matching ring but switches {{the thickness of the}} primary and secondary colored stripes. Since the sets are ordered, an orange (color 2 in its set) with a yellow (color 4) is the color scheme for the 4·5 + 2 − 5 = 17th pair of wires. If the yellow is the more prominent, thicker stripe, then the wire is a tip conductor connecting to the pin numbered 25 + the pair #, which is pin 42 in this <b>case.</b> <b>Ring</b> conductors connect to the same pin number as the pair number.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Valve {{surgery in}} {{children}} {{is aimed at}} restoring correct hemodynamics with few reoperations and limited resort to prostheses, which would imply early deterioration or definitive hypocoagulation. OBJECTIVES: Report a series of paediatric pts with acquired mitral valve disease, mostly due to rheumatic disease, in whom it was possible, for the great majority, to repair the damaged valve. DEMOGRAPHICS: Fifty children with predominant mitral valve disease, 47 rheumatic (94 %) and 3 after endocarditis were consequently operated by the same surgical team {{over the last five}} years. Ages were 12. 5 +/- 3. 1 yrs and weights 33. 2 +/- 8. 4 Kg, 30 pts presented with predominant mitral regurgitation and 20 pts had significant stenosis. In 8 pts there also moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and in 2 pts severe tricuspid regurgitation was present. Patients were not operated during the acute phase of the disease. Five pts were reoperations and from those, all but one received mechanical prosthesis. RESULTS: In all operations the intention was to repair the mitral valve. In 46 pts complex mitral valvuloplasties were performed extended comissurotomies, shortening of chordae, chordal replacement with PTFE, and reconstruction of valve leaflefts by direct patching or pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet (78. 2 % cases), plus reshaping of the annulus by using a fixed prosthetic CE ring (sizes 26 to 32) in every <b>case.</b> <b>Ring</b> sizes correlated poorly with body weights, but correlation was close and positive for the use of pericardial advancement of the posterior leaflet (p< 0. 01). There was no operative mortality, but one pt died early from sepsis and there was no late mortality. Maximum follow up extends now to 50 months (median 28 months) and functional evaluation, at latest follow up, as assessed by Doppler Echocardiography, showed residual mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate in 4 pts and LA-LV gradients mild in 5 and moderate in 2 pts. NYHA functional class, at present follow-up is class I for 43 pts (88 %) and class II in the remaining 6 pts. Along the follow-up period 2 pts had to be reoperated for early repair failures and other three for late failures, presently freedom for reoperation is 91. 8 % at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair in children with rheumatic lesions can be achieved for the great majority of cases by using different techniques. Pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet allowed the use of a bigger size prosthetic ring. Intermediate functional results are good with fair functional classes and few reoperations but follow-up is short and does not allow us to draw conclusions about the long-term results of the repair in these rheumatic patients...|$|E
40|$|Vaccinating {{a buffer}} of {{individuals}} around a <b>case</b> (<b>ring</b> vaccination) {{has the potential}} to target those who are at highest risk of infection, reducing the number of doses needed to control a disease. We explored the potential vaccine effectiveness (VE) of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) for such a strategy. This analysis uses existing data from a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which OCV or placebo was given to 71, 900 participants in Kolkata, India, from 27 July to 10 September 2006. Cholera surveillance was then conducted on 144, 106 individuals living in the study area, including trial participants, for 5 y following vaccination. First, we explored the risk of cholera among contacts of cholera patients, and, second, we measured VE among individuals living within 25 m of cholera cases between 8 and 28 d after onset of the index case. For the first analysis, individuals living around each index case identified during the 5 -y period were assembled using a ring to define cohorts of individuals exposed to cholera index cases. An index control without cholera was randomly selected for each index case from the same population, matched by age group, and individuals living around each index control were assembled using a ring to define cohorts not exposed to cholera cases. Cholera attack rates among the exposed and non-exposed cohorts were compared using different distances from the index case/control to define the rings and different time frames to define the period at risk. For the VE analysis, the exposed cohorts were further stratified according to the level of vaccine coverage into high and low coverage strata. Overall VE was assessed by comparing the attack rates between high and low vaccine coverage strata irrespective of individuals' vaccination status, and indirect VE was assessed by comparing the attack rates among unvaccinated members between high and low vaccine coverage strata. Cholera risk among the cohort exposed to cholera cases was 5 - 11 times higher than that among the cohort not exposed to cholera cases. The risk gradually diminished with an increase in distance and time. The overall and indirect VE measured between 8 and 28 d after exposure to a cholera index case during the first 2 y was 91 % (95 % CI 62 %- 98 %) and 93 % (95 % CI 44 %- 99 %), respectively. VE persisted for 5 y after vaccination and was similar whether the index case was a young child (< 5 y) or was older. Of note, this study was a reanalysis of a cholera vaccine trial that used two doses; thus, a limitation of the study relates to the assumption that a single dose, if administered quickly, will induce a similar level of total and indirect protection over the short term as did two doses. These findings suggest that high-level protection can be achieved if individuals living close to cholera cases are living in a high coverage ring. Since this was an observational study including participants who had received two doses of vaccine (or placebo) in the clinical trial, further studies are needed to determine whether a ring vaccination strategy, in which vaccine is given quickly to those living close to a case, is feasible and effective.
