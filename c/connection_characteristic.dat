40|$|Abstract. Machining {{accuracy}} depends {{very strongly}} on the <b>connection</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the spindle/toolholder interface. Under high rotational speed, the <b>connection</b> <b>characteristics</b> vary greatly. Above variation {{can result in}} the axial displacement of the tool relative to the spindle and the bending of the tool under {{the action of the}} cutting force, thereby reduce machining accuracy. Traditional research methods based on Lames equation are not suited for the spindle/toolholder interface. Advanced nonlinear FEM technology can provide an effective approach to solve this problem. The results demonstrate that higher drawbar force can increase contact pressure between the toolholder and the spindle to prevent the tool from bending during cutting process, and reasonable initial interference can effectively improve axial positioning accuracy of the tool relatively to the spindle. So, enhancing the drawbar force and choosing a reasonable initial interference is benefit to improving machining accuracy and surface quality...|$|R

Referancing to the <b>connection</b> <b>characteristic</b> and {{mechanical}} behavior {{as well as}} the defects in application of joints on concrete-filled steel tube between columns and beams, a new connection type of steel beam throughout joints model is proposed. The inner force transfer mechanism and stress distribution situation of the joint under the monotonous load and hysteretic behavior, ductility, energy dissipation under cyclically lateral load are analyzed using the software ANSYS. The result indicated that the stress of steel pipe is reduced effectively when continious web plate joint is used. Meanwhile， the rigidity of the joint is enhancedand. It is also accord with the seismic design concepts, that is “ strong column-weak beam”. During this process of the jiont working, plastic hinge occurs out of joint area on the beam.

Research on the structural characteristics of their networks is also usually restricted to the size and composition of the networks, moreover, with little attention to such characteristics as the variety, accessibility, length and origin of the relationships or the frequency and initiation of the contacts. A comprehensive examination of both the structural and functional characteristics of the social networks of 33 people with intellectual disabilities was therefore undertaken. The social networks of the individuals who all lived in the community varied from 4 to 28 members (mean 14. 21); 42. 65 % of the network members were family members, 32. 84 % acquaintances and 24. 51 % professionals. Remarkable is the high frequency of contact with network members; {{the finding that the}} participants considered themselves to be the main initiator of contact more often than the other members of their networks as the main initiators; the high scores assigned to neighbours and professionals for functional characteristics; and the relatively low scores assigned to network members for the <b>connection</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the social networks.

40|$|Observation of fire damaged {{structures}} and recent fire tests at the Cardington LBTF {{have suggested that}} even nominally `simple' connections are capable of providing significant restraint at elevated-temperatures. As most frames are designed assuming pinned response at ambient-temperature, with no account being taken of the reduction in mid-span moments, this is an aspect of connectivity which may be utilised {{in the assessment of}} the fire resistance of steel framed buildings, without necessitating changes in the approach adopted in ambient-temperature design or construction. To date the assessment of the influence of connection response on frame behaviour has been limited by the quantity of available test data, although initial studies based on postulated moment-rotation- temperature characteristics concluded that the failure temperatures for beams are increased due to the rigidity of `simple' connections. Moment-rotation relationships have been measured for a flush end-plate connection, both as bare-steel and as composite with a concrete slab across a range of temperatures. To define accurately the full moment-rotation-temperature response a series of tests have been conducted for each arrangement, where specimens were subject to varying constant levels of load and increasing temperatures. Observed failure mechanisms have been compared with those for a nominally identical specimen tested at ambient-temperature, and initial recommendations presented for the degradation of ambient-temperature <b>connection</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A mathematical expression is proposed in order to represent the test data at a number of temperatures. It is clearly unrealistic to expect that many such tests can be anticipated in the future, and as such a spring-stiffness model has been presented for both bare-steel and composite flush end-plate connections. The use of a spring-stiffness model compares favourably with other forms of modelling due to the combination of efficient solution and the ability to follow accurately the full non-linear range of connection response, based on an understanding of the response of the component parts. A multi-linear representation of response has been adopted, where the stiffness of the connection is revised as elements enter the plastic range of response. Comparison has been made between the response predicted and that recorded experimentally. Experimentally derived <b>connection</b> <b>characteristics</b> have been incorporated within analysis of typical sub-frames, with parameters including connection stiffness, capacity and temperature being varied. Further studies are presented considering the sensitivity of overall frame behaviour to inaccuracies in the representation of connection response and the use of simplified models to generate elevated-temperature <b>connection</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Based on postulated elevated-temperature moment-rotation <b>characteristics</b> for the <b>connections</b> contained within the Cardington test frame, predictions have been presented for the response of the structure subject to a series of full scale fire tests, with semi-rigid behaviour being compared with the common assumptions of pinned and rigid characteristics...|$|R
