The limestone was then dissolved in large, Nile-fed pools until it became a watery slurry.

Proof-of-concept tests using similar compounds were carried out at a geopolymer institute in northern France and it was found that a crew of five to ten, working with simple hand tools, could agglomerate a structure of five, 1.3 to 4.5 ton blocks in a couple of weeks.

Some freshly molded lightweight concrete blocks were taken from a block manufacture plant and cured in a CO 2 curing tank in lab. Steam-cured lightweight concrete blocks were randomly taken from the same plant. Several hundreds of concrete blocks after steam and CO 2 curing were stockpiled outside for winter exposure. The compressive strength of CO 2 -cured blocks was similar to that of steam-cured ones. It continued to increase when blocks were placed in a moist environment after steam and CO 2 curing. However, steam-cured blocks showed faster strength development rate than CO 2 -cured ones did, and they behaved the same during the outdoor winter exposure, CO 2 -cured blocks demonstrated lower drying shrinkage and water absorption than steam-cured ones after 180 days of outdoor winter exposure. This indicated that CO 2 -cured concrete blocks had better dimensional stability, but similar weathering properties to steam-cured ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Fast track construction is a special type of construction where construction methods and activities are planned to minimize the construction duration. Since the duration of the hardening period of concrete is largely undefined at the time of placement, it becomes difficult to schedule the time necessary for the <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> in fast track intersection constructions. In order to plan and organize a construction, the construction schedule needs to be established prior {{to the beginning of the}} actual construction. Therefore, a good estimation of the duration of the <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> activity needs to be made by the scheduler. In this research, a method that can be used to predict the time of curing and strength development for a concrete application is proposed. By using this method, concrete strength can be predicted non-destructively by measuring the maturity of concrete and utilizing a strength-maturity relationship. A series of laboratory tests was carried out and the results of these tests were statistically analyzed to develop a strength-maturity relationship. A temperature independent model was developed to be able to utilize it at different curing conditions. This model can be used in the field to validate the strength of concrete by measuring the maturity of concrete. Field work was carried out to evaluate the applicability of the method in the field.
