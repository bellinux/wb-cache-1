Abstract. – A “sandpile ” {{cellular}} automaton achieves complex temporal correlations, like a 1 /f spectrum, if the position {{where it is}} perturbed diffuses slowly rather than changing completely at random, showing that the spatial correlations of the driving are deeply related to the intermittent activity. Hence, recent arguments excluding the relevance of self-organized criticality in seismicity and in other contexts are inaccurate. As a toy model of single fault evolution, and despite of its simplicity, our automaton uniquely reproduces the scaling form of the broad distributions of waiting times between earthquakes. Criticality and intermittency are features of many complex natural phenomena where quiet periods with a slow loading of the system separate events in which a rapid evolution takes place [1, 2]. Some examples are earthquakes [3, 4], solar flares [5], creep experiments with <b>cellular</b> <b>glasses</b> [6] and even with piles of rice [7]. The intensity of the events and the spatial and temporal scales separating them may vary over broad ranges since their distributions are scaleinvariant. For these phenomena one can imagine the nonequilibrium dynamics driving the system to a critical regime, realizing so called self-organized criticality (SOC) [1, 2, 8]. Durin...|$|R

40|$|As {{the range}} of {{applications}} for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials in civil engineering constantly increases, there {{is more and more}} concern with regard to their performance in critical environments. The fire behavior of composite materials is especially important since complex physical and chemical processes such as the glass transition and decomposition occur when these materials are subjected to elevated and high temperatures, possibly leading to considerable loss of stiffness and strength. This stiffness and strength degradation in composite materials under elevated and high temperatures is the result of changes in polymer molecular structures. When polyester thermosets are subjected to elevated and high temperatures, they undergo three transitions (glass transition, leathery-to-rubbery transition, and rubbery-to-decomposed transition), corresponding to four different states (glassy, leathery, rubbery and decomposed). At a certain temperature, a composite material can therefore be considered as a mixture of materials that are in different states. As the content of each state varies with temperature, the composite material exhibits temperature-dependent properties. Since these changes in state can be described using kinetic theory, the quantity of material in each state can be estimated and the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of the mixture can thus be determined. These concepts formed a basis for the development of thermophysical and thermomechanical property sub-models for composites at elevated and high temperatures and even for the description of post-fire status. Incorporating these thermophysical property sub-models into a heat transfer governing equation, thermal responses were calculated using a finite difference method. Integrating the thermomechanical property sub-models within structural theory, the mechanical responses were described using a finite element method and the time-to-failure was also predicted by defining a failure criterion. The modeling results for temperature responses, mechanical responses and post-fire behavior were compared with those obtained from structural endurance experiments on full-scale <b>cellular</b> GFRP (<b>glass</b> fiber-reinforced polymer, in this case polyester resin) panels subjected to a four-point bending configuration and fire from one side. The modeling results for time-to-failure were compared with those from the experiments carried out on GFRP tubes under combined compressive and thermal loadings. In each experimental setup, two different thermal boundary conditions were investigated – with and without water cooling through specimen cells – and good agreement was found. The understanding gained and modeling of the behavior of GFRP composites under elevated and high temperatures carried out in this thesis could be applicable for different composite materials, and also benefit investigations regarding both active and passive fire protection techniques in order to improve the fire resistance of structures made of such materials...|$|R

Two series of fire extinguishing tests in reduced scale have been conducted. Both testseries simulated tank fire conditions by using a large amount of fuel and long preburntimes. The influence of foam application techniques, foam characteristics, and applicationrates have been investigated. Some tests have also included alternative extinguishingmedia such as <b>cellular</b> <b>glass,</b> liquid nitrogen and aqueous vermiculite dispersion (AVD). In total 29 extinguishing tests were conducted in the first test series using a 0, 41 m 2 firetray and 14 tests were conducted in the second test series using a 3, 14 m 2 fire tray. Priorto the experimental work a literature review was conducted to gain experience, both fromreal tank fire incidents and from various test and system design standards for the use offoam on water-miscible fuel fires. The results showed the importance of the characteristics of the finished foam. Higherfoam expansion ratios and longer drainage times resulted in significantly improved fireperformance. These improved foam characteristics are dependent on the foam applicationhardware as well as the foam concentrate formulation. To obtain these improvedcharacteristics the foam concentration was increased to 6 % from a nominal value of 3 %On the other hand, the improved foam characteristics allowed the application rate to bereduced by 50 % without compromising extinguishing performance. This shows that theperformance requirements in existing test standards for foam (e. g. UL 162, EN 1568) donot provide an incentive for manufacturers to formulate their foam to handle more severefire conditions, such as a tank fire scenario. The tests also indicated that gentle application of the foam is not guaranteed by the use offoam pourers (Type II discharge outlet according to NFPA 11) as the foam was not ableto flow gently along the tank wall due to high steel temperatures. With respect to alternative media, applying a layer of <b>cellular</b> <b>glass</b> followed by foamapplication made the extinguishing operation even more robust.

A piezoelectric shock accelerometer (ANC-M) and a resistance temperature sensor (ANC-T) will be mounted in the Lander's harpoon anchor. This will be shot into the surface at about 60 ms− 1 on touchdown, reaching a final depth of between a few centimetres and about 2. 5 m, depending on the hardness of the ground and the maximum available cable length. Early indications of the strength of the surface material and any distinct layers should prove valuable to subsequent depth-sensitive investigations, including the MUPUS thermal probe, seismic sounding experiments, the sampling drill and composition analyses of the extracted material. Interpretation of the ANC-M data will help to constrain models of the formation and evolution of the material found at the landing site and document the mechanical and structural context of nearby sampled material. We report on the results of recent test shots performed with a prototype anchor into several porous materials: two types of glass foam, H 2 O ice and CO 2 ice. With the help of data from direct shear tests and quasi-static penetration tests, we interpret the processed deceleration data using a cavity-expansion penetration model. Layers of distinctly different strengths can be detected and located, and the deceleration profiles are in reasonable agreement with the profiles obtained by quasi-static tests. The anchor projectile's long sharp tip tends to smear out the boundaries, however. In applying the penetration model we found that the coefficient of sliding friction and the target's volumetric strain have a much stronger influence on the deceleration profile than the initial target density and angle of internal friction. Very small values of volumetric strain (corresponding to high ‘drag coefficient’) were required to fit deceleration profiles to the measured data for the glass foam, contrary to what we initially expected by inspecting the thin layer of crushed material around the walls of the penetrated channel. We interpret this to mean that such brittle, porous materials as the glass foam (and perhaps highly porous, brittle, cryogenic ice) do not exhibit plastic deformation before failing completely by the crushing of cell walls. The decelerating forces are thus thought to be dominated by momentum transfer to the crushed material and by the crushing strength of the cellular microstructure, rather than by the force required to deform the target plastically. The cavity-expansion model seems to be well-suited to the ice shots, but for the brittle, <b>cellular</b> <b>glass</b> foam, alternative approaches, taking into account the material's microstructure, are needed. As a first step in this direction, a microstructural model linking textural properties of the material (pore and grain size, and relative contact area between grains) is applied to the glass foam data, obtained from quasi-static penetration tests and from direct shear strength tests. It is demonstrated that the dependence of strength on porosity can be well represented by the model suggested. A microstructural model for sintered ices, relating strength properties to porosity and thermal properties, would be useful for interpretation of MUPUS ANC-M data in the context of other physical properties measurements. The work presented here may also have some relevance to the design of future comet landers or penetrators. The harpoon anchor/penetrometer approach could be employed on other minor body landing missions, while the modelling technique is similar in many ways to that appropriate for other penetrometers/penetrators. ...|$|E
