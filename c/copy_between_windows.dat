The results of study show that the brick masonry wall <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> occurred flexural failure. With the increase of pressure, the ductility of Brick masonry wall <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> will be decreased. But the yield load, maximum bearing capacity and limit bearing capacity is improved obviously. When compared 0. 3 MPa,the maximum bearing capacity under 0. 4 MPa, 0. 5 MPa, 0. 6 MPa increased by 8. 3 %, 16. 4 % and 23. 9 %. The seismic performance was improved.

40|$|Abstract. To {{research}} the seismic performance and failure mode of longitudinal independent brick masonry wall between or not <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> with setting central reinforced concrete constructional columns under the lateral function and vertical load, this paper used ABAQUS {{finite element analysis}} software to model the walls between or not <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> and be in stress analysis, obtaining the reaction force- displacement curve of loading location and the maximum horizontal displacement {{at the top of}} wall. Calculate and compare the shear strength and flexural capacity of walls. The results show that the brick masonry wall <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> with central constructional columns occurred shear failure, but the wall without windows occurred flexural failure. And compared with the wall <b>between</b> <b>windows,</b> the ductility increased, the shear capacity reduced and the seismic performance improved. Propose that can set up a isolated seam between the windowsill wall and longitudinal wall invented by Zhang Wenfang etc., and turn window wall to wall without windows to improve the seismic behavior of wall <b>between</b> <b>windows...</b>|$|R
