40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 90 -year-old patient with {{intractable}} posterior epistaxis presenting as the only symptom of a nontraumatic low-flow <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula.</b> Purpose of this case report is to introduce low-flow <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> in the differential diagnosis of intractable posterior epistaxis. We provide a literature review for the sequence of actions for the confrontation of posterior epistaxis. We also emphasize the significance of the radiological diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the management of posterior epistaxis due to pathology of the cavernous sinus. The gold-standard diagnostic procedure of <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> is digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA with coils is also the state-of-the-art therapy. By failure of DSA, neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be used as alternatives. SRS may also be used as enhancement procedure of the DSA.

40|$|Although {{elevated}} {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) resulting from increased episcleral venous pressure {{is common in}} patients with dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistulas</b> (DCFs), neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is rare. A 42 -year-old woman with ocular congestive symptoms, including high IOP in her right eye, was diagnosed with right DCF with carotid angiography. Although the symptoms resolved after gamma knife radiosurgery was performed to treat the DCF, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) occurred 5 weeks later. Color Doppler ultrasonography indicated the absence of blood flow in the superior ophthalmic vein. This was unlike the retrograde pulsatile blood flow observed with Doppler ultrasonography before the gamma knife radiosurgery. The subsequent development of NVG was treated {{with a combination of}} peripheral retinal cryotherapy and diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. This is the first reported case of CRVO and NVG as complications of DCF after an uneventful gamma knife radiosurgery in a relatively young woman free of systemic cardiovascular or hematologic disorders.

40|$|Background. Dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistulas</b> (CCF) are {{communications}} fed by meningeal {{branches of}} the intracavernous internal carotid artery (ACI) or/and external carotid artery (ACE). In contrast to typical CCF, the arteriovenous shunting of blood is usually low flow and low pressure. Spontaneous dural CCF are more common in postmenopausal women. Aetiology is unknown, but congenital malformation or rupture of thin-walled dural arteries within venous sinuses {{is believed to be}} the cause. Case reports. 3 cases lacking the typical clinical signs of CCF who had been treated as chronic conjunctivitis, myositis of the extraocular muscle and orbital pseudotumour are presented. Clinical presentation depends on the direction and magnitude of fistular flow and on the anatomy of the collateral branches. If increased blood flow is directed anteriorly in ophthalmic veins the signs of orbito-ocular congestion are present (»redeyed shunt syndrome«). Drainage primarly in the inferior petrosal sinus may cause painful oculomotor and abducens palsies without signs of ocular congestion (»white-eyed shunt syndrome«). Also different therapeutic approaches as well as possible complications are described. Conclusions. For definite diagnosis angiography is obligatory and is also therapeutic as one third to one half of dural CCF close spontaneously. Because of potential severe eye and systemic complications, surgical intervention is indicated only in cases with uncontrolled secondary glaucoma and hypoxic retinopathy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{spontaneous}} direct carotid-cavernous fistula causing abrupt loss of vision. Case Report: A 50 -year-old woman with systemic hypertension but no history of ocular disease developed sudden proptosis, frozen eye, subconjunctival hemorrhage and loss of vision in her left eye over 2 hours. Imaging studies revealed a direct carotid-cavernous fistula. Management for high intraocular pressure was promptly initiated and the patient was referred to a neurosurgery service, but she refused any surgical intervention. Ultimately, she accepted to undergo manual carotid artery compression which resulted in significant reduction in the proptosis, but she lost all vision permanently. Conclusion: Direct carotid-cavernous fistula can occur spontaneously and {{should be taken into}} account in patients with signs suggestive of direct <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> even without history of trauma or connective tissue disorder...|$|E
40|$|The {{aetiology}} of ophthalmoplegia in 15 {{patients with}} <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> is discussed, and the clinical findings are correlated with angiographic and orbital CT appearances. After {{closure of the}} fistula the majority of patients with generalised ophthalmoplegia recovered full ocular movements rapidly, while patients with an isolated abduction weakness required much longer to return to normal. Orbital CT studies showed enlarged extraocular muscles in the patients with generalised ophthalmoplegia but muscles of normal size in those with abduction failure alone. After closure of the fistula repeat CT studies of patients with enlarged extraocular muscles showed a diminution in muscle size. We suggest that generalised ophthalmoplegia in carotid cavernous sinus fistula is due to hypoxic, congested extraocular muscles. Isolated abduction weakness {{is due to a}} sixth nerve palsy, which probably occurs either in the cavernous sinus or more posteriorly near the inferior petrosal sinus. A combination of these 2 mechanisms may be found in some patients...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{define the}} normal and variant venous anatomy {{in the human}} orbit. METHODS. Orbital dissections, {{focusing}} on the venous system, were performed on 17 formalin-preserved human cadavers (34 orbits) and two fresh orbits. Dissections were carefully documented photographically. Results were compared with those in previous reports on the venous anatomy of the orbit. RESULTS. The superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) is the most consistent vein within the superior orbit. The inferior ophthalmic vein (IOV) demonstrated more variation, but important variations were noted in both. Smaller veins demonstrated the largest variability. Several formerly published observations on the venous anatomy of the orbit could not be confirmed in this study. A previously unreported variation in the SOV was found in 9 of 36 orbits, with the SOV having a duplicated segment, {{which is likely to}} be a variant medial ophthalmic vein. CONCLUSIONS. The venous anatomy of the orbit demonstrates considerable variability. Some of these variations may have implications in surgical management and natural history of ophthalmic conditions, such as <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> (CCSF). link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{retrospectively}} study {{clinical features}} and diagnostic imaging of vasculogeneic pulsatile tinnitus, and the feasibility {{and efficacy of}} transvascular interventional treatment for this condition. MethodsData from 82 cases of arterial or venous pulsatile tinnitus were reviewed. DSA characteristics and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of pulsatile tinnitus in these cases were studied. Diagnoses in this group included intracranial arterovenous fistula (AVF) (n= 3), spontaneous skull base dural AVF (n= 16), traumatic <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> (n= 5), subclavian artery stenosis (n= 2), internal carotid artery stenosis (n= 3), intracranial arterial stenosis (n= 1), kinked and/or elongated vertebrobasilar artery (n= 2), venous sinus diverticulum (n= 2), venous sinus stenosis on the dominant drainage side (n= 46) and occipital sinus stenosis (n= 2). Treatments included embolization and stenting using coils, NBCA glue, Balt balloons, self-expansion stents and intracranial micro-stents via either the femoral artery or femoral vein. ResultsProcedures were successful in all cases with no surgery-related complications. Tinnitus disappeared within 2 days after the procedure in all cases. Follow up duration was 5 - 36 months. Recurrence occurred in 4 cases of arterial tinnitus within 3 months following the initial procedure, which improved after revision embolization or symptom management. There was no recurrence in venous tinnitus cases following stent plastic or stent-coiling embolization treatments.

40|$|Treatment of {{intracranial}} arterial aneurysms by interventional neurovascular tech-niques is {{now being}} performed in selected cases. From a transfemoral approach, under local anesthesia, a detachable silicone microballoon can be guided through the intracra-nial circulation, directed into the aneurysm, inflated with a polymerizing agent for solidification, and detached. The goal is to exclude the aneurysm from the circulation and preserve flow through the parent artery. Since 1984, 84 patients have been treated by this technique. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 15 to 83 years (mean age, 48) and included 63 females and 21 males. The distribution of aneurysms included 59 in the anterior circulation and 25 in the posterior circulation. The presenting symptom or cause was mass effect in 45 patients (53. 6 %), subarachnoid hemorrhage in 31 patients (36. 9 %), <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> resulting from rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm in six cases (7. 1 %), trauma in one case, and transient cerebral ischemia due to emboli in one case.

Clinical and radiologic follow-ups were performed 1, 3, and 12 months after treatment; duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 68 months (mean, 35. 5 months). In 65 cases (77. 4 %) there was evidence of complete aneurysmal occlusion, and in 19 cases 922. 6 %) there was subtotal occlusion greater than 85 %. lnterventional techniques for treatment of intracranial aneurysms may be useful as a therapeutic alternative in those patients not amenable to standard surgical therapy...|$|E
40|$|Pur po se: To present 3 {{patients}} who had a dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>sinus</b> <b>fistula</b> (CCF) and underwent cavernous sinus embolization through superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) approach. Ma te ri al and Met hod: Medical records of 3 patients with dural CCF who were treated through SOV approach were reviewed. Patient’s age, gender, ophthalmic and radiological findings, treatment results, postoperative complications and follow-up time were recorded. Surgical procedure was performed in the interventional radiology unit and using general anesthesia. Through an eyelid crease incision, the SOV was reached and cannulated. The cavernous sinus was embolized with metalic coils advanced through a microcatheter placed into this cannula. Re sults: All 3 patients (3 female, patient ages: 41, 68 and 71 years) had Barrow type D CCF. One patient had a bilateral CCF. All patients {{had a history of}} unsuccessful treatment with interventional transvenous routes. The embolization procedure via the SOV was successfully completed in 2 patients. In a patient with bilateral CCF, the SOV was thin and tortuous, and could not be cannulated. All ophthalmic symptoms were improved in 2 patients with a successful embolization, and did not recur during the follow-up periods of 24 and 22 months. In one of these, an ischemic cerebrovascular event and orbital hematoma developed after the embolization. These complications improved without leaving a permanent impairment. Dis cus si on: Cavernous sinus embolization can be performed through SOV approach, when it can not be done via the interventional transvenous routes.
