So far, no detailed side-by-side comparison of VLPs and <b>capsomeres</b> has been performed. In the present study, we immunized mice with insect cell-derived human papillomavirus type 16 VLPs and <b>capsomeres.</b> VLPs induced consistently higher antibody titers than <b>capsomeres</b> but the two forms induced similar CD 8 T-cell responses after subcutaneous, intranasal, and oral immunization, and at least 20 to 40 times more L 1 in the form of <b>capsomeres</b> than in the form of VLPs was needed to achieve comparable antibody responses. These results were confirmed by DNA immunization. The lower immunogenicity of <b>capsomeres</b> was independent of the isotype switch, as it was also observed for the early immunoglobulin M responses. Although there were differences in the display of surface epitopes between the L 1 particles, these did not contribute significantly to the differences in the immune responses. <b>capsomeres</b> were less immunogenic than VLPs in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) -deficient mice, suggesting that the lower immunogenicity is not due to a failure of <b>capsomeres</b> to trigger TLR 4. We observed better correlation between antibody results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and neutralization assays for sera from VLP-immunized mice than for sera from capsomere-immunized mice, suggesting qualitative differences between VLPs and <b>capsomeres.</b> We also showed that the lower immunogenicity of <b>capsomeres</b> could be compensated by the use of an adjuvant system containing MPL. Taken together, these results suggest that, presumably because of the lower degree of complexity of the antigen organization, <b>capsomeres</b> are significantly less immunogenic than VLPs with respect to the humoral immune response and that this characteristic should be considered in the design of putative capsomere-based prophylactic vaccines...|$|R

We have identified the karyopherin family of nuclear import factors as possible “chaperones” in preventing the cytoplasmic assembly of papovavirus <b>capsomeres.</b> Recombinant murine polyomavirus (mPy) VP 1 and human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV 11) L 1 <b>capsomeres</b> bound the karyopherin heterodimer α 2 β 1 in vitro in a nuclear localization signal (NLS) -dependent manner.

In the present study, all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method are utilized to examine the molecular interactions in the <b>capsomere</b> of a murine polyomavirus (MPV) VLP.

40|$|Effective {{control of}} {{infectious}} diseases relies on new vaccine technologies that can quicken and broaden vaccine delivery. Novel modular virus-like particle (VLP) and <b>capsomere</b> technologies have been recently reported. These technologies utilize murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) VLPs and capsomeres as potent delivery systems to carry and display antigenic modules consisting of heterologous peptides, {{in the form of}} modular constructs capable of inducing high levels of specific antibodies against bacterial or viral antigens. These constructs are prepared using high-yield microbial synthesis, potentially enabling low-cost, rapid and scalable manufacture of new vaccines. To evaluate this potential, this study analyzes the economics of <b>capsomere</b> and VLP production using process simulation. Data here show that the unit production cost (UPC) for <b>capsomere</b> is up to 69 % lower than that for VLP at the comparison scale (500. L fermentor), due to a simpler downstream process and a higher product yield. For VLP production, reactive diafiltration assembly was shown to have a UPC 30 % lower than dilution assembly. Sensitivity analysis of uncertain process inputs with Monte Carlo simulations revealed a significant influence of final biomass concentration on UPC, contributing up to 50 % of variance observed in the UPC probability distribution. Despite such process variability, optimized <b>capsomere</b> or VLP vaccine production, using a 500 -L or 1500 -L fermentor respectively, has more than 80 % chance of producing vaccine at a cost less than 1 cent per dose based on a conservative assumption of 50. μg protein per vaccine dose. With a 10 -kL fermentor, both the <b>capsomere</b> and VLP processes have productivity that could allow manufacture of 320 million vaccine doses in 2. 3 and 4. 7 days, respectively.

It was recently reported that <b>capsomeres</b> are much less immunogenic than VLPs. Numerous modifications of the L 1 protein leading {{to the formation of}} <b>capsomeres</b> but preventing capsid assembly have been described, such as the replacement of the cysteine residues that form capsid-stabilizing disulfide bonds or the deletion of helix 4. So far, the influence of these modifications on immunogenicity has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we describe the purification of eight different HPV- 16 L 1 proteins as <b>capsomeres</b> from Escherichia coli. We compared them for yield, structure, and immunogenicity in mice. All L 1 proteins formed almost identical pentameric structures yet differed strongly in their immunogenicity, especially regarding the humoral immune responses. Immunization of TLR 4 −/− mice and DNA immunization by the same constructs confirmed that immunogenicity was independent of different degrees of contamination with copurifying immune-stimulatory molecules from E. coli. We hypothesize that immunogenicity correlates with the intrinsic ability of the <b>capsomeres</b> to assemble into larger particles, as only assembly-competent L 1 proteins induced high antibody responses. One of the proteins (L 1 ΔN 10) proved to be the most immunogenic, inducing antibody titers equivalent to those generated in response to VLPs.

However, existing vaccine technologies cannot respond to a new virus outbreak rapidly and at a cost and scale that is commercially viable for poultry vaccination. Here, we developed modular <b>capsomere,</b> subunits of virus-like particle, as a low-cost poultry influenza vaccine.

The capsid patterns {{presented by the}} <b>capsomere</b> shapes, positions, and orientations of three viruses (papilloma, SV 40, and N beta V) have been generated dynamically through a bottom-up procedure which provides a basis for understanding the patterns. A <b>capsomere</b> shape is represented in two-dimensional cross-section by a mass or charge density {{on the surface of}} a sphere, given by an expansion in spherical harmonics, and referred to herein as a morphological unit (MU). A capsid pattern is represented by an icosahedrally symmetrical superposition of such densities, determined by the positions and orientations of its MUs on the spherical surface. The fitness of an arrangement of MUs is measured by an interaction integral through which all capsid elements interact with each other via an arbitrary function of distance. A capsid pattern is generated by allowing the correct number of approximately shaped MUs to move dynamically on the sphere, positioning themselves until an extremum of the fitness function is attained. The resulting patterns are largely independent of the details of both the <b>capsomere</b> representation and the interaction function; thus the patterns produced are generic. The simplest useful fitness function is sigma 2, the average square of the mass (or charge) density, a minimum of which corresponds to a "uniformly spaced" MU distribution; to good approximation, the electrostatic free energy of charged capsomeres, calculated from the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, is proportional to sigma 2. With disks as MUs, the model generates the coordinated lattices familiar from the quasi-equivalence theory, indexed by triangulation numbers. Using fivefold MUs, the model generates the patterns observed at different radii within the T = 7 capsid of papilloma and at the surface of SV 40; threefold MUs give the T = 4 pattern of Nudaurelia capensis beta virus. In all cases examined so far, the MU orientations are correctly found...|$|E

First, the antigenic peptides, when delivered by unadjuvanted modular VLPs or adjuvanted capsomeres, induced high titers of peptide-specific IgG antibodies (over 1 ?׿ 104). Second, delivery by <b>capsomere</b> was superior to VLP for one of the peptides investigated (GAS 3), demonstrating that the delivery system relative effectiveness was antigen-dependant. Third, significant cross-reactivity of GAS 2 -induced IgG with GAS 1 was observed using either VLP or <b>capsomere,</b> showing the possibility of broad-coverage vaccine design using these delivery systems and cross-reactive antigens.

We have determined conditions for the quantitative disassembly of purified HPV- 11 L 1 VLPs {{to the level of}} <b>capsomeres,</b> demonstrating that disulfide bonds alone are essential to maintaining long-term HPV- 11 L 1 VLP structure at physiological ionic strength. The ionic strength of the disassembly reaction was also important, as increased NaCl concentrations inhibited disassembly. Conversely, chelation of cations had no effect on disassembly. Quantitative reassembly to a homogeneous population of 55 -nm, 150 S VLPs was reliably achieved by the re-formation of disulfide linkages following removal of reducing agent at near-neutral pH and moderate NaCl concentration. HPV- 11 L 1 VLPs could also be dissociated by treatment with carbonate buffer at pH 9. 6, but VLPs could not be regenerated following carbonate treatment.

This approach of vaccine re-engineering in response to virus change is the cornerstone of the current influenza control system, based on annual prediction and/or pandemic reaction. This system could become more responsive, and perhaps preventative, if its speed could be improved. Here, we demonstrate vaccine efficacy of a rapidly manufacturable modular <b>capsomere</b> presenting the broadly cross-protecting M 2 e epitope from influenza.

Unadjuvanted pCapM 2 e containing 80 EU of endotoxin per dose was inferior to highly purified and adjuvanted cCapM 2 e (2 EU per dose). However, addition of adjuvant to pCapM 2 e resulting in high immunogenicity after only a single dose of vaccination, yet without any local adverse reaction. This finding suggests a strong synergy between adjuvant, antigen and contaminants, and the possible existence of a "Goldilocks" level of contaminants, where high immunogenicity and low reactogenicity can be obtained in a single-shot vaccination.

40|$|Faster {{and cheaper}} vaccine {{manufacture}} based on modern technologies is increasingly needed to effectively mitigate {{the burden of}} disease caused by highly contagious and mutagenic pathogens, such as influenza viruses. This study describes an approach to synthetically engineer a new influenza vaccine system by antigenic modularization of a carrier viral <b>capsomere,</b> coupled with microbial processing of the sub-unit vaccine. This approach leads to a system optimized with respect to both biological and process criteria. Murine polyomavirus VP 1 protein, which self assembles into a pentameric sub-unit <b>capsomere</b> of a virus-like particle (VLP), was engineered to inhibit VLP assembly and to allow modular insertion of influenza M 2 e antigen at multiple sites within the protein. The yield, solubility, and immunogenicity of the resulting modular capsomeres could be optimized by varying the module insertion site {{and the number of}} M 2 e modules per site. This study demonstrated, for the first time, an innovative strategy of inserting multiple antigenic modules, up to 45 M 2 e modules, in a single <b>capsomere.</b> Modularization of M 2 e antigen was shown to improve its immunogenicity by more than an order of magnitude over that attained by immunization with an equivalent mass of non-modularized M 2 e peptide. Vaccination of mice using modular capsomeres induced high antigen-specific antibody levels suggestive of protective efficacy. This modular vaccine design approach, inspired by synthetic biology approaches to new system development, is conducive to technologies rapidly adaptable to pathogenic variations...|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{demonstrate}} that interaction of human papillomavirus-like particles (HPV-VLPs) with the putative glucosaminoglycan binding receptor is strictly dependent on conformational integrity. Such conformations are present on VLPs and <b>capsomeres</b> {{but not on}} monomers of the major capsid protein, L 1, confirming reports that <b>capsomeres</b> can induce virus-neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we show the suitability of this specific interaction for development of VLP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), using heparin for indirect coupling of VLPs to microtiter plates, which may add an intrinsic quality control. This avoids presentation of linear, often highly cross-reactive epitopes of L 1. In addition, heparin specifically interacts {{with a wide variety}} of HPV types, making it a prime candidate for a universal capture molecule...|$|R
