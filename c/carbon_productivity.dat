This paper studies the level of low carbon development of China's eight major industries and uses Laspeyres index decomposition method to analysis the characteristics of China's <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> change and the sources of industry structure from 2003 to 2011. Research results reveal that the structure factors hindered the growth of China's <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity,</b> and <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> growth mainly comes from the industry production efficiency; agriculture and manufacturing have inhibitory effect on <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> in the structure factors, while in the efficiency factors they have strong promoting impaction; other services in the structure factors play stronger roles in promoting <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> growth...|$|E

In this research, a two-step procedure {{has been applied to}} investigate <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity,</b> which is deemed an appropriate indicator to measure sustainable development in conjunction with carbon reduction and production advancement. A decomposition method with the Log Mean Divisia Index has been applied to explore the factors influencing <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> change, including technological innovation and regional adjustment. The <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> of the Australian construction industry from 1990 to 2012 was then investigated. Research results indicate that <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> in Australian construction had increased significantly and could be further improved. Technological innovation has {{played an important role in}} promoting <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity,</b> while regional adjustment has remained roughly steady. Based on correlation analyses, scale of the construction market and stock of machinery and equipment had shown weak correlations with <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> changes, and it was clear that improvement in <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> could benefit capital productivity and investment return. The research has systematically defined <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> and for the first time measured it for the construction industry.

40|$|The {{following}} report investigates {{relationships between}} labour and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>productivity</b> in the Swedish manufacturing industry 1914 - 1995. Furthermore, relationships between changing energy relative prices {{and carbon dioxide}} emissions are studied. Main conclusions are that improved labour and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>productivity</b> was evident during the post 1973 period, while the results are more ambiguous during the 1950 to 1973 period. During the period 1913 to 1950 the relationship was probably negative. For the whole investigated period there are evidence that carbon dioxide emissions are negatively correlated with oil prices. The relationship was however not stable over each sub-period. An overall interpretation of the results is that carbon dioxide emissions and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>productivity</b> historically {{have been affected by}} other factors apart from relative price changes.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the main influencing factors of China’s industrial <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> by incorporating environmental regulation and technical progress into an econometric model. The paper focuses on data from 35 of China’s industrial sectors and covers the period from 2006 to 2014, {{in order to examine}} the impact of environmental regulation and technical progress on <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity.</b> Methods applied include panel fixed effect model, panel random effect model and two stage least squares with instrumental variables (IV- 2 SLS). The effect of environmental regulation and technical progress has industrial heterogeneity. The paper subdivides industrial sectors into capital and technology intensive, resource intensive and labor intensive sectors according to factor intensiveness. The estimation results of the subgroups have uncovered that for capital and technology intensive and resource intensive sectors, environmental regulation has a more significant impact than technical progress; while for labor intensive sectors, innovation more significantly influences <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity.</b> In addition, foreign direct investment (FDI) and industrialization level facilitate improving <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> for the full sample. By contrast, industrial structure inhibits the overall industrial <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity.</b> The industry-specific results indicate that for capital and technology intensive sectors, optimizing of the industrial structure can improve carbon productivity; for resource intensive sectors, FDI and energy consumption structure should be emphasized more; for labor intensive sectors, industrialization levels help enhance <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity.</b> Finally the industrial sector-specific policy suggestions are proposed...|$|E

40|$|While public {{awareness}} of environmental sustainability is growing, there is concern about the economic costs of shifting to a greener economy. In the case of climate change, a critical issue is the relationship of economic output to greenhouse gas emissions, which has been labeled <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity.</b> Increasing <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> means that economic growth can be sustained while emissions are reduced.

This is achieved by incorporating endogenous investment in <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> into the RICE- 99 integrated assessment model of Nordhaus and Boyer (2000). Simulation analysis of various emission reduction scenarios with several restrictions on emissions trading reveals a pronounced dichotomy of effects across regions: Restrictions to trading raise the investments in <b>carbon</b> <b>productivity</b> in permit demanding regions while reducing them in permit supplying regions. In terms of per capita consumption, permit demanding regions lose and permit supplying regions gain from restrictions. In scenarios that involve 'hot air', restrictions to trade lower overall emissions which results in reduced climate damage for most regions.

Live weight yields from annual pasture emit more GHG emissions than do N fertilised and non-N fertilised perennial pastures.
