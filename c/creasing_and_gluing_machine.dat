A case conversion process has been investigated {{with a view to}} understanding and ultimately improving the case quality. In particular, fishtailing, or the squareness of case, has been studied in relation to <b>creasing,</b> folding <b>and</b> <b>gluing.</b> The process has been optimized in terms of fishtailing on the individual panels. Uni-directional fishtailing results have been attributed to the existing method of folding. To this end, the folding mechanism has been studied and two innovations, generic to any continuous folding operations, have been suggested: the coil cam and the twin cam. [Continues. ...|$|R

Based on this divide, chairs were classified into six categories. Based on previous research, strength of joints have been influenced by <b>gluing</b> surface, <b>machining</b> quality, type of fit, species and humidity of wood material, <b>glue</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>gluing</b> parameters.

50|$|Stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> {{has become}} one of the {{dominant}} techniques in amateur boatbuilding. While the use of relatively few plywood panels (which minimizes the joints and makes the construction easier and faster) limits the shapes possible, the simplicity and low cost of the stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> technique makes it the method of choice among most amateur boatbuilders. Simple software CAD packages are available for designing stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> boats, <b>and</b> there are many Internet bulletin boards, newsgroups, and mailing lists dedicated to the subject of stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> boats <b>and</b> various popular stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> designs. Stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> is not inherently limited to small designs though, as demonstrated by the boats made by Sam Devlin, who has applied the technique to making boats as long as 65 feet.|$|R

40|$|<b>Creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding {{are vital}} {{processes}} in manufacturing of liquid and cartonboard packages. The {{quality of the}} <b>crease</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent folding is essential for good runnability and aesthetic appearance. The out-of-plane mechanical properties of cartonboard are particularly import in these processes. In this paper, recent advances in analysis of <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding, using numerical simulations {{by means of the}} finite element method and the through-thickness shear strength profile of cartonboard, are presented. Existing methods to determine the out-of-plane shear strength of paper materials only give the strength in the weakest layer. In order to capture the through-thickness variation in shear strength the laminated notched shear test was introduced. In the simulations, the cartonboard was represented by a combination of continuum and cohesive models in order to capture the bulk and delamination properties, respectively. The continuum model was calibrated for each ply by testing individual plies that were isolated by grinding, and the cohesive model was calibrated using shear strength data from laminated notched shear tests. Results from the simulations are compared with <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding experiments and the agreement is excellent considering the relative simplicity of the analysis. Finally, practical implications for trouble-shooting <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding problems will be discussed. QC 2012060...|$|R
40|$|The <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding {{behavior}} of three paperboards {{have been studied}} both experimentally <b>and</b> numerically. <b>Creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding studies were performed on strips in both the machine direction and the cross machine direction. A finite element model that mimicked the experimental <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding setup was developed, <b>and</b> the <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding behavior could be well predicted for all three paperboards. An experimental characterization scheme consisting of three experiments was proposed, and was shown to be sufficient to predict the <b>creasing</b> <b>and</b> folding behavior. For the whole paperboard the shear strength profiles in the through thickness direction was determined with the notched shear test. Each ply was laid free by grinding, and density measurements and in-plane tension tests were performed on the bottom, middle and top plies of each paperboard. Instead of assuming uniform properties in each ply, the shear strength profiles were used to map the measured properties in the through thickness direction. Numerical simulations were performed when the ply and interface properties of the paperboards were altered to follow different shear strength profiles. This was done in order to mimic different production strategies. It was shown that the interface strengths mainly influenced the folding behavior. Whereas altered the ply properties affected the creasing force needed. QC 20130815 </p...|$|R
