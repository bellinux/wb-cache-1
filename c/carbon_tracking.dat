5000|$|Main {{international}} organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank, {{have begun to}} develop programs aimed at curbing deforestation. The blanket term Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) describes these sorts of programs, which use direct monetary or other incentives to encourage developing countries to limit and/or roll back deforestation. Funding has been an issue, but at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010-2012. Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote forest monitoring using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the Center for Global Development's FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) initiative [...] and the Group on Earth Observations' Forest <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> Portal. Methodological guidance for forest monitoring was also emphasized at COP-15. The environmental organization Avoided Deforestation Partners leads the campaign for development of REDD through funding from the U.S. government. In 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and partners launched Open Foris - a set of open-source software tools that assist countries in gathering, producing and disseminating information {{on the state of}} forest resources. The tools support the inventory lifecycle, from needs assessment, design, planning, field data collection and management, estimation analysis, and dissemination. Remote sensing image processing tools are included, as well as tools for international reporting for Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and MRV and FAO's Global Forest Resource Assessments.|$|E

The objective is to explore the scope of reducing the energy for utilities and CO 2 emissions. Thermodynamic analysis is carried out using the column targeting tool (CTT) to address the sustainability metrics of ‘Energy Intensity. ’ CTT {{is based on the}} ‘Practical Near-Minimum Thermodynamic Condition’ representing a close to practical reversible column operation. Environmental impact metrics are estimated from the <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> options. The <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> are estimated by the CO 2 emission data source of US-EPA-Rule-E 9 - 5711 using natural gas as the primary fuel. The results show that the total reductions in energy loss and the total hot and cold utility are around 44 and 10 %, respectively; the total reductions in carbon dioxide are around 14 %. These improvements lead to considerable reductions in the operating costs. Thermodynamic analysis helps estimating and improving the energy and environmental sustainability metrics and hence can lead to a more sustainable separation by distillation columns.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} {{documents}} {{the use of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> to localize parathyroid adenomas in three patients with persistent or recurrent parathyroid disease. METHODS: Three patients requiring second or third operations for hyperparathyroidism were operated upon after the parathyroid lesion had been localized preoperatively using a suspension of carbon particles in water. The enlarged parathyroid glands were identified by using {{one or more of}} the following: computed axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound or Sestamibi nuclear scan. The lesion was then localized with ultrasound or computed axial tomography and a carbon track was inserted from the lesion to the skin, leaving a small skin tattoo as a marker for the surgeon. Each patient underwent a minimally invasive parathyroid operation. RESULTS: For each of the three patients the recurrent or persistent parathyroid adenoma was successfully identified and removed via a small incision. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive techniques for primary hyperparathyroidism are changing our approach to parathyroid surgery. However, a minimally invasive technique is less applicable when the disease is persistent or recurrent. Although, when the recurrent or persistent parathyroid adenoma can be identified, localization and <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> have proved useful in allowing the surgeon to remove the lesion via a minimally invasive technique.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> is a {{phenomenon}} where an electric field across a normally insulating plastic can, {{in the presence of}} contamination, grow into an electrical short and cause a fire. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) has long had a <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> test (UL 746 A, Section 23) for exposure to Alternating Current (AC), and have developed an index to classify materials as to their resistance to this phenomenon. Recently, the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and MVFRI sponsored research at UL to develop such a test for Direct Current (DC) voltages which may be used in 42 -volt (and higher) electrical systems for automobiles. For the DC test, we changed the electrodes to copper and we switched the electrolyte (used to simulate surface contamination – also sometimes called “reagent”) from 0. 1 % Ammonium Chloride to 5 % Sodium Chloride. The latter is representative of road salt and has a much higher electrical conductivity than Ammonium Chloride. Drops of a specified volume of electrolyte are applied to the plastic sample between the electrodes. A drop is made to fall approximately every 30 seconds, and if a sample survives 50 drops or more it is said to “pass ” the test. The highest voltage that will result in 50 drops for a given material is the “Index ” for that material...|$|E

The results of this analysis show that the total ECF emission intensity increases when an individual’s consumption is higher than 10000 yuan (which is the turning point). This implies that emission intensity increases with a luxury lifestyle whereas it is lower for lower-income households.

This allows visualisation of the full length of the needle and allows identification of the position of the needle tip. If the needle is introduced at right angles to the probe axis, the needle is visualised only in part, and it is not possible to identify the needle tip with certainty.

The use of traditional teaching methods frequently leaves students seemly unable to grasp these more difficult concepts due to gaps in their basic understanding of how 3 D molecules interact in the environment.

In metabolism, activities focused on basic molecular rearrangement and <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> in the central metabolic pathways.

40|$|International audienceWhen a same {{quantity}} of energy is transfered to a biological medium, strong {{difference in the}} effects can be observed, if this energy is transfered by high or low-LET (Linear Energy Transfer) particles. This difference is mainly due to the track structure geometry and to the more substantial density of energy deposit {{in the case of}} high LET particles. This leads to complex DNA damages, much more difficult to repair by the cell. Therfore, a spatial distribution of energy seems more relevant to characterize the energy deposits in the medium, for biological purposes. Lea's work on the formation of chromosome aberrations have led to the « Dual Radiation Action » theory. In this theory, Lea suggested that the final biological “lesions” were formed by the interaction of pair of “sublesions” issued from the initial energy transfer in the medium. Later on, Kellerer and Rossi[1] proposed a general formulation of this theory using the concept of proximity functions. In their formulation, Kellerer and Rossi expressed the average number of lesions as the integral of the product of two functions: the physical proximity function t(x) that characterizes the microdosimetric distribution of energy transfers in a medium, and the biological proximity function that characterizes the biological system (cell). In this work we calculate the physical function t(x) for electron, proton and <b>carbon</b> <b>tracks</b> simulated in water with a low energy package of the Geant 4 Monte Carlo toolkit. This version of Geant 4 (Geant 4 DNA) includes specific physical processes for low energy protons and electrons. In addition, <b>carbon</b> <b>tracks</b> are calculated by scaling with Z²eff (carbon effective charge) the proton total cross section in water. The function t(x) is thus calculated for electron tracks of 125 eV, 1 KeV and 10 KeV, and compared to Chen and Kellerer [2] results. The function t(x) is also calculated for 0. 5, 5 and 20 MeV protons and for 5 and 20 MeV/n carbons. The characteristics of this function are then analysed and discussed. Finally, the variation of the dose mean lineal energy {{depending on the size of}} the sensitive site is deduced from t(x) ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{frequently}} {{cured of}} Hodgkin lymphoma, {{adolescents and young}} adults can develop radiation induced second cancers. These patients could potentially benefit from scanned ion radiotherapy yet likely would require motion mitigation strategies. In theory, four-dimensional (4 D) optimization of ion beam fields for individual motion states of respiration can enable superior sparing of healthy tissue near moving targets, compared to other motion mitigation strategies. Furthermore, carbon-ion therapy can sometimes provide greater relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for cell sterilization in a target but nearly equivalent RBE in tissue upstream of the target, compared to proton therapy. Thus, we expected that for some patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, carbon-ion therapy would reduce the predicted risk of second cancer incidence in the breast compared with proton therapy. The purpose of this work was to determine whether 4 D-optimized carbon-ion therapy would significantly reduce the predicted risk of radiation induced second cancers in the breast for female Hodgkin lymphoma patients while preserving tumor control compared with proton therapy. To achieve our goals, we first investigated whether 4 D-optimized <b>carbon</b> beam <b>tracking</b> could reduce dose to volumes outside a moving target compared with 3 D-optimized <b>carbon</b> beam <b>tracking</b> while preserving target dose coverage. To understand the reliability of scanned <b>carbon</b> beam <b>tracking,</b> we studied the robustness of dose distributions in thoracic targets to uncertainties in patient motion. Finally, we investigated whether using carbon-ion therapy instead of proton therapy would significantly reduce the predicted risk of second cancer in the breast for a sample of Hodgkin lymphoma patients. We found that 4 D-optimized ion beam tracking therapy can reduce the maximum dose to critical structures near a moving target by as much as 53 %, compared to 3 D-optimized ion beam tracking therapy. We validated these findings experimentally using a scanned carbon ion synchrotron and a motion phantom. We found scanned <b>carbon</b> beam <b>tracking</b> to be sensitive to a number of motion uncertainties, most notably phase delays in tracking, systematic spatial errors, and interfractional motion changes. Our findings indicate that a lower risk of second cancer in the breast might be expected for some Hodgkin lymphoma patients using carbon-ion therapy instead of proton therapy. For our reference scenario, we found the ratio of risk to be 0. 77 ± 0. 35 for radiogenic breast cancer after carbon-ion therapy versus proton therapy. Our findings were dependent on the RBE values for tumor induction and the radiosensitivity of breast tissue, as well as the physical dose distribution...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The Amazon Tropical Rain Forest is {{the largest}} {{tropical}} rain forest system, comprising approximately 65 % of such forests on earth. Since the 1960 's, human populations in the Brazilian Amazon have increased from two to over 20 million. Concomitant urbanization, forest conversion, and economic dependence on resource extraction have exerted severe demands on these fragile ecosystems. Its status as a global carbon source and sink and its unique biodiversity compels study of the Amazon and the dramatic changes sustained to optimize conservation strategies and ameliorate loss. While the overall effects of deforestation are well documented, {{little is known about}} the spatio-temporal interactions between forest dynamics and anthropogenic disturbance. As part of a collaborative NASA-Smithsonian Institute project, the present research focuses on the analysis and modeling of spatio-temporal forest dynamics in the Amazon across scales. The first analysis indicates that secondary forest tree species richness is significantly influenced by proximity to large forest tracts containing frugivorous fauna. These results underscore the necessity of conserving large tracts and the consideration of spatial design for adequate preservation of biodiversity. Methods developed in the second analysis demonstrate that while deforestation devastates biodiversity, secondary forests may contribute to the attenuation of greenhouse gas concentrations. However, this <b>carbon</b> <b>tracking</b> process is revealed to be more complex than previously assumed. Land tenure dynamics and heterogeneity preclude the use of simple static models. These results imply that modeling the world's largest rain forests effects on global greenhouse gas concentrations is highly uncertain and must be evaluated cautiously. The final analysis evaluates the diverse effects of specific large-scale development projects on forest integrity currently being planned. Riverside deforestation and road upgrades have the highest potential for effecting irreversible environmental damage. Protected forests and indigenous lands comprise 30 % of the Brazilian Legal Amazon and have the potential to prevent the degradation of 464, 151 km² of mature forest. However, political and economic pressures on indigenous peoples threaten to destabilize land tenure and land-use practices. Urgent efforts need to be directed to develop long-term and large-scale planning of Amazon land-use that takes such complexity into consideration...|$|E

The Initiative builds on the experience gained from the Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) and Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) projects [1], [2], in which SAR data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS- 1) were used to generate consistent image mosaics over the entire tropical and boreal zones of Earth. While the GRFM and GBFM projects were undertaken already in the mid 1990 s, they demonstrated the utility of L-band SAR data for mapping and monitoring forest and wetland areas {{and the importance of}} pro- viding spatially and temporally consistent satellite acquisitions for regional-scale monitoring and surveillance. The K&C Initiative was established by JAXA in 2001 to sup- port data and information needs of international environmental conventions, carbon cycle science and conservation of the envi- ronment (referred to as the " 3 C" application areas). The project is led by JAXA's Earth Observation Research Center (EORC) and supported by {{an international}} Science Team consisting of 25 research groups from 14 countries. The K&C Science Team is also a scientific advisory group to JAXA and provides scien- tific support and advice to the Ramsar Wetlands Convention and the Forest <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> Task of the Group on Earth Obser- vations (GEO). The objective of the K&C Initiative is {{to take advantage of the}} specific features of ALOS PALSAR and, in particular, the global systematic acquisition strategy that provides consistent and repetitive wall-to-wall coverages over all land areas [3], and to develop regional-scale applications and thematic products that can be used to meet the specific information requirements relating to the " 3 C" application areas.

40|$|The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) {{established}} the Forest <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> (FCT) task in 2008 to provide satellite-based observation support to countries wishing {{to establish a}} national system for forest carbon monitoring. The main goal of the GEO FCT task is to support countries on the path towards the establishment of national Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems. To have a full national accounting system supporting the REDD mechanism, reliable methods for estimation of changes in forest carbon emissions are needed. To reduce the possibility of leaking in such a system wall-to-wall coverage is desirable and methods to separate the anthropogenic caused changes from the natural ones must be in place. A set of general recommendations is defined within the task, like national wall-to-wall coverage with annual update at the spatial resolution of 25 - 30 meter. Based on the above recommendations two products, Forest/Non-Forest and Land-use type maps, are considered highest priority (Horizon- 1) {{with a set of}} more diverse and trend related Horizon- 2 products to come later. There is not a single method or kind of method that has been identified as the most effective across a wide range of environments and types of imagery, so to achieve consistency through space and time a set of guiding principles has been established. In general, automated analysis (computer-based) is preferable to visual interpretation of imagery and changes are more efficient monitored by comparing images as opposed to comparing maps derived from images. The mapping of forest information products, when possible, should be based on a time series of satellite observations. Optical images, with wealth of developed methods and historically rich data archive, especially the Landsat data series, constitutes a base source for the information products. However, due to the vulnerable of optical sensors to clouds, development of methods for efficient interoperable use of optical and SAR data is a goal for the task. If reporting should be based on emission reference levels the MRV-system must be able to measure a proxy such as above ground forest biomass with reliable confidence. This is a challenge with wide-area optical or SAR sensors. Valuable solutions have been extensive modeling of biomass changes trough time from a stack of images combined with ancillary data and growth functions and methods where disturbance can be identified by the change patterns that occur when a measure of forest cover is plotted as a trajectory through time. Such a trajectory approach {{can also be used to}} smooth the annual variations in biomass estimation caused by noise in the images and thereby produce a more stable and reliable estimate than possible from single date images. Even small biomass changes caused by degradation or forest regrowth has been successfully monitored with such approaches...|$|E

The Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI) aims to facilitate the supply and use of earth observation information, so that all countries can better manage their forest resources. Initially GFOI aims to support countries’ national forest monitoring systems in accordance with the IPCC Guidelines such as the systems needed to implement the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) programme on REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation; forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks). GFOI was set up by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and has the active support and involvement of 13 space agencies (and data providers). It has been explicitly endorsed by 90 countries plus the EU and 67 international organisations. GFOI engages and coordinates with key organisations and institutions such as the UNFCCC, FAO, World Bank and IPCC as well as developing country participants. GFOI developed from the GEO Forest <b>Carbon</b> <b>Tracking</b> project which successfully demonstrated its approach through selected national demonstrator countries and which started in 2008. GFOI has identified a list of thematic forest map product specifications (see next section) that can be derived from a combination of Earth Observation and ground measurement data, and that are needed for countries to measure and report their changes in carbon stocks in forests and the subsequent greenhouse emissions. A country may not need to use all of these products: their choice will depend on their national circumstances and the additional objectives they have. This review considers these products and for each determines what, if any, additional research and development may be needed before the products can be widely used and recommended for use in long term systematic forest monitoring. These R&D topics are then prioritised by both needs expressed by countries and by the IPCC ´s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory good practice requirements of transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability and accuracy, as endorsed by the UNFCCC. The need for forest information may extend beyond NFMS, MRV, and GHGI objectives. Indeed, the nine societal benefit areas of GEO need some type of information about the forests. Information about the status of forest resources is used in forestry operations, natural resource assessment, conservation and reserve planning and illegal logging detection systems. Similar forest map products may be useful for biodiversity initiatives such as GEOBON. The GEO Initiative provides a unique opportunity for coordination of data and information between different sectors. Global Initiatives such as GEO and GEOBON should consult on cross-cutting information needs and the possibility of generating a suite of forest map products that serve different purposes across sectors. The current report is the first step in the development of a comprehensive R&D Plan. This Plan will be further developed by the GFOI Office, based on inputs from demonstrator countries, interested organisations and relevant research expertise. Priority Research Topics will be presented to donors for funding...|$|E
5000|$|The ADSS {{cable is}} {{suspended}} in the electrical field due to the phase conductors; this varies from a maximum at mid-span to zero at the grounded metal supports of the cable. In dry conditions, no current flows on the jacket of the cable, but moisture reduces the jacket insulation. Uneven distribution of moisture can result in formation of high-resistance [...] "dry bands" [...] which have a relatively high voltage across them. Dry bands tend to form at the supports. Voltage across the dry band can cause <b>carbon</b> <b>tracks</b> to form and erosion of the jacket material. If the voltage across the dry band is high enough, an arc may form which can damage the jacket. Dry-band arcing is more likely for cables installed under higher transmission voltage lines (220 kV and above). Even a few incidents of arcing along a dry band can cause severe permanent damage to the jacket, leading to subsequent failure of the cable. Relatively low sustained arc currents of a few milliamperes can cause eventual aging degradation of the cable. The magnitude of current available in an arc (and probability of damage) depends on the geometry of the installation and is not simply correlated with the voltage of the transmission line. Wetting conditions near industrial plants or saltwater will have more severe effect on the jacket resistance than in freshwater rain or fog. While one measure to protect cables from dry-banding damage incorporates a semiconducting layer to equalize potential, a more feasible method uses externally applied protection within 50 metres of each support, since this is the area most susceptible to damage.|$|R
25|$|An {{in-depth}} review of 13 LCA studies {{of wood and}} paper products found a lack of consistency in the methods and assumptions used to <b>track</b> <b>carbon</b> during the product lifecycle. A wide variety of methods and assumptions were used, leading to different and potentially contrary conclusions – {{particularly with regard to}} carbon sequestration and methane generation in landfills and with carbon accounting during forest growth and product use.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} study the design and fabrication of <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>track</b> bicycle frames. A finite element software {{was used for the}} geometry development, laminate configuration, and for predicting failure using the maximum stress criteria. A load case and boundary conditions simulating actual riding conditions were developed. The stresses in each of the composite layers were found to be lower than the allowable stresses because of a properly designed geometry and laminate. Two composite frames were fabricated using the hand lay-up technique, using unidirectional and woven carbon fiber pre-preg material over an internal foam core. Using static testing techniques and comparisons with traditional tubular frames, the carbon fiber prototypes were shown to be better in all rigidity aspects. Combining the experimental and theoretical results, a good understanding of the critical problems related to composite monocoque bicycle frame design was obtained...|$|R

On January the 17th 2012 Transport Minister Norman Baker MP officially opened the Zero <b>Carbon</b> Futures Performance <b>Track</b> and Low Emission Vehicle Development Centre in Washington, Tyne & Wear. The Centre is designed to facilitate the development of the transport of the future providing the ideal location for anyone - academics, automotive manufacturers and system developers - to test and trial new transport technologies.|$|R

The usefulness of MU-hLCA is demonstrated through its application in modelling an economy-wide potential use of recycled construction materials in Australia. The proposed model merges physical and monetary units of industrial systems related to construction materials and their recycled substitute products in order to enable the calculations of embodied <b>carbon</b> and the <b>tracking</b> of material flows with improved accuracy. The {{results of this study}} will help inform decarbonisation strategies in the built environment sector.|$|R
