50|$|The 802.11 {{standards}} {{define a}} power-save mode for client devices. In power-save mode, a <b>client</b> <b>device</b> {{may choose to}} sleep for one or more beacon intervals waking for beacon frames that include DTIMs. When the DTIM period is 2, a <b>client</b> <b>device</b> in power-save mode will awaken to receive every other beacon frame. Upon entering power-save mode, a <b>client</b> <b>device</b> will transmit a notification to the access point, so that the access point will {{know how to handle}} unicast traffic destined for the <b>client</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>client</b> <b>device</b> will begin to sleep according to the DTIM period.|$|E

50|$|MU-MIMO {{is part of}} the IEEE 802.11ac {{standard}}, {{the first}} Wi-Fi standard to offer speeds in the gigabit per second range. MU-MIMO enables an access point (AP) to transmit to up to four <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> simultaneously. This eliminates contention delays, but requires frequent channel measurements to properly direct the signals. Each user may employ up to four of the available eight spatial streams. For example, an AP with eight antennas can talk to two <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> with four antennas, providing four spatial streams to each. Alternatively, the same AP can talk to four <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> with two antennas each, providing two spatial streams to each. Multi-user MIMO beamforming even benefits single spatial stream devices. Prior to MU-MIMO beamforming, an access point communicating with multiple <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> could only transmit to one at a time. With MU-MIMO beamforming, the access point can transmit to up to four single stream devices at the same time on the same channel.|$|R

The {{proliferation}} of lightweight <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> such as iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets, {{has created an}} increased demand for cloud-based services. In many of these services, queries over structured data are sent to cloud-based servers for processing and the results relayed back to the <b>client</b> <b>devices.</b> Network bandwidth between <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> and cloud-based servers is often a limited resource and any effort {{to reduce the amount}} of data transmitted across the network would not only conserve bandwidth but help with the battery life of the <b>client</b> <b>devices.</b> In this thesis we propose a novel query-aware compression method for compressing query results sent from database servers to client applications. Our method is based on two key ideas. We exploit redundancy information obtained from the query plan and possibly from the database schema to achieve better compression than standard non-query aware compressors. We use a collection of memory-limited dictionaries to encode attribute values in a lightweight and efficient manner. We evaluate our method empirically using the TPC-H benchmark show that this technique is effective especially when used in conjunction with standard compressors. Our results show that compression ratios of up to tow times over gzip are possible...|$|R

50|$|In {{the present}} standards, an access point {{is able to}} store only a single DTIM period. Consequently, {{different}} <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> in power-save mode will all wake up for the same beacon frames according to the DTIM period. A network manager may need to balance the conflicting requirements for power consumption and communication throughput when in power-save mode of <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> in different wireless networks when configuring the DTIM period of an access point. In the future, an access point that can serve multiple service sets (multiple SSIDs) may have a separate DTIM period for each service set. A network manager may consider the requirements of power consumption and communication throughput of <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> in a particular wireless networks when determining which DTIM period to configure for which service set. A higher DTIM period may increase the potential savings in power consumption but reduce the communication throughput, and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Frequently, {{client-side}} wireless {{devices have}} {{a view of}} multiple WiFi access points, whether from open residential and commercial networks, corporate networks, or mesh networks. Given {{the increasing number of}} radios and antennas in today’s wireless devices, residual capacity from these multiple APs could be leveraged if <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> communicate with multiple APs simultaneously. In this paper, we exploit multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) technology to improve throughput and reliability in both directions of a wireless connection. For uplink, we use multi-user beamforming to enable the <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> to send multiple data streams to multiple APs simultaneously. For downlink, we leverage interference nulling technology to allow the <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> to decode parallel packets from multiple APs. This iBeam system requires no changes to existing APs or backhaul networks and is compatible with the IEEE 802. 11 standards. We experimentally evaluate iBeam and show significant throughput improvements over both single-AP connections and multi-AP connections in a time division mode. The client’s reliability and stability are also significantly improved due to the multi-AP diversity gain...|$|R

50|$|The {{adoption}} of client-side Cooperative MIMO lags behind server-side Cooperative MIMO. Client-side Cooperative MIMO, such as Mobile Relays, can distribute processing loads among <b>client</b> <b>devices</b> in a cluster, {{which means the}} computational load per processor can scale more effectively as the cluster grows. While there is additional overhead for coordinating the <b>client</b> <b>devices,</b> devices in a cluster can share radio channels and spatial subchannels via short-range wireless links. This means that as the cluster grows, the available instantaneous data bandwidth per user also grows. Thus, instead of the data bandwidth per user being hard-limited {{by the laws of}} Physics (i.e., the Shannon-Hartley Theorem), data bandwidth is constrained only by computational processing power, which keeps improving according to Moore’s Law. Despite the great potential for client-side Cooperative MIMO, a user-based infrastructure is more difficult for service providers to monetize, and there are additional technical challenges.|$|R
