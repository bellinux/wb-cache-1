500|$|Like other Iridomyrmex species, {{the meat}} ant is an omnivore, {{retrieving}} food sources from various insects it tends, including caterpillars and various sorts of butterflies, particularly the larvae of the Waterhouse's hairstreak (Jalmenus lithochroa). Meat ants usually feed on honeydew from sap-sucking insects, flower nectar, sugar and other sweet substances. In captive colonies, workers prefer to consume {{small pieces of}} grapes rather than honey solutions and other sweet foods. These ants prey on various insects and animals, collecting both live and dead invertebrates and acquire meat from dead vertebrates. Insects the meat ants prey on include giant lacewings, which they swarm up trees to kill, the butterfly genoveva azure Ogyris genoveva, Indian mealmoths, almond moths, the Western Australian jarrah leafminer and the larvae of the wasp Trichogramma. Large and developed larvae of the [...] <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris rapae) are attacked more effectively by meat ant workers than those of other Iridomyrmex species. On sandy beaches, this species is observed preying on the polychaete annelid worm, Armandia intermedia, causing high mortality rates on them (rates of 30 percent). These ants will feed {{on a number of}} dead or alive animals, including metamorphic crucifix toads, snakes, lizards, and birds. On some occasions, swarms of workers have been found on dead foxes. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on fresh guano. The collection of guano by a nearby meat ant colony shows the opportunistic nature of the species. Observations show that trails of workers in groups of two to four were found collecting the guano under an active bat roost within an abandoned mine and proceeded to return it to the nest. The collection of guano by any Australian ant colony was never recorded prior to these observations, but it is unknown why meat ants collect fresh guano.|$|E

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} not only an {{activator}} of male sexual behavior: Its absence may also stop an approaching male and his attempt to copulate. Female White <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> are not always receptive to male White <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> and to communicate this message, they assume the mate refusal posture. This behavior consists of opening the wings and straightening the abdomen. Opening of the wings in this manner exposes the dorsal side of the female wings which are known to be unable to reflect ultraviolet light. In effect, females are removing the ultraviolet signal that initiates male sexual behavior, resulting in the abrupt halt of male sexual behavior. Female White <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> take advantage of the personal butterfly ultraviolet communication system to also reject males by removing an ultraviolet reflectance signal.|$|R
50|$|White <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies,</b> Pieris rapae crucivora, {{use their}} private {{ultraviolet}} communication system to initiate mating behavior. In this species, ultraviolet reflection is sexually dimorphic with females exhibiting {{the ability to}} reflect ultraviolet light of 380 nm to 400 nm and males being less able to reflect UV. Males who perceive an ultraviolet reflection from a female initiate a courtship behavior that involves approaching the female and attempting to copulate. Females communicate their receptivity to males using their ultraviolet communication system. The ultraviolet reflection {{is thought to be}} concentrated to the ventral side of a female’s hind wing. Yoshiaki Obara determined this experimentally by comparing the number of approaches to different parts of butterfly wings. The results showed that the female’s ventral hind wing was the greatest releaser of male sexual behavior. Although ultraviolet reflectance releases the sexual behavior, the strongest reflection of UV light is not the strongest releaser for the behavior. As a result, male white <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies</b> must have a preference for a certain level of UV reflectance from females. Using a private ultraviolet communication system, female White <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> signal their receptivity and initiate male mating behavior.|$|R

50|$|Pieris brassicae, {{the large}} white, also called <b>cabbage</b> <b>{{butterfly}},</b> cabbage white, cabbage moth (erroneously), or in India the large cabbage white, is a butterfly {{in the family}} Pieridae. It is a close relative of the small white, Pieris rapae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small white}} (P. rapae) is a small, common, {{cosmopolitan}} butterfly whose caterpillar has fine, short fuzz and is bright green; it prefers cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower. A larger Old World form (P. brassicae) is called large white. A common North American form (P. protodice) {{is known as}} the southern <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly.</b> The green-veined white (P. napi) occurs in Europe and North America.|$|E
50|$|Most moths lack bright colors, as {{many species}} use {{coloration}} as camouflage, but butterflies engage in visual communication. Female <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies,</b> for example, use ultraviolet light to communicate, with scales colored in this range on the dorsal wing surface. When they fly, each down stroke {{of the wing}} creates a brief flash of ultraviolet light which the males apparently recognize as the flight signature of a potential mate. These flashes from the wings may attract several males that engage in aerial courtship displays.|$|R

50|$|The adults {{fly from}} March to October with {{two to four}} generations {{depending}} on the latitude. The eggs are laid singly and have an incubation period of seven days. The caterpillars are present from May. They are greyish-greenish, with black dots and broad yellow stripes, quite similar to the larva of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris brassicae).

50|$|In {{the absence}} of dirigent protein, pinoresinol is a {{relatively}} minor product of lignan biosynthesis. When dirigent protein is present, it becomes the major product.

It may serve a similar defensive purpose in Forsythia intermedia.|$|E
50|$|Adult P. rapae {{use both}} vision and {{olfactory}} cues to identify flowers in their foraging flight. The <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> prefers purple, {{blue and yellow}} flowers over other floral colors. Some flowers, like Brassica rapa, have a UV guide for aiding nectar search for the butterfly where the petals reflect near UV light whereas {{the center of the}} flower absorbs UV light, creating a visible dark center in the flower when seen in UV condition. This UV guide plays a significant role in P. rapae foraging.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{three phase}} to host {{selection}} by the P. rapae adult female butterfly: searching, landing, and contact evaluation. A gravid female adult will first locate suitable habitats, and then identify patches of vegetation that contain potential host plants. The <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies</b> seem {{to limit their}} search to open areas and avoid cool, shaded woodlands even when host plants are available in these areas. Furthermore, gravid females will not oviposit during overcast or rainy weather. In laboratory conditions, high light intensity is required to promote oviposition. The females fly in a linear path independent of wind direction or position of the sun.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between plant patch size and population density of herbivores within fields often deviates from predictions of the theory of island biogeography and the resource concentration hypothesis. Here we argue that basic features of foraging behaviour can explain different responses of specialist herbivores to habitat heterogeneity. In a combination of field and simulation studies, we applied basic knowledge on the foraging strategies of three specialist herbivores: the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), the <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris rapae L.) and the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.), to explain differences in their responses to small scale fragmentation of their habitat. In our field study, populations of the three species responded to different sizes of host plant patches (9 plants and 100 plants) in different ways. Densities of winged cabbage aphids were independent of patch size. Egg-densities of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> were higher in small than in large patches. Densities of diamondback moth adults were higher in large patches than in small patches. When patches in a background of barley were compared with those in grass, densities of the cabbage aphid and the diamondback moth were reduced, but not <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly</b> densities. To explore the role of foraging behaviour of herbivores on their response to patch size, a spatially explicit individual-based simulation framework was used. The sensory abilities of the insects to detect and respond to contact, olfactory or visual cues were varied. Species with a post-alighting host recognition behaviour (cabbage aphid) could only use contact cues from host plants encountered after landing. In contrast, species capable with a pre-alighting recognition behaviour, based on visual (<b>cabbage</b> <b>butterfly)</b> or olfactory (diamondback moth) cues, were able to recognise a preferred host plant whilst in flight. These three searching modalities were studied by varying the in flight detection abilities, the displacement speed and the arrestment response to host plants by individuals. Simulated patch size - density relationships were similar to those observed in the field. The importance of pre- and post- alighting detection in the responses of herbivores to spatial heterogeneity of the habitat is discusse...|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, the larvae of the <b>cabbage</b> white <b>butterflies,</b> Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, are {{considered}} to be major pests in several economically important brassicaceous crops including various cultivars of cabbage and mustard. Thus far, biological control of these pests has focused on parasitoids including species in the genus Cotesia. We examined interactions between the solitary ichneumonid parasitoid, Hyposoter ebeninus, developing in 1 st to 3 rd (L 1 –L 3) larval instars of both P. rapae and P. brassicae. H. ebeninus is common in central and southern Europe, but has thus far received little attention as a possible biological control agent of <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies.</b> Larvae of both pierids continued to grow after they were parasitized, and development was only arrested some 5 – 7 days later. Caterpillars parasitized in the third instar grew significantly larger than larvae parasitized as L 1 or L 2. Adult parasitoid body mass was inversely correlated with host instar parasitized, and female wasps were significantly larger than male wasps. Egg-to-adult development time in H. ebeninus did not vary between the two hosts, but the parasitoid exhibited protandry. Parasitoid survival was generally higher in larvae of P. rapae than in larvae of P. brassicae, but varied with instar in the two hosts. Our study shows that H. ebeninus has promise as a biological control agent, particularly against its more suitable host, P. rapae. ...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic wasps {{employ a}} wide range of {{chemical}} cues to find their hosts. Very recently, we discovered how 2 closely related egg parasitoids, Trichogramma brassicae and Trichogramma evanescens, exploit the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide of one of their hosts, the gregarious large <b>cabbage</b> white <b>butterfly</b> Pieris brassicae that deposits a clutch of more than 20 eggs per oviposition bout. The pheromone is transferred by male butterflies to females during mating to enforce female monogamy. On detecting the anti-aphrodisiac, the tiny parasitic wasps ride on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitize her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that both wasp species similarly exploit the anti-aphrodisiac mixture of methyl salicylate and indole of another host, the more common solitary small <b>cabbage</b> white <b>butterfly</b> Pieris rapae that deposits only one egg at a time. Interestingly, this behavior is innate in T. brassicae, whereas T. evanescens learns it after one successful ride on a mated female butterfly. Moreover, we show that the wasps only respond to the anti-aphrodisiacs of the 2 <b>cabbage</b> white <b>butterflies</b> when the ubiquitous compounds are part of a complete mated female odor blend. Obviously, parasitic wasps use the sophisticated espionage-and-ride strategy to find eggs of different gregarious and solitary host species. From the wasps' perspective {{there seems to be a}} trade-off between the abundance and egg-laying behavior of the butterflies. Our findings suggest that Pieris butterflies are under strong selective pressure to minimize the use of an anti-aphrodisiac. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{small and}} large <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies,</b> Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, are found {{worldwide}} and are of considerable economic importance. The composition of the male scent-producing organs present on the wings was investigated. More than 120 components were identified, but {{only a small portion}} proved to be male specific. Major components were the known beetle pheromone ferrulactone (1) in P. rapae and its previously unknown larger analogue, brassicalactone (2), in P. brassicae. The latter carries an additional isoprene unit and is closely related to 1. Other components present in larger amounts on male relative to female wings were hexahydrofarnesylacetone (18) and phytol (23). Brassicalactone (2) was fully characterized by synthesis of its various diastereomers by using ring-closing metathesis. A similar approach to ferrulactone (1) failed, presumably because of its smaller ring size. Instead, this compound was synthesized by using a modified literature procedure. The biological activity of the compounds in the extract was tested by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic (GC-EAD) analysis, which showed that both macrolides and the other major components of the wings can be detected by the antennae of the conspecific female butterflies. Other detectable compounds included several alkanes, which are typical constituents of the butterfly cuticula, derivatives of phytol (23) and long-chain secondary alcohols. Finally, bioassays with males showed that the mixture of 1 (P. rapae) or 2 (P. brassicae) together with 18 and 23 applied to freshly eclosed males increased mating success compared to untreated males.
