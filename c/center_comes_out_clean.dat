60|$|Now, {{see what}} happens. These two platinum-plates {{are the two}} ends (or I will make them so immediately) of this apparatus; and I am about {{to put them in}} contact with that {{solution}} just as we did a moment ago on the paper. It does not matter to us whether the solution be on the paper or whether it be in the jar, so long as we bring the ends of the apparatus to it. If I put the two platinums in by themselves, they <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as <b>clean</b> and as white as they go in [inserting them into the fluid without connecting them with the battery]; but when we take the power and lay that on [the platinums were connected with the battery and again dipped into the solution], this, you see [exhibiting one of the platinums], is at once turned into copper, as it were: it has become like a plate of copper; and that [exhibiting the other piece of platinum] has <b>come</b> <b>out</b> quite <b>clean.</b> If I take this coppered piece and change sides, the copper will leave the right-hand side and come over to the left side; what was before the coppered plate <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean,</b> and the plate which was <b>clean</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> coated with copper; and thus you see that the same copper we put into this solution we can also take out of it by means of this instrument.|$|R
50|$|Dunbar says Kendall is lying. Mueller and Kendall were {{illegally}} selling {{prescription drugs}} and West became aware of their drug dealing. Mueller used Pike's grenade to kill West, then tried to pin the blame on Pike. A firefight broke out and all the trainees were killed. Dunbar claims that Dr. Peter Vilmer (Harry Connick Jr.), {{an old friend of}} Hardy and Osborne's former love interest, supplied the drugs and falsified drug tests so that soldiers <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean.</b> After confessing to the crime, Vilmer is placed under arrest.|$|R
60|$|But {{the fusion}} is a wiser step now, and altogether--even {{if we could}} spare the Emperor's fame. Do you {{remember}} the obloquy he suffered for Neufchâtel? and how it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that, if he pressed his conditions, it was simply because he meant {{to fight for the}} independence of the State? and how at last the Swiss delegates went to Paris to offer their gratitude for the deliverance he had attained for the people? His loyalty will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> before the eyes of his enemies now as then. We agree absolutely. And Robert does not dissent, I think. Facts begin to be conclusive to him.|$|R

Manjeet collapses in the toilet because of drug overdose. Everyone gets stunned on knowing that Manjeet has been taking drugs {{for quite some time}} now. Manjeet is sent for {{rehabilitation}} and his father decides to leave the town once he gets well. Vinny (Vincent) Sir tells everyone about the after-effects of drugs.

5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid marking paintwork, [...] "{{touchless}}" [...] (aka [...] "touchfree" [...] or [...] "no-touch") car washes were developed. A touchless car wash uses chemicals and high water pressure to clean the vehicle instead of brushes, minimizing the chance of surface damage to the vehicle. There are five primary factors to cleaning a vehicle successfully using a touchless system. These five factors are water quality, water temperature, chemistry, time, and water pressure generated by the equipment. If these factors are all set properly, vehicles will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> and shiny without the chance of vehicle damage caused by brushes.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the group testing {{problem for a}} finite population of possibly defective items {{with the objective of}} sampling a prespecified demanded number of nondefective items at minimum cost. Group testing means that items can be pooled and tested together; if the group <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean,</b> all items in it are nondefective, while a "contaminated" group is scrapped. Every test takes a random amount of time and a given deadline has to be met. If the prescribed number of nondefective items is not reached, the demand has to be satisfied at a higher (penalty) cost. We derive explicit formulas for the distributions underlying the cost functionals of this model. It is shown in numerical examples that these results can be used to determine the optimal group size. ...|$|R

He was threatened that his toe nails would be plucked out which was a basic procedure of torture then, if he did not <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> and hand over all the financial details to the British India police. Responding to the threat, Panchanan Chakraborty ordered one of his innumerable servants to get a knife and {{right in front of the}} officer of the British India police chopped off his right toe thumb and offered as a gift to the officer. The interrogation was over and the officer left for his own good.|$|R

50|$|Now Ra. Sankaran, {{who already}} knows about Chinna Gounder, {{finds out that}} he is in trouble and decides to offer help. He takes over the case in favour of Deivanai and begins his ground work. He gets the post mortem report and finds out that the cause of death of the man {{attacked}} by Deivanai was lack of breath. Meanwhile, Deivanai is kidnapped by Sakkara Gounder. Chinna Gounder comes to the rescue and saves Deivanai. Chinna Gounder produces Sakkara Gounder in front of the village panchayat where it is revealed that it was him who killed the witness and decided to blame Deivanai. In the end, Chinna Gounder and Deivanai <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> from the accusations made over them. Sakkara Gounder begs pardon to the villagers but no one listens and ignores him.|$|R
50|$|Sriramachandramurthy is sued by lawyer Charu Haasan (Kamal Haasan) on Chandran's behalf for {{injuring}} Uma. Sriramachandramurthy is, for {{the most}} part, scared during the lawyer's monologue, but eventually realises that he is being fooled again — this time by Charu Haasan, who is actually an actor hired by Chandran, while Uma was not actually crippled in the chase. At this point, all the main characters approach Sriramachandramurthy and tell him the truth. A visibly confused and shaken Sriramachandramurthy locks himself in a room, and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> shaven after a while, feeling {{that he does not}} need something which caused so much trouble. Sriramachandramurthy then laments to Lord Kartikeya about his foolishness. As he does so, the picture of Kartikeya changes into that of Lord Ganesha; a voice from heaven (Ganesha's) apologises to him as he was also involved in fooling him.|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth's fortune {{changes for}} good when a {{professional}} and skilled girl Mini (Rohini) turns up {{and soon the}} place is filled with customers. Emil is smitten by Mini at first sight, but {{even though she is}} attracted to him, she keeps her distance, and this makes Emil suspect that Mini is afraid and hiding something. The business flourishes with Mini at the helm. They expand it to health club, moves into a new place and Emil starts his video studio nearby. He puts up advertisements of the beauty clinic with Mini's pictures without her consent. She is furious and threaten to quit until unless the advertisements are removed. Emil does that but his concern that she is hiding something grows. This is soon cemented when some people come enquiring about her and say that Mini had escaped from her last employer with stolen valuables. Mini reveals the truth and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{an instant}} of rigid silence, and then Syme in his turn fell furiously on the other, filled with a flaming curiosity. The Marquis was probably, in a general sense, a better fencer than he, as he had surmised at the beginning, {{but at the moment}} the Marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage. He fought wildly and even weakly, and he {{constantly}} looked away at the railway line, almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel. Syme, on the other hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual fury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword. For this purpose, he aimed less at the Marquis's body, and more at his throat and head. A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man's neck below the jaw. It <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean.</b> Half mad, he thrust again, and made {{what should have been a}} bloody scar on the Marquis's cheek. But there was no scar.|$|R
40|$|The MOOC’s (Massive open online classes) have {{ushered in}} a new era of {{learning}} overcoming the boundaries of time and geography to provide high quality education to masses who cannot afford university education. The major drawback however is that although they have best tried to capture classroom environment but facets such as teacher-student interaction and the usefulness of assignments as a source for enhanced understanding of subject matter have not been captured. Also it has led to plagiarism, which not only is a serious hazard but is also staining the otherwise excellent image the MOOC’s could have had. In this paper we propose a JADE based multi-agent system(MAS) as an effective step {{to solve the problem of}} plagiarism. The system has considered 2 types of plagiarism namely local and internet-based plagiarism. This will be used to filter out the students caught in plagiarism and students who <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> will then have their solutions checked by using LEXICAL ANALYSIS to determine the styling and subjected to tests as well as codechecker to check for logical and syntactical correctness...|$|R
50|$|Vince posts his {{symptoms}} on the internet. Some doctors {{come in to}} diagnose him. Before Foreman kicks them out, one doctor suggests a brain tumor. Thirteen tries to be diplomatic {{by saying that the}} diagnosis of both Foreman and the other doctor have merits. Foreman is angry that Thirteen did not completely back him up. Vince's MRI <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean,</b> so Foreman orders Thirteen to treat for thrombocytosis. Thirteen complains to House, who has been expecting her to visit because he predicted that tensions would occur in her relationship with Foreman, now that he's in power. He tells her to give in to Foreman to save their relationship. Foreman apologizes to Thirteen and they make up. However, Vince's lymph nodes swell up. Foreman was wrong about thrombocytosis. Vince offers a $25,000 reward for an answer online. The team is swamped by suggestions sent in from the public. Vince decides to go with the majority diagnosis and demands to be tested for amyloidosis. Foreman makes a deal with him: Foreman will test for amyloidosis, but if the test result is negative then Vince must cease requesting help on the internet.|$|R

500|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, McBride sold the Browns for $600,000 ($ in today's dollars), {{more than twice the}} largest sum ever paid for a {{professional}} football team. The old stockholders were McBride and his son Edward, along with minority owners including taxi business associate Dan Sherby, Brown and four others. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Cleveland Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney who had founded the Cleveland Rams, Saul Silberman, owner of the horse race track later known as Thistledown Racecourse, and Ralph DeChairo, an associate of Silberman. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football. McBride said he had simply [...] "had his fling" [...] with football and wanted to concentrate on other business activities. [...] "Well, I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> after all," [...] he said.

Previous to the Coventry Festival, Phish had announced plans to break up. This proved to be temporary once Phish launched its reunion announcements in October 2008. It was said that the band decided to break up because they were [...] "exhausted by touring and the strain of Anastasio's substance abuse." [...] However, during the band's break, Trey's consistent problems with drugs and alcohol harmed him worse than he had expected. On December 16, 2006 Trey Anastasio was pulled over at 3:30 AM one night in Whitehall, NY for failing to keep right. He was found in possession of heroin and bottles of prescription painkillers bearing someone else's name {{and was sentenced to}} 14 months in the Washington County, New York drug court.

He did however receive $386,000 from Schrader's life insurance. Bohnett had been a staff information systems consultant at Arthur Andersen from 1980 to 1983 and, unable to be openly gay in that world, he had left to work at software companies instead.

6000|$|... 'I {{drew out}} the arrow from Pearce's chest: a {{slanting}} wound not going in very deep, running under the skin, yet of apparently almost fatal character to an ignorant person like myself; Five inches were actually inside him. The arrow struck him almost in {{the centre of}} the chest and {{in the direction of the}} right breast. There was no effusion of blood, he breathed with great difficulty, groaning and making a kind of hollow sound, was perfectly composed, gave me directions and messages in case of his death. I put on a poultice and bandage, and leaving him in charge of some one, went to Fisher. The wrist was shot through, but the upper part of the arrow broken off and deep down; bleeding profuse, of which I was glad; I cut deeply, though fearing much to cut an artery, but I could not extract the wooden arrow-head. At length getting a firm hold of the projecting point of the arrow on the lower side of his wrist, I pulled it through: it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean.</b> The pain was very great, he trembled and shivered: we gave him brandy, and he recovered. I poulticed the wound and went to Edwin. Atkin had got out the splinter from his wound; the arrow went in near the eye and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> by the cheek-bone: it was well syringed, and the flow of blood had been copious from the first. The arrows were not bone-headed, and not poisoned, but I well knew that lock-jaw was to be dreaded. Edwin's was not much more than a flesh wound. Fisher's being in the wrist, frightened me more: their patience and quiet composure and calm resignation were indeed a strength and comfort to us all.|$|R

Dhananjay, the descendent of Gods, is Dhruva's most powerful ally and a good friend who not only provided him {{with the power to}} breathe inside water but is also ready to help whenever Dhruva needs him and vice versa. But amongst a long list of supporting characters in Dhruva series, the most important character has been Shweta, Dhruva's sister. She has been the strongest pillar of support in Dhruva's constant battle against evil on many levels. As a little sister, she engages with Dhruva in funny sibling banter, cheers him up and makes sure he never feels sad or misses his biological family. As a budding scientist, she constantly provides Dhruva with innovative gadgets that prove very helpful to Dhruva during his fights. But the highest level of support she provides {{is in the form of}} Chandika, a blonde super heroine, her alter ego. Chandika has inherited her brother's fighting style. Like Dhruva, she too depends on brains more than brawn as well as on her self-invented gadgets. She is always there to help Dhruva whenever he is in danger. Dhruva who is very protective about her sister, under strong suspicion that Shweta is in fact Chandika, often reprimands her for putting her life in danger. But Shweta somehow manages to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>clean</b> every time proving that she is not Chandika. Natasha is the only person who knows Chandika's true identity.
