5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree <b>canopy</b> <b>density</b> >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree <b>canopy</b> <b>density</b> >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree.

30|$|Canopy base height, <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density,</b> and <b>canopy</b> {{fuel loading}} were {{calculated}} using Canopy Fuels Inventory Processor (CFIP) (Larry Wilson; Larkspur, California; unpublished report). The CFIP is a vegetation simulation program {{largely based on}} the algorithms used in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (Crookston and Stage 1991) and the Fire and Fuels Extension (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). The processor incorporates a post-treatment reduction in <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density</b> and <b>canopy</b> base height for hardwoods and select conifers in California. To represent changes in <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density</b> and <b>canopy</b> base height post-treatment, the fraction of crown length removed was multiplied by the average crown mass (Noonan-Wright et al. 2006). This reduced crown mass value was then applied to the vertical distribution for calculations of canopy base height and <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density</b> for each plot. Otherwise, for hardwoods such as black oak, and conifers such as red fir and white fir, measured changes in individual tree crown base height {{would have resulted in}} higher values of crown bulk density, post-treatment. Surface and ground fuel loads were calculated using Brown et al. (1984) with coefficients specific to California tree species (van Wagtendonk et al. 1996).|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{airborne}} Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) {{that provided}} three-dimensional forest {{information has been}} widely applied in forest inventory and has shown great potential in automatic individual tree crown delineation (ITCD). Usually, ITCD algorithms include treetop detection and crown boundary delineation procedures. In this study, we proposed a novel method called region-based hierarchical cross-section analysis (RHCSA), which combined the two procedures together based on a canopy height model (CHM) derived from airborne LiDAR data for ITCD. This method considers the CHM as a three-dimensional topological surface, simulates stereoscopic scanning {{from top to bottom}} using an iterative process, and utilizes the individual crown and vertical structure of crowns to progressively detect individual treetops and delineate crown boundaries. The proposed method was tested in natural forest stands with high <b>canopy</b> <b>densities</b> in Liangshui National Nature Reserve and Maoershan Forest Farm, Heilongjiang Province, China. Its performance was evaluated by an accuracy procedure that considered both the relative position of treetops and overlapped area of crowns. The average overall accuracy achieved was 85. 12 % for coniferous plots, 83. 86 % for deciduous plots and 86. 44 % for coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest plots. The results revealed that the RHCSA method can detect and delineate individual tree crowns with little influence from forest types and crown size. It could provide technical support for individual tree crown delineation in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests with high <b>canopy</b> <b>densities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) Project is mapping {{wildland}} fuels, vegetation, {{and fire}} regime characteristics across the United States. The LANDFIRE project is unique {{because of its}} national scope, creating an integrated product suite at 30 -m spatial resolution and complete spatial coverage of all lands within the 50 states. Here we describe development of the LANDFIRE wildland fuels data layers for the conterminous 48 states: surface fire behavior fuel models, <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density,</b> <b>canopy</b> base height, canopy cover, and canopy height. Surface fire behavior fuel models are mapped by developing crosswalks to vegetation structure and composition created by LANDFIRE. Canopy fuels are mapped using regression trees relating field-referenced estimates of canopy base height and <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density</b> to satellite imagery, biophysical gradients and vegetation structure and composition data.

30|$|The grass {{stage is}} widely {{accepted}} as an adaptation to frequent fire (Brockway et al. 2006, Keeley 2012), yet {{several studies have}} reported high mortality rates of small grass stage seedlings following fire (Croker and Boyer 1975, Grace and Platt 1995 a, Moule 2013). Brockway et al. (2006) suggested a threshold root collar diameter of 13  mm for increasing the probability of survival from surface fire, although seedling mortality {{has also been shown}} to increase with fire intensity (Jack et al. 2010). Observations of seedling aggregation within canopy openings in naturally regenerated longleaf pine stands may be related to fire-induced mortality of longleaf pine seedlings beneath canopy pines (Grace and Platt 1995 a, Avery et al. 2004). However, effects of seedling size and fire intensity on mortality are difficult to separate in observational studies because greater <b>canopy</b> <b>densities</b> often correspond to greater competition (i.e., smaller longleaf pine seedlings) and greater fuel loads from needlefall (i.e., greater fire intensity).|$|R

Repeated measurements from each method displayed considerable variability, but hemispherical photography proved to be the more precise method. To evaluate the accuracy of the different methods, we correlated measurements with allometrically derived estimates of <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density</b> and available <b>canopy</b> fuel. Measurements from both methods were more highly correlated with available canopy fuel than <b>canopy</b> bulk <b>density.</b> Hemispherical photography emerged as the superior methodology, displaying greater precision and accuracy, at least when measurements must be collected under sub-par lighting conditions.
