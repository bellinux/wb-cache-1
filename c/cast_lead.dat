5|$|During {{factional}} clashes {{across the}} Gaza Strip in June 2007 which ended with Hamas gaining control over that territory, {{at least four}} paramilitaries from Hamas and Fatah were killed in Deir al-Balah. On 2 January 2009, Deir al-Balah was shelled by the Israeli Army {{as part of its}} month-long offensive Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead.</b> During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{accidents}} involving the Apache helicopter in Israeli service. During the Lebanon War in 2006, two IAF AH-64A helicopters collided, killing one pilot and critically wounding three. In another incident in the conflict an IAF AH-64D crashed due to a malfunction in the main rotor, killing the two crew. In late 2007, the Israeli Air Force put further purchases and deliveries of AH-64Ds on hold during an investigation upon the aircraft's performance envelope. However, Israeli officials have since praised the Apache for its role in Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead</b> in 2008, against Hamas in Gaza. In recent years, Israeli Apaches {{have been used to}} patrol the skies over Gaza; strike operations against insurgents using these helicopters has become a frequent occurrence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, amateur ship model kits became {{available}} from companies such as Bassett-Lowke in Great Britain and Boucher's in the United States. Early 20th century models comprised a combination of wooden hulls and <b>cast</b> <b>lead</b> for anchors, deadeyes, and rigging blocks. These materials gradually gave way to plastic precast sets.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish Agency {{has played}} an {{important}} role in supporting the residents of Sderot and the surrounding area, which has been the target of many rockets launched from Gaza. More than 12,000 children have enjoyed respite activities in the center and north of the country (during Operation Protective Edge); 300 educators have been trained to work with children living through trauma (during Operation Cast Lead); supplemental educational activities have been offered to more than 2,000 students; the S.O.S. Emergency Fund for Victims of Terror has helped more than 200 people whose lives were directly affected by the Kassam attacks; 100 bomb shelters were renovated in the region during <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead</b> and 500 during Operation Protective Edge; and 500 students received scholarships (during <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead)</b> to study at Sapir College in Sderot, with more scheduled to receive scholarships as of the aftermath of Operation Protective Edge.|$|E
25|$|Since Hamas' {{takeover}} of Gaza in 2007, the Israeli Air Force has {{taken part in}} repeated bouts of violence between Israel and the Hamas-held Gaza Strip. In December 2008, the IAF spearheaded Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead,</b> carrying out more than 2,360 air strikes. It had a principal role in destroying Hamas targets, and killed several senior Hamas commanders, including Said Seyam, Nizar Rayan, Tawfik Jaber, and Abu Zakaria al-Jamal.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{with fine}} sand {{entering}} the Tavor's chamber, which were identified {{over the two}} years of testing, were rectified by numerous small adjustments. A number of other improvements and changes to the design were also made between 2001–2009. Tavor CTAR-21 bullpup assault rifles saw combat service in Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead,</b> used by Givati Brigade and Golani Brigade, and the soldiers reported the Tavor bullpup assault rifles functioned flawlessly.|$|E

25|$|A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on 19 December 2008; {{attempts}} at extending the truce failed amid accusations of breaches from both sides. Following the expiration, Israel launched {{a raid on}} a tunnel suspected of being used to kidnap Israeli soldiers which killed several Hamas fighters. Following this, Hamas resumed rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities, most notably firing over 60 rockets on 24 December. On 27 December 2008, Israel launched Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead</b> against Hamas. Numerous human rights organizations accused Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Olmert {{came under}} {{investigation}} for corruption and this led him to announce on 30 July 2008, {{that he would be}} stepping down as Prime Minister following election of a new leader of the Kadima party in September 2008. Tzipi Livni won the election, but was unable to form a coalition and Olmert remained in office until the general election. Israel carried out Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead</b> in the Gaza Strip from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 in response to rocket attacks from Hamas militants, leading to a decrease of Palestinian rocket attacks.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ground}} invasion, Israeli forces {{destroyed}} livestock in Gaza. In Beit Hanoun, 370 cows {{were killed by}} tank shelling and airstrikes. In Beit Lahiya, 20 camels were shot by ground forces. Israel's Minister of Finance estimated that the operation would cost Israel NIS 8.5 billion (approximately 2.5 billion USD), {{which is similar to}} Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead</b> in 2009 and higher than Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012. The forecast included military and non-military costs, including military expenditure and property damage. The calculation indicated that if the operation lasted 20 days, the loss in GDP would be 0.4%.|$|E

25|$|In December 2009, {{a warrant}} for Livni's arrest was {{understood}} to have been issued by a British court, following an application by lawyers acting for Palestinian victims of Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead.</b> The warrant focused on Livni's role in Israel's war against Hamas-run Gaza earlier in the year, and was withdrawn after her visit was canceled. For several years, Palestinian activists have made largely unsuccessful attempts to prosecute Israeli officials in European courts under universal jurisdiction. The warrant was issued on 12 December and revoked on 14 December 2009, after {{it was revealed that}} Livni had not entered British territory.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2004, sixteen {{people were}} killed in two suicide bombings on {{commuter}} buses in Beersheba for which Hamas claimed responsibility. On August 28, 2005, another suicide bomber attacked the central bus station, seriously injuring two security guards and 45 bystanders. During Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead,</b> which began on December 27, 2008 and lasted until the ceasefire on January 18, 2009, Hamas fired 2,378 rockets (such as Grad rockets) and mortars, from Gaza into southern Israel, including Beersheba. The rocket attacks have continued, but have been only partially effective since the introduction of the Iron Dome rocket defense system.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, after Hamas {{defeated}} Fatah in the Battle of Gaza (2007) {{and took}} {{control over the}} Gaza Strip, Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza. Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli raids, such as Operation Hot Winter continued into 2008. A six month ceasefire was agreed in June 2008, but it was broken several times by both Israel and Hamas. As it reached its expiry, Hamas announced that they were unwilling to renew the ceasefire without improving the terms. At the end of December 2008 Israeli forces began Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead,</b> launching the Gaza War that left an estimated 1,166–1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{the losses}} {{of water in}} the network were {{estimated}} some 28% in the West Bank and even half of the supplied amount in Gaza. In the West Bank, construction and maintenance of water and sewage infrastructure are problematic. The Palestinian areas are enclaves in the Israeli-controlled Area C. Therefore, all projects are subject to approval of the Joint Water Committee and the Israeli army. In Gaza, the infrastructure is subject to periodic large-scale destruction by Israeli attacks, such as in the 2004 Raid on Beit Hanoun, or the 2008/2009 Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead.</b> The groundwater in Gaza is highly contaminated by leaked sewage.|$|E
25|$|Leahy joined ten House of Representative {{members in}} asking the State Department to {{investigate}} suspected {{human rights violations}} by Egyptian and Israeli security forces, in particular citing claims of extrajudicial killings which may trigger the Leahy Law, a law that can cause the suspension of all American military aid to countries guilty of such abuses. While Leahy has signed resolutions in support of Israel's right to self-defense, {{he has also been}} critical of human rights violations in the region, especially after the 2008 Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead.</b> In 2011, Leahy initially promoted a bill to cut the military aid to three elite IDF units, after reports of human rights violations during the Gaza flotilla raid and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|An {{order from}} Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion on 26 May 1948 officially {{set up the}} Israel Defense Forces as a conscript army formed out of the {{paramilitary}} group Haganah, incorporating the militant groups Irgun and Lehi. The IDF served as Israel's armed forces in all the country's major military operations—including the 1948 War of Independence, 1951–1956 Retribution operations, 1956 Sinai War, 1964–1967 War over Water, 1967 Six-Day War, 1967–1970 War of Attrition, 1968 Battle of Karameh, 1973 Operation Spring of Youth, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1976 Operation Entebbe, 1978 Operation Litani, 1982 Lebanon War, 1982–2000 South Lebanon conflict, 1987–1993 First Intifada, 2000–2005 Second Intifada, 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, 2006 Lebanon War, 2008–2009 Operation <b>Cast</b> <b>Lead,</b> 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense, and 2014 Operation Protective Edge. The number of wars and border conflicts in which the IDF {{has been involved in}} its short history makes {{it one of the most}} battle-trained armed forces in the world. While originally the IDF operated on three fronts—against Lebanon and Syria in the north, Jordan and Iraq in the east, and Egypt in the south—after the 1979 Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty, it has concentrated its activities in southern Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories, including the First and the Second Intifada.|$|E
