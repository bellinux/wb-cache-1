40|$|Fluorescent {{determination}} of chloride (Cl-) in nanoliter samples. BackgroundMeasurements of Cl- in nanoliter samples, {{such as those}} collected during isolated, perfused tubule experiments, have been difficult, somewhat insensitive, and/or require custom-made equipment. We developed a technique using a fluorescent Cl- indicator, 6 -methoxy-N-(3 -sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ), to make these measurements simple and reliable. MethodsThis is a simple procedure that relies on the selectivity of the dye {{and the fact that}} Cl-quenches its fluorescence. To measure millimolar quantities of Cl- in nanoliter samples, we prepared a solution of 0. 25 mM SPQ and loaded it into the reservoir of a continuous-flow ultramicrofluorometer, which can be constructed from commercially available components. Samples were injected with a <b>calibrated</b> <b>pipette</b> via an injection port, and the resultant peak fluorescent deflections were recorded. The deflections represent a decrease in fluorescence caused by the quenching effect of the Cl- injected. ResultsThe method yielded a linear response with Cl- concentrations from 5 to 200 mM NaCl. The minimum detectable Cl- concentration was approximately 5 mM. The coefficient of variation between 5 and 200 mM was 1. 7 %. Resolution, defined as two times the standard error divided by the slope, between 10 and 50 mM and between 50 and 200 mM was 1 mM and 2. 6 mM, respectively. Furosemide, diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid and other nonchloride anions (HEPES, HCO 3, SO 4, and PO 4) did not interfere with the assay, whereas 150 mM NaBr resulted in a peak height greater than 150 NaCl. In addition, the ability to measure Cl- did not vary with pH within the physiological range. ConclusionWe developed an easy, accurate, and sensitive method to measure Cl- concentration in small aqueous solution samples...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{circulating}} blood volume was undertaken {{as a part}} of a study of the disturbed physiology in pellagra, chiefly for the purpose of finding out whether shrinkage of plasma volume existed in patients who were suffering from a disease frequently characterized by severe diarrhea. Such a shrinkage would be of great importance of itself, and would obviously have a bearing upon the interpretation of the composition of the plasma determined at the same time. The existence of anemia can hardly be established nor its severity estimated-so long as we are in ignorance- of the plasma volume. It was also considered possible that the magnitude of the {{circulating blood}} volume might be correlated with certain of the features of the skin lesions, such as the degree of exudation of serum. I have used the dye method of Keith, Rowntree and Geraghty (1) modified as follows: A 3 per cent aqueous solution of brilliant vital red (National Analine Company) was made up 'the afternoon before use, and sterilized at 100 °C. for 8 minutes.

The dye left in the flask was taken up in a small quantity of sterile distilled water. After taking blood for chemical studies and to provide plasma for preparation of dye stand-ard, the dye was injected through the same needle and the remaining dye washed out of the syringe with the patient's circulating blood by emptying and filling the syringe twice.

50|$|Irrespective {{of brand}} or expense of pipette, every micro pipette {{manufacturer}} recommends checking the calibration {{at least every}} six months, if used regularly.

40|$|Viral vectors {{preparation}} A replication-deficient {{retroviral vector}} {{based on the}} Moloney murine leukemia virus was used to express RFP under a CAG promoter (1). Retroviral particles were assembled using three separate plasmids containing the capside (CMV-vsvg), viral proteins (CMV-gag/pol) and the transgene (CAG-RFP). For channelrhodopsin- 2 expression, retroviral particles were prepared by using a Ubi-ChR 2 -GFP plasmid (kindly provided by S. Ge, SUNY Stony Brook). Plasmids were transfected onto HEK 293 T cells using deacylated polyethylenimine. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection and concentrated by two rounds of ultracentrifugation. Virus titer was typically ~ 105 particles/μl. Animals and surgery for retroviral delivery Female C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice 6 – 7 weeks of age were housed at 4 mice per cage, with two running wheels.

Springs subjected to changing tensioning behave more smoothly and consistently when they are allowed to enjoy an interval of rest to settle into their new configuration.

50|$|A {{bottle top}} media {{dispensers}} is an inexpensive {{alternative to the}} motor-driven inductive pump. This type involves a piston on a plunger which is pushed down against a spring: as the spring pushes the piston back into its original position, it draws the medium up from a reservoir underneath.

40|$|Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) is a {{scanning}} probe microscopy particularly suitable for the investigation of living biological specimens due to its low invasivity. Recently, this technique has been used not only to perform 3 D-imaging but also to stimulate and guide neuronal growth cones. In particular it has been demonstrated that one can guide the cone growth for tens of micrometers by means of recurrent and noncontact SICM scanning along a defined line, with a pipette having an internal hydrostatic pressure. Accurate measurements of the mechanical forces acting on the cell membrane in these stimulation protocols are essential in order to explain the biological mechanisms involved. Herein we describe a setup specifically developed for this purpose, combining together SICM, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and inverted optical microscopy. In our configuration, a SICM pipette can be approached to an AFM cantilever while monitoring the cantilever deflection {{as a function of}} the hydrostatic pressure applied to the pipette and the relative distance.

40|$|Background: Periodontitis {{involves}} intricate {{interactions of}} the biofilm with the host immunoinflammatory response and subsequent alterations in bone and connective tissue homeostasis. Neopterin is a marker, {{belonging to the}} class of pteridines, which is associated with cell-mediated immunity. It is produced by interferon-γ stimulated macrophages. The levels of neopterin in body fluids are elevated in infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancies and allograft rejections. This investigation was designed to estimate the levels of neopterin in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in health, chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects were divided into three groups of ten subjects each as with healthy periodontium (Group 1), chronic gingivitis (Group 2) and chronic periodontitis (Group 3). The GCF samples {{were obtained from the}} subjects by placing color-coded <b>calibrated,</b> volumetric, micro-capillary <b>pipettes</b> extracrevicularly.

Interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 α) has shown to have specific roles in inflammation, immunity, tissue breakdown, and tissue homeostasis. This study assessed the correlation of periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) index with the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of IL- 1 α, which would be helpful in evaluating the validity of PISA index in terms of reflection of the disease. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were recruited for this study and 20 subjects with healthy gingiva (Group I) served as controls and 20 subjects served as cases with periodontitis (Group II). Samples of GCF were obtained from one site in each patient by placing color-coded, <b>calibrated,</b> volumetric microcapillary <b>pipettes</b> extracrevicularly, and subjected to ELISA test. Results: There was a statistical significance for mean probing depth (PD) and periodontal epithelial surface area (PESA) (P < 0. 01), mean bleeding on probing and PISA, IL- 1 α (P < 0. 01) and PESA (P < 0. 05) in Group I. Statistical significance was found between PISA and IL- 1 α in Group I (P < 0. 01). A positive correlation was found in Group II between mean PD and mean attachment loss (P < 0. 01), PISA, IL- 1 α and PESA (P < 0. 01), PISA and IL- 1 α levels (P < 0. 01) which was statistically significant.

CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2011 (in press). ### INTRODUCTION The *Caenorhabditis elegans* embryo is {{particularly}} amenable to microscopy and embryological studies {{because of its}} short developmental time, transparent shell, and nonpigmented cells. The agar mount described in this protocol is {{an easy way to}} prepare live *C. elegans* embryos for microscopic visualization. The mount slightly embeds the embryo in agar to hold it in place. The mount also slightly compresses the embryo to provide consistent orientation such that every embryo will be positioned with either its right side or its left side facing the objective. Other techniques can result in random orientations that complicate analysis and make identification of individual blastomeres more challenging. ### RELATED INFORMATION Protocols for collection and analysis of four-dimensional (4 D) data can be found in [Acquisition of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 a) and [Analysis of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 b). An ablation technique for killing individual cells within the embryo (to facilitate the study of cell interactions within the *C. elegans* embryo) is described in [Laser Killing of Blastomeres in *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 c). An alternative method for mounting embryos that involves raising a coverslip on grease “feet” is found in [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans* (]([URL] and Isaacson 2010). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Agar (5 %) - *Melt the agar just before use*. - *C. elegans* (gravid hermaphrodites) - M 9 buffer for agar mounts - Valap for agar mounts ### Equipment 1. Aspirator tube assembly (15 -in., for mouth pipette) - Bunsen burner - Coverslips, 18 × 18 -mm (# 1) - Eyelash brush (eyelash glued to end of round toothpick) - Microscope - *For assembling the mount, a standard stereoscope is required for all steps with C. elegans. To identify early embryos (one to four cells), a total zoom of 80 X or greater is recommended. We use Leica S 8 APO microscopes with 10 X eyepieces and Leica MZ 12. 5 microscopes with 16 X eyepieces and 1. 0 X objective lenses*. - Microscope slides, 25 × 75 -mm (1 mm thick) and single depression (3 mm thick) - Paintbrush - Pasteur pipettes (6 -in.) - Pick (platinum wire) - *To make the pick, insert 1 in. of 30 -gauge platinum or 90 % platinum, 10 % iridium wire into a 6 -in Pasteur pipette. Heat it in a flame until the glass melts around the wire. Use flat end hobby pliers or a small tack hammer to flatten the end of the pick*. - <b>Pipettes,</b> <b>calibrated</b> glass (50 -μL) - Razor blade - Syringes (1 cc) with 27 gauge × 1 / 2 -in. needles or scalpel (# 15 curved blade) (see Step 2) - Tape, laboratory label - Tissue (e. g., Kimwipe) ### METHOD *The total time needed for the experienced is 10 - 15 min and for the novice is 30 min*. 1. Use a platinum wire pick to move ~ 5 gravid C. elegans hermaphrodites from a culture dish to a single-depression microscope slide mostly filled with M 9 buffer for agar mounts. - *The number of hermaphrodites needed depends on the number of embryos required at the appropriate stage*. - By holding a syringe with a needle in each hand, place the needles on either side of a hermaphrodite, and draw the flat sides of the tips of the needles across each other to cut the worm in half transversely (Fig. 1 A,B). The embryos will be released from the halves of the hermaphrodite. Use an eyelash brush to carefully prod the halves to expel any remaining embryos. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Isolation of *C. elegans* embryos and preparation for mounting on a slide. (A,B) Gravid hermaphrodites are cut in half with 27 × 1 / 2 -in. needles. (C) At a higher magnification, embryos are sorted and are grouped using an eyelash. (D) Embryos and M 9 buffer are transferred using a mouth pipette. *It is important to cut as close to the vulva as possible to release newly fertilized embryos in the uterus. This step can also be conducted by cutting the worm in half with a # 15 curved blade scalpel*. 3. Sort the embryos using the eyelash brush, and brush them together into a group of ~ 10 embryos (Fig. 1 C). *Embryos will tend to stick slightly to each other when grouped. If you desire a certain stage of embryogenesis, it is at this point that the embryo stage should be assessed and the embryos sorted appropriately. Two-cell stage embryos are the easiest developmental stage to collect*. 4. Make an agar pad: - i. Using laboratory label tape, tape two flat microscope slides parallel and one slide width apart on the laboratory bench. - ii. Place a third slide between the two taped slides (Fig. 2 A). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2. ** Making an agar pad. (A) Three slides are placed on the bench, and the outer two are taped down to the bench. (B) A drop of molten 5 % agar is placed onto the middle slide. A fourth slide is then placed perpendicular to the three original slides. The top slide is compressed over the taped slides. (C) The finished slide is sealed with valap. Using a toothpick to make hash marks in the valap (arrows) aids in finding the grouping of embryos on the compound scope. - iii. Using a 6 -in. Pasteur pipette, place three to four drops of molten 5 % agar onto the middle slide. - iv. Immediately lay the fourth slide perpendicular to the other three slides over the agar, and press it over the taped slides to flatten the agar before it cools (Fig. 2 B). 5. Once the agar has set, use a razor blade to trim excess agar from the edges of the slides. Carefully slide apart the untaped slides, so that the agar pad is left in the center of one slide. *See Troubleshooting*. 6. Prepare a mouth pipette: - i. Heat a glass 50 -μL pipette in the flame of a Bunsen burner. - ii. Once the glass is soft and fluid, remove it from the flame, and quickly pull apart the ends. - iii. Break the two ends apart to create a pipette with a tapered end with a diameter of ~ 40 μm. - iv. Place the pipette in a mouth pipette aspirator. 7. Using the mouth pipette, transfer the grouping of embryos (from Step 3) and ~ 20 μL of M 9 buffer to the corner of the agar pad on the microscope slide (Fig. 1 D). 8. Brush the embryos out of the M 9 buffer {{into the center of the}} slide using the eyelash. Position the embryos in a single layer side by side. 9. Set the edge of a coverslip at the side of the agar pad opposite the M 9 buffer and slowly drop it so that the coverslip lands on the embryos before it contacts the M 9 buffer. Use a tissue to wick excess buffer from the edges of the coverslip, and wick air bubbles from under the coverslip. *See Troubleshooting*. 10. Trim excess agar from the edges of the coverslip using a razor blade. Seal the edges of the coverslip with melted valap for agar mounts using a paintbrush (Fig. 2 C). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The agar pad dries to the slide before it can be used. **[Step 5]** - **Solution**: Make the pad immediately before use. Stereomicroscopes with light sources mounted under the stage have the potential to heat the stage after long use, which can quickly dry agar pads. Using a stereomicroscope with an external bulb or a cool temperature bulb will reduce this problem. - **Problem**: When a coverslip is placed on the slide, all the embryos wash to the edge of the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Too much M 9 buffer is used, and the M 9 buffer is hitting the embryos before the coverslip can land on them and hold them in the agar. Use less M 9 buffer. - **Problem**: The slide has air bubbles under the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Use more M 9 buffer. This will allow M 9 buffer to completely wash under the coverslip. Too much M 9 buffer, however, will cause embryos to wash away (see previous problem). - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop after mounting. - **Solution**: Consider the following: - i. One-cell embryos are especially vulnerable to mechanical stress and are challenging to mount without killing. If studying a later stage of development, the likelihood of embryos surviving is markedly increased if two-cell or later stage embryos are used to make the mount. - ii. Groupings larger than 15 - 20 embryos often display increased lethality caused by oxygen starvation. By keeping groupings of embryos around 10 embryos, oxygen starvation should not be a problem. ### DISCUSSION Mounting *C. elegans* embryos on agar mounts provides a stable long-term environment for microscopic analysis of development. The slight compression from the coverslip will result in embryos reproducibly positioned with either the left or the right side facing toward the objective lens. During later stages of embryogenesis, embryos turn such that left-side views become dorsal views and right-side views become ventral views. Embryos on agar mounts will survive and will hatch from the eggshell on the mount. Embryos prepared with an agar mount are amenable to both light microscopy (with differential interference contrast [DIC] optics) and confocal microscopy. Alternative methods for mounting embryos, such as poly-L-lysine-coated slides with grease feet (see [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] [Mohler and Isaacson 2010]) or polymer beads, are often used to avoid compression to the embryo. However, these techniques typically result in random embryo orientation, which can complicate analysis of development. Additionally, the slight compression of the coverslip seems to have little to no effect on development; in most cases, avoidance of such compression is unnecessary. In conclusion, preparing *C. elegans* embryos on an agar mount is a simple technique that can be easily mastered and is regularly performed by undergraduates in the investigators’ laboratories. It provides a consistent embryonic orientation and environment that is suitable for long-term microscopy of *C. elegans* embryos. ### REFERENCES 1.
