25|$|Larger hardstone carvings and cameos, {{which are}} rare in {{intaglio}} form, {{seem to have}} reached Greece around the 3rd century; the Farnese Tazza is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the dates assigned to the Gonzaga Cameo and the <b>Cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemies), but other glass-paste imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.

25|$|In one Greek vase painting, Helios appears riding {{across the}} sea in the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delphic tripod {{which appears to be}} a solar reference. Athenaeus in Deipnosophistae relates that, at the hour of sunset, Helios climbed into a great golden cup in which he passes from the Hesperides in the {{farthest}} west {{to the land of the}} Ethiops, with whom he passes the dark hours. While Heracles traveled to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely, in turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail {{across the sea}} every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles' actions immensely bold. Heracles used this golden cup to reach Erytheia.|$|E
25|$|During the night, nectar is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flower. This is commonly associated with flowers specialising in pollination by bats. Common brown lemurs Eulemur fulvus were seen fouraging from Brexia flowers in the early morning. These primates took the inflorescences with their hands and bent these to lick the nectar from the flower cups. This was repeated in other nearby specimens of Brexia immediately after. Flowers were not damaged, {{and it is likely}} the lemurs assisted the pollination. B. madagascariensis grows in coastal vegetations on a range of soil types such as coral, sand, loam or coarse rocky ground, in places like the edges of saline water swamp forest, mangrove swamps, evergreen shrubland and other forest types near the sea. In Tanzania it has been found in an almost pure stand of Maesopsis eminii. The fruit can float in sea water for many months and the numerous dark seeds within remain viable.|$|E

On May 25, 2014, Donovan scored twice against the Philadelphia Union to break Cunningham's record of 134, making Donovan MLS's All-Time leading goalscorer with 136 goals.

25|$|The Sarmatians had a near-religious {{fondness for}} their swords: tribal worship was {{directed}} at a sword sticking up from the ground, similar to the sword in the stone. They carried standards {{in the form of}} dragons. Ossetian Nart sagas contain a number of interesting parallels to the Arthurian legends. First, the life of the Nart warrior (batraz) is tied to his sword, which must be thrown into the sea at his death. When one wounded Batraz asks his last surviving comrade to do the task for him, his companion tries to fool him twice before finally hurling the weapon into the sea; rather like Arthur's wondrous sword Excalibur which had to be returned to the Lady of the Lake at his death by his last surviving knight, Bedivere, who only did the deed on his third trip to the lake. The Nart heroes Soslan and Sosryko, collect the beards of vanquished enemies to trim their cloaks like Arthur's enemy Rience: the subjects of both stories have one last beard to obtain before the cloak is complete. Two other similar motifs are the <b>Cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Narts (Nartyamonga), which appeared at feasts, delivered to each person what he liked best to eat, and which was kept by the bravest of the Narts ('Knights') - somewhat similar to the Holy Grail connected to the Arthurian cycle – and the magical woman, dressed in white, associated with water, who helps the hero acquire his sword – similar to the Lady of the Lake.|$|E

500|$|It {{seems that}} the vessel's pagan origins were {{overlooked}} when it was converted into a Christian chalice during the Middle Ages. Classicist Erika Zwierlein-Diehl noted that many descriptions of the cup omitted the Dionysiac nature of the carvings and images, merely noting the general presence of trees, heads, and animals. This (possibly purposeful) loss of iconographic understanding, {{also referred to as}} [...] "un-naming", {{seems to have been a}} way for pagan artifacts to be reused for Christian purposes; the <b>Cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemies is therefore an example of interpretatio christiana, or the adaptation of non-Christian elements of culture or historical facts to the worldview of Christianity.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemies (French: Coupe des Ptolémées) is an onyx cameo two-handled cup, or kantharos. The cup, {{decorated}} with Dionysiac vignettes and emblems, was carved {{at some point}} in Classical Antiquity, probably in Alexandria. Eventually, it found its way into the treasury of the French kingdom, before it was donated to the abbey of St. Denis. During the Middle Ages, it was used as a Christian chalice, and lavish mounts were added, with Latin inscriptions. In 1804, the cup was stolen, and the mounts were lost, although the cup itself was recovered. [...] It is now in the Cabinet des Médailles at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris.|$|E
