5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed <b>Clinical</b> <b>Social</b> Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Assertive {{community}} treatment (ACT) failed {{to develop in}} Europe, and its efficacy is debated. In Lausanne, Switzerland, ACT focuses on difficult-to-engage patients and aims to facilitate linkage with outpatient care through time-limited interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of time-limited ACT. Methods: We retrospectively assessed <b>social,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and functional outcomes and motivation for treatment in 75 consecutively seen subjects treated between 2000 and 2002. Results: With 70 % of the interventions lasting less than 6 months, we observed significant improvement in most <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> problems, in collaboration, in motivation for treatment, and in social network support, despite high baseline levels of <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> problems. The number of hospitalizations decreased significantly. Conclusions: Time-limited ACT is a useful treatment for difficult-to-engage patients with severe <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> problems, and it facilitates linkage to care. This narrower target for ACT may facilitate its implementation in Europe. (Can J Psychiatry 2005; 50 : 845 – 850) Information on author affiliations appears {{at the end of}} the article...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the distinctions between}} the client-keyworker relationship and the client-vocational worker relationship by assessing their impact on clinical outcomes and exploring the associations between the two. METHODS: As part of an international randomised controlled trial of supported employment (n = 312), client-keyworker relationship and client-vocational worker relationship were each tested against <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> functioning 6 months later. Associations between the two relationships over time were explored. RESULTS: Client-keyworker relationship predicted quality of life, while client-vocational worker relationship, as rated by the client, did not predict any <b>clinical</b> or <b>social</b> functioning outcomes. Vocational worker-rated relationship predicted reduced depression. The client-keyworker and client-vocational worker relationships were correlated, but this did not change over time. CONCLUSION: The impact of the client-vocational worker {{is likely to be}} on the shared task of finding employment, rather than on <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> functioning. Good client-vocational worker relationships do not detract from client-keyworker relationships...|$|R

The compliance rate was increased significantly in the trial group, and they had better <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> outcomes. Conclusions.

25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed <b>clinical</b> <b>social</b> worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E

40|$|Background: Concerns are {{frequently}} expressed that working might worsen {{the mental health}} of people with severe mental illness (SMI). Several studies of Individual Placement and Support (IPS), however, have found associations between working and better nonvocational outcomes. IPS has been found to double the return to work of people with SMI in 6 European countries. Aims: To explore separately associations between IPS, returning to work, and <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> outcomes. Methods: Patients (n = 312) in a randomized controlled trial of IPS in 6 European centers were followed up for 18 months. Results: There were no differences in <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> functioning between IPS and control patients at 18 months. Those who worked had better global functioning, fewer symptoms, and less social disability at final follow-up; greater job tenure was associated with better functioning. Working was associated with concurrently better <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> functioning, but this contrast was stronger in the control group, suggesting that IPS was better than the control service at helping more unwell patients into work. Working was associated with having been in remission and out of hospital for the previous 6 months. It was also associated with a slight decrease in depression and with being in remission over the subsequent 6 months. Conclusions: Concerns among clinicians about possible detrimental effects of working and supported employment have been misplaced. Although some of the associations found may have been selection effects, there is sufficient evidence of work having beneficial effects on <b>clinical</b> and <b>social</b> functioning to merit further exploration...|$|R
