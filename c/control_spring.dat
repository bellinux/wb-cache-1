Improvements included a new ice sheet with {{state of the art}} chilling system, improved climate <b>control,</b> <b>spring</b> loaded boards, seamless glass, new overhead center scoreboard, reconfigured penalty boxes, more spacious aisles, and seating with improved sight lines. Seating capacity was reduced from 2,504 to 2,225 to accommodate the changes.

50|$|There {{had been}} {{interest}} {{in building a}} dam in the eastern Snake River Plain {{for many years to}} <b>control</b> <b>spring</b> runoff and provide a more constant water supply in the summer. The area had suffered a severe drought in 1961, followed by serious flooding in 1962. The Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) proposed the Teton Dam in 1963 and Congress passed without opposition an authorizing bill the following year. The planned dam was to be an earthen structure 310 ft high and 0.6 mi long and create a reservoir 17 mi in length. The impounded water would be used to generate hydroelectric power. An environmental impact statement was issued for the dam in 1971, but it did not raise the possibility of a collapse. Lack of funding, site prep work and questions surrounding the required environmental impact statement saw project stall. Barely 14 pages long, the statement quickly drew the ire of opponents of the project.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} zero power control method for a {{permanent}} magnetic suspension system consisting mainly of a permanent magnet, an actuator, sensors, a suspended iron ball and a spring. A system using this zero power control method will consume quasi-zero power when the levitated object is suspended in an equilibrium state. To realize zero power <b>control,</b> a <b>spring</b> is installed in the magnetic suspension device to counterbalance the gravitational force on the actuator in the equilibrium position. In addition, an integral feedback loop in the controller affords zero actuator current when the device is in a balanced state. In this study, a model was set up for feasibility analysis, a prototype was manufactured for experimental confirmation, numerical simulations of zero power control with nonlinear attractive force were carried out based on the model, and experiments were completed to confirm the practicality of the prototype. The simulations and experiments were performed under varied conditions, such as without springs and without zero power <b>control,</b> with <b>springs</b> and without zero power <b>control,</b> with <b>springs</b> and with zero power <b>control,</b> using different <b>springs</b> and integral feedback gains. Some results are shown and analyzed in this paper. All results indicate that this zero power control method is feasible and effective for use in this suspension system with a permanent magnet motion feedback loop...|$|R
50|$|A {{feature in}} the design of the leading bogie was that the bogie frame was a single steel casting to which the cast steel horns were bolted to take the axle boxes. An {{innovation}} was the arrangement of the laminated side <b>control</b> <b>springs</b> in combination with two point swing links, which would be part of all Hendrie's subsequent designs. To prevent trouble which had been experienced earlier owing to the fracture of the smokebox saddle and frame stretcher castings which contained steam chest passages, and also leakage at exhaust joints, the blast pipe breeches were made separate castings and not integral with the centre stretcher casting.|$|R
50|$|The {{object with}} an {{articulated}} locomotive is to distribute traction power over {{a larger number}} of driving wheels with a flexible wheelbase.

On curves, the front engine unit could move several inches laterally under the boiler barrel. Side <b>control</b> <b>springs</b> acted as a centering device for the engine unit.|$|R
