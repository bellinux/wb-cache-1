50|$|Some {{computer}} text editors, such as Emacs and vi, originally {{relied on}} double-spacing to recognize sentence boundaries. By default, Emacs will not break a line {{at a single}} space preceded by a period, but this behavior is configurable (with the option sentence-end-double-space). There are also functions to move the cursor forward or backward to the next double-space in the text. In Vim the joinspaces setting indicates whether extra spaces are inserted when joining lines together, and the J flag in cpoptions indicates whether a sentence must be followed by two spaces. The GNU Coding Standards recommend using two spaces when coding <b>comments.</b> The <b>optional</b> Emacs mode LaTeX provides a toggling option French-LaTeX-mode which, if set to French, creates single sentence spacing after terminal punctuation.|$|R

5000|$|The DVI format was {{designed}} to be compact and easily machine-readable. Toward this end, a DVI file is a sequence of commands which form [...] "a machine-like language", in Knuth's words. Each command begins with an eight-bit opcode, followed by zero or more bytes of parameters. For example, an opcode from the group 0x00 through 0x7F (decimal 127), set_char_i, typesets a single character and moves the implicit cursor right by that character's width. In contrast, opcode 0xF7 (decimal 247), pre (the preamble, which must be the first opcode in the DVI file), takes at least fourteen bytes of parameters, plus an <b>optional</b> <b>comment</b> of up to 255 bytes.|$|R

50|$|The {{streaming}} archive {{format is}} designed to be extracted in a single pass. An archive is divided into a sequence of blocks that can be decompressed independently in parallel. Blocks are divided into segments that must be decompressed sequentially in order. Each block header contains a description of the decompression algorithm. Each segment has a header containing an optional file name and an <b>optional</b> <b>comment</b> for meta-data such as size, date, and attributes, and an optional trailing SHA-1 checksum of the original data for integrity checking. If the file name is omitted, it is assumed to be a continuation of the last named file, which may be in the previous block. Thus, inserting, removing, or reordering the blocks in a streaming archive has the effect of performing the same operations on the data that the blocks represent.|$|R

40|$|With {{the simple}} act of copy-and-paste, a user can easily extract {{excerpts}} from a myriad of existing information sources and then combine and elaborate the extracted information in an unlimited number of new contexts. But we can do much more by automatically capturing the provenance of the excerpts and allowing the users to revisit the original information, in context. Our work with our colleagues over the past decade has been developing the notion of superimposed information [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] where the user can easily create a mark to any selected bit of information. A mark is an encapsulated address, with associated metadata, that can be stored in a repository and easily referenced and used {{from a wide variety of}} what we call superimposed applications. The key feature of a mark is that the user can always return to the original application, with the original selection highlighted, in its original context. Our work to date has required minimal support from existing applications – namely the ability to create a mark and the ability to go to mark. We have built various superimposed applications that use marks including: a simple scratchpad tool (called SLIMPad [, RIDPad, and now Sidepad [5]) that allows the user to place and arrange marks (with a title and an <b>optional</b> <b>comment)</b> into groups...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the type of support provided by mentors in helping new principals develop instructional leadership skills. Perceptions were investigated to determine if principals believed participation in mentoring programs (both statewide and district-created) was effective in providing the necessary support during their initial years as administrators to help develop skills needed to address the accountability measures in place for today's schools and to help principals become successful instructional leaders. Quantitative data were obtained through a researcher created survey completed by forty-five beginning principals. Follow-up, semi-structured interviews with six principals provided qualitative data, along with <b>optional</b> <b>comments</b> from the survey. The study findings revealed no significant differences between the two types of mentoring programs in the support provided to beginning principals to assist in developing instructional leadership skills. In addition, data indicated both programs were weak in providing the targeted support. Additional methods of developing these skills were also investigated. Implications for practice were identified to assist in making improvements to both statewide and district-created mentoring programs. In addition, improvements to university preparatory programs and internship opportunities were suggested...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{corporate}} culture are mostly limited to samples drawn from management, and the integrative view of corporate culture as something unique within an organisation still dominates in the literature. Such a unitary stance bears {{the risk that}} cultural divergences in corporations remain undetected, thereby limiting the value of research {{on corporate}} culture. A further aspect {{found in the literature}} is the complexity and variety ascribed to corporate culture, which exacerbates practical implementation of the concept. The operationalisation of the cultural concept is still a prevalent problem not yet completely resolved. This research addresses these two concerns. The researcher conducted this research at Post CH Ltd. The study incorporated the design and implementation of a tailored survey, based on cultural dimensions from the literature, items from Swiss Post’s employee survey, and data from semi-structured qualitative interviews with members of top management. The survey involved employees of Post CH Ltd from all hierarchical levels, selected by proportionate stratified random sampling. The two thirds of the questionnaire recipients who responded could also <b>comment</b> on an <b>optional</b> open question. The researcher then analysed the qualitative and quantitative data in order to discover the degree of alignment on corporate culture. Finally, recommendations were elaborated on how to mitigate the explored divergences between management and employees. This research provides contributions in two distinct areas: first, it demonstrates that the perception of a unitary corporate culture is not always tenable. The researcher found distinctive and statistically significant divergences in corporate culture, as staff in line management positions are considerably more positive in their perception of corporate culture compared to employees without management responsibilities. Using content analysis, the researcher further discovered divergences in the perception of corporate culture between top management and employees. Second, it demonstrated the successful operationalisation of corporate culture research into practical application, by offering a thorough, concrete, specific, and tailored approach, contributing to a more practitioner friendly usage of the concept of corporate culture. The methods used here can be applied to other organisations in a similar way.

U perspektivi, upravljanje dokumentima komandno-informacionih sistemima Vojske Srbije biće zasnovano na sistemima upravljanja sadržajima. / Introduction The paper {{explains}} {{the importance and}} the role of content management systems, gives an overview of the functionality required by such systems and makes a categorization of existing content management systems, thus performing, to some extent, a systematization of this area. Internet technologies and e-business Electronic business is a set of business activities that occur by ICT, especially Internet. CMS existence is conditioned by the development of Internet technology. Basic terminology, problem and solution The basic terms of which problems are considered in this paper are Content, Content Management and Content Management System. Content management systems demand Content management systems demand is reflected in the following: (1) complex structure and a hierarchy of target groups are major challenges for the selection and implementation of an adequate system of content management in decision-making processes; (2) timely adoption of key decisions and their implementation is currently a considerable advantage over competitors; (3) by applying modern information and communication technologies and service-oriented architecture, content, especially documents, management provides security and protection of information in the process of content managing. Content management systems types This article describes the following types of content management systems: Document Management System, Digital Asset Management, Web Content Management and Learning Content Management. Content management systems basic parts The main parts of the content management system are: (1) Content integration, including any content manipulation (input, processing, display); (2) Version control, older versions of files are stored in the database (date of creation/change, and <b>optional</b> <b>comment).</b> Thanks to version control, web site can be restored later (rolled-back) to the previous version; (3) Workflow, allows defining processes in a few steps concerning the creation, review and approval of content publishing; (4) Content repositorium (relational, object or XML databases) greatly improves reuse and content management, especially when these items have a high repetition level; (5) Users management and their privileges; (6) User interface. Display of client and administrative console is done through a web browser; (7) Applications represent an addition to content management systems (business rules, API functions, search, forum, etc.) Content management systems classification Content management systems classification can be performed by different elements: (1) by type, where the content management system is a framework or system; (2) by license; (3) by used technology; (4) by price. The paper briefly {{explains the}} classification. Conclusion Future direction of research of content management system applications in the Serbian Army would be based on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} electronic document management system repositories, for example realistic management processes and data flows within the command and information system...|$|R
40|$|Haemonchus contortus is a {{gastrointestinal}} nematode {{of significant}} importance in Australia and worldwide. It prevails in tropical zones, summer rainfall regions and mostly coastal areas in temperate regions. The high fecundity {{of the female}} parasite {{and its ability to}} persist in sheep for extended periods of time has helped in this parasite’s development of resistance to multiple synthetic anthelmintics. The development of parasite anthelmintic resistance has been influenced by producers’ over-reliance on these chemicals to control parasites as well as poor management practices such as under-dosing. With the increased occurrence of multiple drug resistant parasites, other more sustainable methods are being investigated, including the use of medicinal plant extracts with anthelmintic properties, such as garlic. The subsequent meat quality of the animals after being fed these herbal concoctions to control parasites is not often investigated. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the use of garlic to control the gastrointestinal nematode H. contortus and then evaluate the subsequent meat quality by consumer taste panel. To look at garlic for the control of H. contortus a 14 -week feeding trial was conducted over the summer of 2008. The trial used thirty nine Merino wether lambs in five groups fed a high quality basal ration and infected with 4000 L 3 “Kirby” H. contortus larvae. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated negative control group, a positive control group treated with abamectin 28 days post infection and three treatment groups fed 0. 9 %, 1. 8 % and 3. 6 % garlic (included into the basal ration). There was no reduction in worm egg counts between the negative control and the garlic treatment groups. There was however a significant interaction between the effects of the treatments and VFI on WEC. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment group had significantly lower final liveweight, weight gain, and feed conversion efficiencies than the 0. 9 % and 1. 8 % garlic treatment groups. The tenderloins collected from all animals at slaughter {{at the end of the}} feeding trial were used in a consumer taste panel to assess the subsequent meat quality. The meat samples were assessed by 104 untrained participants in a blind tasting. Participants were asked to asses the meat samples of flavour, acceptability as well as an <b>optional</b> <b>comment</b> section. Participants rated the flavour of the meat from the garlic and control lambs the same. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment had a significantly higher percentage of “yes” responses for the panellists’ assessment of “acceptability as lamb”. The 3. 6 % garlic also had a significantly higher percentage of positive comments about the samples, suggesting that this lamb was more acceptable than the meat from the control animals. The results from these experiments suggest that fresh garlic included in a pelleted ration does not show potential to aid in the control of H. contortus and may have negative effects on production if fed at a rate of 3. 6 %. However the inclusion of garlic in a pelleted ration improved the acceptability of lamb as assessed by consumers, so there may be the potential for a niche product...|$|R
