Water saturation is set at four levels - 100, 70, 30 and 0 % - by drying the fully saturated specimen.

The measurement accuracy is evaluated using a reference specimen {{made up of a}} non-dispersive material. As expected, a linear decrease of RW velocity vs. porosity is observed for the intermediate saturation states, but not for the fully and dry states, possibly due to micro-cracks induced during the drying phase and to the presence of bubbles in the specimens with low w/c ratio. The comparison of phase velocity in specimens with low and high w/c ratio shows an inversion of the porosity gradient perpendicular to the surface of measurements, which is due to segregation of cement at high w/c ratio.

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{diffusion coefficient}} {{is considered to}} be a key factor for evaluating the service life of ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blended concrete. The chloride diffusion coefficient relates to both the concrete mixing proportions and curing ages. Due to the continuous hydration of the binders, the <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> of the concrete decreases and the chloride diffusion coefficient also decreases over time. To date, the dependence of chloride diffusivity on the binder hydration and curing ages of slag-blended concrete has not been considered in detail. To fill this gap, this study presents a numerical procedure to predict time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficients for slag-blended concrete. First, by using a blended cement hydration model, the degree of the binder reaction for hardening concrete can be calculated. The effects of the water to binder ratios and slag replacement ratios on the degree of the binder reaction are considered. Second, by using the degree of the binder reaction, the <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> of the binder paste at different curing ages can be determined.

This paper presents a digital image method {{for the analysis of}} soil pores. In the analysis of soil thin sections, the image threshold separating pore space from the surrounding solid, as well as the capillary pore size threshold separating air pores and capillary pores, was obtained by analysis of the thin sections of calibration samples where values of total porosity and <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> were pre-determined by traditional soil physics methods (IM). The total porosity and <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity,</b> as well as percentages of pores of a particular size, of all samples of similar soil type can then be determined by these image thresholds in thin section image analysis. The maximum capillary pore size in soils can also be determined. Because the thresholds for the total porosity and <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> are determined based on physical soil characteristics in this method, the error associated with existing methods (caused by subjective threshold estimates) was overcome. Small variations in results proved that this method has good accuracy and is acceptable. Any personal computer and flatbed scanner, along with any commercial remote sensing software (ENVI, PCI, ERDAS, etc.) and Geographic Information System software (ArcGIS, ArcView, SuperMap, etc.) are sufficient to complete the method.

The NT Build 361 Nordtest method is a standard for estimating the w/c ratio in hardened concrete {{and is based on}} the relationship between the ilc ratio and the <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> in the cement paste. The latter can be estimated using fluorescent light microscopy of concrete thin sections because the <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> is related to the intensity of the fluorescent light in the cement paste. The NT Build 361 method consists of visual comparison of the light intensity in unknown samples with reference samples.

However, there are a few problems to be overcome for image analysis to be reliable with respect to wlc ratio.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the Saltstone {{variability}} study is to identify (and, quantify the impact of) the operational and compositional variables that control or influence the important processing and performance properties of Saltstone mixes. A performance property for Saltstone mixes that is important but not routinely measured is the liquid permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cured Saltstone mix. The value for the saturated hydraulic conductivity is an input into the Performance Assessment for the SRS Z-Area vaults. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} a method available that allows for an accurate and reproducible measurement of permeability quickly and inexpensively. One such method that could potentially meet these requirements for the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity is the technique of beam bending, developed by Professor George Scherer at Princeton University. In order to determine the feasibility of this technique for Saltstone mixes, a summer student, David Feliciano, was hired to work at Princeton under the direction of George Scherer. This report details the results of this study which demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the beam bending method to measurement of permeability of Saltstone samples. This research effort used samples made at Princeton from a Modular Caustic side solvent extraction Unit based simulant (MCU) and premix at a water to premix ratio of 0. 60. The saturated hydraulic conductivities for these mixes were measured by the beam bending technique and the values determined were of the order of 1. 4 to 3. 4 x 10 {sup - 9 } cm/sec. These values of hydraulic conductivity are consistent with independently measured values of this property on similar MCU based mixes by Dixon and Phifer. These values are also consistent with the hydraulic conductivity of a generic Saltstone mix measured by Langton in 1985. The high water to premix ratio used for Saltstone along with the relatively low degree of hydration for MCU based mixes leads to high total and <b>capillary</b> <b>porosities.</b> These two conditions generally lead to higher permeabilities as has been well documented in the literature for typical cementitious pastes in water. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the hydraulic conductivities of these Saltstone mixes are relatively high...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} dust (EAFD) is a {{by-product}} of the electric steelmaking industry produced in large quantities around the world. In Saudi Arabia, a form of EAFD known as Bag House Dust (BHD) is being used in small amounts as concrete additive, because higher levels of addition caused excessive retardation of setting and hardening. The use of this material is recent, therefore {{little is known about}} its effects on durability. This research aims to examine effects of BHD additions on certain properties of cement pastes, mortars and concretes, particularly those believed to affect the susceptibility of embedded steel reinforcement to chloride-induced corrosion as this is a major cause of degradation of reinforced concrete structures in the Arabian Gulf region. Studies of the effects of 2 % BHD addition on pore solution chemistry of hydrated-cement pastes with various levels of internal chloride contamination indicated that both free chloride concentration and hydroxyl ion concentration increased. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel in chloride-contaminated mortars showed that the rates of corrosion were reduced slightly in the presence of BHD. Measurements of the coarse <b>capillary</b> <b>porosities</b> of hydrated-cement pastes revealed significantly lower results in 2 - 3 % BHD-specimens compared to plain cement pastes. Attempts to measure the consequent changes in apparent diffusion coefficients of chloride in related concrete specimens showed that the BHD additions caused no adverse effects on chloride penetration rates. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of steel bars embedded in mortars exposed to chloride ingress at 20 Â°C and 40 Â°C demonstrated that the threshold chloride level for the initiation of crevice corrosion was significantly increased by the presence of BHD. This was thought to be partly influenced by BHD in reducing bleeding which affects the integrity of the layer of hydration products formed around the steel surface. Having found that 2 - 3. 5 % BHD additions had no detrimental effects on the properties studied, the possibility of using chloride-free accelerators to increase levels of BHD addition without causing excessive retardation of cement hydration was investigated. Calcium nitrite and calcium formate were both found to be reasonably effective in increasing the rates of hardening of specimens with 8 % addition of BHD.

The two belite cements were fabricated by the hydrothermalâcalcinations route of fly ash class C in NaOH 1 M solution (FABC- 2 -N) and demineralized water (FABC- 2 -W). In the case of FABC- 2 -W, a densification of the CâSâH gel was produced at the temperature of 401 C, which favored the formation of pores B 3 nm in diameter leading to higher surface area values, compared with the CâSâH gel formed at 201 C. At a microscale, the temperature led to an increase of <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> (40. 05 lm) at a later age of hydration and, consequently, a decrease of compressive mechanical strength. In the case of FABC- 2 -N, the densification of the gel was less evident, but the increase of <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> (pores of diameter 40. 05 lm) was higher.

Based on experimental results and proposed paste models, stoichiometry factors of the reactions of cement and mineral admixtures are determined, and the corresponding kinetics is investigated. With the stoichiometry factors and kinetics, the microstructure of cement paste is modeled at two levels using a series of status-oriented computer models. The status of outer CSH layer at sub-micro-level is characterized by its small <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity,</b> while that of paste by w/c (or w/b) and cement degree of hydration (and degree of reactions in blended paste). Interfacial transition zone (ITZ) is characterized by a newly developed multi-aggregate approach. Mortar/concrete is modeled as a composite consisting of bulk paste, ITZ and aggregate particles. Starting from the simulated microstructures, diffusion tortuosity (ÏD) is computed at each level, except nano-level, through random walker simulations. Diffusion tortuosity of LD CSH (Low Density Calcium Silicate Hydrates) at nano-level is determined separately as ÏD LDCSH = 21. 76. At sub-micro-level, tortuosity of outer CSH layer ÏD OCSHL is found to be a function of the small <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity,</b> and at micro-level, ÏD P and ÏD ITZ are functions of large <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity.</b> In combination with the effective porosity, the computed diffusion tortuosity at each level can be transformed to formation factor, related to which electrical conductivity, chloride diffusion coefficients and permeability can be calculated through the definition of formation factor, the Nernst-Einstein equation and the Katz-Thompson equation, respectively. Most of the outputs of the models developed in this study have been compared to the experimental results and reasonable agreement has been observed...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePredicting the {{time-dependent}} {{performance of}} cement-based materials during hydration {{has been a}} challenge to many researchers {{from all over the}} world. In this context, numerical approaches present many advantages and can be considered as the only real alternative to obtain the properties starting from the microstructure. This paper presents a multi-scale strategy based {{on the development of the}} MuMoCC platform (Multi-scale Modelling of Computational Concrete). A combination of the NIST cement hydration model (CEMHYD 3 D) and the FE software Abaqus is proposed and applied to study the diffusion and mechanical behaviours of cement-based materials during hydration. The evolution of the effective diffusion coefficient, the elastic modulus and the compressive strength of mortar according to the <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> and the degree of hydration is put into evidence. For mechanical computations, both elastic and inelastic behaviours are considered. Firstly, the methodology was applied to a water-to-cement ratio (w/c) 0. 4 cement paste and mortar. Then and based on numerical simulations, a set of simplified formula relating the main engineering parameters of transport and mechanical behaviour to <b>capillary</b> <b>porosity</b> is proposed and addressed to researchers involved in modelling at meso-scale and who need input data coming from the cement paste scale.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of mortars containing different dosages of superabsorbent polymer (SAP) and distinct water/binder (W/B) ratios was measured. In addition, mechanical properties, <b>capillary</b> index and <b>porosity</b> of samples with 0 - 0. 9 wt. % SAP and 0. 66 - 0. 82 water/binder weight ratios were also evaluated at 28 days, using {{design of experiments}} (DoE). In general, the yield stress was the rheological parameter that better expressed the continuous absorption of water molecules persistence once the mechanical mixing was concluded. Spread on table and yield stress exhibited an opposite relationship described by a power correlation. Despite being prepared with additional water dosages, SAP-containing mortars showed a capillary index below those estimated for SAP-free mortars, while the flexural strength results remained invariable. As expected, SAP increased up to 18 % the moisture buffering capacity of the mortar, {{when compared to the}} reference sample (0 wt. % SAP). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} reactivity of burnt clays in connection with modified lime mortars. The theoretical part of the {{doctoral thesis}} {{provides an overview of}} the properties of lime mortars, their quality and ways of their degradation. The different types of burnt clays (brick powder, bentonites and burnt clay shale), their origin, properties and factors affecting their reactivity and methods of its evaluation are stated. The properties and reactivity of burnt clays are evaluated on the basis of determination of pozzolanic activity, mineralogical and chemical composition, surface area, density, content of the amorphous phase and granulometry in the experimental part of the doctoral thesis. The compositions of lime mortars containing burnt clays and evaluation of an impact of burnt clay on the properties of mortars in the fresh and hardened state are given. Consistency, bulk density, workability and air content of mortars in the fresh state are evaluated. Strength characteristics depending on the time, water absorbability, <b>porosity,</b> <b>capillary</b> attraction, adhesion, coefficient of diffusion resistance, frost resistance, shrinkage, mineralogical composition and microstructure of mortars in the hardened state are evaluated. Attention is also paid to the influence of the cellulose ether addition into the modified lime mortars...|$|R
40|$|Natural cement, {{also called}} "Roman cement", was invented {{at the end}} of the 18 th Century and played an {{important}} role in the development of civil engineering works until the 1860 s. More surprisingly, it was also used to restore historic buildings, such as gothic cathedrals. This paper deals with the mineralogy and the durability of natural cement, in the particular case of the Bourges Cathedral in France. This study illustrates the interest of this material particularly adapted in stone repair or substitution. Contrary to traditional mortars, the present samples are made of neat cement paste, revealed by the absence of mineral additions as quartz or carbonate sand. Several combined techniques (SEM-EDS, TGA, XRD) were carried out to determine the composition of the hydraulic binder rich in calcium aluminate hydrates. The raw marl at the origin of the cement production contains oxidized pyrites which consist in a potential source of sulphate pollution of the surrounding limestone. The exposition of the cement in urban environment leads to some weathering features as atmospheric sulphation. Finally a petrophysical approach, based on water <b>porosity,</b> <b>capillary</b> sorption and compressive strength, has been performed to demonstrate the durability and the compatibility of roman cement applied as a restoration mortar of historical building...|$|R
