40|$|Cadmium {{has been}} widely used as a coating to provide {{protection}} against galvanic corrosion for steels and for its natural lubricity on threaded applications.

Al slurry coatings have been developed as an alternative to replace cadmium coatings. The coatings were deposited on AISI 4340 steel and have been characterized by optical and electron microscopy.

40|$|Use of an ion {{microprobe}} and a laser microprobe {{to measure}} concentrations of corrosion-produced hydrogen on a microscopic scale. Hydrogen concentrations {{of several thousand}} ppm were measured by both analytical techniques below corroded and fracture surfaces of hot salt stress corroded titanium alloy specimens. This extremely high concentration compares with only about 100 ppm hydrogen determined by standard vacuum fusion chemical analyses of bulk samples. Both the ion and laser microprobes were used to measure hydrogen concentration profiles in stepped intervals to substantial depths below the original corroded and fracture surfaces. For the ion microprobe, the area of local analysis was 22 microns in diameter and for the laser microprobe, the area of local analysis was about 300 microns in diameter. The segregation of hydrogen below fracture surfaces supports a previously proposed theory that corrosion-produced hydrogen is responsible for hot salt stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>embrittlement</b> and cracking of titanium alloys. These advanced analytical techniques suggest great potential for many areas of stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement research, quality control, and field inspection of corrosion problems.

40|$|The methods {{available}} {{to study the}} correlation between properties and atomic structure of interfaces are critically assessed by considering the specific limitations. Studies of the behaviour of grain boundaries {{by means of the}} plate/sphere method are reported indicating that a few boundaries exhibit special properties which were observed for a particular interface independently of the property investigated (e. g. energy, <b>corrosion,</b> <b>embrittlement).</b> Most special boundaries were of high coincidence type. But not all high coincidence boundaries showed special properties. It seems the interatomic interaction which selects between special and "non-special" high coincidence boundaries. The properties of boundaries deviating from special misorientations were found to be controlled by the presence of (secondary) boundary dislocations. systematic studies of the properties of interphase boundaries between ionic crystals and noble metals showed that coincidence misorientations do not result in special behaviour which was observed only if close packed rows of atoms at the "surfaces" of the metal crystals "locked" into the "valleys" between close packed atomic rows at the "surfaces" of the ionic crystals ("lock-in" model of interphase boundaries). The basic idea of nanocrystalline materials is to generate a new type of solids by exploiting the highly distorted atomic structure existing in the core of grain (interphase) boundaries. This is achieved by reducing the crystal size of a polycrystalline material to a few nanometers (nanocrystalline material) so that the volume fraction occupied by interfaces (interfacial component) and crystals are comparable. The interfacial component of such a material consists of many (typically 1019 cm- 3) boundaries. As the structures of these boundaries are all different, the interfacial component (i. e. the sum of all boundary structures) resembles a frozen gas. Experimental studies of nanocrystalline materials support this hypothesis and suggest that interfaces may be used as a structural component for generating a gas-like solid state structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prestressing}} wires of {{prestressed concrete}} cylinder pipe (PCCP) provide core concrete with compressive stress to resist internal pressure. Broken wires resulting from <b>corrosion</b> and <b>embrittlement</b> may cause cracking in pipe wall {{and increase the}} risk of failure with time. In order to reveal the mechanism of longitudinal cracking in PCCP with broken wires, a simplified model is developed and the maximum number of broken wires to preclude onset of longitudinal cracking can be determined conveniently by the equations derived in this paper. Verification against results of finite element analysis shows that the presented method has decent accuracy for appropriate effective pipe length and wall thickness. By comparing the calculated maximum number of broken wires with the actual number of broken wires detected by inspection and monitoring technologies, longitudinal cracking in prestress loss zone can be predicted, thus aiding condition assessment of PCCP...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to produce highly {{pressurised}} electrolysers to increase the overall energy efficiency by eliminating mechanical compression. However, in-depth modelling of electrolysers suggests that electrolysis at atmospheric pressure is electrically more energy efficient if parasitic energy consumption and gas losses are incorporated in both cases. The reversible cell voltage increases with increasing pressures. The electrode activation and Ohmic losses, leakage current and inevitable heat losses increase the electrolysis voltage beyond the thermoneutral voltage and consequently heat removal from the stack becomes essential. The expected gas loss at various operating pressures is incorporated to reveal the energy consumption that would occur in practice. Comparison of total energy consumption at various operating pressure up to 700 atm is performed and atmospheric electrolysers are found more efficient at all levels.
