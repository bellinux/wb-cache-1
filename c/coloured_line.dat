The locomotive was wrapped in remembrance vinyls that included images of poppies, soldiers, and text from the 'For the Fallen' poem by Laurence Binyon. The locomotive nameplates read: 'Harry Patch The last survivor of the trenches' and included a <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> of all eight ribbons from the medals awarded to Patch.|$|E
25|$|There was {{demonstrable}} {{continuity in}} the south, {{even though the}} Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between {{the art of the}} north and that of the south. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of cross shafts took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced. The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The Wessexan hegemony and the monastic reform movement appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England {{from the end of the}} 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred decorative motif. Key early works are the Alfred Jewel, which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop Frithestan of Winchester, which are ornamented with acanthus leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of Byzantine art. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> drawings.|$|E
500|$|The {{back cover}} is {{decorated}} more simply, with no raised elements and purely geometric decoration of engraved lines, which are filled in with two pigments which now appear as the bright yellow {{and the dark}} colour, once apparently blue. [...] Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself, a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of 3mm squares, 21 tall and 10 wide. [...] Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped [...] "crosses", or squares standing on one corner, with additional stepped elements in the four corners and halfway up the vertical sides, between the two [...] "crosses". [...] The vertical axial line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right {{to the edges of}} the grid. [...] The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour. [...] This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages, as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles, and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous Sutton Hoo shoulder-clasps. [...] The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect, as the top framing line was extended too far to the left. [...] Traces of an uncoloured first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side, above the <b>coloured</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

60|$|And {{you must}} not imagine this dustless, spotless, sweet {{apartment}} as anything but beautiful. Its appearance is a little unfamiliar of course, but all the muddle of dust-collecting hangings and witless ornament that cover the earthly bedroom, the valances, the curtains to check the draught from the ill-fitting wood windows, the worthless irrelevant pictures, usually a little askew, the dusty carpets, and all the paraphernalia about the dirty, black-leaded fireplace are gone. But the faintly tinted walls are framed with just one clear <b>coloured</b> <b>line,</b> as finely placed as the member of a Greek capital; the door handles and {{the lines of the}} panels of the door, the two chairs, the framework of the bed, the writing table, have all that final simplicity, that exquisite finish of contour that is begotten of sustained artistic effort. The graciously shaped windows each frame a picture--since they are draughtless the window seats are no mere mockeries as are the window seats of earth--and on the sill, the sole thing to need attention in the room, is one little bowl of blue Alpine flowers.|$|E
60|$|The {{explanation}} of this curious little fact is not difficult. I will not attempt any geometrical reasoning, but will give only a practical illustration. In doing this, I shall {{first have to}} allude to a point which was almost passed over when treating of Twining-plants. If we hold in our left hand a bundle of parallel strings, we can with our right hand turn these round and round, thus imitating the revolving movement of a twining plant, and the strings do not become twisted. But if we hold {{at the same time}} a stick in our left hand, in such a position that the strings become spirally turned round it, they will inevitably become twisted. Hence a straight <b>coloured</b> <b>line,</b> painted along the internodes of a twining plant before it has wound round a support, becomes twisted or spiral after it has wound round. I painted a red line on the straight internodes of a Humulus, Mikania, Ceropegia, Convolvulus, and Phaseolus, and saw it become twisted as the plant wound round a stick. It is possible that the stems of some plants by spontaneously turning on their own axes, at the proper rate and in the proper direction, might avoid becoming twisted; but I have seen no such case.|$|E
60|$|We towed out slowly. We saw him {{land and}} watch {{us from the}} beach. A figure {{approached}} him humbly but openly--not at all like a ghost with a grievance. We could see other men running towards him. Perhaps he had been missed? At any rate {{there was a great}} stir. A group formed itself rapidly near him, and he walked along the sands, followed by a growing cortege and kept nearly abreast of the schooner. With our glasses we could see the blue ribbon on his neck and a patch of white on his brown chest. The bay was waking up. The smokes of morning fires stood in faint spirals higher than the heads of palms; people moved between the houses; a herd of buffaloes galloped clumsily across a green slope; the slender figures of boys brandishing sticks appeared black and leaping in the long grass; a <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> of women, with water bamboos on their heads, moved swaying through a thin grove of fruit-trees. Karain stopped {{in the midst of his}} men and waved his hand; then, detaching himself from the splendid group, walked alone to the water's edge and waved his hand again. The schooner passed out to sea between the steep headlands that shut in the bay, and at the same instant Karain passed out of our life forever.|$|E

60|$|Vitis vinifera.--The tendril {{is thick}} and of great length; {{one from a}} vine growing out of doors and not vigorously, was 16 inches long. It {{consists}} of a peduncle (A), bearing two branches which diverge equally from it. One of the branches (B) has a scale at its base; it is always, as far as I have seen, longer than the other and often bifurcates. The branches when rubbed become curved, and subsequently straighten themselves. After a tendril has clasped any object with its extremity, it contracts spirally; {{but this does not}} occur (Palm, p. 56) when no object has been seized. The tendrils move spontaneously from side to side; and on a very hot day, one made two elliptical revolutions, at an average rate of 2 hrs. 15 m. During these movements a <b>coloured</b> <b>line,</b> painted along the convex surface, appeared after a time on one side, then on the concave side, then on the opposite side, and lastly again on the convex side. The two branches of the same tendril have independent movements. After a tendril has spontaneously revolved for a time, it bends from the light towards the dark: I do not state this on my own authority, but on that of Mohl and Dutrochet. Mohl (p. 77) says that in a vine planted against a wall the tendrils point towards it, and in a vineyard generally more or less to the north.|$|E

5000|$|The Rekord B {{had come}} with a curious [...] "strip speedometer", {{featuring}} a <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> that grew longer as speed increased, and which changed colour from green to yellow to red as the most common speed limit thresholds of 50 km/h and 100 km/h were crossed. Opinions were divided on the strip speedometer, and with the Rekord C Opel reverted to a conventional dial format speedometer, suggesting that for them too, the expanding colour changing strip speedometer {{had fallen out of}} fashion.|$|E
50|$|The main shirt sponsor was the Stobart Group, and {{the word}} 'Stobart' was written {{across the front of}} the shirt.

50|$|The {{first version}} of Tantrix was created by Mike McManaway in 1988 and was called Mind Gamehttp://www.tantrix.com/english/TantrixHistory.html. It used 56 {{cardboard}} pieces with only two <b>coloured</b> <b>lines,</b> red and black.http://www.tantrix.com/english/TantrixHistory.html Owning a games shop, McManaway sold the game directly and following customer feedback continued {{to change the rules}} and design. In 1991, the tiles were changed to plastic and two more colours were added, allowing for four-player games.|$|R
50|$|The {{volume of}} the {{pronounced}} drapery is geometrical, emphasised by <b>coloured</b> <b>lines</b> and glazing, contrasting with the flat tones of the background. In addition, the symmetry, frontality, hieratic nature and the very representation of God couldderive from Byzantine art, possibly via Italy. The bands of colour in the backgrounds, present in many Catalan Romanesque paintings, could remind us {{of what is known}} as Mozarabic illumination in tenth-century Hispanic manuscripts.|$|R
50|$|First Greater Manchester {{originally}} branded their frequent {{services as}} an Overground. Based on the London Underground network where each frequent service {{is given a}} recognisable colour, each Overground service was also allocated its own colour line. The concept was a prominent fixture on network maps and coloured vinyls applied to the buses frequently serving those routes. However, the brand has largely been dropped. The colours still remain on network maps but the vinyls {{for the most part}} have disappeared from the fleet's vehicles. The coloured routes are those with Monday - Saturday daytime frequencies of 15 minutes or better. This has allowed services such as the 67, 98, 519, 540 and 598 to keep their <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> despite the frequency of the service dropping under the 10 minutes minimum frequency.|$|E
50|$|At the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix, Pirelli {{introduced}} a coloured band {{around the outside}} of the tyre on the softer of the two dry compounds. This was due to confusion during {{the first round of the}} season. This measure was said to be a stop gap, with a permanent solution due to be implemented at the first European race of the season. The <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> featured at the Chinese Grand Prix too. From the Turkish Grand Prix, the permanent solution was implemented; the option compound had a new marking. The option tyre had two thick coloured lines between the Pirelli and P Zero logos of each tyre, which made it easier to see the colour of the marking when the tyre rotates. The prime tyre remained the same markings as previously, though later in the season had the sidewall updated with the new markings.|$|E
5000|$|Dendrelaphis tristis is a long, slender snake with {{a pointed}} {{head and a}} bronze <b>coloured</b> <b>line</b> running right down its back. Its diet {{includes}} geckos, birds and occasionally frogs. This harmless snake prefers the tree tops to life on the ground. It is camouflaged (made invisible by means of protective coloring [...] ) among the leaves because of its uniform ruddy brown skin. This active snake is restless and quick, both {{on the ground as}} well as in the trees. Generally a lively and plucky snake, its disposition varies from one example to another. It is found in southern India and the Himalayan foothills. This oviparous (egg laying animal e.g. birds) snake lays its eggs between September and February. The 6-7 eggs in a clutch, or number of eggs laid at once, hatch 4-6 weeks after laying; that is, they have a gestation period of 4-6 weeks.|$|E

50|$|The artwork {{featured}} in this station under the Art in Transit programme is Art Lineage by Erzan Adam.

The artist then digitised and overlayered the images to create a single piece, which is now displayed on the lift shaft in the station.|$|R
