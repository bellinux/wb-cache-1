5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the <b>corolla</b> tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and <b>corolla</b> are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued {{from the mouth}} of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina. The next day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in <b>Corolla,</b> North Carolina before the storm moved ashore. In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.|$|E
50|$|The class {{later to}} {{become known as}} Supertouring, it {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} Toyota <b>Corollas</b> and a Toyota Carina and a group of older modified Group A touring cars, BMW M3s, Ford Sierras and Toyota <b>Corollas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} nearly invisible; male flowers have {{translucent}} <b>corollas</b> and simple yellow stamens and female flowers, if they occur, lack <b>corollas</b> altogether. This is a plant of mineral-rich waterways such as intermittent streams and alkali flats.|$|R

5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and <b>Corolla</b> were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. The first generation Nova and the donor <b>Corolla</b> were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Despite Tahara's {{large-scale}} automation, Lexus LS production {{also involves}} specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle's V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation. With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced. The production standards {{used on the}} Lexus LS were eventually adopted by the manufacturer for other vehicles; in 2007, the assembly of Toyota <b>Corolla</b> economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.|$|E
5|$|During Stearn's initial {{four years}} in Cambridge (1929–1933), he {{published}} twenty-four papers, predominantly in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Gardening Illustrated and the Journal of Botany, his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had observed a specimen of Campanula pusilla (Campanula cochleariifolia) with a distorted <b>corolla.</b> He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library.|$|E

5|$|Holden {{began to}} sell the subcompact Suzuki Swift-based Barina in 1985. The Barina was {{launched}} concurrently with the Suzuki-sourced Holden Drover, followed by the Scurry later on in 1985. In the previous year, Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the Holden Astra, {{as a result of}} a deal with Nissan. This arrangement ceased in 1989 when Holden entered a new alliance with Toyota, forming a new company: United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI). UAAI resulted in Holden selling rebadged versions of Toyota's <b>Corolla</b> and Camry, as the Holden Nova and Apollo respectively, with Toyota re-branding the Commodore as the Lexcen.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 2001, the Toyota <b>Corolla</b> {{purchased}} by Mihdhar {{was found in}} Dulles International Airport's hourly parking lot. Inside the vehicle, authorities found a letter written by Mohamed Atta, a hijacker aboard American Airlines Flight 11; maps of Washington, D.C. and New York City; a cashier's check made out to a Phoenix, Arizona flight school; four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit; a box cutter; and a page with notes and phone numbers, which contained evidence that led investigators to San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and <b>corolla</b> (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of the species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but the species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Some species grow in dry areas, others in wet habitats, such {{as members of the}} section Simiolus, which are hydrophilic. Both overall plant size and <b>corolla</b> size vary greatly throughout the genus. A minimum of 25 of the species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow <b>corolla</b> around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was staying}} safely at Corfe Castle in Dorset {{with his mother}} when King John died. On his deathbed, John {{appointed}} a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most}} famous knights in England. The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October. In the absence of the archbishops of Canterbury or York, he was anointed by the bishops of Worcester and Exeter, and crowned by Peter des Roches. The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold <b>corolla</b> belonging to Queen Isabella.|$|E

50|$|Hummingbird beaks are {{flexible}} and their shapes vary dramatically as an adaptation for specialized feeding. Some species, such as hermits (Phaethornis spp.) have long bills {{that allow them}} to probe deep into flowers with long <b>corollae.</b> Thornbills have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short <b>corollae</b> and piercing the bases of longer ones. The sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved <b>corollae</b> of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae. The bill of the fiery-tailed awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the avocets. The male tooth-billed hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill.|$|R

5|$|The VE Commodore {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian market, where it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly double that of its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota <b>Corolla</b> in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 has helped to re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total Commodore sales. In 2007 the VE Commodore became the fifth Commodore model to receive the Wheels Car of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the <b>corolla)</b> and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota <b>Corolla</b> Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota <b>Corolla,</b> she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E
