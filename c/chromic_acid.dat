25|$|The cell {{provided}} 1.9 volts. It proved {{popular with}} experimenters {{for many years}} due to its relatively high voltage; greater ability to produce a consistent current and lack of any fumes, but the relative fragility of its thin glass enclosure {{and the necessity of}} having to raise the zinc plate when the cell was not in use eventually saw it fall out of favour. The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'.

25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, <b>Chromic</b> <b>acid</b> cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

Paper presented ut AESF 82 nd Technical Cotlference, SIJWIN 95 (Baltimore, Md, June 1995) CHEMISTRY OF CHROMIUM Chromium, Cr, also loosely called Chrome, is the twenty-first element in relative abundance with respect to the earth's crust, yet is the seventh most abundant element because Cr is concentrated in the earth's core and mantle.

40|$|The unusual {{nature of}} {{protoplasm}} to generate subprotoplasts spontaneously from disintegrated Bryopsis cells was examined. Protoplasm extruded from algal cells aggregated rapidly in cell sap which was derived mainly from huge central vacuoles of the cells. Electron microscopic observations revealed extensive agglutination of algal cellular membranes in the protoplasmic masses, {{suggesting that this}} is of primary importance for the wound-healing ability of the alga. Seawater caused spheration of the resultant protoplasmic aggregates. Gelatinous sheaths were formed temporarily surrounding the spherical protoplasmic masses before reformation of cell membrane. Staining with phosphotungstic and <b>chromic</b> <b>acids</b> suggested that new cell membrane was formed by fusion of the disintegrated original cell membrane with cytoplasmic vesicles on the surfaces of the protoplasmic masses. Both pH and salts {{were found to be}} essentially important at the two steps of subprotoplast generation. The newly formed cell membranes were responsible for subsequent notable plasmolysis of the wounded cells in seawater. Thus, it is suggested that unicellular marine algae Bryopsis spp. naturally contain effective materials for agglutinating and fusing particular cellular membranes through the sequential aid of acidic cell sap and alkaline seawater after disintegration of the giant cells...|$|R
40|$|When {{stained with}} {{ruthenium}} red (RR), chick embryo cells infected with various strains of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and with avian leukosis viruses RAV- 1 and RAV- 3 showed {{an increase in}} the layer of acid mucopolysaccharides (AMPS) at their surfaces as compared with uninfected cells. This increase was most prominent in cells infected with the Fujinami strain of RSV. The layer was resistant to digestion with neuraminidase or trypsin but was readily removed by exposure to hyaluronidase. The thickness of this AMPS layer was not correlated with the varying degree of loss of contact inhibition exhibited by cells infected with the different strains of virus. The staining of the cell envelope with a solution of phosphotungstic and <b>chromic</b> <b>acids</b> (PTA-CR) suggested the presence of glycoproteins. The outer surface of the virions showed the same staining as the cell surface with RR and PTA-CR, and the budding virus particle was seen to incorporate the RR layer of the cell into its structure.

50|$|Techniques for {{metallization}} {{started as}} early as mirror making. In 1835, Justus von Liebig discovered the process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver, making the glass mirror {{one of the earliest}} items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of ABS plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical conductor, the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot <b>chromic</b> acid-sulfuric <b>acid</b> mixture. The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in tin(II) chloride solution, then palladium chloride solution. The processed surface is then coated with electroless copper or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6 kgf/cm or 10 to 60 N/cm or 5 to 35 lbf/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal adhesion strength.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Electrochemical investigations concerning the corrosion resistance ofaustenitic steel samples were carried out by means of the potentiodynamic and elektrochemical impedancespectroscopy method. Findings: The analysis of the obtained results leads to the conclusion that chemical passivation affects also thechemical composition of the passive layer of steel and changes its resistance to corrosion. Electrolytic polishingimproves corrosion resistance, as can be proved by the shift {{of the value of the}} corrosion potential and breakdownpotential of the passive layer and the initiation of pittings.
