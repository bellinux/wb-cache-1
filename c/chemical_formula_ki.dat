When a scientist searches for a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> using a search engine today, she gets articles where the exact keyword string expressing the <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> is found. Searching for the exact occurrence of keywords during searching results in two problems for this domain: a) if the author searches for CH 4 and the article has H 4 C, the article is not returned, and b) ambiguous searches like "He" return all documents where Helium is mentioned as well as documents where the pronoun "he" occurs. To remedy these deficiencies, we propose a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> search engine. To build a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> search engine, we must solve the following problems: 1) extract <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> from text documents, 2) index <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae,</b> and 3) designranking functions for the <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae.</b> Furthermore, query models are introduced for formula search, and for each a scoring scheme based on features of partial formulae is proposed tomeasure the relevance of <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> and queries. We evaluate algorithms for identifying <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> in documents using classification methods based on Support Vector Machines(SVM), and a probabilistic model based on conditional random fields (CRF). Different methods for SVM and CRF to tune the trade-off between recall and precision forim balanced data are proposed to improve the overall performance. A feature selection method based on frequency and discrimination isused to remove uninformative and redundant features.

40|$|Abstract Background Mass spectrometry-based {{metabolomics}} analyses {{have the}} potential to complement sequence-based methods of genome annotation, but only if raw mass spectral data can be linked to specific metabolic pathways. In untargeted metabolomics, the measured mass of a detected compound is used to define the location of the compound in chemical space, but uncertainties in mass measurements lead to "degeneracies" in chemical space since multiple <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> correspond to the same measured mass. We compare two methods to eliminate these degeneracies. One method relies on natural isotopic abundances, and the other relies on the use of stable-isotope labeling (SIL) to directly determine C and N atom counts. Both depend on combinatorial explorations of the "chemical space" comprised of all possible <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> comprised of biologically relevant chemical elements. Results Of 1532 metabolic pathways curated in the MetaCyc database, 412 contain a metabolite having a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> unique to that metabolic pathway. Thus, <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> alone can suffice to infer the presence of some metabolic pathways. Of 248, 928 unique <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> selected from the PubChem database, more than 95 % had at least one degeneracy on the basis of accurate mass information alone. Consideration of natural isotopic abundance reduced degeneracy to 64 %, but mainly for formulae less than 500 Da in molecular weight, and only if the error in the relative isotopic peak intensity was less than 10 %. Knowledge of exact C and N atom counts as determined by SIL enabled reduced degeneracy, allowing for determination of unique <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> for 55 % of the PubChem formulae. Conclusions To facilitate the assignment of <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> to unknown mass-spectral features, profiling can be performed on cultures uniformly labeled with stable isotopes of nitrogen (15 N) or carbon (13 C). This makes it possible to accurately count the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in each molecule, providing a robust means for reducing the degeneracy of chemical space and thus obtaining unique <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> for features measured in untargeted metabolomics having a mass greater than 500 Da, with relative errors in measured isotopic peak intensity greater than 10 %, and without the use of a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> generator dependent on heuristic filtering. These <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> can serve as indicators for the presence of particular metabolic pathways. </p...|$|R
