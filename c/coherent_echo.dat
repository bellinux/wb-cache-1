In particular, both radar systems were observing continuously along the same magnetic meridian, which allowed for a detailed comparison between the line-of-sight (l-o-s) velocity data sets. It is shown that l-o-s velocity correlation for data points strictly matched in time (within 1 s) depends strongly on the number of ionospheric echoes detected by KOD in a given post-integration interval or, equivalently, on the KOD echo occurrence in that interval. The l-o-s velocity correlations reach 0. 7 – 0. 9 for echo occurrences exceeding 70 %, while also showing considerable correlations of 0. 5 – 0. 6 for occurrences as low as 10 %.

By only considering the observations from the narrow riometer beams comparable (in terms of the intersection with the ionosphere) with the VHF radar cells, we identify ~ 200 one-hour high correlation periods (HCPs) for 2 years near the solar cycle maximum, 2000 ? 2001. The HCP occurrence is maximized in the afternoon (12 : 00 ? 17 : 00 UT, MLT?UT+ 3), with the secondary peak near the midnight (21 : 00 ? 02 : 00 UT). Relative to the VHF echo occurrence, HCPs occur more frequently from 11 : 00 to 20 : 00 UT. The diurnal variation of HCP occurrence {{is similar to that}} of the 1 -h intervals with the lowest mean absorption A The HCPs are observed more frequently during the winter months, which, combined with the fact that VHF echoes observed during HCPs exhibit features typical for field-aligned E-region irregularities, makes their association with the polar mesospheric echoes (for which some positive CNA/SNR correlation has been reported in the past) very unlikely. Instead, we attribute the high positive CNA/SNR correlation to the synchronous, to a first approximation, variation of the particle fluxes for two different but close sets of energies. By considering the dependence of the CNA/SNR correlation coefficients for both VHF radars (C A 1 and C A 2) upon the correlation between SNRs for two radars (C 12), we show that both coefficients, C A 1 and C A 2, and the agreement between them decrease drastically with a C 12 decrease, which we interpreted through the progressively increasing role of the spatial inhomogeneity of the processes leading to the enhanced CNA and SNR. In this situation, a similarity between the radio signal collection areas should become important, and we demonstrate that the HCP occurrence and mean correlation coefficient decrease as the riometer beams and radar cells become less comparable in terms of mutual orientation and closeness between the points of maximum sensitivity.

40|$|In this thesis, {{several aspects}} of HF {{coherent}} backscatter from the high-latitude E and F regions are studied with {{the focus on the}} relationship between the echo characteristics and the parameters of the ionosphere. The Hankasalmi CUTLASS/SuperDARN radar is the primary instrument for the undertaken studies. The starting point in the research is that <b>coherent</b> <b>echo</b> characteristics are affected by two factors: the plasma physics of magnetic field-aligned irregularity formation and the propagation conditions in that the HF radio waves need to be close to the normal of the Earth’s magnetic field to detect the irregularities. Since the mechanisms of irregularity production are believed to be different at various heights, observations in the E and F regions are considered separately. For the F-region backscatter, we first investigate the ionospheric conditions necessary for backscatter to be detected at specific latitudes and in specific time sectors. To achieve this goal, two approaches are employed. First, a long-term statistical study of diurnal, seasonal and solar cycle effects on echo occurrence is done to assess the relative importance of changes in plasma instability conditions and radio wave propagation. Next, echo occurrence is studied for an area in which ionospheric parameters are measured by EISCAT and other instruments. Both approaches indicate that F-region echoes occur if the electric field is enhanced (above 5 - 10 mV/m). We show that, once the electric field is above the threshold, the echo power is only slightly dependent on it. We demonstrate that the strongest echoes are received when the F-region electron density is optimal for the selected range and altitude. This optimal value is found to be about 2 x 1011 m- 3 for the Hankasalmi radar. The role of the conducting E region on irregularity excitation and HF radio wave absorption are discussed. The next problem considered with respect to the F-region echoes is the relationship between the velocity of the F-region echoes and plasma convection. We give additional evidence that the observed HF line-of-sight velocity is the projection of the convection velocity on the radar beam and that the Map Potential technique (currently in use for building the global-scale convection maps) compares well with the local EISCAT convection measurements. With respect to the E-region backscatter, two major features are studied. First, a more detailed (as compared to the standard SuperDARN approach) analysis of the spectra is performed. By employing the Burg spectrum analysis method, we show that the E-region echoes are double-peaked in ~ 35 % of observations. Variations of the peak separation with the range and azimuth of observations are investigated. The occurrence of double-peak echoes is associated with scatter from two different heights within the E region. HF ray tracing indicates that for typical ionospheric conditions, scatter from the top and the bottom of the E region is possible at certain slant ranges. In the upper layer the plasma waves move with the velocity close to the ExB convection component. For the lower layer, the plasma wave velocity is reduced due to enhanced ion and electron collision frequencies. A second issue is how do the velocities of HF and VHF E-region echoes compare for observations along the same direction. We concluded that the velocity of E-region echoes at HF can be comparable to or below the VHF velocity and well below the ExB convection component, implying that the scatter can often come {{from the bottom of the}} electrojet layer. Other aspects of VHF velocities are also discussed...|$|E

Thus the short code sequence is equally good as a full cycle of alternating codes with the same pulse length and bit length.

40|$|During {{the past}} several years, the 440 -MHz radar at Millstone Hill has been {{modified}} to detect <b>coherent</b> <b>echoes</b> from clear-air turbulence in the stratosphere/troposphere (S/T) over the altitude range 4 - 25 km. Two distinct modes of data acquisition have been developed, and data reduction programs have been completed {{for one of these}} modes. This mode (I-mode) transmits a 10 microsec (1. 5 km) pulse on the fully steerable antenna. Typically, the antenna is set at a low elevation angle (e. g., 15 deg.) to reduce the altitude resolution to approximately 1 km., and power spectra are collected at some 40 range gates. The antenna may be scanned in azimuth to obtain the total wind vector, held fixed to monitor wave motion, or scanned in elevation to monitor the horizontal extent of the turbulent activity. This steerability gives Millstone a flexible system to focus on localized events, such as lee waves or convective storms. An additional advantage at low elevations is the relatively large Doppler shift of the signal, since the LOS velocity contains a large component of the horizontal velocity. This shift separates the turbulence signal sufficiently far from the ground clutter to allow the spectral moments to be readily inferred. Some 500 hours of S/T I-mode data have been reduced to geophysical parameters, and reside on a data base at Millstone Hill...|$|R
30|$|Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN; Chisham et al. 2007) is {{currently}} the widest high-frequency (HF) (8 – 20  MHz) radar network that actively utilizes ground backscatter (GB) to study ionospheric processes. The use of GB has been given special importance with {{the extension of the}} SuperDARN to mid-latitudes (Baker et al. 2007), where the percentage of ionospheric <b>coherent</b> <b>echoes</b> is sufficiently lower in comparison with polar and sub-polar regions. In contrast to ionospheric echoes, GB has a more regular and predictable behavior and can be successfully used for different scientific and applied purposes, such as monitoring HF propagation condition (Hughes et al. 2002; Bland et al. 2014), testing ionosphere models, and studying traveling ionospheric disturbances (Samson et al. 1990; Bristow et al. 1994; Karhunen et al. 2006; Chisham et al. 2007). The multimode character of GB, which is related to the multihop propagation mechanism and appearance of several HF waveguides, creates difficulties in automatic interpretation of radar data. Another limiting factor is the relatively low accuracy of GB mapping related to HF wave refraction caused by different regular (diurnal and seasonal ionosphere variations, solar activity) and irregular conditions (ionospheric disturbances, geomagnetic activity). Measurement of the elevation angle allows advancements in efficiently solving the mentioned problems (Milan et al. 1997). However, the shortcomings arising from regular ionospheric gradients and the lack of accuracy in mapping techniques remain in the latter case too.|$|R
40|$|VHF radar {{data from}} the Summer 1990 Equatorial Spread F {{campaign}} on Kwajalein are presented. The Cornell 50 MHz portable radar interferometer (CUPRI) operated concurrently with the Altair UHF incoherent scatter radar throughout July and August and supported two sounding rocket flights on July 30 and August 2. This experiment provided the first opportunity to simultaneously diagnose equatorial spread F using the three prime experimental techniques: VHF/UHF coherent scatter, incoherent scatter, and in situ probe measurements of electric field and density fluctuations. The intensity of the <b>coherent</b> <b>echoes</b> observed was consistent with typical Jicamarca spread F observations, but chains of periodic, large-scale plasma upwellings were observed more often and for much longer durations on Kwajalein than have been seen over Peru. CUPRI also measured Doppler frequencies in one upwelling corresponding to 1200 -m/s plasma drift velocities. This measurement agrees with recent observations of supersonic drift rates at the magnetic equator by spacecraft. Near the most active localized plasma upwellings, interferometer data reveal that the zonal drift rate of plasma irregularities can vary sharply in space, {{as one would expect}} for two-dimensional incompressible flow. We introduce a semiempirical model of the three-dimensional spectrum of F region irregularities that is consistent with the one-dimensional spectra of density fluctuations observed by sounding rockets and with the axial ratio of irregularities determined recently. Normalized to data from one of the rocket flights on Kwajalein, the model predicts the 3 -m scattering cross-section measured by CUPRI to within a few decibels...|$|R

The model incorporates both the RF phase and magnitude differences between the microstructure and <b>coherent</b> flaw <b>echo</b> spectra. An adaptive implementation of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) is presented for estimating A-scan amplitudes associated with coherent scatterers embedded in grain echoes. The adaptive implementation is motivated by the nonstationary behavior of the back-scattered energy received over {{the duration of the}} A-scan [1]. This nonstationarity results from the frequency dependent absorption, scattering, and diffraction that occurs as the pulse propagates through the materia...|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric {{irregularities}} are small-scale {{structures in}} plasma density {{aligned with the}} magnetic field that are formed by plasma instability processes and occur frequently in the auroral region of the ionosphere. <b>Coherent</b> scatter radar <b>echoes</b> from these irregularities convey information about the fine-scale structure of the auroral ionosphere during periods of geomagnetic activity. This subject has been studied extensively, however, {{the relationship between the}} coherent scatter spectral measurements and the ionospheric state parameters is not fully understood. Models of plasma waves, instability mechanisms, irregularities, and <b>coherent</b> <b>echoes</b> are required to further develop this understanding. This thesis presents three studies of the auroral E region ionosphere that use radar measurements and computational models to understand the significance of radar backscatter from field aligned irregularities observed by a 30 MHz coherent scatter radar in Homer, Alaska. The first study models the Farley Buneman instability by combining the global, 2 -D ionospheric model, SAMI 2, with a local, heuristic model developed by Milikh and Dimant [2002]. The model estimates profiles of wave phase speed, magnetic aspect width, wave heating rates, and ionospheric state variables. This model shows promising agreement with incoherent scatter radar measurements from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and coherent scatter radar measurements from the Homer radar. The second study uses an empirical model to invert measured coherent scatter spectra into estimates of convection velocity and then fits for the overall convection pattern. This model is informed by the simulations of Oppenheim et al. [2008]; Oppenheim and Dimant [2013] and formulas calculated by Nielsen and Schlegel [1985]. Comprehensive agreement between the convection velocity estimates and the convection pattern indicates an incompressible flow and validates the inversion. The third study examines E region ionospheric modification experiments that cause plasma instabilities and artificial irregularities. The study analyzes the threshold power needed to generate artificial irregularities due to the thermal parametric instability. SAMI 2 was modified to simulate the propagation of the HF pump waves and their heating effects. The model revealed that active suppression of the artificial irregularities occurs entirely due to D region absorption. This thesis concludes with a summary of these studies and suggestions for future research...|$|R
