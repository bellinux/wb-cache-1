2500|$|As {{the company}} grew, it {{increased}} its fleet from 242 to 582 buses {{over the next}} decade. In 1949, it took over the Bandra Bus Company, which used to ply buses in the suburbs. In 1951, the electricity division switched over from direct current (DC) to the more efficient alternating current (AC). The company launched its services in the eastern suburbs in 1955. That year, the Undertaking and private operators went to court, with the BEST asking for a complete closure of the private companies. The case dragged on for four years before the Supreme Court of India granted the organisation a complete monopoly over bus services in the Greater Bombay area. In 1964, due to high operational costs and poor public support, its long-running tram services were terminated. The company achieved the status {{of being the first}} company in the country to issue <b>computerised</b> <b>billing</b> in 1974. In 1994, the company introduced electronic meters, in a move to replace the less accurate electric meters.|$|E
50|$|In the Alipore Hospital Campus {{there is}} a Medical Store with 3 Qualified Pharmacists. This Medical Store serves 24/7 round-the-clock 365 days of the year. A <b>computerised</b> <b>billing</b> is also {{introduced}} in this Pharmacy which is also having Air-conditioners.|$|E

5000|$|Identity {{doctrine}} {{asserts that}} the [...] "root of all evil" [...] is paper money (in particular Federal Reserve Notes), and that usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews. The creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 shifted control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution. The money system encourages the Federal Reserve to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars of government debt and allowing international bankers to control America. Credit/debit cards and <b>computerised</b> <b>bills</b> are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture warning against [...] "the beast" [...] (i.e., banking) as quoted in [...] Identity preacher Sheldon Emry claims [...] "Most of {{the owners of the}} largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) Rothschild European banks", thus, in Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of property rate has been least tapped by decentralized governments in Ghana. This paper investigates the property rating system in Ghana through {{a case study}} of Offinso South Municipality (OSM). Questionnaires were used to gather empirical data from property owners in the municipality. The paper finds that there is inadequate property tax administration system and high public disdain for the property tax in OSM, with a significant association between compliance with the property tax and land use regulations in OSM. The paper suggests that the Offinso South Municipal Assembly (OSMA) should improve its land use planning system to facilitate voluntary compliance with the property tax. OSMA should also address accountability and transparency problems in the property tax system in order to increase public confidence in the tax regime. The OSMA should also improve on the property tax collection modes by <b>computerising</b> the <b>billing</b> and collection processes...|$|R
50|$|In 1968, {{the front}} hall and ground floor restaurants, {{including}} the Winter Garden, were redesigned, and the first <b>computerised</b> <b>billing</b> system in London was installed. The revolving doors {{and other parts of}} the foyer designed by Oliver Bernard were removed in this redesign, but were of such fine quality and historic interest, that the curators at the Victoria and Albert Museum requested them for their collection in 1969. The pieces were dismantled and stored in the museum's Battersea depot. The doors were exhibited in 2003 in the museum's major exhibition 'Art Deco: 1910-1939', following reconstruction.|$|E
