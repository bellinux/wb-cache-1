It is shown that when at least one public good is provided, then only dictatorial <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are incentive compatible. Dictatorial mechanisms are very unsatisfactory, as any conflict of interest is always resolved in favor of a single individual (the dictator).

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{examines}} the question: can economic resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{be used in}} distributed computing environments to reduce energy consumption whilst maintaining execution speed? This thesis investigates the use of several resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that {{take account of the}} power consumption and processing capacity of each available computing node within a distributed heterogeneous computing environment. Different economic resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have different attributes and allocate resources differently. The resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are evaluated to examine their effect on the time and energy required to process a workload of the sort that might be expected in a distributed computing system. Initial examination of the resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was conducted through the execution of artificial workloads on a simulated cluster. To further this research, a real cluster and grid environment was created from obsolete computers. An examination was undertaken of the use of obsolete computers in distributed computing environments and how the use of such systems may assist to mitigate electronic waste. The examination of resource allocation was continued on a cluster, and then on an institutional grid. The simulation model was then calibrated to the cluster and grid, which was then used to simulate the execution of real published grid workloads under each of the resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> under consideration were found to have different characteristics that resulted in them being suited for different types of workload. It was also found that the choice of a resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that takes account of the power consumption and performance of individual resources can make a significant difference, through leveraging the heterogeneous nature of resources, to the total system energy consumed and time taken in computing a workload...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the economic lot-sizing problem with perishable items (ELS-PI), where each item has a deterministic expiration date. Although all items in stock are equivalent regardless of procurement or expiration date, we allow for an <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that defines an {{order in which}} the items are allocated to the consumers.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a problem in}} supply chain management that how scarce resources can be efficiently allocated among competing interests.

In contrary to the existing <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in which retailers are local monopolists, the new model exhibits much more complicated market behaviors. We show that the widely-used proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is no longer necessarily Pareto optimal, even if all retailers are in a symmetric situation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the proportional allocation to be Pareto optimal is given.

40|$|In {{computational}} grids, heterogeneous {{resources with}} different ownerships are dynamically available and distributed geographically. It is not realistic {{to build the}} resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for such computational platform without considering economic issues. Developing computational economic-based approaches is a promising avenue for building efficient, scalable and stable resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> without a centralized controller for computational grids. The key difficulty in building a computational economic-based resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is measuring the economic value of resource usage. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented mechanism for measuring the economic value of using heterogeneous resources in computational grids. This mechanism provides feasibility for resource users to evaluate their outsourcing decisions. It also gives resource suppliers incentive to provide their resources to computational grids. Based on this mechanism, auction-based, commodities market-based and game theory-based distributed resource <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are established for computational grids. 1...|$|R

Besides differences in their resource capacities, servers may be additionally heterogeneous {{in their ability to}} service users - certain users' tasks may only be serviced by a subset of the servers. We identify important shortcomings in existing multi-resource fair <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> - Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) and its follow up work - when used in such environments. We develop a new fair <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> called Per-Server Dominant-Share Fairness (PS-DSF) which we show offers all desirable sharing properties that DRF is able to offer {{in the case of a}} single "resource pool" (i. e., if the resources of all servers were pooled together into one hypothetical server).

Second, it seems promising to use task <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to direct experts to primarily answer difficult questions when they contribute to the system.

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of single-parameter mechanisms for markets {{in which there is}} competition amongst both consumers and suppliers (namely, two-sided markets). Specifically, we examine the proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for two-sided markets. This mechanism is the natural generalization of both Kelly’s proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for demand-competitive markets [8] and Johari and Tsitsiklis’ proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for supply-competitive markets [7]. First we consider the case of a market for one divisible resource, for example bandwidth on a single-link network. Under the standard assumptions of decreasing marginal valuations for buyers and increasing marginal costs for suppliers, we show that a Nash equilibrium always exists for the proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> provided {{there are at least two}} suppliers. The effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving high social welfare is dependent upon the curvature of the suppliers marginal cost functions. We measure this effectiveness in terms of the welfare ratio (price of anarchy), the worst case ratio of an equilibrium against an optimal social solution. In the case of convex marginal costs, the welfare ratio is about 0. 5887. This ratio is tight, there are examples achieving th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{establishes}} an agent-based simulation {{system of}} the carbon emissions trading {{in accordance with the}} complex feature of the trading process. This system analyzes the impact of the carbon quota <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> on emissions trading for three different aspects including the amount of emissions reduction, the economic effect on the emitters, and the emissions reduction cost. Based on the data of the carbon emissions of different industries in China, several simulations were made. The results indicate that the emissions trading policy can effectively reduce carbon emissions in a perfectly competitive market. Moreover, by comparing separate quota <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> we obtain the result that the scheme with a small extent quota decrease in a comprehensive <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> can minimize the unit carbon emission cost. Implementing this scheme can also achieve minimal effects of carbon emissions limitation on the economy on the basis that the environment is not destroyed.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of allocating a single item {{repeatedly}} among multiple competing agents, {{in an environment where}} monetary transfers are not possible. We design (Bayes-Nash) incentive compatible mechanisms that do not rely on payments, with the goal of maximizing expected social welfare. We first focus on the case of two agents. We introduce an artificial payment system, which enables us to construct repeated <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> without payments based on one-shot <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with payments. Under certain restrictions on the discount factor, we propose several repeated <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on artificial payments. For the simple model in which the agents’ valuations are either high or low, the mechanism we propose is 0. 94 -competitive against the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>mechanism</b> with payments. For the general case of any prior distribution, the mechanism we propose is 0. 85 -competitive. We generalize the mechanism to cases of three or more agents. For any number of agents, the mechanism we obtain is at least 0. 75 -competitive. The obtained competitive ratios imply that for repeated allocation, artificial payments may be used to replace real monetary payments, without incurring too much loss in social welfare.
