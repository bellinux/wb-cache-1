40|$|Indeed, <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the {{pancreas}} are rare and account for 10 – 15 % of pancreatic neoplasms. 1 There are four main categories of pancreatic <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> including i) Mucinous <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> (MCTs); ii) Se-rous <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> (SCTs); iii) Intraductal papillary <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> (IPCTs); and iv) Papillary cystic tu-mors. 2, 3 Mucinous cystic neoplasm of {{the pancreas}} is an uncommon tumor {{characterized by an}} inner mu-cin-producing columnar epithelium layer and an outer dense cellular ovarian-like stromal layer.

40|$|<b>Cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the {{pancreas}} are less frequent than solid lesions {{and are often}} detected incidentally, {{as many of these}} lesions are small and asymptomatic. However, they may be associated with pancreatitis or have malignant potential. With advancements in diagnostic imaging, cystic lesions of {{the pancreas}} are being detected with increasing frequency. Many lesions can cause a pancreatic cyst, most being non-neoplastic while approximately 10 % are <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors,</b> ranging from benign to highly malignant tumors. With increasing experience it is becoming clear that the prevalence of pseudocyst among cystic lesions of the pancreas is lower than usually presumed. A presumptive diagnosis of pseudocyst based on imaging appearance alone can cause a diagnostic error, and neoplastic cysts of the pancreas are particularly susceptible to this misdiagnosis, which can result in inappropriate treatment. <b>Cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas are formed by serous or mucinous structures showing all stages of cellular differentiation. According to the WHO classification, they can be subdivided {{on the basis of their}} histological type and biological behavior into benign tumors, borderline tumors, and malignant <b>tumors.</b> <b>Cystic</b> pancreatic <b>tumors</b> can be subdivided into peripheral (serous cystadenomas, mucinous <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors,</b> solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms, <b>cystic</b> islet cell <b>tumors),</b> which do not communicate with the main pancreatic duct, and ductal tumors (mucinous tumor), according to their site of origin. On the basis of imaging criteria alone, it can be very difficult to differentiate non-tumoral cystic lesions from neoplastic ones.

50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variability}} in size, shape, thickness, and texture of the persistent eustachian valve, and in {{the extent to which}} it encroaches on neighboring structures such as the atrial septum. At one end of the spectrum, the embryonic eustachian valve disappears completely or is represented only by a thin ridge. Most commonly, it is a crescentic fold of endocardium arising from the anterior rim of the IVC orifice. The lateral horn of the crescent tends to meet the lower end of the crista terminalis, while the medial horn joins the thebesian valve, a semicircular valvular fold at the orifice of the coronary sinus. At the other extreme, it persists as a mobile, elongated structure projecting several centimeters into the right atrial cavity. In this case, it may demonstrate an undulating motion in real time echocardiography; and when it is quite large, it may be confused with right atrial tumors, thrombi, or vegetations. Occasionally, the eustachian valve crosses the floor of the right atrium from the orifice of the IVC and inserts into the lower portion of the interatrial septum adjacent to the atrioventricular valves. However, higher insertion of a giant eustachian valve, which mimics the echocardiographic appearance of divided right atrium, is very rare. This type of abnormality may be confused with cor triatriatum dexter. Very rarely, such a configuration of a large eustachian valve may mimic a right atrial <b>cystic</b> <b>tumor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} reassess the common dynamic CT manifestations of <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas and {{to determine whether they}} might allow the differentiation between benign and malignant tumors. Materials and Methods: Dynamic CT examinations of 19 patients with 20 <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas, including 7 serous cystadenomas, 3 benign mucinous cystadenomas, 5 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 3 mucin-producing duct ectasias, and 2 papillary cystic epithelial neoplasms, were retrospectively reviewed. The examinations were obtained with 4 to 5 mm collimation with intravenous injection of 120 - 130 ml of contrast agent. Results: Calcifications were found only in benign tumors (seven serous cystadenomas). Internal septations were found in benign and malignant tumors (seven serous cystadenomas, three benign mucinous cystadenomas, three mucinous cystadenocarcinomas). Solid excrescences within cystic cavities were found only in malignant tumors (two mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, two mucin-producing duct ectasias). Dynamic CT features allowed the distinguishing of serous cystadenomas from other <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> and mucin-producing duct ectasias from other mucinous tumors. Dynamic CT features did not permit differentiation between benign mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, and papillary cystic epithelial neoplasms. Conclusion: The review suggests that dynamic CT findings are useful to differentiate (a) serous cystadenomas and mucin-producing duct ectasias from other <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas and (b) benign from malignant tumors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} clinical parameters, presurgical diagnostic tests, histologic findings, and {{the presence}} of K-ras oncogene mutations in <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas to determine which best predict malignancy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Because presurgical, intraoperative, and final pathologic differentiation is difficult in <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas, it would be a major benefit to identify markers that accurately predict malignancy in these rare tumors. The role of K-ras oncogene mutations as an indicator of malignancy has not been determined in these tumors. METHODS: Nineteen patients with <b>cystic</b> <b>tumors</b> of the pancreas were evaluated, including K-ras mutation analysis based on polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion assays and direct DNA sequencing, to screen for parameters that accurately predict malignancy. RESULTS: All malignant <b>cystic</b> pancreatic <b>tumors</b> (five cystadenocarcinomas and three mucin-producing adenocarcinomas) harbored K-ras mutations at codon 12 or 13. K-ras mutations were also detected in the percutaneous fine-needle aspirates of two of these patients. In contrast, none of nine benign cystadenomas or the solid-papillary neoplasm had K-ras mutations. None of the patients with a benign tumor carrying K-ras wild-type sequences developed recurrent disease after a mean follow-up of 50 months. Seven of the 8 malignant <b>cystic</b> pancreatic <b>tumors,</b> but none of the 11 benign tumors, showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct on computed tomography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. CONCLUSIONS: K-ras mutation analysis seems to be a powerful tool to determine the malignant potential of <b>cystic</b> pancreatic <b>tumors</b> before and after surgery. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct on computed tomography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is highly suggestive for malignancy in these rare tumors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Odontogenic {{tumors are}} lesions that {{are derived from}} {{remnants}} {{of the components of}} the developing tooth germ. The calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumor</b> or calcifying odontogenic cyst is a benign cystic neoplasm of odontogenic origin that is characterized by an ameloblastoma-like epithelium and ghost cells. Calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumor</b> may be centrally or peripherally located, and its ghost cells may exhibit calcification, as first described by Gorlin in 1962. Most peripheral calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumors</b> are located in the anterior gingiva of the mandible or maxilla. Case presentation Authors report a rare case of a peripheral calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumor</b> of the maxillary gingiva. A 39 -year-old male patient presented with a fibrous mass on the attached buccal gingiva of the upper left cuspid teeth. It was 0. 7 -cm-diameter, painless and it was clinically diagnosed as a peripheral ossifying fibroma. After an excisional biopsy, the diagnosis was peripheric calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumor.</b> The patient was monitored for five years following the excision, and no recurrence was detected. Conclusions All biopsy material must be sent for histological examination. If the histological examination of gingival lesions with innocuous appearance is not performed, the frequency of peripheral calcifying <b>cystic</b> odontogenic <b>tumor</b> and other peripheral odontogenic tumors may be underestimated. </p...|$|R

In the present case, an abdominal <b>cystic</b> <b>tumor</b> was successfully removed via a small incision after aspirating the cyst fluid and thereby reducing {{the size of the}} tumor. The cystic fluid was successfully aspirated without spillage using a tissue adhesive, suction tube, and 16 -gage over-the-needle catheter. The abdominal laparoscopic procedure used a smaller incision than is required for conventional laparotomy, and the laparoscope allowed more detailed observation, which was useful for the operative diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|A nine-year-old, {{otherwise}} healthy girl presented with abdominal pain. On exam, {{there was a}} palpable <b>cystic</b> <b>tumor</b> in the left abdomen. According to imaging examinations, we tentatively diagnosed the tumor as lymphangioma of mesentery with bleeding. We planned to perform laparoscopic surgery to remove the tumor. On laparoscopy, cyst aspiration was performed to reduce {{the volume of the}} cysts, and the aspirated fluid was found to contain red blood cells. Due to technical difficulties, laparoscopic surgery was converted to open surgery. RBCs were detected in the cyst fluid at the sigmoid colon and intestinal mesentery. Resection of the <b>cystic</b> <b>tumor</b> and sigmoidectomy were performed. On pathologic examination of the tumor, there were multiple cysts but there was no cavernous part. The largest cyst was 6  × 5  × 3 cm. Simple squamous epithelium cells were found along parts of the inner lining of enlarged luminal cysts. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor was positive for CD 31 and CD 34, and negative on D 2 - 40 antibody staining. Therefore, we diagnosed this specimen as hemangioma with giant cysts at the mesentery. We conclude that bleeding into cysts of a hemangioma of mesentery might lead to the development of giant cysts and, in turn, a <b>cystic</b> <b>tumor</b> in the abdomen...|$|E
