40|$|Australian regulatory-approved Deeds of <b>Cross</b> <b>Guarantee</b> were {{introduced}} in the mid- 1980 s to, inter alia, assist business by relieving costs of preparing audited annual accounts for the guaranteeing subsidiary companies. Whereas the potential for direct cost savings arising from the Deeds has been reasonably well known, the potential relief under the Deeds from not providing proprietary information about subsidiaries' operations is less familiar. The quid pro quo for those reporting benefits are the <b>cross</b> <b>guarantee</b> covenants by which the holding company (for example, a chief entity) {{and a set of}} nominated (wholly owned or controlled entities) guarantee the debts of the companies subject to Deed. Those guarantee covenants extending the capital boundary provide potential, but to date unrealised, extended security for creditors. Despite the rhetoric promoting the quid pro quo creditor protection accompanying the introduction of the Deeds, survey and earlier case evidence indicates that the benefits appear to accrue more to the companies party to the Deeds than to creditors. This has implications for future regulatory policy related to corporate groups...|$|R
40|$|A {{regulatory}} approved deed of <b>cross</b> <b>guarantee</b> (the deed) {{was introduced}} into Australia in December 1991, relieving participating companies within {{a group from}} having to prepare, have audited, and file financial statements. We examine the characteristics of firms that obtain relief from filing (and therefore disclosing) separate financial statements of closed-group companies by adopting the deed. This is the first attempt to analyse adoption using large-scale archival data. The results support the survey evidence in Dean and Clarke (2005), thus providing triangulation on their work. In particular they {{support the view that}} the decision to adopt the deed is a function of strategic factors as well as accounting and auditing cost savings. Those strategic factors were not in focus when regulators first introduced a deed of indemnity in 1985, nor when the original indemnity was modified to become a deed of <b>cross</b> <b>guarantee</b> in 1991 or when it was further modified in 1998. Further, evidence is provided to test the conflicting ideas arising from the analytical literature and the mixed results in the empirical, voluntary disclosure literatures. That evidence suggests that non-disclosure arises when firms are in a more competitive industry and, in particular, when there is ability to retain non-disclosure at the consolidated level (i. e., where the number of segments is high). Other factors supporting non-disclosure are leverage and the proportion of foreign operations (proxying for deed complexity). The proportion of outside directors (a proxy for legal liability) and the number of shares outstanding (a proxy for agency costs of equity) are not associated with the decision to adopt the deed...|$|R

After reviewing the related studies and comparing various CAD packages, the analysis of accuracy difference between 3 D method and average-end-area method is conducted. It shows that in average-end-area method the critical value of interval distance between two consecutive cross sections is 30 m. It also shows that the Change Rate of Cut-Fill (CRCF) value, an index firstly proposed to represent the cut-fill variance frequency associated with roadway terrain, alignment and profile design, has no significant impacts on the accuracy of 2 D result. It is concluded that the 3 D method could be easily used in practice with the CAD software.

This problem is intensified when the database we are dealing with, is frequently updated, as only limited time is available to perform the maintenance. In this paper, we propose a novel tree maintenance mechanism for the problem of answering approximate k-Nearest Neighbor queries with a probabilistic guarantee on timeseries streams. When the underlying data change, we may choose to defer updating the tree {{as long as the}} probabilistic guarantee of answering queries is high. To prolong such deferment, we present innovative techniques that maintain the utility of the tree by migrating its pivots and by partially reconstructing it. As the probabilistic guarantee decays with time and <b>crosses</b> the minimum <b>guarantee</b> threshold, all of the deferred updates are performed. In essence, our work offers an elegant compromise between the accuracy guarantee of query results and the cost of providing them. With extensive empirical studies, we also show the flexibility and efficiency of our approach. 1...|$|R

Nikephoros III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family. Straboromanos tried to give Anna his cross, but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath. She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith. He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross.

As indicated by the movement burden and blockage, distinctive sorts of convergences and roundabouts are actualized to guarantee more wellbeing and solace. Roundabouts are favoured on the grounds that the outline of this rotational <b>crossing</b> point <b>guarantees</b> positive perspectives regarding security, limit, vehicular deferrals, driver conduct and vehicular communication. The heterogenic movement situation of Indian activity gives an extreme test to make an extraordinary model. The study considers the estimation of basic crevice by utilizing proposed INAFOGA (Influence Area for Gap Acceptance) technique in the heterogeneous Indian Traffic conditions. In this strategy, a zone is considered, which impact the degrees of progress of the vehicle and the appropriate impact territory is taken for this study. A trapezoidal and a rectangular territory is accepted as the impact region in a specific part of the circuitous where the contention between the circling stream and passage stream is greatest. Information has been gathered from nine roundabouts of seven unique urban communities (Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Ranchi, Chandigarh, Trivandrum, Kolkata and Nagpur) of India. From the video information, the aggregate Circulating Flow (PCU/hr), Entry Flow (PCU/hr), Critical Gap (tc), and Follow-up Gap (tf) has been removed for particular spots. Trapezoidal Area is turned out to be effective while evaluating the basic crevice considering vehicular measurements, horizontal leeway between sequential vehicles and zone of the trapezoid and is favored over the rectangular zone. The basic crevice evaluated from the INAFOGA strategy considering trapezoidal zone is then contrasted and approved and the basic hole found from the current models like Raff and harmony likelihood technique. Deducing the information gathered from different locales, activity structure was observed to be broadly heterogeneous. Vehicles are found which gives the direction way along this impact range. The direction is being broke down by the direction way investigation which demonstrates the most clashing zone of the indirect with a specific end goal to confirm the impact territory...|$|R
40|$|We use a newly {{released}} {{version of the}} SuperBayeS code to analyze {{the impact of the}} choice of priors and the influence of various constraints on the statistical conclusions for the preferred values of the parameters of the Constrained MSSM. We assess the effect in a Bayesian framework and compare it with an alternative likelihood-based measure of a profile likelihood. We employ a new scanning algorithm (MultiNest) which increases the computational efficiency by a factor ~ 200 with respect to previously used techniques. We demonstrate that the currently available data are not yet sufficiently constraining to allow one to determine the preferred values of CMSSM parameters {{in a way that is}} completely independent of the choice of priors and statistical measures. While b->s gamma generally favors large m_ 0, this is in some contrast with the preference for low values of m_ 0 and m_ 1 / 2 that is almost entirely a consequence of a combination of prior effects and a single constraint coming from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which remains somewhat controversial. Using an information-theoretical measure, we find that the cosmological dark matter abundance determination provides at least 80 % of the total constraining power of all available observables. Despite the remaining uncertainties, prospects for direct detection in the CMSSM remain excellent, with the spin-independent neutralino-proton <b>cross</b> section almost <b>guaranteed</b> above sigma_SI ~ 10 ^{- 10 } pb, independently of the choice of priors or statistics. Likewise, gluino and lightest Higgs discovery at the LHC remain highly encouraging. While in this work we have used the CMSSM as particle physics model, our formalism and scanning technique can be readily applied to a wider class of models with several free parameters.

40|$|Local {{races of}} winter rye have been grown {{to the present}} day in many places in Finland. These races of this allogamous and highly {{heterozygous}} species are usually strongly adapted to local climate, soil quality conditions and cultivation practices. Local races are derived from old, mainly European local races or varieties which have been imported to Finland during the history of rye cultivation here. The single plants which {{have not been able to}} survive over hard winters or which lacked growth vigour during stand development have not produced seed. This elimination of weak plants has continued from generation to generation raising the fitness of the population and increasing adaptation. Because of cross pollination rye plants will become very similar by phenotype if there is no pollen transfer from the outside. Different parts of Finland have varied growing conditions which has led to different adaptation of local races and our country has become a valuable source of rye polymorphism. Rye breeders in our country have repeatedly used local races as gene sources for winter hardiness, earliness and disease resistance. Domestic market varieties which have been grown widely and successfully are reliable cross parents as well. Our long lasting winter is often too severe to varieties from more southern countries. A winter rye variety for Finland must be hardy against extreme cold in the winters without snow cover and resistant against snow mould in the winters when snow cover stands long. Here in the North rye varieties must also be adapted to long day lengths to be able to exploit all the sun light for rapid growth. The Finnish rye breeding has been much based on crosses between local land races or domestic varieties and foreign, high yielding varieties possessing high resistance against lodging. The goal is to breed a modern rye variety with high adaptability and stabile yield level. The <b>crosses</b> between non-relatives <b>guarantee</b> a high degree of continuous heterozygocity and heterosis in varieties descending from such crosses which raises their yield level in cultivation. Seeds of local races were collected and saved from being lost by collecting expeditions soon after founding of the Nordic Gene Bank. Now the collections of the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre (NordGen) include 90 local races and 34 varieties of rye from our country. A part of the collection has been evaluated for field characteristics in Jokioinen in 1999. As a breeder s view, the local race from Kinahmi, Nilsiä, was a good candidate among some others for a cross parent. Today, local races are still grown for production in many provinces. Seed samples of those are acquired by the working group of genetic resources in question. The samples are usually rejuvenated by distance isolations to get the sample of high quality for long term storage in NordGen. As an example, there have been three such distance isolations in the South Savo experimental station of MTT Agrifood Research Finland this summer. One of them, a local race originating from Iissavaara, Lieksa, showed exceptionally high tillering capacity and resistance against diseases. vo...|$|R
