40|$|Compassion focused therapy (CFT) {{is rooted}} in an evolutionary, {{functional}} analysis of basic social motivational systems (e. g., to live in groups, form hierarchies and ranks, seek out sexual, partners help and share with alliances, and care for kin) and different functional emotional systems (e. g., to respond to threats, seek out resources, and for states of contentment/safeness). In addition, about 2 million years ago, (pre-) humans began to evolve a range of cognitive competencies for reasoning, reflection, anticipating, imagining, mentalizing, and creating a socially contextualized sense of self. These new competencies can cause major difficulties {{in the organization of}} (older) motivation and emotional systems. CFT suggests that our evolved brain is therefore potentially problematic because of its basic ‘design,’ being easily triggered into destructive behaviours and mental health problems (called ‘tricky brain’). However, mammals and especially humans have also evolved motives and emotions for affiliative, caring and altruistic behaviour that can organize our brain {{in such a way as}} to significantly offset our destructive potentials. CFT therefore highlights the importance of developing people's capacity to (mindfully) access, tolerate, and direct affiliative motives and emotions, for themselves and others, and <b>cultivate</b> <b>inner</b> compassion as a way for organizing our human ‘tricky brain’ in prosocial and mentally healthy ways...|$|E

50|$|The third formula, Fusion, really starts inner alchemy practices. Inner alchemy {{traditionally}} has three stages: transmuting Jing to Chi, transmuting chi to shen, returning shen to void. Chi and shen are inner life energies with shen {{at a more}} refined level, and both originate from the same original universe force, {{which can only be}} reached by completely removing one's own consciousness. In Kan Li practices, one should have developed strong chi and strong mental power so that intercourses of polarities of life energies take place inside one's own body, analogous to intercourses of a female and a male which leads to a birth of a child. The intensive activities of internal life energy create an inner energy body which becomes the center of further practices, and eventually the inner body leads to immortality, reaching Tao. <b>Cultivating</b> the <b>inner</b> body and merging into immortality are the central training practices of inner alchemy, which require great dedication and determination.

5000|$|The Taipingjing is a {{guide that}} reveals the proper methods {{to bring forward}} an era of great peace or {{equality}} - the [...] "Great Peace" [...] -, an idea that probably {{dates back to the}} Warring States period. The idea of the [...] "Great Peace" [...] became more prominent during the Han period. The main idea brought forward by the scriptures is that the world is in a terrible state of chaos. There is a loss of cosmic balance, and this is made obvious by omens such as droughts, floods, famines, epidemics and other natural disasters. There is also chaos in the courts of the imperial house, proven by recorded events such as freakish births (perhaps a hint at the meddling of eunuchs), all of which demonstrate Heaven's displeasure towards the mortal realm. Humans have been polluted by their sins and their ancestors' sins (evil accumulated through many generations). The Universe reciprocates the mortal realm's condition; for there to be balance again, the people must heal themselves and <b>cultivate</b> their <b>inner</b> Dao. Salvation lies in the hand of great princes known as Celestial Masters. Chinese antiquity was divided into three eras: High Antiquity, Middle Antiquity and Late Antiquity, but it was only High Antiquity that contained a time of Great Peace, maintained with the collaborative efforts of the rulers of that era and the Celestial Masters. There was no infant mortality, no bad harvests and the climate was convenient. This balance was so delicate that the suffering of one entity was enough to make things out of synch.

We used a two-chamber culture model with human fetal DRG <b>cultivated</b> in an <b>inner</b> chamber, allowing axons to grow out and penetrate an agarose barrier and interact with autologous epidermal cells in the outer chamber. After HSV infection of the DRG, anterograde transport of viral components could be examined in the axons in the outer chamber at different time points by electron and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). In the axons, unenveloped nucleocapsids or focal collections of gold immunolabel for nucleocapsid (VP 5) and/or tegument (VP 16) were detected. VP 5 and VP 16 usually colocalized in both scanning and transmission IEM. In contrast, immunolabel for glycoproteins gB, gC, and gD was diffusely distributed in axons and was rarely associated with VP 5 or VP 16. In longitudinal sections of axons, immunolabel for glycoprotein was arrayed along the membranes of axonal vesicles. These findings provide evidence that in DRG axons, virus nucleocapsids coated with tegument proteins are transported separately from glycoproteins and suggest that final assembly of enveloped virus occurs at the axon terminus...|$|R

But how can we use digital media so that they make us empowered participants rather than passive receivers, grounded, well-rounded people rather than multitasking basket cases? In Net Smart, cyberculture expert Howard Rheingold shows us how to use social media intelligently, humanely, and, above all, mindfully. Mindful use of digital media means thinking about what we are doing, <b>cultivating</b> an ongoing <b>inner</b> inquiry into how we want to spend our time. Rheingold outlines five fundamental digital literacies, online skills that will help us do this: attention, participation, collaboration, critical consumption of information (or "crap detection"), and network smarts.

He describes the quality of participation that empowers the best of the bloggers, netizens, tweeters, and other online community participants; he examines how successful online collaborative enterprises contribute new knowledge to the world in new ways; and he teaches us a lesson on networks and network building. Rheingold points out that there is a bigger social issue at work in digital literacy, one that goes beyond personal empowerment.

MBSR teaches individuals to <b>cultivate</b> awareness and <b>inner</b> resources to cope with life’s challenges. Recent research has also found that mindfulness meditation improves attentional control and emotional regulation.

Despite potential benefits in applicable areas of challenges, MBSR has never been utilized with an ASD population. Self-report assessment outcomes {{can be a challenge}} for the ASD population due to limitations in abstraction, awareness, and flexible thinking. Thus, this research project included two feasibility studies that examined (1) selected self-report QOL and mindfulness outcome measures and (2) a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction group intervention with adults diagnosed with ASD. Twenty-two subjects with ASD participated in a cognitive interview and reliability study to evaluate selected self-report measures. Subjects completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Child Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), WHOQOL-BREF, and WHOQOL-DIS at two time points with a two-week washout period. A subset of participants (n= 8) completed cognitive interviews with a trained counselor to evaluate the understanding of each item on the selected scales. Results support use of the SWLS and CAMM with adults with ASD, as both demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and item understanding. In the subsequent quasi-experimental feasibility trial, twelve adults with ASD completed an 8 -week group MBSR intervention. Intervention fidelity and feasibility standards were met for retention, understanding of material, and participation. Participants reported high satisfaction with the intervention, as measured by the CSQ- 8 (M = 27. 92, SD = 3. 5).

40|$|James A. Garfield (1831 - 1881), {{the only}} preacher to ever occupy the White House, {{was a product}} of the {{profound}} social, intellectual and religious ferment of {{the early decades of the}} nineteenth century which produced the American religious movement known as the Disciples of Christ. The first fifty years of Disciple history closely paralleled Garfield’s life. The purpose of this study is to focus on the intimate Garfield-Disciples relationship, and to show its reciprocal nature. Garfield was helped by Disciples in the building of a political base (he won ten consecutive elections in the Western Reserve), and they in turn shared in the prestige and influence of his expanding career. Garfield was reared on Ohio 2 ̆ 7 s Western Reserve, “the principal theatre” of the Disciple movement, and at the age of eighteen (1850) he was baptized by a Disciple preacher. While a student at the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (1851 - 1854), a Disciple academy at Hiram, he <b>cultivated</b> an <b>inner</b> circle of friends and developed the ability to preach for Disciples. Two years at Williams College (1854 - 1856) enlarged his intellectual horizons and convinced him that the Disciple ministry was “an unpromising field. ” By the time Garfield returned to teach at Hiram, he was already formulating plans for entering “the field of statesmanship” through the “educational portal. ” In the first three years after his return to Hiram (1856 - 1859), Garfield was made president of the Eclectic, married into a strong Disciple family in Hiram, and became “a favorite preacher” among Western Reserve Disciples. At the same time, he was laying the groundwork for a political career with the Eclectic as a base and his beloved “Hiram circle” of Disciple colleagues as associates and supporters. In 1859, with the support of several influential Disciples, Garfield won election to the Ohio Senate and “gained a step in the direction of my purpose. ” At the yearly meeting of Disciples he argued that there was a greater need of “manly men in politics” than there was of preachers. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Garfield saw his course clearly. Governor Dennison assured him that successful military leaders would rule the nation for twenty years after the war, and he eagerly accepted command of the Forty-second Ohio. With evangelistic fervor he recruited hundreds of Disciples into his regiment. His avid speech at the 1861 convention of the American Christian Missionary Society led that Disciple organization to adopt a resolution of loyalty to the Union. During Garfield’s military years (1861 - 1863) he won rapid promotion to the rank of major general, and through the diligent work of his Disciple associates back home he won election to Congress. His congressional career began in December 1863, and continued until the autumn of 1880 when he was elected to the Presidency. As a member of the Hiram board Garfield initiated a theological department at the school in 1866; and in that same year he was the catalyst behind the establishment of a significant new Disciple periodical called the Christian Standard. He conceived of merging the school and the paper in an effort to make a fight for “a liberal Christianity” within the Disciple movement, but in this he failed. However, he continued to support the “new and better movement” he saw emerging in the ministries of progressive Disciples like Lewis Pinkerton and Burke Hinsdale. The Disciples were active in Garfield’s presidential campaign, and through his victory they enjoyed the fruits of worldwide publicity for their young religious movement. After Garfield 2 ̆ 7 s assassination, they sought to perpetuate his memory in such projects as the Garfield Memorial Church and Garfield University. This study is based on the extensive collection of Garfield manuscripts in the Library of Congress, and throughout the narrative Garfield is left to express himself in his own words as often as possible.

40|$|Long before Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s 1998 celebrated story Who Moved My Cheese? {{a best-selling}} text on change was published, Charles Darwin in the Origin of Species (1859), {{documented}} compelling scientific evidence on species that became extinct because of mal-adaptation or resistance to change. It is intriguing to discover in today 2 ̆ 7 s business world, that most {{businesses that are}} making waves never existed beyond few decades. In the same vein, most organizations in the past, that roamed their environments like dinosaurs, are today extinct or too flaccid to make earth-breaking impact. Change has caused all these. Organizations that have realized the inevitability of change have accepted the onerous tasks of managing it. Others that believed otherwise, have unwittingly surrendered themselves to change, to tweak the way it deems fit. Change is so fundamental to all {{things in the world}} that it is the most important obstacle to overcome in a game of survival of the fittest. It is constant for all times. This immutable principle may have been the raison d 2 ̆ 7 etre behind the craving by many to understand change, as a phenomenon from wider and deeper perspectives. Consequently, this perhaps, has attracted to the field of management and indeed the entire sciences, as well as humanity, avalanche of change theories, postulations and practices. Nowhere in the world economy has change made such unimaginable impacts as it has done in the information and communication technology (ICT) world in the past few decades, especially {{in the last two decades}} when the ICT wind has blown across every continent of the world. Contemporary Issues in Change Management Change by definition requires creating a new system. Managing change therefore requires managers to think about the organization from a new perspective. Duck (1998) argues that this demands from the manager, something beyond mere breaking change into small pieces – total quality management, process reengineering, employee empowerment and managing each as operating machine, akin to treating the human body of one ailment at a time. Change management appears to be influenced by three paradigms viz: deeply held, unconscious set of assumptions and values, things taken for granted, and expectations Zohar (1997), in his own view, identified two broad influences which managers of change are susceptible to. These are Newtonian and Quantum constructs. Under the Newtonian perspective, change management sees an organization from the perspective of atomicity, with emphasis on separate working parts. This leads to a tendency toward fragmentation. Second, the Newtonian believes that change management is determinate and thus is governed by iron laws. This is why some of their proponents are taken aback when results of change programme are way off from prediction. The third underlying assumptions of the Newtonian construct on change management is the view that, all answers on change, must be 2 ̆ 2 either, or 2 ̆ 2. That is why those who subscribe to it give premium to change leaders, who 2 ̆ 7 keep their eyes on the ball 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 see clearly a particular vision to pursue 2 ̆ 7. It is from these people that we hear frequent arguments that, there is one best way to do things or the best software package to drive information and communication technology. The fourth is actuality, which concerns 2 ̆ 7 here and now 2 ̆ 7. This anchors on immediate results that can be touched and measured. The fifth concerns 2 ̆ 7 subject-object split 2 ̆ 7. Managers influenced by this movement divide the world into the organization and its environment, as well as the organization and its market. According to Zohar (1997), these managers believe that change programme and management, should empower them to manage that environment and to exploit the market. Quite often we hear these managers shouting to their subordinates 2 ̆ 2 Customers are out there and they are to be managed. Their tastes are to be manipulated, their dissatisfactions stoked up, their expectations set 2 ̆ 2. Sixth change management, under the Newtonian influence, regards the organization, both political and corporate as existing in a constant and seemingly unresolved tension between the individual and the group. That the thrust of change management is to foster the initiative and creative qualities of the individual, while at the same time developing the co-operation and team qualities of the group. It is based on this that we have many change managers stressing the crucial importance of the individual, at the same time, being suspicious of the group. Leadership under this context <b>cultivates</b> own <b>inner</b> light and individual potential, while feeling that there is nothing or little lesson to draw from the great insight and inspiration of the unexpressed qualities of the group being led. Seventh, Newtonian managers on change management are under the influence of 2 ̆ 7 focus, certainty, and control 2 ̆ 7. A story is told of a famous physicist, Lord Kelvin, who often advised his best students to avoid making a career in physics, because they had solved all the problems that required solutions. In other words, there was nothing exciting or new that a newcomer would discover in the subject. Change management under this influence, creates a situation that makes the leader see others and their ways of doing things, as the source of the problems of the organization, while nothing is wrong the way he administers his job...|$|R
