On July 10, 1776, the Fourth Provincial Congress changed its name to the Convention of Representatives of the State of New York, and [...] "acts as legislature without an executive." [...] While adjourned it left a Committee of Safety in charge.

It had been drafted by John Jay, and was not submitted to the people for ratification. Under its provisions, the governor would be elected not appointed, voting restrictions were reduced, secret ballots were introduced, and civil rights were guaranteed. On July 30, 1777, George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston. On July 9, 1778, the State of New York signed the Articles of Confederation and officially became a part of the government of the United States of America, though it had {{been a part of the}} nation since it was declared in 1776 with signatories from New York.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that a single clause may not include a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> state {{expression}} and a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> expression (e. g., *Sam kicked Bill black and blue out of the room.). This co-occurrence restriction is known as the Unique Path Constraint effect. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that this constraint comes from the nature of event structure ― assuming that an event structure can be composed of at most two internal events, a single event may not include more than one distinct change. I argue that apparent counterexamples (e. g., John broke the egg into the bowl.), which are presented in the literature, can also be explained under the event-based analysis provided in this paper. The co-occurrence <b>of</b> a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> state expression and a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> expression in a single clause is possible when they are in a further specification relation. In such a case, the two expressions refer to different aspects of a single unified change, so they can be licitly associated with a single subevent. In this paper, I show that a further specification relation is satisfied when an event that is expressed by a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> state expression involves spatial extension, and the spatial extension is specified by a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> expression. This paper provides empirical evidence for the event-based analysis of the Unique Path Constraint effect, and consequently provides empirical support for the idea that human language is devised assensitiveto event structure...|$|R
