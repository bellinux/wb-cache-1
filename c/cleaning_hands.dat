40|$|Statement of problem: Residual zinc oxide-eugenol cement may {{adversely}} affect retention of zinc phosphate cement. Purpose of this study: was to measure retention of cast restorations cemented with zinc phosphate cement after cleaning the fitting (internal) surfaces from residues of zinc oxide-eugenol provisional cement using different cleaning methods. Material and methods: Sixty standard stainless steel models {{of a standard}} complete crown preparation were prepared. Cast crowns using Type III dental alloy (Midas, Jclenko, N. Y, USA) were fabricated then cemented on their respective models using zinc oxide-eugenol cement (Temp Bond, Kerr, CA, USA). They were stored in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. The castings were separated from their models using a universal testing machine (Model 1197, Instron, UK). Cleaning of all models was done with a spoon excavator. Specimens were then equally divided into 6 groups of different cleaning methods of residues of zinc oxide-eugenol cement on the fitting surfaces of the cast restorations (<b>hand</b> <b>cleaning,</b> <b>hand</b> cleaning/ultrasonic <b>cleaning,</b> airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic <b>cleaning,</b> <b>hand</b> cleaning/ steam <b>cleaning,</b> airborne-particle abrasion/steam cleaning and chemical cleaning). Castings were cemented back using zinc phosphate cement then stored in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. Retention was measured using a universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, non-parametric one-way ANOVA and post-Hoc, non-parametric Tukey Type test. (Alpha value was set at 0. 05). Results: Airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning showed the highest crown retention among other methods. Only airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic <b>cleaning,</b> <b>hand</b> cleaning/ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> and <b>hand</b> cleaning/steam <b>cleaning</b> showed significantly higher crown retention than that of only <b>hand</b> <b>cleaning</b> (P= 0. 027).

Student <b>hand</b> <b>cleaning</b> behavior was monitored with video surveillance and in-person structured observation, both simultaneously and separately, at four primary schools in urban Kenya over a study period of 8 weeks. Video surveillance and in-person observation captured similar rates of <b>hand</b> <b>cleaning</b> (absolute difference < 5 %, p = 0. 74). Video surveillance documented higher <b>hand</b> <b>cleaning</b> rates (71 %) when at least one other person was present at the <b>hand</b> <b>cleaning</b> station, compared to when a student was alone (48 %; rate ratio  = 1. 14 [95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 28]).

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that if safety {{behavior}} is used judiciously, it could help facilitate treatment by making exposure and response prevention (ERP) less demanding and less threatening. The current study investigated whether using safety behavior in ERP not only reduces fear but also reduces the credibility of catastrophic beliefs. A total of 66 students (53 women) participated. In the exposure + response prevention condition, participants touched a contaminant several times without engaging in safety behavior. In the exposure + safety behavior condition, participants did engage in safety behavior after touching (<b>cleaning</b> <b>hands</b> with hygienic wipe). In the control condition participants only touched the contaminant twice, with a waiting time in between trials. We hypothesized that E+RP and E+SB conditions would show a greater decrease in contamination, fear, danger and disgust (CFDD) scores and credibility of catastrophic belief. Relative to the control condition, a clear pre- to post-test decrease in CFDD scores and credibility of catastrophic belief was found in E+RP and E+SB. This suggests that the treatment of contamination-based OCD is not impeded by using wipes as safety behavior, which adds to the growing amount of evidence indicating that safety behavior is innocuous or even contributory to the reduction of fear in exposure therapy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{similarities and}} differences in media discourses relating to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at three important points {{in the development of}} the bacterium and its perception by the public over the last decade. We analyse three increasingly large sets of texts from the national media using a variety of complementary qualitative and quantitative methods. As such this paper exploits, develops and empirically assesses an emerging methodological trend in applied linguistics, namely the convergence of critical metaphor analysis, with corpus linguistics and science and technology studies. Using this, the study identifies a shifting media narrative that involves changes in dramatis personae over the decade. First, personified forces of nature, doctors and hospitals are engaged in a battle of evil against good, but also intelligence over stupidity. Second, we are presented with victims of personified bacterial forces and doct! ors and hospitals cast as perpetrators of crimes of omission by not <b>cleaning</b> <b>hands</b> or wards.

40|$|Background and objectives: Safety {{behaviours}} {{are widely}} held to impede the beneficial effects of exposure, certainly in OCD. Recently, Rachman, Radomsky, Shafran, and Zysk (2011) challenged this view. Healthy volunteers repeatedly touched a contaminant in two sessions. Half {{of the participants}} did not engage in safety behaviours after touching (exposure + response prevention), while the other half did (exposure + safety behaviours, i. e., <b>cleaning</b> <b>hands</b> with a hygienic wipe). Scores of contamination, fear, danger, and disgust decreased in both sessions and the effects were not impeded by safety behaviours. Three potential artefacts were identified in the Rachman et al. study: a no-treatment control group was lacking, the stop rules for ending exposure differed between conditions, and positive expectations may have been induced in the safety behaviours group. We tried to critically replicate the main findings. Method: The Rachman et al. (2011) study was replicated, with 44 volunteers but stop rules and expectations were similar between treatments, and effects were also assessed in a no-intervention control group. Results: Relative to the control condition, both exposure interventions induced reliable decreases in feelings of contamination, fear, danger, and disgust. The decline followed an exponential curve with the largest gains at the first trials of each session. Limitations: Findings were obtained from a non-clinical sample. Conclusion: The findings attest to the robustness of the Rachman et al. findings, and challenge the notion that safety behaviours should be dismissed categorically in exposure treatments...|$|E
40|$|In fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{strengthened}} steel structures, debonding of the bonded FRP reinforcement {{from the}} steel substrate {{may result from}} adhesion failure at the steel/adhesive interface or the FRP/adhesive interface, cohesion failure in the adhesive, {{or a combination of}} these two modes.
