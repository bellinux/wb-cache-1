40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{are expected}} to be a promising nanomaterial because of their outstanding electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. For macroscopic device applications, an assembly of SWNTs is a critical issue. We propose a self-organized micro-honeycomb network structure of SWNTs obtained by water vapor treatment of as-synthesized vertically-aligned SWNTs (VA-SWNT) for solar cell devices with higher performance. The microhoneycomb structure was realized by simply exposing VA-SWNT to water vapor and drying in ambient condition. Honeycomb cell walls consist of capillary-aggregated vertically aligned SWNTs with heavily bundled top part. Within each cell, collapsed spaghetti-like SWNTs make contact to the substrate. The SWNT/n-Si heterojunction solar cell was built by placing the micro-honeycomb SWNTs network film on top of the substrate which has a 3 mm � 3 mm bare n-type silicon <b>contact</b> <b>window</b> in the center.

40|$|To {{meet the}} demands of the next {{generation}} of CMOS, the limits of silicon integration are being pushed towards nanoscale dimensions. Exploratory research has {{in the past couple of}} years been directed towards semiconductor nanostructure growth and several successful studies have been reported [1, 2]. However, the existing fabrication techniques are still far from being viable integration processes. In this paper, we present a well-controlled sub- 500 °C solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) process for selectively filling nanoscale contact windows with aluminum p+-doped Si, directly applicable for integration in Si nanodevices. The basic process flow is presented in Fig. 1. Contact windows are first opened through a thermal oxide to the mono-crystalline Si substrate. Silicon-nitride spacers are used as a hard mask to anisotropically open contact windows to Si substrate. After the removal of the SiN spacers, contact windows down to 100 nm dimensions were obtained in a reproducible way (Fig. 2 a). Physical vapor deposition (PVD) of a thin layer of aluminum and amorphous silicon (α-Si) is then performed in the same vacuum system. The epitaxial growth was induced by annealing at temperatures between 350 and 500 °C, which is far below the 577 °C eutectic point of the Al/Si alloy. Initiated first in the corners of the contact windows, presumably due to a stress driven process, the crystal growth, fed from the α-Si layer via a fast diffusion process in the Al layer [3], occurs preferably on the exposed silicon substrate rather than on the surrounding oxide and stops abruptly when the crystal protrudes above the Al layer. Lateral growth proceeds until the <b>contact</b> <b>window</b> is entirely filled. For contact windows smaller than 500 nm wide, a single crystal will fill the entire <b>contact</b> <b>window.</b> The epitaxial growth has been verified (Fig. 2 b) by high-resolution transmission electron microscop...|$|E

Another feature of the algorithm is the use of a differentiation mechanism based on message utility. This allows allocating more resources for high utility messages. More precisely, messages are replicated in the order of highest utility first, and removed from the buffers in the reverse order. To illustrate the benefit of such a scheme the global accumulated utility is used as a system-wide performance metric. Simulations illustrate the benefit of our model and show that ORWAR provides lower overhead and higher delivery rate, as well as higher accumulated utility compared to a number of well-known algorithms (including Maxprop and SprayAndWait) ...|$|E
