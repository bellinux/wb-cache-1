An exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used where qualitative data was were collected in the first study through semi-structured interviews with 20 young people, and quantitative data was collected in the second study through a survey instrument with 226 young people. Data from study one were used to inform the development of a theoretical model of influences on young people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward the police and to aid in the construction of a survey instrument to test the model. Results from this study showed that young people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward the police are influenced by at least three factors: perceptions of the performance and effectiveness of police, legal socialisation, and cooperative and compliant behaviour {{on the part of the}} young person. Each of these factors was tested as an element of the theoretical model in study two using structural equation modelling. Model testing showed a good fit to the data with each factor having similar effects on overall attitudes toward the police. This indicated that young people place some importance on the performance and behaviour of the police in making their assessments of them. However, in addition unique aspects of adolescence, namely legal socialisation and levels of offending at this age, are important considerations and should be included in future measures of young people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward the police.

Afterproviding information concerning the extent to which people tend to be vulnerable to the conformity, the first author gaveclasses with a focus on the guidance to be given to bystanders who witness bullying with reference to a case study whichthe pupils discussed on paper anonymously. We group 633 comment cards that 142 students wrote by using KJ Method asreference and examine their relations. The primary results are as follows: Firstly, what students learned can be groupedinto 14 knowledge subsets. That is, "effects of discussion on paper", "efforts of teachers and trust in teachers", "newly-gainedknowledge and impressions", "negative dynamics in a group", "positive dynamics in a group", "students 2 ̆ 7 own experiences","doubts about discussion on paper", "learner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attitude</b> about bullying", "effects of anonymity", "learner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attitude</b> about thechild", "guidance to the bystander", "effects of writing", "factors which made the classroom change" and "sense of guilt".
