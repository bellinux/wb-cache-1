These cells exhibited a low level of spontaneous chromosome instability. Upon treatment with diepoxybutane (DEB), chromosome breakage increased to a level comparable to that reported earlier in DEB-treated FA heterozygous cells. Cultured cells derived from chromosomally normal fetuses which served as controls did not show DEB-induced chromosome breakage. This observation suggests that the fetus studied is heterozygous for the FA gene.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{main feature}} of Fanconi anemia (FA) {{is the high}} {{sensitivity}} of the cells to the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agent,</b> diepoxybutane (DEB). Thus, differential diagnosis of this syndrome {{can be made by}} cytogenetic analysis; adding DEB to lymphocytes in culture (DEB test) increases the number of chromosome breaks. Fanconi anemia cells have an abnormal cell cycle, with an increased frequency of cells arrested at G 2. In order to determine if flow cytometry can be utilized for FA diagnosis, we cultivated lymphocytes with DEB and analyzed them for G 2 accumulation. Lymphocytes cultivated for 72 h were labeled with CD 3 antibody and propidium iodide for analysis of the cells in the G 2 phase.

40|$|A basic {{principle}} of cell physiology is that chromosomes condense during mitosis. However, condensation can be uncoupled from mitotic events under certain circumstances. This phenomenon {{is known as}} "premature chromosome condensation (PCC). " PCC provides insights in the mechanisms of chromosome condensation, thus helping clarifying the key molecular events leading to the mitosis.

The method paved the way to a great number of fundamental discoveries in cytogenetics, radiation biology, and related fields, but it has been hampered by technical difficulties. The novel drug-induced PCC method was introduced about 10 years ago. While fusion-induced PCC exploits the action of external maturation/mitosis promoting factor (MPF), migrating from the inducer mitotic cell to the interphase recipient, drug-induced PCC exploits protein phosphatase inhibitors, which can activate endogenous intracellular MPF. This method is much simpler than fusion-induced PCC, and has already proven useful in different fields...|$|R

Cells were treated with 1 before (pretreatment), during (co-treatment), and after (post-treatment) treatment with the mutagens, in order to investigate the type of antimutagenic activity (desmutagenic or bioantimutagenic) manifested. In the range of concentrations tested (0. 3 - 330 μM) 1 reduced significantly the frequency of micronuclei induced by ethyl methanesulfonate, in both pre- and co-treatment protocols (up to 74 % and 70 % of reduction, respectively), showing an anticlastogenic activity. Conversely, 1 did not inhibit the effect of colcemid in all treatments. The nuclear division index value of lymphocytes was not affected by treatment with 1, thus demonstrating that the anticlastogenic effect of 1 was not due to a cytotoxic effect.

40|$|Non-{{homologous}} end joining (NHEJ) and {{homologous recombination}} (HR) are pathways that repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the repair of these breaks {{is influenced by}} histone acetylation. Therefore, we tested mammalian cells deleted for NHEJ (Ku 80 or DNA Ligase IV) or altered for HR (breast cancer associated gene, Brca 2, or Bloom's syndrome, Blm) for sensitivity to trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being investigated as an anti-cancer therapeutic. We show that cells mutated for Ku 80 (ku 80 −/−) or DNA Ligase IV (lig 4 −/−), but not cells mutated for Brca 2 (brca 2 lex 1 /lex 2) or Blm (blmtm 3 Brd/tm 4 Brd), are hypersensitive to TSA in a dose-dependent manner.

The corresponding ratio with {sup 60 }Co gamma rays was 15. 6. The dose-response was biphasic suggesting that either receptor sites are saturated at high does, or {{that there is a}} nonrandom distribution of breaks induced by the {sup 123 }I-estrogen. The {sup 123 }I-estrogen treatment induced chromosome aberrations with an efficiency of about 1 aberration for each 1, 000 disintegrations per cell. This corresponds to the mean lethal dose of {sup 123 }I-estrogen for these cells suggesting that the lethal event induced by the Auger electron emitter bound to estrogen is a chromosome aberration.

40|$|MYCN {{amplification}} {{occurs in}} approximately 20 % of human neuroblastomas and {{is associated with}} early tumor progression and poor outcome, despite intensive multimodal treatment. However, MYCN overexpression also sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to apoptosis. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms linking MYCN to apoptosis might contribute to designing more efficient therapies for MYCN-amplified tumors. Here we show that MYCN-dependent sensitization to apoptosis requires activation of p 53 and its phosphorylation at serine 46. The p 53 S 46 kinase HIPK 2 accumulates on MYCN expression, and its depletion by RNA interference impairs p 53 S 46 phosphorylation and apoptosis. Remarkably, MYCN induces a DNA damage response that accounts for the inhibition of HIPK 2 degradation through an ATM- and NBS 1 -dependent pathway. Prompted by the rare occurrence of p 53 mutations and by the broad expression of HIPK 2 in our human neuroblastoma series, we evaluated {{the effects of the}} p 53 -reactivating compound Nutlin- 3 on this pathway. At variance from other tumor histotypes, in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, Nutlin- 3 further induced HIPK 2 accumulation, p 53 S 46 phosphorylation, and apoptosis, and in combination with <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agents</b> purged virtually the entire cell population.

The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was used to evaluate such effects of apigenin. Blood samples were collected from two non-smoking healthy male volunteers who had no history of previous exposure to other <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agents.</b> Isolated lymphocytes were cultured. There were two tubes per concentration for all treatments. To evaluate the genotoxicity of apigenin, cells were first treated with different concentrations of apigenin (0, 2. 5, 5, 10 and 25 microg/mL) at 24 h after culture initiation, followed by cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) treatment (3 microg/mL) and cell harvest at 44 and 72 h, respectively. Secondly, to investigate the radioprotective effect, cell cultures were exposed to different concentrations of apigenin as described above for 30 min before being irradiated to 2 Gy of 137 Cs gamma rays (at a dose rate of 0. 75 Gy/min). In all instances, the frequency of MN was scored in binucleated (BN) cells. The nuclear proliferation index also was calculated. We did not detect an increase in the frequency of MN in non-irradiated human lymphocyte cultures treated with 2. 5, 5. 0 or 10 microg/mL apigenin; although, we did observe an increase in cultures treated with 25 microg/mL apigenin (the highest concentration of apigenin used in our study). We also observed a significant increase in the frequency of MN in irradiated cells overall; however, the frequency was decreased as the concentration of apigenin increased, suggesting a radioprotective effect.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) with four different DNA probes being used simultaneously to study plant mutagenesis. A quantitative analysis allowed ten types of micronuclei, which were characterized by the presence or absence of specific FISH signal(s), to be distinguished, thus enabling some specific rules governing the composition of the MH-induced micronuclei with the majority of them originating from the terminal regions of chromosomes, to be identified. The application of rDNA sequences as probes showed that 5 S rDNA-bearing chromosomes are involved in micronuclei formation more frequently than the 25 S rDNA-bearing chromosomes.

40|$|EN] In proliferating {{eukaryotic}} cells, there occurs {{a striking}} chromosome repair mechanism, wich operates during G 2 and prophase {{of the division}} cycle. The main task of this repair mechanism could by the removal of DNA lesions able to give rise chromosomal aberrations during chromatin condensation and chromosome movements in next mitosis. In the present work, we study this repair mechanism, its inhibition by caffeine and we propose a model to explain the estrategy of cell mechanism operating under control conditions and after the treatment with any <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agent.</b> The G 2 -prophase repair is a mechanism of eukaryotic cells reminiscent of bacterial SOS system and it would operate as follows: I) The response is induced {{by the presence of}} certain DNA lesions in post-replicative and premiotic genome, whenever they were induced. Under these circumstances, a cell cycle arrest takes place in G 2, also termed division delay. II) During the G 2 arrest, DNA repair pathways operate to restore DNA structure. III) When adequate DNA structure for physical chromosome integrity is achieved cells go into mitosis. This recovery from arrest is dependent on protein synthesis. Caffeine is an inhibitor of G 2 -prophase repair mechanism by cancelling division delay and, probably, by affecting the rate of DNA repair at the same time. Caffeine efficiency appears to by dependent on drug concentration and cellular ATP level. The lower the level the higher its inhibitory efficiency. Cycloheximide can ameliorate DNA repair during G 2 -prophase, even in the presence of caffeine. Likely, inhibition of protein synthesis during post-treatments with damaging agents allows damaged cells to have enough time for DNA repair before mitosis. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Aneugenic and <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agents</b> {{are good}} {{inducers}} of both micronuclei and apoptosis. In its turn, apoptosis may modify the threshold {{values for the}} induction of micro-nuclei. This is of major concern for accurate assessment of hazard related to exposure to mutagens. In the present work we studied the influence of caspases, the key regulat-ors of the apoptotic process, on the induction of micronuclei in the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. For this, we applied a combined approach in which both human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) and the paired human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF- 7, which is caspase- 3 deficient, and the caspase- 3 transfected MCF- 7 (MCF- 7 casp- 3) were used to study the influence of caspase activity on micronuclei. When nocodazole induced apop-tosis was inhibited {{by the use of}} inhibitors of the two main apical caspases- 8 and- 9 in PBMC, the frequencies of micronucleated binucleates (MNCB) increased with inhibi-tion of these caspases confirming that apoptosis can elimin-ate micronucleated cells. On the contrary when caspase- 3 was inhibited, the frequencies of MNCB was lower, suggest-ing a role of caspase- 3, also in micronuclei formation. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the induction of apoptosis and micronuclei by the aneugen nocodazole, the clastogen methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and the non-mutagenic apoptogen staurosporin in MCF- 7 and MCF- 7 casp- 3 cells. The results showed that when caspase- 3 activity was impaired, in the parental MCF- 7 cell line or in the MCF- 7 casp- 3 cells {{in the presence of the}} caspase- 3 inhibitor, the frequencies of nocodazole or MMS induced micronuclei decreased.

Amongst them Fanconi's anaemia (FA) {{is the most common}} and, together with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), the best characterized. The aim of this study was twofold: A. To devise a strategy which may prermit "expression cloning" of the FA genes. B: To characterise cytogenetic (and molecular) features of cells from FA and DC patients which may provide {{a better understanding of the}} basis of these disorders. As a first step towards cloning the gene (s) for Fanconi's anaemia (FA) I devised a selection system [based on the DNA cross-linking agents mitomycin-c (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB) ] that discriminates between FA and normal cells. 'Mixing experiments' (where approximately 10 normal cells were co-plated with 106 FA cells) demonstrated that it is possible to kill FA cells at high density without significantly affecting the cloning efficiency of normal cells. Transfection of FA fibroblasts with normal DNA (mouse genomic, human genomic, and human cDNA) either by calcium phosphate precipitation or by electroporation yielded 11 DEB and MMC resistant colonies. However, southern analysis of the DNA from these colonies with the appropriate probes gave no positive signal, and thus no "handle" to recover the FA gene (s). Experiments addressing the effect of the specific DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, on FA and normal cells showed: 1. The FA lymphocytes have increased chromosomal breakage compared to normal lymphocytes after incubation with camptothecin (p= 0. 006). 2. Incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) from normal subjects with camptothecin, produced the same type of chromosomal breakage as that seen in FA lymphocytes. 3. FA fibroblasts were more sensitive to camptothecin than normal fibroblasts. These data are compatible with either a defect which makes topoisomerase I more crucial, or its function being abnormal in some FA patients. In patients with DC, primary skin fibroblast cultures were abnormal in both morphology and growth rate. Survival studies using 4 clastogens and gamma-irradiation showed no significant difference between DC and normal fibroblasts. Cytogenetic studies performed on pbl showed no difference between DC and normal lymphocytes with or without prior incubation with clastogens. However, bone marrow from 1 out of 3 patients and fibroblasts from 2 out of 4 patients showed numerous unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in the absence of <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agents.</b> Although patients with FA and DC share some features in common they appear to differ in two fundamental ways: Firstly, unlike Fanconi cells, DC cells are not hypersensitive to clastogens.

Phytoextraction is a subprocess of phytoremediation in which plants are used to clean up contaminated matrices of various types (soil, sediments, water, etc.). Additionally, additive substances are often used in phytoextraction process (assisted phytoextraction). For our experiments, plants of Cannabis sativa L., var Ferimon, were grown in a soil contaminated by arsenic, a polluting and toxic metalloid; the soil was sampled in a contaminated industrial area, where the As concentration was extremely high (approximately 2000 mg/kg). This soil sample was used to set up microcosms with or without phosphate amendment (KH 2 PO 4 0. 1 M). When used as phosphate, phosphorus (P) is a plant nutrient and for its chemical properties and similarities with As, it can compete with the most oxidized form of As (arsenate) in plant nutrition and with soil binding sites. Moreover phosphate {{is very important for}} the As mobilization in soil and consequently it can influence As absorption and accumulation in plants. The phytoextractive capacity of hemp plant has been evaluated by analyzing the following parameters: the bioavailability variation of As in the soil, the As content into the roots, stems, and leaves; the effects of As on plant biomass production. Results indicated that Cannabis sativa L. was able to grow on the considered As-contaminated soil, and it was capable to phyto-accumulate a low concentration of As in aerial part, so the whole phytoextraction processes will have to be implemented. Moreover biochemical analyses, with appropriate enzymatic assays, were carried out to evaluate oxidative stress on Cannabis sativa L. leaves; results suggested a general increase of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response, except the catalase. In addition analysis of gas exchanges in leaves evidenced negative effects on plant physiology due to As contamination. Genotoxic and phytotoxic effects of different As contaminated matrices (derived from As polluted soil treated or not with phosphate and/or soil vegetated with hemp for 30 days), were analyzed in Vicia faba L. (a model plant for genotoxicity study) and for comparison in Cannabis sativa L [...] Results indicated that the As contaminated matrices induced phytotoxic effects highlighted by germination index and primary root length reduction. Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were evaluated by means of cytogenetic analyses of a statistically significant number of plant root apices derived from the different treatments. Cytotoxic effect was determined considering the variation of mitotic activity (Mitotic Index, MI) of plant meristems in comparison with control plant; genotoxic effect was estimated by micronucleus test (MN-test), a test based on the appearance of micronuclei as a results of DNA breakage caused by <b>clastogenic</b> <b>agents.</b> Cytogenetic analysis revealed the significant decrease of MI, the increase of chromosome anomalies and micronuclei in the root meristems from plants exposed to As contaminated soil.

40|$|The organophosphorous {{insecticide}} acephate {{was tested}} {{for its ability}} to induce in vitro cytogenetic effect in human peripheral lymphocytes by using the chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) assay. The level of nuclear DNA damage of acephate was evaluated by using the comet assay. Concentrations of 12. 5, 25, 50, 100 and 200  μg mL− 1 of acephate were used. All concentrations of acephate induced significant increase in the frequency of CAs and in the formation of MN dose dependently (r =  0. 92 at 24  h, r =  0. 95 at 48  h for CAs, r =  0. 87 for MN). A significant increase was observed in induction of SCE at 50, 100 and 200  μg mL− 1 concentrations during 24  h treatment and at all concentrations (except 12. 5  μg mL− 1) during 48  h treatment period in a dose-dependent manner (r =  0. 84 at 24  h, r =  0. 88 at 48  h). Acephate did not affect the replicative index and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI). However, it significantly decreased the mitotic index at all three highest concentrations (50, 100, 200  μg mL− 1) for 24  h treatment and at all concentrations (except 12. 5  μg mL− 1) for 48  h treatment, dose-dependently (r =  0. 94 at 24  h, r =  0. 92 at 48  h). A significant increase in mean comet tail length was observed at 100 and 200  μg mL− 1 concentrations compared with negative control in a concentration-dependent manner (r =  0. 94). The mean comet tail intensity was significantly increased at only 200  μg mL− 1 concentration. The present results indicate that acephate is a <b>clastogenic,</b> cytotoxic <b>agent</b> and it causes DNA damage at high concentrations in human lymphocytes in culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) {{has been used}} primarily to study interphase chromosomes of somatic cells. In this study, mitotic cells were fused to cells from the mouse testes to examine the chromosomes of germ cells. The testes contain various types of cells, both germinal and nongerminal. In these initial studies, four types of PCC morphologies were observed. Chromosome morphology of the PCC and labeling experiments demonstrated the mouse cell origin of various PCC. Attempts were next made to determine the cell types producing the PCC. Spermatogonia, diplotene spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids are proposed to be {{the origin of the}} PCC morphologies. Some PCC could be banded by G and C banding techniques and the mouse chromosomes identified. ^ Studies were subsequently undertaken to evaluate this technique as a method of evaluating damage to germ cells. Testicular cells from irradiated mice were fused to mitotic cells and the PCC examined. Both round spermatids and secondary spermatocytes exhibited chromosome damage in the form of chromatid breaks. A linear correlation was found between the dose of irradiation and the number of breaks per cell. This technique may develop into a useful method for evaluating the <b>clastogenic</b> effect of <b>agents</b> on the germ cells. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Chromosomal damage {{measurement}} is one {{of important}} ways to evaluate the toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity of drugs, chemicals, and rays. The observation that chromosome damage {{can be caused by}} exposure to ionizing radiation or carcinogenic chemicals was among the first reliable evidence that physical and chemical agents can cause major alterations to the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. The Cytokinesis-Blocked Micronucleus (CBMN) assay also allowed us to score the abnormal nuclear shapes (ANS). The CBMN assay in human lymphocytes {{is one of}} the most commonly used methods for measuring DNA damage. Material and methods: The study population included 20 healthy workers exposed to ionizing radiation (radiologist, technicians and nurses) and 20 individuals healthy people not exposed on radiation. Results: We found an high frequency of micronuclei in healthy workers exposed on ionization in comparison with the control group (healthy people not exposed on ionization). Also we evaluate other nuclear changes like nucleoplasmic bridges and binucleated cell with nuclear buds are biomarkers of chromosomal instability and major alterations in genetic material of the cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that chromosomal instability is in the correlation with micronucleus frequencies and genetic load in healthy workers. The formation of micronucleus and other changes indicates that healthy workers are exposed on <b>clastogenic</b> and aneugenic <b>agents</b> like ionizing radiation and have chromosomal instability and risk of cancer. ...|$|R
40|$|Benzene is a <b>clastogenic</b> and {{carcinogenic}} <b>agent</b> that induces acute {{myelogenous leukemia}} in humans and multiple of tumors in animals. Previous {{research has indicated}} that benzene must first be metabolized to one or more bioactive species to exert its myelotoxic and genotoxic effects. To better understand the possible role of individual benzene metabolites in the leukemogenic process, as well as to further investigate inhibition of topoisomerase II by benzene metabolites, a series of known and putative benzene metabolites, phenol, 4, 4 '-biphenol, 2, 2 '-biphenol, hydroquinone, catechol, 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol, 1, 4 -benzoquinone, and trans-trans-muconaldehyde were tested for inhibitory effects in vitro on the human topoisomerase II enzyme. With minor modifications of the standard assay conditions, 1, 4 -benzoquinone and trans-trans-muconaldehyde were shown to be directly inhibitory, whereas all of the phenolic metabolites were shown to inhibit enzymatic activity following bioactivation using a peroxidase activation system. The majority of compounds tested inhibited topoisomerase II at concentrations at or below 10 microM. These results confirm and expand upon previous findings from our laboratory and indicate that many of the metabolites of benzene could potentially interfere with topoisomerase II. Since other inhibitors of topoisomerase II have been shown to induce leukemia in humans, inhibition of this enzyme by benzene metabolites may also {{play a role in the}} carcinogenic effects of benzene...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>clastogenic</b> or {{mutagenic}} <b>agents</b> have rarely {{been studied in}} neotropical fish species exposed to contaminated water. In this study, the genetic damage caused by lead in the widely distributed South American fish, Hoplias malabaricus, was assessed using the comet (SCGE) assay and by testing for chromosomal aberrations. Eighteen specimens were acclimatized to laboratory conditions and then chronically exposed to contaminated food by feeding prey (Cyprinus sp.) injected intraperitoneally with doses of inorganic lead adjusted to give a contamination level of 21 mg of Pb 2 +. g- 1 net weight of H. malabaricus. Three fish were sampled for chromosomal analysis after four doses (18 days) and another three after eight doses (41 days) of lead and the results then compared with three untreated controls kept under lead-free conditions. An additional six treated fish and three controls were sampled for the comet assay after 13 doses (64 days). Exposure to lead significantly increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations {{and the frequency of}} tailed cell nuclei, the latter indicating DNA damage. These results show that H. malabaricus is a useful biological model for screening the clastogenic effects of lead and possibly other xenobiotics. The genetic damage seen here illustrates the need to investigate the potential effects of heavy metals on fish species in South America...|$|R
40|$|Background: The genetic {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are incompletely understood. Cancer predisposition is associated with chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Fanconi anemia patients are extremely sensitive to crosslinking agents and {{are at increased risk}} of developing several cancers including leukemias, gynecological, and head and neck cancers. The Fanconi Anemia proteins (FANCs) are involved in pathways necessary for crosslink damage recognition and repair. Eight FANC proteins (A/B/C/F/G/I/J/L) assemble into a nuclear complex and two other proteins, FANCD 1 /BRCA 2 and FANCD 2 act downstream of the core complex. This FA protein complex is required for the monoubiquitination of the FANCD 2 protein in response to DNA damage. By testing head and neck tumors for FANC characteristics, such as hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosome breakage FANCD 2 protein ubiquitination, formation of radial figures and genomic instability, we can determine whether this specific DNA damage repair pathway is intact in the tumors. Methods: Head and neck tumor cell lines were treated with the <b>clastogenic</b> crosslinking <b>agent,</b> diepoxybutane (DEB), and double-strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations were quantified. FANCA and FANCD 2 cell lines were analyzed as positive controls and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as negative controls. ivFindings: HNSCC cell lines treated with DEB have an increased number of DEB-induced double-strand breaks compared to normal lymphocytes, as evidenced by increased chromosomal breaks and tri- and quadriradials, suggesting defects in the DNA damage response. Interpretation: Patients who are hypersensitive to DNA damage are at increased risk of developing several types of cancer at an early age. Likewise, we predicted and showed that head and neck tumors have defects in the FANC pathway. This might suggest that the genes in the pathway either had germline or acquired alterations (mutations or regulatory defects), which could be tested by comparing normal cells from these patients to the tumor cells. Identifying and examining the mechanisms by which DNA damage occurs and is repaired can lead {{to a better understanding of}} genetic predisposition to cancer and to advances in early detection and treatment, therefore reducing morbidity and mortality. ...|$|R
40|$|Damage from {{occupational}} or {{accidental exposure}} to ionising radiation is often assessed by monitoring chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and these procedures have, in several cases, assisted physicians {{in the management}} of irradiated persons. Thereby, circulating lymphocytes, which are in the G 0 stage of the cell cycle are stimulated with a mitogenic agent, usually phytohaemagglutinin, to replicate in vitro their DNA and enter cell division, and are then observed for abnormalities. Comparison with dose-response relationships obtained in vitro allows an estimate of exposure based on scoring: Unstable aberrations by the conventional, well-established analysis of metaphases for chromosome abnormalities or for micronuclei; So-called stable aberrations by the classical G-banding (Giemsa-Stain-banding) technique or by the more recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) method using fluorescent-labelled probes for centromeres and chromosomes. Three factors need to be considered in applying such biological dosimetry: (1) Radiation doses in the body are often inhomogeneous. A comparison of the distribution of the observed aberrations among cells with that expected from a normal poisson distribution can allow conclusions to be made with regard to the inhomogeneity of exposure by means of the so-called contaminated poisson distribution method; however, its application requires a sufficiently large number of aberrations, i. e. an exposure to a rather large dose at a high dose rate. (2) Exposure can occur at a low dose rate (e. g. from spread or lost radioactive sources) rendering a comparison with in vitro exposure hazardous. Dose-effect relationships of most aberrations that were scored, such as translocations, follow a square law. Repair intervening during exposure reduces the quadratic component with decreasing dose rate as exposure is spread {{over a longer period of}} time. No valid solution for this problem has yet been developed, although, in theory, both deterministic damage and aberrations might be repaired to a similar degree; a comparison of aberrations following a linear dose relationship might also help when the doses have been sufficiently large. (3) Investigations might have been possible only a certain time after the exposure. The relatively rapid disappearance of lymphocytes carrying unstable aberrations limits their use in retrospective dosimetry, years after exposure. Scoring stable aberrations, thought to persist in the circulating lymphocytes, might appear more appropriate in such situations. However, the examination of a representative number of cells by G-banding is extremely laborious, and the FISH method is not only expensive but has not yet been fully validated in different laboratories. In conclusion, biological dosimetry has serious limitations exactly for situations where the need for information is most urgent. It renders its most useful results when an individual has been exposed to a rather homogeneous high-level radiation over a short time interval, i. e. accidents at high-intensity radiation devices. On the other hand, it yielded less satisfactory information even when the most recent techniques were used for situations, where a low level, low dose rate exposure has occurred at some time in the past, for example for persons living in areas contaminated from the Chernobyl accident. Such negative experiences should be kept in mind in order to avoid futile and expensive investigations in the case of populations exposed from radioactivity and, notably, also from potentially <b>clastogenic</b> chemical <b>agents...</b>|$|R
