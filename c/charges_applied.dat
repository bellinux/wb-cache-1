2500|$|In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on-male {{concepts}} of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, {{in the early}} times, also included adultery); vis, a physical assault for purpose of lust; and iniuria, a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned Lex Iulia specifically criminalized per vim stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, {{but only if the}} victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (ingenuus), and carried potential sentence of death or exile. [...] Iniuria was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than his/her owner.) [...] In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between [...] "active" [...] (penetrative) and [...] "passive" [...] (receptive) partners, and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these <b>charges</b> <b>applied</b> to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as Lex Scantinia covered at least some forms of male-on-male stuprum, and Quintillian mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces – about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay – as a normal penalty for stuprum upon an ingenuus. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known.|$|E

Cellular phones were not as prevalent as today, and wireless data services such as GPRS had not yet been deployed on US cellular networks. It was possible to use specially adapted dialup modems over cellular connections, but this was slow (typically topping out at 9.6 kbit/s), expensive (per-minute <b>charges</b> <b>applied),</b> and often flaky. In contrast, Ricochet was fast, flat-rate, and very reliable.|$|E

50|$|Taxation and <b>charges</b> <b>applied</b> in {{only one}} nation or region {{controversially}} affect the Barnett formula. In one example, the top-up tuition fees introduced in England are counted as additional English public expenditure (as the extra income is spent by the universities) and, therefore, an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund, paid for by UK-wide taxation, has been transferred to the Scottish Government. It was argued that this meant that only the English paid tuition fees, yet this money is shared with Scottish universities, despite Scottish students studying at those universities not having to contribute any extra fees.|$|E

50|$|In a {{commercial}} income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This {{can be done}} using revenue multipliers or capitalization rates applied to a Net Operating Income (NOI). Usually, an NOI has been stabilized {{so as not to}} place too much weight on a very recent event. An example of this is an unleased building which, technically, has no NOI. A stabilized NOI would assume that the building is leased at a normal rate, and to usual occupancy levels. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective Gross Income) less operating expenses (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation <b>charges</b> <b>applied</b> by accountants).|$|E

[...] This includes situations where Proposition 218 constitutional preconditions (e.g., prior voter approval for taxes or the majority protest process for property-related fees and <b>charges)</b> <b>applied</b> to the local government levy. As a practical matter, this means that a local levy will typically be in effect and imposed by a local government {{for a period of time}} (sometimes as long as a year or more) before local voters would have an opportunity to reduce or repeal that levy in an election utilizing the local initiative power under Proposition 218.|$|E

However outside this situation there is anecdotal evidence of significantly higher charges being applied where third party owner/operated ATMs are used, including those operated/owned by other Spanish banks. These may be in reported but unverified cases to be as high as 5+% of the value withdrawn.An effort is currently being made to research, identify and quantify the structure and nature of what from this anecdotal evidence, appear in some cases to be excessive charges. The case is complicated because the fees can originate from the ATM operator, or/and the customers own bank, for as [...] "processing fees".|$|E
