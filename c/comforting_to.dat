500|$|Late 2004 saw {{the first}} two recognitions of Whedonesque.com by major Internet media. [...] On November 22, 2004, Whedonesque was {{selected}} as SciFi.com's Site of the Week, which commented [...] "first-rate weblog on all things Joss-related" [...] that [...] "has very clearly laid-out guidelines for posting and a solid policy on how to label spoilers." [...] On December 14, 2004 USA Todays Pop Candy selected [...] "the Whedonesque gang" [...] as the 70th of its [...] "top 100 people of 2004", calling it [...] "... <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> visit Whedonesque.com each day, where piles of links are posted by my fellow Joss Whedon obsessives." [...] In 2005, Whedonesque was cited {{as a case study}} in marketing success.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E
2500|$|In Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid (2013), Giovanni {{describes}} {{falling off}} of a bike and her mother saying, [...] "Come here, Nikki and I will pick you up." [...] She has explained that it was <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> hear her mother say this, and that [...] "it took me the longest to realize – no, she made me get up myself." [...] Chasing Utopia continues as a hybrid (poetry and prose) work about food as a metaphor and as {{a connection to the}} memory of her mother, sister, and grandmother. The theme of the work is love relationships.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} role that SciTech plays in death, palliative care {{constitutes}} a specialized area of healthcare philosophy that specifically relates to patients who are terminally ill. Similar to hospice care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. Even though the terms [...] "palliative" [...] and [...] "hospice" [...] are typically used interchangeably, they are actually quite different. As a patient nears {{the end of his}} life, it is more <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. Palliative care has generally been reserved for those who have a terminal illness. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In the Western world, {{much of the}} {{bereavement}} {{literature of}} the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences {{as a form of}} denial, in the tradition of Freud's interpretation in Mourning and Melancholia of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'. In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) [...] has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways While most of these experiences tend to be reported as <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others, to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.|$|E

[...] Uncut also gave it four stars and said, [...] "What's especially daring about Not Too Late {{is the degree to}} which Jones and [...] Alexander trust their songs and her languorous voice to hold the listener's interest." [...] musicOMH likewise gave it four stars and said that [...] "This collection of quaint, feel-good numbers is not going to set the world alight, but it offers something warm and <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> come home to." [...] Now gave it the similar four stars out of five score and called it [...] "A very good showcase for Jones's evolution as a writer and musician." [...] The Phoenix gave it three stars out of four and said of Jones, [...] "Too good to hate, not exciting enough to love, she still makes most of what’s out there sound like phony baloney." [...] Hartford Courant gave it a positive review and also said of Jones, [...] "Subtlety was a defining characteristic of her first two records, and it carries over onto 'Not Too Late,' where even the differences are understated and discreet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In a strange way, it was <b>comforting</b> <b>to</b> me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E
