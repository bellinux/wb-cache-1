5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{nothing better than}} to outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects {{is known as}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
60|$|The {{other form}} of the fallacy: Things which we <b>can</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{together}} <b>can</b> not exist together—including {{as one of its}} branches, that what we <b>can</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as existing <b>can</b> not exist at all—may thus be briefly expressed: Whatever is inconceivable must be false.|$|R

25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> system {{architecture}} {{as a set}} of representations of an existing (or future) system. These representations initially describe a general, high-level functional organization, and are progressively refined to more detailed and concrete descriptions.|$|E
25|$|So we <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the {{category}} of real vector bundles on X as sitting inside {{the category}} of sheaves of OX-modules; this latter category is abelian, so {{this is where we}} can compute kernels and cokernels of morphisms of vector bundles.|$|E

25|$|For all causal {{and stable}} {{systems that have}} the same {{magnitude}} response, the minimum phase system has its energy concentrated near {{the start of the}} impulse response. i.e., it minimizes the following function which we <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as the delay of energy in the impulse response.|$|E
25|$|By {{commutativity}} and associativity one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> join {{and meet}} as binary operations that are defined on non-empty finite sets, {{rather than on}} elements. In a bounded lattice the empty join and the empty meet can also be defined (as 0 and 1, respectively). This makes bounded lattices somewhat more natural than general lattices, and many authors require all lattices to be bounded.|$|E

25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> each row {{operation}} as {{the left}} product by an elementary matrix. Denoting by B {{the product of}} these elementary matrices, we showed, on the left, that BA = I, and therefore, B = A−1. On the right, we kept a record of BI = B, which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.|$|E
25|$|Schellenberg says he hasn't {{seen any}} serious {{objections}} to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder {{writes about the}} possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.|$|E
25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> MEMS {{resonators}} {{as small}} bells that ring at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of}} a millimeter across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. MEMS resonators have operated at over a gigahertz.|$|E

25|$|Wargrave then {{suggests}} searching all the rooms, and any {{potentially dangerous}} items they <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> are locked up. Lombard's gun {{is missing from}} his room. When Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell of seaweed left {{hanging from the ceiling}} of her room and screams; the remaining guests rush upstairs to her room. Wargrave, however, is still downstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge. Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead.|$|E
25|$|Radio signals {{consist of}} {{constantly}} varying electric and magnetic fields arranged at right angles. When {{the magnetic field}} passes a metal object, it will cause the electrons in the metal to begin moving synchronously with the signal. According to Faraday's law of induction, this effect is maximized when the object and field are {{at right angles to}} each other (alternately, one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the electric field being in-line with the object). Although radio signals will propagate in any orientation, for the signals considered here the propagation is strongly attenuated if the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the ground. For this reason, radio antennae, both broadcaster and receiver, are normally vertical. Such signals are said to be vertically polarized.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
