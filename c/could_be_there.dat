25|$|The writ of coram nobis {{does not}} lie to correct any error in the {{judgment}} of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>there</b> would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} known {{examples}} of call triage occurring in the dispatch centre occurred in 1975, when the Phoenix, Arizona Fire Department assigned some of its paramedics to their dispatch centre in order to interview callers and prioritize calls. [...] The following year, Dr. Jeff Clawson, a physician employed by the Salt Lake City Fire Department as its Medical Director, developed a series of key questions, pre-arrival instructions, and dispatch priorities {{to be used in}} the processing of EMS calls. [...] These ultimately evolved into the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS), APCO (EMD) and PowerPhone's Total Response Computer aided call handling (CACH) system. [...] Such systems were initially technologically quite primitive; in the mid-1970s the use of computers in dispatching was extremely uncommon, and those that used them were dealing with very large mainframe computers. Most such systems were based on either reference cards or simple flip charts, and have been described by lay people on more than one occasion as being like a [...] "recipe file" [...] for ambulance dispatchers. [...] The development of pre-arrival instructions presented an entirely new challenge for those involved in emergency medical dispatch; it might take eight or more minutes for paramedics to arrive at the patient's side, but dispatchers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> in seconds. [...] Physicians began to see a dramatic new potential for the saving of lives by means of simple scripted telephone instructions from the dispatcher, and the concept of Dispatch Life Support was born. [...] Suddenly dispatchers were providing complex information and instructions to callers, and even providing guidance on performing procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by telephone. The concept became an area of medical research, and even EMS Medical Directors debated on the best approach to such services.|$|E
