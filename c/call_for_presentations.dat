They are constructed on {{the notion of}} category enriched in higher-dimensional vector spaces. Linear polygraphs allow more possibilities of termination orders than those associated to Gröbner bases. We introduce polygraphic resolutions of algebras giving a description obtained by rewriting of higher-dimensional syzygies <b>for</b> <b>presentations</b> of algebras. We show how to compute polygraphic resolu-tions starting from a convergent presentation, and how to relate these resolutions with the Koszul property of algebras...|$|R
40|$|I review {{theoretical}} and experimental challenges {{in studies of}} the ratio of multiplicities in quark and gluon jets, and its relevance for our understanding of hadronization. At the best of conferences, a talk initiates reactions and discussions which are more relevant for the proceedings than the talk itself. New bright ideas initiated by the reactions could <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>presentation,</b> or there could be an apparent need to review the basic arguments, perused and put in perspective in the discussions. I have at this conference {{had the privilege of}} experiencing the latter. Therefore, this note is not so much about the latest calculations, presented here at Moriond 2001, but rather a review and summary of presentations during three years, triggered by the response at this conference. Narratio The ratio of multiplicities in gluon and quark jets, r, at asymptotic energies, is predicted by perturbative QCD (pQCD) since long. 1, 2 Renormalization group (RG) calculations 1 and the modified leading log approximation (MLLA) 2 of parton showers (PS) give identical results on the leading, O (√ αs), correction. At the higher of presently available energies, these reduce the asymptotic value, 9 / 4, with about 10 %. The theoretical calculations apply to parton multiplicities...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} Web 2. 0 {{brought a}} new breadth to the Internet, and a social perspective that seems set to stay. Services such as LinkedIn, Hi 5, and Facebook have found a place in our society. People connect to each other through common paths. Meta-APIs such as Google 2 ̆ 7 s November 2007 release, OpenSocial, enable social applications to operate across multiple sites and services, providing a way to relate much of this data. In social bookmarking tools (e. g. Del. icio. us, Connotea, Bibsonomy), and media sharing services (such as Youtube, Flickr, Picasa, Slideshare) people are asked to tag and otherwise annotate and share their resources inside communities or at a global scale, creating {{a huge amount of}} user generated metadata (tags) with a clear value for information discovery. This workshop intends to gather all interested in such applications and developments, and in their relationship with metadata and practices. The themes of the workshop will be:-Emerging trends in social tagging. -Tagging communities and Web-based collaboration. -Web standards for resource description in collaborative landscapes. -Vocabulary building from folksonomies (tag-ontologies, tag-thesaurus, etc.) -Metadata and annotation management. -Formats for describing communities (FOAF, SIOC, etc.) -Analysis of online communities (SNA) through folksonomies and tagging systems. -Other ways of describing information for Web 2. 0 (microformats, etc.) A description of the workshop formatThe workshop will include invited talks and presentations, giving a consistent background for discussion. This will be followed by short presentations or position papers submitted by interested researchers, bloggers, etc. that will be evaluated by the Program Committee (see below). The <b>Call</b> <b>for</b> <b>Presentations</b> will be sent to discussion lists from different perspectives and backgrounds, including the DC Social Tagging Community, microformats- and other related communities. A discussion on improving communication between (and thus research within) different user-generated metadata communities will be included. This last session in the workshop will be conducted ?BridgeCamp? style. (BridgeCamp grew from the Barcamp movement, in which participants in the workshop are offered an essentially unfilled timetable in which to either propose questions, offer to give a 5 - 10 minute presentation answering them, with a further 10 - 5 minutes for discussion. Several members of the Program Committee have considerable experience with this style of workshop and have found it to be a valuable addition to a traditional set of presentations, providing a structure more readily oriented to outcomes relevant to the participants than normal ?breakout sessions?) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of the first fractal generating software originated in Benoit Mandlebrot's pursuit of a generalized function for a class of shapes known as Julia sets. In 1979, Mandlebrot discovered that one image of the complex plane could be created by iteration. He and programmers working at IBM generated the first rudimentary fractal printouts. [...] This marked the first instance of the generation of fractals by non-linear creations laws or 'escape time fractal'. Loren Carpenter created a two-minute color film <b>called</b> Vol Libre <b>for</b> <b>presentation</b> at SIGGRAPH in 1980. Fractals were rendered in computer games as early as 1984 {{with the release of}} Rescue on Fractalus!. From the early 1980s to about 1995 hundreds of different fractal types were formulated.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of network}} {{properties}} in resting-state fMRI experiments [1] demonstrate {{the possibility to}} investigate large numbers of very weak connections between regions that {{are not related to}} any task. However, in brain networks, the goal is often to find the spatial location and extent of a signal source. This study uses three-dimensional (3 D) visualisation techniques (e. g. surface rendering) and graphics primitives (surfaces, lines, tubes) to display the connections of a brain network, as well as the regions that are connected, in anatomical space. Theory Other analyses of large resting-state networks [2, 3] show that large networks with different types of connections (long-range, low frequency vs. short-range, high-frequency) present a visualisation problem: the large amount of data <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> an abstract <b>presentation</b> that reorganises the locations of the nodes [4], or simplified representations where part of the spatial information is discarded ([3], see Fig. 5 - 6). a surface rendering of the AAL regions Imagin...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The International Patient Decision Aid Standards, a {{framework}} {{for the creation of}} high-quality decision aids, <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the <b>presentation</b> of probabilities. To inform the content of a goals-of-care decision aid in critically-ill TBI (ciTBI) patients, we examined physician’s awareness, perceptions, and use of the IMPACT-model, the most widely validated ciTBI outcome model, and explored their preferences for communicating prognostic information towards families. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in 20 attending physicians (neurocritical care, neurosurgery, trauma, palliative care) at 7 U. S. academic medical centers. We used descriptive statistics and performed qualitative content analysis of transcribed interviews to identify major themes. Results: Only 12 physicians (60 %) expressed awareness of the IMPACT-model; two stated that they “barely” knew the model. Seven physicians indicated using the model {{at least some of the}} time in clinical practice, although none used it exclusively to derive a patient’s prognosis. Four major themes emerged: the IMPACT-model is intended for research but should not be applied to individual patients; mistrust in the IMPACT-model derivation data; the IMPACT-model is helpful in reducing prognostic variability among physicians; concern that statistical models may mislead families about a patient’s prognosis. Conclusions: We identified substantial variability in the awareness of, use, and attitude toward the IMPACT model among physicians. Understanding knowledge, use, and barriers to using existing models, like IMPACT, is vital for creating and implementing a meaningful shared decision-making tool to improve goals-of-care discussions...|$|R

40|$|The Western Mexico chachalaca (Ortalis poliocephala) is a large, frugivorous bird {{endemic to}} the {{tropical}} dry forest of western Mexico. They are very vocal, with a distinctive call that serves a variety of purposes, not {{all of which are}} understood, but can be used in territorial displays and as an alarm of danger. The call contains two motifs with the first consisting of two to four harsh notes gaining in volume and pitch. The second motif has considerable variation in the number of syllables (two to eight), but consists of three harsh notes increasing in pitch. Our objective was to investigate how the frequency of calling varied {{over the course of the}} day and habitat type. The research was conducted at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela in Jalisco, Mexico over four days in late March. We walked a 4. 8 kilometer route through the forest in the morning and late afternoon and recorded each group we encountered for a ten minute period. Our route took us along the ridge and down in the arroyo. Meanwhile, we also recorded the number of calls heard from the field station itself. The data showed that O. poliocephala called almost exclusively between the times of 06 : 00 and 11 : 00. Habitat type did not seem crucial in determining location of groups. Understanding vocalization patterns helps give us an insight into the group dynamics of the birds and opens door for future research into the meaning behind the <b>calls.</b> <b>For</b> this <b>presentation,</b> Julia VanDerslice and Emily Reyer received a College of the Sciences Best Oral <b>Presentation</b> Award <b>for</b> 2014...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the {{framework}} of relational work, or the work individuals invest in maintaining their relationships (Locher and Watts 2005), {{to the analysis of}} prenatal screening (PS) for Down Syndrome of Chinese clients in Hong Kong. PS has traditionally followed a nondirective principle that <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> an unbiased <b>presentation</b> of information and women’s autonomous decision- making regarding testing. However, in Chinese contexts, healthcare providers appear extremely directive; and women, in turn, explicitly express their expectations of being led in decision-making (Zayts et al. 2013). These observations lend support to previous politeness studies of Chinese institutional contexts wherein hierarchical communication has been described as “listening-centered, asymmetrical and differential” (Gao and Ting-Toomey 1998 : 48). More recent politeness studies, however, warn against such stereotyping at a cultural level (Eelen 2001; Mills 2003, 2004; Watts 2003). In this paper, rather than using culture as an a priori explanatory variable to account for the directive stance of the healthcare providers, we argue that using {{the framework of}} relational work enables researchers to focus on how meaning is created and negotiated at the micro-level of an interaction, and to move away from “grand generalizations” about culture specific behaviors and expectations...|$|R
