500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of the Clinton Administration, {{often referred}} to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. [...] The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. [...] Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. [...] Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> <b>may</b> have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1993 Clinton {{encouraged}} {{congress to}} pass the Brady bill, stating that he would sign it if they passed it. [...] That same month Charles Schumer introduced the bill in the House and Howard Metzenbaum did so in the Senate. [...] Public opinion polls at the time showed a majority favored the bill. [...] After several months of debate, the White House had put enough pressure on congress to get several Republican in both houses to support the bill. [...] Despite last-ditch efforts by pro-gun Senators and the NRA, the bill managed to pass both houses and {{was signed into law}} on November 30, 1993. [...] The law required a five-day waiting period after purchasing a handgun, and the dealer had to report the sale to the local chief law enforcement officer to run a check on the buyer. [...] <b>Clinton</b> <b>may</b> have called the bill a [...] "good beginning" [...] for more gun control legislation. [...] Many credit Clinton's skills at building coalitions and using the public stage to keep pressure on getting the bill passed.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that Clinton {{has a long history}} of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other side of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>may</b> feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Momentum {{shifted in}} Clinton's favor, and {{she won the}} popular vote in the Nevada caucuses eleven days later, despite Obama's {{endorsement}} from the influential Culinary Workers Union. However, Obama ran strongly in rural areas throughout the state and beat Clinton in the delegate count. Edwards's support collapsed in Nevada, as voters coalesced around the two apparent frontrunners. Dennis Kucinich withdrew from the race. In the following week, issues of race {{came to the fore}} as campaigning began for the South Carolina primary, the first to feature a large proportion of African Americans in the Democratic electorate. Behind in the state polls, Hillary Clinton left to campaign in some Super Tuesday states, while her husband, former president Bill Clinton, stayed in South Carolina and engaged in a series of exchanges with Obama. CBS News reported, [...] "By injecting himself into the Democratic primary campaign with a series of inflammatory and negative statements, Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>may</b> have helped his wife's presidential hopes in the long term but at the cost of his reputation with a group of voters [...] that have long been one of his strongest bases of political support." [...] Obama won by a more than two-to-one margin over Clinton, gaining 55% of the vote to her 27% and Edwards's 18%. The day of the primary, Bill Clinton compared Obama's expected win to Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1988 South Carolina primary. His comments were widely criticized as an apparent attempt to dismiss the primary results and marginalize Obama by implying that he was [...] "the black candidate." [...] The momentum generated by Obama's larger-than-expected win in South Carolina was deflated somewhat by the win Clinton claimed in the nullified Florida primary the following week. John Edwards suspended his candidacy on January 30. He did not immediately endorse either Clinton or Obama, but said they both had pledged to carry forward his central campaign theme of ending poverty in America. Neither Clinton nor Obama had a clear advantage heading into the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries, with 23 states and territories and 1,681 delegates at stake and more media attention than any primary election day in American history.|$|E
