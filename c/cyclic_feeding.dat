While earlier studies in this direction focused on relatively short single feed restriction-refeeding protocols, the present trial was designed to evaluate the impact of different repeated <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> schemes on the zootechnical response of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) over a complete growing phase up to the commercial size.

40|$|Feeds {{and feeding}} {{practices}} {{have a major}} influence on sustainability of intensive fish farming, in addition they affect many quality attributes of cultured fish species. In the framework of the “I. R. IDEA” project, the composition of feeds, feeding practices and major quality traits of fish produced by the local trout farming industry were investigated with the aim at seeking for possible distinctive features and/or suggesting novel feeding protocols which could add value to the regional trout supply chain. The survey has shown that the locally used trout feeds are quite different in formulation and nutrient characteristics resulting in variable quality attributes of the fish flesh. This actually does not allow acknowledgement of particular features of the local trout farming process/products. An agreement between fish farmers and the feed-mill industry for a sustainable range of raw materials–nutrients specifications to be set in trout feeds, is strongly recommended as an effective way to characterise local trout products and supply chain. Also the feeding practices and protocols currently adopted by the local trout farmers do not possess peculiar features. On this subject we have tested <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> as a novel protocol being adopted {{for the first time in}} commercial trout farms. The results obtained so far have shown <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> to be a promising practice, resulting in improved economic and environmental sustainability when compared to conventional feeding protocols. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> should be also recommended as a possible tool to characterise local trout farming management and supply chain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The diurnal {{cycle of}} hepatic HMG CoA reductase {{activity}} was studied {{under conditions of}} controlled feeding where the percentage of dietary lipid, alone or in combination with 2 % cholestyramine, was varied. Cholestyramine caused an increase in HMG CoA reductase activity that began soon after feeding started and peaked 6 hr later. In contrast, a diet containing 20 % corn oil was a much weaker inducer of the enzyme but caused a prolonged elevation that began late in the fasting part of the cycle.

40|$|Initial tests {{results are}} {{presented}} for the novel process of hydrogen production called unmixed steam reforming (USR) using methane and sunflower oil fuels. The USR process relies on two mass transfer materials which operate on a two-step cycle: an oxygen transfer material (OTM) which provides the heat necessary for the steam reforming reaction, and a CO 2 sorbent which shifts the water gas reaction yielding a H 2 -rich reformate gas. A shortlist of Ni-based OTMs and a natural dolomite were tested during bench-scale investigation and optimisation stages following micro-reactor tests. Under near-isothermal conditions, we show the sequence via which the main reactions occurred. We unexpectedly found that thermal decomposition of the fuel {{played a significant role}} in the early H 2 production concurrent with coking conditions, by causing the OTM to initially reduce. The direct OTM reduction from the fuel via the unmixed combustion reaction then took over to a point where the steam reforming reaction could begin. Most importantly, carbon lay-down (coking) during the fuel/steam flow did not lower gradually the process efficiency, as it was shown to completely oxidise under the <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeds</b> of air and fuel/steam flows of the USR process.

40|$|In female mammals {{including}} rodents and humans, feeding decreases {{during the}} periovulatory {{period of the}} ovarian cycle, which coincides with a surge in circulating estrogen levels. Ovariectomy increases food intake, which can be normalized by estrogen treatment at a dose and frequency mimicking those during the estrous cycle. Furthermore, administration of estrogen to rodents potently inhibits food intake. Despite these well-known effects of estrogen, neuronal subtypes that mediate estrogen's anorexigenic effects have not been identified. In this study, we show that changes in hypothalamic expression of agouti-related protein (Agrp) and neuropeptide Y (Npy) coincide with the <b>cyclic</b> changes in <b>feeding</b> across the estrous cycle. These <b>cyclic</b> changes in <b>feeding</b> are abolished in mice with degenerated AgRP neurons even though these mice cycle normally. Central administration of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) decreases food intake in controls but not in mice lacking the AgRP neurons. Furthermore, E 2 treatment suppresses fasting-induced c-Fos activation in AgRP and NPY neurons and blunts the refeeding response. Surprisingly, although estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is the key mediator of estrogen's anorexigenic effects, we find that expression of ERα is completely excluded from AgRP and NPY neurons in the mouse hypothalamus, suggesting that estrogen may regulate these neurons indirectly via presynaptic neurons that express ERα. This study indicates that neurons coexpressing AgRP and NPY are functionally required for the <b>cyclic</b> changes in <b>feeding</b> across estrous cycle and that AgRP and NPY neurons are essential mediators of estrogen's anorexigenic function...|$|R

40|$|In most mammals, daily rhythms in {{physiology}} {{are driven}} by a circadian timing system composed of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral oscillators in most body cells. The SCN clock, which is phase-entrained by light–dark cycles, is thought to synchronize subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues, mainly by driving <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior. Here, we examined the expression of circadian clock genes in the SCN and the liver of the common vole Microtus arvalis, a rodent with ultradian activity and feeding rhythms. In these animals, clock-gene mRNAs accumulate with high circadian amplitudes in the SCN but are present at nearly constant levels in the liver. Interestingly, high-amplitude circadian liver gene expression can be elicited by subjecting voles to a circadian feeding regimen. Moreover, voles with access to a running wheel display a composite pattern of circadian and ultradian behavior, which correlates with low-amplitude circadian gene expression in the liver. Our data indicate that, in M. arvalis, the amplitude of circadian liver gene expression depends on the contribution of circadian and ultradian components in activity and feeding rhythms. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} examine whether {{circulating}} concentrations {{of a range of}} vitamins and trace elements in patients receiving long-term <b>cyclic</b> enteral tube <b>feeding</b> vary during the day, and whether standardised time points for blood sampling are required for assessment of nutrient status. Methods: Circulating concentrations or activities of water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamins B 6, B 12, folate and C), fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E) and trace elements (iron, zinc, copper and selenium (assessed by glutathione peroxidase activity), were measured at 0, 3, 6 and 9 – 12 h after cessation of nocturnal feeding (fasting), in eight clinically stable patients receiving cyclic nocturnal enteral nutrition. Results: The circulating concentrations of the nutrients did not change between the fed and fasted state (repeated-measures-ANOVA) except the following: plasma folate increased progressively from 10. 9 (SD 4. 6) nmol/l in the fed state to 14. 0 (SD 4. 4) nmol/l at 9 – 12 h after cessation of feeding (P< 0. 05); plasma zinc increased progressively throughout the fasting period by 33. 5 % (8. 57, SD 0. 68 vs. 11. 44, SD 1. 85 ?mol/l, in fed state vs. 9 – 12 h fast respectively, P< 0. 05); and total tocopherol/cholesterol ratio decreased by 9. 6 % during the study period (P< 0. 02), while ?-tocopherol increased by 59. 2 % (P< 0. 05). For all analytes, the concentrations in blood samples taken at 3 and 6 h after cessation of feeding were not significantly different from those at 9 – 12 h. Conclusions: Although cessation of nocturnal tube feeding had no significant effect on the circulating concentrations of most micronutrients, it increased plasma folate and zinc concentrations, and decreased the tocopherol/cholesterol ratio.

40|$|Behavioural {{observations}} of Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus {{were made by}} diving at two locations on the Avalon Peninsula. Qualitative descriptions of the daily activity were compiled with two fundamental postures, REST and ALERT, and four behaviours, rooting, agonism, locomotion, and feeding, being observed. A behavioural profile for the longhorn sculpin was derived from these descriptions. [...] Feeding behaviour occurs in a stereotyped pattern, similar in its basic form to the feeding of other marine and freshwater predators. Despite these behavioural characteristics, the longhorn is an ineffective predator of smaller benthic fish species. Field observations indicated that the longhorn is primarily a visual feeder. Laboratory experiments however, revealed that this species also employs other sensory modes {{for the detection of}} food. [...] Stomach contents, intestinal contents, and occurrence of digestive stages in specimens caught over a 24 hour period, indicated <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> during the capelin (Mallotus villosus), spawning period. However, an Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), revealed that time was not the most important factor affecting ingestion. [...] Caloric analysis of selected prey organisms indicated that capelin, with a value of 5341 calories per gram dry weight, is the most energy rich food resource for inshore populations of the longhorn sculpin. Large scale movements of M. octodecemspinosus to shallower, inshore waters of Newfoundland during the early summer are suggested to be a phenomenon related to the availability of this food resource...|$|E
40|$|Gonostoma elongatum is an {{important}} mesopelagic fish found throughout the world at subtropical-tropical latitudes. This study examined its distribution, abundance and life history in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The species was a strong diel migrator, found from 25 to 325 m at night and from 425 to 725 m during the day with small fish occurring shallower than large fish. Numerical abundance and biomass were high, rivaling the dominant species of myctophids in the Gulf of Mexico. There no obvious seasonal fluctuations in population abundance. G. elongatum is a protandric hermaphrodite whose population breeds throughout the year and females probably once a lifetime. Growth rate, based on 2 ̆ 7 daily 2 ̆ 7 ring counts from otoliths, was linear (0. 34 mm d- 1) and the largest fish (225 mm Standard Length) was estimated to live less than 2 yr. G. elongatum feeds primarily on crustaceons, with copepods and ostracods dominating in early juvenile stages (SL) and euphausiids in the larger sizes. Diet composition shows little apparent seasonal variation. Size selectivity in feeding occurs, with G. elongatum preferentially ingesting medium to large zooplankton, a trend which becomes stronger with age. Taxonomic selectivity occurs as well in that this species preferentially feeds on conchoecid ostracods and copepods Pleuromamma spp. There is an obvious selection against non-crustacean prey. A <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> pattern was observed with most active feeding occurring in the 25 to 250 m zone at night. While G. elongatum has relatively little predation impact on one of its principal foods (Pleuromamma spp.) over the entire zone of occurrence of this prey genus, predation in substantial on large Pleuromamma (3 ̆e 3 mm) in certain depth zones (150 to 200 m) at night...|$|E
40|$|Day/night {{variations}} in the size distribution of the particulate matter > 0. 15 mm (PM) were studied in May 1995 during the DYNAPROC time-series cruise in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Data on vertical distributions of PM (> 0. 15 mm) and zooplankton were collected with the Underwater Video Profiler (UVP). The comparisons of the UVP data with plankton net data and POC data from water bottles indicated that more than 97 % of the particles detected by the UVP were non-living particles (0. 15 mm) and that the PM contributed 4 - 34 % of the total dry weight measured on GF/F filters. Comparison of seven pairs of day and night vertical profiles performed during the cruise showed that in the upper 800 m, the mean size and the volume of particles was higher at night than during the day. During the night, the integrated volume of the PM increased on average by 32 ± 20 %. This increase corresponded to a shift of smaller size classes (0. 5 mm). During the day, the pattern was reversed, and the quantity of PM > 0. 5 mm decreased. During the study period, the standing stock of PM (60 - 800 m) decreased from 7. 5 to less than 2 g m? 2 but the diel variations persisted, except for two short periods in the superficial layer following a wind event. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> activity induced by the diel vertical migration of zooplankton {{could be the best}} candidate to explain the observed diel fluctuations in the size classes of PM in the water column.

Three major challenges need to be tackled for in-vivo kinetic identification: (1) measurement limitations: the available data set contains only few observations of noisy data; (2) distinctive experimental setup: a high excitation is required and (3) parameter identification limitations, since kinetic models are highly non-linear. Aims To accurately estimate carbon fluxes under metabolic dynamic conditions from 13 C labeling experiments and develop a kinetic model to describe the interaction of storage metabolism with central carbon metabolism. Methods An experimental platform based on a dynamic, <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> regime (20 s feed in 400 s cycle) is used to accommodate for concentration and labeling measurements. The cycles are highly reproducible, enabling to sample one cycle to obtain concentrations, switch to labeled substrate and follow the labeling enrichment. The concentration and labeling information is then evaluated to estimate dynamic flux profiles using a novel modeling approach [1]. The dynamic flux profiles are compared to those obtained under continuous cultivation conditions (aerobic culture of S. cerevisiae at an average growth rate of 0. 1 h- 1). Results Measured time profiles for O 2 and CO 2 concentrations in the off gas and dissolved oxygen along with the feeding pattern prove a high reproducibility of the cycles. Time profiles for concentrations and enrichments of metabolites from glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and storage evidence the dynamic behavior of the complete metabolism during the cycle. Comparing dynamic and steady-state conditions, shifts in metabolic activity are observed. Especially, the Pentose phosphate pathway {{seems to be more}} active under dynamic conditions. Under dynamic conditions, about 80 % of the carbon uptake is entering glycolysis, 10 % storage and 10 % is directed to the oxidative PPP. A slight decrease in biomass yield (5 %) has been observed. Conclusions The experimental approach allows for concentration and labeling measurements under dynamic conditions and together with a hybrid modeling approach allows for the estimation of short term flux profiles (400 s). Dynamic metabolic fluxes can be reconstructed in time. Together with the measured concentrations, a start point for a further reconstruction of kinetic functions is set. New insight on the storage carbohydrate dynamics and its relation with central carbon metabolism have been obtained showing that under dynamic conditions the storage metabolism (glycogen and trehalose) seem to reduce the dynamics of flux changes...|$|E
40|$|Dietary zinc-deficiency induces a {{striking}} reduction and a cyclic pattern of food intake in rodents. To elucidate the mechanisms for these effects, we studied the hypothalamic content, synthesis, {{and distribution of}} galanin (GAL) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) during zinc deficiency and refeeding in the rat. In Wistar rats, three weeks of zinc-deprivation consistently induced a reduction and a cyclic pattern of night- and day-time food intake, {{as well as of}} water intake. This was accompanied in zinc-deficient (ZD) rats, {{and to a lesser extent}} in pair-fed (PF) rats, by a decrease of hypothalamic GAL mRNA concentration (CTR: 100 +/- 8, ZD: 61 +/- 4, PF: 78 +/- 2 arbitrary densitometric units, ADU, P < 0. 01) and an increase of hypothalamic NPY (CTR: 100 +/- 11, ZD: 154 +/- 10, PF: 126 +/- 4 ADU, P < 0. 05), without peptide modification. The two neuropeptidergic systems were not affected by the cycles of feeding, with the exception of the NPY-immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (geniculo-hypothalamic tract), that was inversely correlated to the food intake in both ZD and PF animals. In a second experiment, we showed that zinc-repletion for 4 days suppressed the behaviour induced by a two-week zinc-deprivation, and reversed the increase of NPY mRNA in ZD animals. We finally demonstrated that zinc-deficiency induced a similar behaviour in Zucker rats. However, in these rats whose synthesis of NPY is constitutively up-regulated, no change of NPY synthesis was observed in ZD rats, suggesting that the increase observed in Wistar is adaptative rather than instrumental to the abnormal food intake. In conclusion, we have further characterized the <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour of the zinc-deficient Wistar rats, and shown in these animals a decreased activity of the GAL system and an increased activity of the NPY system, likely corresponding to a compensatory response of the two neuropeptidergic systems, as observed in food-deprived animals. As spontaneous food intake of ZD rats does not increase, a resistance to NPY could also be present. These behavioural and neuropeptidergic changes were partially reversed by reintroduction of zinc in the diet. In Zucker rats, the same behaviour occurred despite an insensitivity of the NPY system to the zinc-deficiency. In addition, we describe a nutritional regulation of the NPY-immunoreactivity in the geniculo-hypothalamic tract, that could constitute the substrate of circadian rhythm modulation by timed feeding...|$|E

L'objectif principal de ce travail est de montrer qu'une alimentation séquentielle d'un réacteur parfaitement agité avec maintien permanent du recyclage des boues et de l'oxygénation permet d'obtenir une bonne épuration tant du point de vue de l'élimination de la pollution carbonée que de la maîtrise de la décantabilité des flocs microbiens. Les essais sont menés sur un pilote de laboratoire constitué d'une colonne à bulles et d'un décanteur, alimenté avec un substrat synthétique. Contrairement à une alimentation continue, {{la mise en place}} de cycles d'alimentation permet d'obtenir des flocs de bonne décantabilité de manière constante dans le temps. Ainsi une concentration élevée en biomasse peut être maintenue dans le réacteur. De plus, le suivi d'un cycle 1 h/ 1 h confirme que la mise en œuvre d'un cycle court n'entraîne pas de variations importantes des performances d'épuration. Par ailleurs, le suivi d'un long cycle (24 h/ 24 h) montre des variations significatives des concentrations en DCO, polysaccharides dans la phase liquide et exopolysaccharides dans les flocs microbiens. Ceci semble indiquer que des produits microbiens sont relargués des flocs vers la phase liquide pendant l'arrêt de l'alimentation et que des exopolysaccharides sont produits dans les flocs pendant l'alimentation. The {{overall efficiency}} of an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment system}} depends both on the ability of the activated sludge culture to remove the soluble organic pollution and on the efficiency of the separation of the treated water from the biomass. In the treatment of a high-strength wastewater (COD > 1. 5 kg. m- 3), ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems can sometimes substitute for the final clarifier, the separation of the sludge from the effluent water being very good regardless of changes in sludge settleability. Because of the high pollutant concentrations, the biomass must be more concentrated in the bioreactor than in the usual aerobic processes (10 to 20 kg. m- 3 rather than 4 kg. m- 3), whatever the separation system (settler or filtration system). Thus, with this biomass concentration, the volumetric loading rate can be increased while the organic loading rate is maintained at a low level. The use of a clarifier is preferable because it is cheaper than ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems, which have very high investment and operation costs, on the other hand, and some fouling problems, on the other hand. However, its use requires a very good biomass settleability. Results from the literature show that there is no general relation between sludge settleability and such wastewater treatment operating parameters as dissolved oxygen concentration in the aeration basin, organic loading rates, pH, or low relative influent nitrogen and phosphorus contents. On the other hand, the separation ability of the clarifier depends on the hydraulic configuration of the aerated reactor: biomass settleability can be controlled by completely stirred reactors in series, plug-flow reactors or intermittently-fed systems. Indeed, this spatial or temporal staggering should allow microorganisms to consume their accumulated substrate and thus restore their accumulation capacity. In the case of high-strength wastewater treatment, temporal staggering is better than spatial staggering. Indeed, higher organic loading rates require a higher number of reactors. Thus, the COD concentration significantly increases in the first reactors of the cascade and some toxic or inhibitory problems could appear. For this reason, a temporal staggering was chosen. Biomass settleability is linked to the extracellular polymers that are the third component of the sludge flocs, after the cells and the water. These polymers are composed largely of microbial exopolysaccharides. Measurements of exopolysaccharides could be used to characterize sludge settleability. A too low level of exopolysaccharides indicates a sludge defloculation problem, whereas a too high level of exopolysaccharides means that sludge settleability could be hindered because of an excessive growth of filamentous organisms. The purpose of the present work is to show that the use of only one completely stirred reactor, fed in a cyclic way with permanent oxygenation and return sludge flow, leads to good sludge settleability and effluent quality. The experiments have been performed with a laboratory pilot-plant composed of a 11. 3 litre bubble column, which is a completely stirred reactor, and a secondary settling tank of 14. 8 litres. The reactor is fed with an equilibrated synthetic substrate consisting mainly of meat extract, saccharose and ethanol (COD:N:P= 100 : 5 : 1 and 1 kg COD= 1 kg meat extract + 0. 444 kg saccharose + 0. 2 kg ethanol). The feeding cycle is a set of consecutive periods of feeding and starvation. For example, during a 1 h/ 2 h feeding cycle, the substrate feeding is continuous during 1 hour and stopped during 2 hours. The sludge comes from the Nancy-Maxéville wastewater treatment plant and its acclimation to the synthetic substrate begins with an aeration without feeding during 12 hours. Afterwards, the experimental system is fed during 1 hour every 2 hours with the substrate (first concentration of COD= 0. 1 kg. m- 3). Then, the inlet COD is increased by steps of 0. 1 kg. m- 3 every day until the required concentration is reached. Once the biomass is acclimated to the influent and sufficiently concentrated, the experiment can begin. In order to show the positive influence of <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> on wastewater treatment quality, we have carried out one experiment with continuous feeding and two experiments with <b>cyclic</b> <b>feeding</b> (see Table 1). For these experiments, the volumetric loading rate is about 4 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1. With an appropriate feeding cycle, the settleability of the sludge and the effluent quality remain good: the diluted sludge volume index is 56 cm 3. g- 1 and 96 % of the inlet COD is removed. Thus, the biomass concentration remains high in the reactor (19 kg. m- 3). This is not the case with a continuous feeding where the biomass settleability rapidly deteriorates. The principal advantage of sequential feeding is the maintenance of good sludge settleability and a high biomass concentration in the aeration basin. Moreover, during the short feeding cycles, the variations of the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides in the bulk phase and extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are very low. This augurs well for system stability. In contrast, monitoring of a long cycle (24 h of feeding and 24 h of starvation) shows great variations in the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides in the system. When the feeding is stopped, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase increase whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration in sludge flocs decreases. Reciprocally, after the feeding is begun, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase decrease, and then remain constant, whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration increases. As 1 kg of measured polysaccharides represents 0. 9 kg COD, and as in the bulk phase the COD concentration is equivalent to 4 times the polysaccharide concentration, it seems that microbial products other than polysaccharides are released in the bulk phase during starvation, these products being slowly biodegradable. Extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are formed during the feeding phase...|$|E

Foi realizada cateterização não cirúrgica em 21 marrãs, submetidas a dois ciclos de coleta para dosagem de glicose e insulina, aos 14 e 21 dias do ciclo. Todas as marrãs foram abatidas aos 28, 6 dias de gestação média, para análises biométricas do trato reprodutivo. Marrãs do T 1 apresentaram maior taxa ovulatória em relação às do T 2 (16, 52 vs 14, 70, P Fifty four cyclic gilts were {{randomly}} selected and uniformized according to genetic background, litter of origin, weight gain, backfat, number of cycles and clinical score. Gilts were alloted {{to one of two}} groups fed isocaloric, isoproteic and isolysinic diets. Two energy sources were tested: corn starch (T 1) and soybean oil (T 2). Second estrus was synchronized with oral allyl-trenbolone, so that insemination was carried out at third estrus. Indweeling catheters were implanted by non-surgical technic in 21 gilts, which were submitted to consecutive blood samplings for glicose and insulin determination. Timing of ovulation was estimated by means of ultrasonography. All gilts were slaughtered at an average gestation lenght of 28. 6 days. Starch-fed gilts (T 1) showed higher ovulation rates than T 2 gilts (16. 52 vs 14. 70; P< 0. 01). There was no effect of treatments on pregnancy rate and embryo survival.

40|$|Lignin is a {{biopolymer}} that comprises up to 35 % {{of woody}} biomass by dry weight. It is currently underutilized compared to cellulose and hemicellulose, {{the other two}} primary components of woody biomass. Lignin has an irregular structure of methoxylated aromatic groups linked by a suite of ether and alkyl bonds which {{makes it difficult to}} degrade selectively. However, the aromatic components of lignin also make it promising as a base material for the production of aromatic fuel additives and <b>cyclic</b> chemical <b>feed</b> stocks such as styrene, benzene, and cyclohexanol. Our laboratory research focused on three methods to selectively cleave and deoxygenate purified lignin under mild conditions: acidolysis, hydrogenation and electrocatalysis. (1) Acidolysis was undertaken in CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. (2) Hydrogenation was carried out by dissolving lignin and a rhodium catalyst in 1 : 1 water:methoxyethanol under a 1 atm H 2 environment. (3) Electrocatalysis of lignin involved reacting electrically generated hydrogen atoms at a catalytic palladium cathode with lignin dissolved in a solution of aqueous methanol. In all of the experiments, the lignin degradation products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy and flame ionization detection. Yields were low, but this may have reflected the difficulty in recovering the various fractions after conversion. The homogeneous hydrogenation of lignin showed fragmentation into monomers, while the electrocatalytic hydrogenation showed production of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and substituted benzenes. In addition to the experiments, promising pathways for the conversion of lignin were assessed. Three conversion methods were compared based on their material and energy inputs and proposed improvements using better catalyst and process technology. A variety of areas were noted as needing further experimental and theoretical effort to increase the feasibility of lignin conversion to fuels...|$|R

For this purpose, four rams underwent surgical implantation of bipolar electrodes into the abomasal antrum, entire small bowel and gallbladder infundibulum, corpus and fundus. The strain gauge force transducer was also mounted in the gallbladder fundus, near the electrode. In the course of chronic experiments, the myoelectrical and motor activity was recorded in fasted and non-fasted rams, with or without <b>feeding.</b> <b>Cyclic</b> myoelectrical and motor activity pattern was found in the gallbladder. It resembled the migrating myoelectric complex present in the small bowel. The gallbladder pattern was well correlated with the intestinal migrating complex. Three or four phases of this pattern could be identified in all gallbladder regions. The most characteristic phase 3 -like activity was longer and more intense in the gallbladder fundus as compared with the upper gallbladder regions. In both the small bowel and gallbladder, motility alterations caused by various feeding conditions were comparable.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effect of}} a cyclic versus a {{continuous}} enteral feeding protocol on postoperative delayed gastric emptying, start of normal diet, and hospital stay was assessed in patients undergoing pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed gastric emptying occurs in approximately 30 % of patients after PPPD and causes prolonged hospital stay. Enteral nutrition through a catheter jejunostomy is used to provide postoperative nutritional support. Enteral infusion of fats and proteins activates neurohumoral feedback mechanisms and therefore can potentially impair gastric emptying and prolong postoperative gastroparesis. METHODS: From September 1995 to December 1996, 72 consecutive patients underwent PPPD at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam. Fifty-seven patients were included and randomized for either continuous (CON) jejunal nutrition (0 - 24 hr; 1500 kCal/ 24 hr) or cyclic (CYC) enteral nutrition (6 - 24 hr; 1125 kCal/ 18 hr). Both groups had an equal caloric load of 1 kCal/min. The following parameters were assessed: days of nasogastric intubation, days of enteral nutrition, days until normal diet was tolerated orally, and hospital stay. On postoperative day 10, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) levels were measured during both feeding protocols. RESULTS: Nasogastric intubation was 9. 1 days in the CON group (n = 30) and 6. 7 days in the CYC group (n = 27) (not statistically significant). First day of normal diet was earlier for the CYC group (15. 7 vs. 12. 2 days, p < 0. 05). Hospital stay was shorter in the CYC group (21. 4 vs. 17. 5 days, p < 0. 05). CCK levels were lower in CYC patients, before and after feeding, compared with CON patients (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cyclic</b> enteral <b>feeding</b> after PPPD {{is associated with a}} shorter period of enteral nutrition, a faster return to a normal diet, and a shorter hospital stay. Continuously high CCK levels could be a cause of prolonged time until normal diet is tolerated in patients on continuous enteral nutrition. Cyclic enteral nutrition is therefore the feeding regimen of choice in patients after PPP...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the production performance of the Atlantic salmon postsmolt (Salmo salar L.) subjected to cyclic oxygen reductions (hypoxia) of varying severity. Triplicate groups (N = 955) were kept at constant 80 % O 2 (control) or subjected to 1 h and 45 min of hypoxia (50, 60 or 70 % O 2, termed 80 : 70, 80 : 60 and 80 : 50 groups) every 6 h at 16 °C for 69 days. Feed was provided in normoxia. One third of the fish were kept further for 30 days in normoxia to study possible compensatory growth. Cyclic hypoxia did not alter the oxygen uptake rates of fish, measured in night-time. Fish subjected to 50 % and 60 % O 2 reduced feeding by 13 % and 6 % compared with the controls, respectively, with corresponding reductions in specific growth rates. Feed utilization was not reduced. Compensatory growth was observed in fish from the 80 : 50 group, but full compensation was not achieved. The main conclusions were that feeding in normoxia does not fully alleviate negative effects of <b>cyclic</b> hypoxia on <b>feeding</b> and growth, when oxygen is reduced to 60 % or below in hypoxic periods, that feed utilization is maintained, and that compensatory growth may lessen negative effects...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the effect of {{periodic}} liquid feeding on trickle bed fluid mechanical and mass transfer characteristics and on the effect of packing particle shape by comparing data obtained with cylindrical extrudates and with spherical particles. Cylindrical-extrudate particles are employed to study air-water downflow (steady trickling flow) in a packed bed of 14 cm i. d. The effect of particle shape, neglected in the literature so far, is shown to be very significant. A packed bed of extrudates displays significantly greater global dynamic liquid holdup hd and pressure drop, as well as a trickling-to-pulsing transition boundary at higher gas flow rates, compared to beds of spheres of comparable size. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup, hd, in the axial flow direction, a trend reported {{for the first time as}} there are no similar data available in the literature; on the contrary beds of spherical particles are characterized by practically constant hd in the axial direction. Although an explanation for this hd axial variation is not obvious, one might attribute it to the anisotropy and non-uniformity of interstitial voids of packed cylindrical particles. Comparisons are reported with literature methods for predicting the measured parameters; discrepancies between data and predictions may be partly due to the inadequacy of a single “equivalent” diameter to represent both shape and size of non-spherical particles; predictive methods performing best are also identified. Periodic liquid feeding is investigated – at sufficiently high frequencies to be classified as “fast” mode of induced pulsing – in the range of mean gas and liquid flow rates corresponding to the steady “trickling flow” regime. Detailed information is obtained, on the axial propagation and attenuation of pulses, from instantaneous, cross-sectionally averaged holdup measurements. Key fluid-mechanical parameters studied include, aside from dynamic holdup and pressure drop, pulse celerity and intensity, as a function of fluid feed rates (G, L) and liquid cyclic frequency. Data from previous work for 6 mm glass spheres and 3 mm spheroid particles, are employed for comparison; it is shown that, for the particles examined, particle-size has a pronounced effect, but not as significant as that of particle shape. For particles of comparable volume, the cylindrical shape is associated with much greater global dynamic holdup and pressure drop, and with increased pulse attenuation. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup in the axial direction, as in the case of steady trickling flow. For spherical particles, both time-average holdup and pulse celerity are practically constant along the bed for fixed liquid and gas flow rates. Pressure drop, global holdup and pulse celerity are not affected by <b>cyclic</b> liquid <b>feeding</b> frequency, for both spherical and cylindrical extrudate particles. For the mass transfer study, experiments aimed at determining local and global liquid/solid mass transfer rates, mainly for the so-called fast mode of periodic liquid feeding. Uniform 6 mm spheres and cylindrical extrudates, of 1. 5 mm diameter and a narrow distribution of lengths, are employed in the tests. For completeness, results are also reported for single-phase (liquid) and trickling flow through the same packed beds. A well-known electrochemical technique is employed to measure instantaneous local mass transfer coefficients by means of quite a few probes distributed throughout the bed. The hydrodynamic characteristics under the above conditions, are helpful in interpreting the new mass transfer data. There is a wide spread of measured local mass transfer rates, in all cases tested, apparently due to packing and flow non-uniformities. This spread is much smaller in the case of packed uniform spheres. In general, the benefits of <b>cyclic</b> liquid <b>feeding</b> are more evident in the packed bed of spheres than in that of cylindrical extrudates; for instance, with increasing mean liquid rate, induced pulsing tends to reduce the spread of local mass transfer coefficients, which suggests that more uniform fluids distribution is promoted. Other trends of local mass transfer rates are identified and discussed in relation to measured variation of liquid holdup, under the same conditions. For packed spheres, the measured global mass transfer rates are in fair agreement with literature correlations obtained for the trickling flow regime, unlike the case of packed extrudates where significant discrepancies are observed. In conclusion, imposed pulsing flow appears to promote a uniform distribution of fluids in the packing characteristics. Moreover, for comparable particle size and mean packing void fraction ε, the uniform spherical shape displays clear advantages over the cylindrical extrudates, both with respect to fluid mechanical parameters and to mass transfer rates. ...|$|R

The {{control of the}} synthesis conditions, such as reaction time, catalyst concentration, and monomer concentration, allows the formation of copolymers with molecular weights {{in the range of}} 15 - 330 kg/mol. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that with a low THF content in the <b>feed</b> <b>cyclic</b> copolymers are the major reaction products, whereas with a high THF content, linear copolymers are the main products. To explain these results, a zwitterionic ring-opening copolymerization mechanism was postulated based on DFT calculations and experimental results. Physical properties of the resulting copolymers demonstrated that by changing the relative amounts of monomers copolymers with tailored glass transition temperatures in a broad range of temperatures from- 84 to- 4 °C can be obtained and that crystallization of THF fragments can be suppressed. Rheological measurements showed that by controlling the degree of crystallization, copolymers with rubber-like behavior can be obtained in a broad temperature range below room temperature.

40|$|Biological {{processes}} are organized in time as innate rhythms {{defined by the}} period (τ), phase (peak [Φ] and trough time), amplitude (A, peak-trough difference) and mean level. The human time structure in its entirety is comprised of ultradian (τ τ 28 h) bioperiodicities. The circadian time structure (CTS) of human beings, which {{is more complicated than}} in lower animals, is orchestrated and staged by a brain central multioscillator system that includes a prominent pacemaker – the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Additional pacemaker activities are provided by the pineal hormone melatonin, which circulates during the nighttime, and the left and right cerebral cortices. Under ordinary circumstances this system coordinates the τ and Φ of rhythms driven by subservient peripheral cell, tissue and organ clock networks. <b>Cyclic</b> environmental, <b>feeding</b> and social time cues synchronize the endogenous 24 h clocks and rhythms. Accordingly, processes and functions of the internal environment are integrated in time for maximum biological efficiency, and they are also organized and synchronized in time to the external environment to ensure optimal performance and response to challenge. Artificial light at night (ALAN) exposure can alter the CTS as can night work, which, like rapid transmeridian displacement by air travel, necessitates realignment of the Φ of the multitude of 24 h rhythms. In 2001, Stevens and Rea coined the phrase “circadian disruption” (CD) to label the CTS misalignment induced by ALAN and shift work (SW) as a potential pathologic mechanism of the increased risk for cancer and other medical conditions. Current concerns relating to the effects of ALAN exposure on the CTS motivated us to renew our long-standing interest in the possible role of CD in the etiopathology of common human diseases and patient care. A surprisingly large number of medical conditions involve CD: adrenal insufficiency; nocturia; sleep-time non-dipping and rising blood pressure 24 h patterns (nocturnal hypertension); delayed sleep phase syndrome, non- 24 h sleep/wake disorder; recurrent hypersomnia; SW intolerance; delirium; peptic ulcer disease; kidney failure; depression; mania; bipolar disorder; Parkinson’s disease; Smith–Magenis syndrome; fatal familial insomnia syndrome; autism spectrum disorder; asthma; byssinosis; cancers; hand, foot and mouth disease; post-operative state; and ICU outcome. Poorly conceived medical interventions, for example nighttime dosing of synthetic corticosteroids and certain β-antagonists and cyclic nocturnal enteral or parenteral nutrition, plus lifestyle habits, including atypical eating times and chronic alcohol consumption, also can be causal of CD. Just as surprisingly are the many proven chronotherapeutic strategies available today to manage the CD of several of these medical conditions. In clinical medicine, CD seems to be a common, yet mostly unrecognized, pathologic mechanism of human disease as are the many effective chronotherapeutic interventions to remedy it...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of siderosis of liver and spleen {{was investigated in}} rats subjected alternately to periods of starvation and periods of feeding of diets rich in iron (0. 71 % or 1. 23 % Fe) or of control diets, during periods ranging up to 245 days. With 0. 71 % iron in the diet, cyclic starvation-feeding markedly enhanced the accumulation of iron in rat livers by comparison to feeding ad libitum even though rats fed ad libitum ingested far greater total amounts of iron than cyclically fed rats. With 1. 23 % iron in the diet, the concentration of iron in livers reached {{more or less the}} same plateau in cyclically starved-fed rats and in rats fed ad libitum (betwen 4 and 5 mg Fe/g wet weight); but the mean rate of accumulation of iron in the livers of cyclically starved and fed rats was more than twice that in rats fed ad libitum, whereas mean ingestion of iron per feeding day was only 16 % higher in the former group. Surgical removal of the spleen enhanced the accumulation of iron in the liver in cyclically starved-fed rats and in rats fed ad libitum. Histologically, siderosis of the liver was moderate in rats fed the diet with 0. 71 % iron but was severe in rats fed the diet with 1. 23 % iron and most severe in those without spleens. Stainable iron was deposited in hepatocytes and in Kupffer cells. None of the rats developed cirrhosis of the liver. The data suggest that in rats a barrier to the absorption of iron from the gut, or to its later utilization, is surmounted if the concentration of iron in the food exceeds a certain limit value, somewhere between 0. 71 and 1. 23 %. With iron in the food below this value, cyclic starvation-feeding markedly potentiates accumulation of iron in the liver in the course of several months, but siderosis is moderate. With iron in the food above the limit value, <b>cyclic</b> starvation-feeding and <b>feeding</b> ad libitum can equally lead to massive siderosis of the liver...|$|R
40|$|In the United Kingdom a large {{proportion}} of agricultural land is laid to grass which is used for grazing and also harvested for animal feed. Grass is also potentially the crop most suited to energy production in the UK because of its high yield, low maintenance and suitability for growing under the climatic conditions. Anaerobic digestion is a potential technology for conversion of grass to energy and the current work looks at the design and operation of digester types {{that could be used to}} maximise the energy yield per hectare of crop and take advantage of the requirement to store harvested material over the winter period. Initial experiments established the methane potential of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) to be 0. 245 m 3 kg- 1 VS added. This was determined in a series of conventional batch digestion studies at different inoculum to substrate ratios using an anaerobic sludge taken from a municipal wastewater digester. The research then went on to examine potential energy losses through the use of conventional continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) digester design and from this began to focus on plug flow designs that could be simulated through a batch digestion model. Experimental work used a batch feed cycle to simulate a continuous fed plug flow reactor, although the results are equally applicable to a <b>cyclic</b> batch <b>feeding</b> regime. The minimum feed cycle length to gain 70 % of the methane potential was found to be six days at an initial substrate loading rate (ISLR) of 10 g VS L- 1 and twelve days at an ISLR of 20 g VS L- 1; in both cases this was equivalent to an Organic Loading Rate (OLR) of 1. 7 g VS L- 1 day- 1. In a batch or plug flow system it is necessary to add an inoculum, and experiments were designed to show the advantages and disadvantages associated with using the liquid or solid fractions derived from separated digestate material for this purpose. Both proved to be suitable as an inoculum at a 10 g VS L- 1 batch loading, but a higher gas yield was achieved from the separated solids inoculum due to the capturing of residual VS by increasing the solids retention time of the system. Results from a number of experiments indicated that in a ryegrass digestion system mechanical stirring could be problematic, and there were indications that this type of mixing might not be necessary for optimal performance. At an ISLR of 20 g VS L- 1 some small advantages were found as a result of stirring during acclimation of the inoculum to the feedstock but this could be compensated for by the adoption of once per day liquid recirculation around the digester. This mixing strategy was therefore adopted in subsequent experiments. 30 L digesters were used to test a digester operating mode in which solids were allowed to accumulate over a number of feed cycles, achieved by removing only the liquor which passed a 1 mm mesh at the end of each cycle. The solids accumulation rate for ISLR of 10 g VS L- 1 loading on a seven-day cycle would allow the digester to operate for 30 weeks if no solids were broken down. In practice the rate of VS destruction measured extended this by between ~ 24 - 67 % depending on the initial solids make up of the digester. In a subsequent smaller-scale solids accumulation experiment a specific methane yield of 0. 415 L CH 4 gVS- 1 was achieved over 10 feed cycles (weeks) and showed this reached an optimum at an I:S ratio of 3 – 3. 5 on a VS basi...|$|R
