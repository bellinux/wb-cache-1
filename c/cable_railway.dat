25|$|Traffic {{gradually}} {{moved away}} from the canal to the railways. In 1904, Endon basin was built, where limestone brought from the quarries by the railway could be transferred to boats. One of the major users of the limestone, based at Sandbach, closed in 1920, and the <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> to Froghall closed in the same year. Limestone was no longer transhipped at Endon from 1930, and the canal saw virtually no traffic. Responsibility for the canal passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1940, who closed the Leek branch under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1944. The last heavy commercial traffic was the transfer of coal from Endon to Cheddleton, which ceased in 1952.|$|E

500|$|The newly {{organized}} CL initially {{operated a}} main line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, leasing the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and trackage rights over the Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the old [...] narrow gauge D line) into Dayton. But {{the latter was}} converted to [...] in April 1887, and CL service was cut back to Dodds, since the operations north of there were unprofitable {{even when it was}} able to reach Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was leased in 1892 to the company organized to operate north of Dodds.) Avondale Branch operations were discontinued in August 1889, due to competition from the cheaper Mt. Auburn <b>Cable</b> <b>Railway.</b> Under Hafer's leadership, new passenger and freight depots opened {{on the north side of}} Court Street in December 1885. In preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the CL relaid rail and replaced bridges, including a straight trestle in the Deer Creek Valley, completed in January 1889, in place of a curving old narrow gauge structure. The first standard gauge rails were laid by August 1889 as part of a dual gauge setup south of Idlewild, when the Ohio and North Western Railroad (O, successor to the C), which had converted its line to standard gauge, moved its trains from the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad system) back to the CL Several months later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, allowing the O to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad (successor to the M). After undertaking more improvements to the alignment, the company completed the conversion of the main line to Lebanon to standard gauge on September 16, 1894, although, until it acquired a full set of standard gauge equipment, much of the commuter service to Blue Ash continued to use the narrow gauge tracks.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} attempts to access and develop {{the interior of the}} Verdugo Mountains was the 1912 proposal by Colonel Lewis Ginger to build a cable incline railroad to the summit of Mount Verdugo, now known as Mount Thom. [...] The proposed Glendale & Verdugo Mountain Railway was to run in a straight line from the Pacific Electric’s Casa Verdugo station at the top of Brand Boulevard to the summit of Mount Verdugo, employing cars with stepped seating similar to those of Angels Flight on Bunker Hill in Los Angeles. Initially, Colonel Ginger had proposed that his <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> would lift a Pacific Electric car directly to the summit, but Henry E. Huntington did not approve of this scheme. [...] The railway was to have four or five stations along the incline and a large visitor’s center at the summit. [...] Several months after the initial proposal, the route was altered to run up the west side of Verdugo Canyon from a hoped-for extension of the Pacific Electric up Verdugo Canyon to Montrose. [...] Interest in the <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> continued for about a year, but the project was abandoned before a company could be formed, largely {{as the result of the}} Pacific Electric’s decision not to build the Montrose extension.|$|E

2500|$|The first streetcars in Chicago were horse cars {{run by the}} Chicago City Railway Company and the North Chicago City Railway Company around 1858-1861.

2500|$|The first uses of railroads in North America {{for heavy}} haulage were visible {{in at least}} three periods. A {{portable}} temporary funicular <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> was first employed in 1795 by Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House and other prominent Boston properties, to reshape (raze and shave) Boston's [...] "Tri-mount" [...] or [...] "the Tremont" [...] which were the three peaks dominating the colonial era's goosenecked peninsula's eastern and northern topography. The hills' summits and sides were systematically cut down at different times before 1816, with the first cuttings occurring in 1795 to build the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill at a more desirable lower elevation. Fredrick Gamst believes the same hardware was then relocated and used again in 1799–1804 and 1809–1815 to transfer hilltop materials into land reclamation and real-estate speculation, that began creating Boston's famed Back Bay neighborhoods from the long mud flats of the Charles River by creation of the duck pond and public gardens near the Boston Common.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, {{with the}} last {{streetcar}} (tram) line demolished, Klagenfurt was meant to become a car-friendly city, with lots of wide roads. [...] A motorway was even planned which was to cross the city partly underground, but which now by-passes {{the city to the}} north. The problem of four railway lines from north, west, south, and east meeting at the central station south of the city centre and strangulating city traffic has been eased by a considerable number of underpasses on the main arteries. Nevertheless, despite 28 bus lines, traffic jams are frequent nowadays as in most cities of similar size. Ideas of a rapid transport system using the existing railway rails, of an elevated <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> to the football stadium, or of a regular motorboat service on the Lend Canal from the city centre to the lake have not materialized. But for those who fancy leisurely travel there is a regular motorboat and steamer service on the lake connecting the resorts on Wörthersee. During severe winters, which no longer occur regularly, you might of course be faster crossing the frozen lake on your skates.|$|E

50|$|Many cable {{railways}} {{connect to}} conventional adhesion lines at their top and bottom, allowing trains {{to be lifted}} from a lower line to a higher one. A specific type of <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> is the funicular, which is a <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> with the cars permanently fixed to the cable. Usually funiculars are self-contained and not connected to other railway networks.|$|E
50|$|Cable haulage did prove viable {{where the}} {{gradients}} were exceptionally steep, {{such as the}} 1 in 8 gradients of the Cromford and High Peak Railway opened in 1830. <b>Cable</b> <b>railways</b> generally have two tracks with loaded wagons on one track partially balanced by empty wagons on the other, to minimise fuel costs for the stationary engine. Various kinds of rack railway were developed to overcome the lack of friction of conventional locomotives on steep gradients.|$|R
50|$|A {{cable car}} {{in the context of}} mass transit is a system using rail cars that are hauled by a {{continuously}} moving cable running at a constant speed.
