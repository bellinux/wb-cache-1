Specifically, a Xenopus chromosome that was both easy to identify and that possessed a single DNA replication fork in one arm was found and used to conduct the experimentation. This chromosome was exposed to UV in early S phase and a Bromodeoxyuridine/Giemsa differential staining technique was applied in conjunction with conventional aberrational techniques to correlate progression of the DNA replication fork through segments of this arm with <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletion</b> production in these segments.

40|$|Unstable genetic aberrations {{might provide}} a good marker for {{assessing}} genetic damage in populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. The frequency of these aberrations was estimated in peripheral lymphocytes from hospital workers in Bushehr Port, occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation (54 subjects) and age and sex matched controls. A total of 34 (23 males & 11 females) subjects had unstable genetic aberrations (50 chromosomal-type & 31 chromatid type) but only 7 subjects in control group had unstable genetic aberrations. When compared with controls, exposed workers showed {{a significant increase in}} structural chromosomal-type aberrations (p< 0. 001 OR= 11) chromosomal exchange being the most frequent alteration. <b>Chromatid</b> <b>deletion</b> (18 cases) and ring chromosome (4 cases) were seen only in exposed group.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the frequency of}} chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes from underground miners from the Casapalca (n = 8, mean age = 45 y, range = 36 y to 55 y) and Bellavista (n = 8, mean age = 28 y, range 23 y to 34 y) high-altitude mining camps in the Peruvian Andes. This population was occupationally exposed to heavy metals such as lead and zinc as well as diesel emission particles, organic solvents and mine dust. The control groups consisted of individuals from a high altitude farming community in the Peruvian village of Tinco (n = 8, mean age = 37 y, range = 25 y to 52 y) and the sea level city of Lima (n = 14, mean age = 26 y, range = 20 y to 35 y). All individuals were male native Peruvians. A significantly higher incidence (1. 88 %, p < 0. 05) of chromosomal aberrations (<b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> and breaks, chromosome breaks and acentric fragments) were detected in lymphocytes from miners at the Casapalca camp as compared to miners from the Bellavista camp (0. 5 %, <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> and acentric fragments only) and the Lima sea level (0. 07 %, <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> only) and Tinco high altitude (no aberrations) controls. These results suggest that male native Peruvians occupationally exposed to underground mining activity have an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations, which {{could be related to}} both age and exposure time. The increased chromosomal damage observed in the mining populations studied may be attributable to the complex mixture of genotoxic agents to which the miners may have been exposed...|$|R

The frequency of deletions observed in the ith + 1 division subsequent to fragment distribution at the ith division anaphase is independent of the cell death resulting from fragment loss. Further, the transmission frequency of chromosome acentric fragments is mathematically equal to the fragment frequency observed in the ith + 1 generation divided by the mean fragment frequency in the ith generation.

After two hours, they were irradiated and then samples were fixed at 5, 15, 25, 35 minutes {{from the beginning of}} irradiation. The results obtained show that the aberration level increases with time subsequent to fixing. This increase takes place first for <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> and then for isochromatid <b>deletions</b> and <b>chromatid</b> exchanges.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} radon is {{a relatively}} ubiquitous environmental carcinogen to which {{large numbers of people}} can be exposed over their lifetimes. The accumulation of radon in homes, therefore, has led to a large program {{to determine the effects of}} the densely ionizing a particles that are produced when radon decays. In human lymphocytes, low doses of X-rays can decrease the number of <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> induced by subsequent high doses of clastogens. This has been attributed to the induction of a repair mechanism by the low-dose exposures. Historically, chromosome aberrations induced by radon have been considered to be relatively irreparable. The present experiments, however, show that if human peripheral blood lymphocytes are irradiated with low doses of X-rays (2 cGy) at 48 hr of culture, before being exposed to radon at 72 hr of culture, the yield of <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> induced by radon is decreased by a factor of two. Furthermore, the numbers of aberrations per cell do not follow a Poisson distribution but are overdispersed, as might be expected because high-linear energy transfer (high LET) a particles have a high relative biological effectiveness compared to low-LET radiations such as X-rays or y rays. Pretreatment with a low dose of X-rays decreases the overdispersion and leads to a greater proportion of the cells having no aberrations, or lower numbers of aberrations, than is the case in cells exposed to radon alone. It therefore appears that the putative chromosomal repair mechanism induced by low doses of sparsely ionizing radiation is also effective in reducing cytogenetic damage induced by a particles, which hitherto had been thought to be relatively immune to repair processes...|$|R

No such response was observed in fibroblasts irradiated in the G 0 phase. The observed increases in achromatic lesions and in <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> in FA cells as compared with normal cells appear to indicate that FA cells are deficient in strand break repair and also possibly in base damage excision repair.

40|$|Repair- and recombination-defective {{mutations}} at two loci (mei- 9 and mei- 41) of Drosophila melanogaster {{have been}} examined for their effects on the induction of chromosome aberrations by x-rays {{and the formation of}} sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). Irradiation of larval neuroblast cells during the S phase with x-rays showed that mutants at both of these loci are about 10 times more sensitive than wild type to the induction of chromosome aberrations. The pattern of induced aberrations was characteristic for each mutant locus: in cells bearing mei- 9 mutations most breaks were <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions,</b> whereas in the presence of mei- 41 mutations similar frequencies of <b>chromatid</b> and isochromatid <b>deletions</b> were observed. Furthermore, chromatid interchanges could not be induced in cells carrying mei- 9 alleles; therefore these mutations define a step necessary for chromatid rejoining. mei- 41 alleles also define a function involved in the formation of chromatid interchanges; total exchanges were less frequent than expected from nonmutant controls; and the proportion of exchanges arising by symmetrical rejoining was markedly reduced. These data indicate that <b>chromatid</b> and isochromatid <b>deletions</b> have different molecular steps in their formation, and that different molecular mechanisms are also involved in the symmetrical and unsymmetrical rejoining in chromatid interchanges. Neuroblast cells of larvae bearing mei- 9 and mei- 41 alleles were also treated for 13 hr with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine at 9 mug/ml in order to differentiate sister chromatids for the scoring of SCEs. Whereas mei- 41 had a normal level of SCEs, mei- 9 exhibited a frequency of SCEs that was about 70 % that of the control. Because both mei- 9 and mei- 41 mutations result in defective meiotic recombination, these data suggest that they define steps shared by symmetrical interchange formation and meiotic recombination that do not participate in the formation of most SCEs...|$|R

Genotoxic studies on industrial pollutants are very important as they tend to accumulate in aquatic animals. Thus use of aquatic organisms to detect the genotoxicity is very useful in environment monitoring. For this chromosomal aberration test was employed to study genotoxicity caused by dyeing industry effluent on a freshwater fish, Cirrhinus mrigala. Kidney tissue {{was used for the}} present study. The 96 h LC 50 was calculated and three sublethal concentrations 24. 48 %, 12. 24 % and 6. 12 % were prepared.

40|$|Metaphase {{chromosome}} preparations were analysed {{as part of}} {{a larger}} study from a population occupationally exposed to benzene and compared with a control group. Forty eight of the 66 exposed individuals and 29 of the 33 controls had samples in which metaphase spreads could be evaluated. The incidence of chromosomal aberrations (particularly <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> and gaps) in the exposed group were slightly increased compared with the control group. This increase was of borderline significance in parametric statistical tests but was significant using Fisher's exact test. No lifestyle factors had any consistent effect on the incidence of chromosome aberrations, although there was a small reduction in gaps with increasing cigarette smoking. Older individuals had a higher incidence of chromosome exchanges and "other" aberrations. Individuals who reported a recent viral illness had a higher incidence of aberrations particularly gaps. There was no evidence of any correlation in the incidence of chromosome aberrations with any of the other biological parameters previously reported. The increased incidence of aberrations seen in the group exposed to benzene may result from a history of exposure to benzene. Nevertheless, other explanations such as sampling, interindividual variability, and unintentional bias in the selection of two groups cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spontaneous {{levels of}} the {{chromosome}} aberrations in the peripheral lymphocytes of 173 women were analyzed {{in the course of}} a medical examination of the residents of the Bryansk District territories (Klintsy Region, and the town of Klintsy) contaminated after the Chernobyl NPP accident in April 1986. The study population included only women who had been premenopausal at the time of the accident (mean age in 1986 was 23. 9 ± 0. 7 years, ranging 2 to 56 years). The territory contamination with 137 Cs ranged from 1. 8 to 23. 7 Ci/km 2, the mean value being 7. 5 ± 0. 2 Ci/km 2. The range of the calculated absorbed thyroid doses was 30 to 340 mGy (in average, 52. 3 ± 3. 3 mGy). The number of women with benign breast diseases (BBD) was 116 (67 %). All recognizable chromosome lesion types were scored in the first in vitro division metaphases stained with azure-eosin. The mean total aberration frequency in the sample studied was 3. 5 ± 0. 2 per 100 metaphases, the main contribution being made by the <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions,</b> which is typical for a normal spontaneous aberration pattern. Based on the results of the cytogenetic analysis, the study population was subdivided into two groups.

40|$|A 85 Xenopus {{cells that}} {{exhibited}} {{a high level}} of photoreactivation (PR) and V 79 B 2 hamster cells that exhibited little PR were fused to produce the V 79 B 2 x A 85 cell line — a hybrid line which possessed a relatively stable karyotype, with most cells containing the entire V 79 B 2 and A 85 genomes. UV and UV plus PR fluence-survival relations were then determined and compared for the hybrid and parental lines in a first attempt to elucidate interactions of the parental PR mechanisms in the hybrid. It was anticipated that the A 85 genome in the hybrid would produce PR enzyme in sufficient concentration and of such a nature as to efficiently PR UV-induced lethal damage in both A 85 and V 79 B 2 DNA, and little difference would be observed in the levels of PR exhibited by the V 79 B 2 x A 85 and A 85 lines. To the contrary, the level of PR observed for the hybrid was substantially below that observed for the A 85 line. To assist in the interpretation of this unexpected observation, three additional preliminary studies were carried out: 1) Comparison of the optimum PR schemes for the A 85 and hybrid lines, 2) examination of relations between the PR and dark UV repair mechanisms possessed by these lines, and 3) comparison of the levels of PR of <b>chromatid</b> <b>deletions</b> induced by UV in selected V 79 B 2 and A 85 chromosomes of the hybrid. The results suggested that the relatively low level of PR manifested by the hybrid cells was a consequence of their inability to efficiently PR pyrimidine dimers induced by UV in V 79 B 2 DNA...|$|R
40|$|Errors in {{chromosome}} segregation or distribution {{may result in}} aneuploid embryo formation, which causes implantation failure, spontaneous abortion, genetic diseases, or embryo death. Embryonic aneuploidy occurs when chromosome aberrations are present in gametes or early embryos.

In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of SAC components (Bub 3, BubR 1 and Mad 2) in mouse preimplantation embryos. Our data showed that overexpressed SAC components inhibited metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing sister <b>chromatid</b> segregation. <b>Deletion</b> of SAC components by RNAi accelerated the metaphase-anaphase transition during the first cleavage and caused micronuclei formation, chromosome misalignment and aneuploidy, which caused decreased implantation and delayed development.

40|$|SummaryMeiotic cohesin serves in sister {{chromatid}} linkage and DNA repair until its subunit Rec 8 is cleaved by separase. Separase is activated when its inhibitor, securin, is polyubiquitinated by the Cdc 20 regulated anaphase-promoting complex (APCCdc 20) and consequently degraded. Differently regulated APCs (APCCdh 1, APCAma 1) {{have not been}} implicated in securin degradation at meiosis I. We show that Mnd 2, a factor known to associate with APC components, prevents premature securin degradation in meiosis by APCAma 1. mnd 2 Δ cells lack linear chromosome axes and exhibit precocious sister <b>chromatid</b> separation, but <b>deletion</b> of AMA 1 suppresses these defects. Besides securin, Sgo 1, a protein essential for protection of centromeric cohesion during anaphase I, is also destabilized in mnd 2 Δ cells. Mnd 2 ’s disappearance prior to anaphase II may activate APCAma 1. Human oocytes may spend many years in meiotic prophase before maturation.

40|$|Abstract Background Agave tequilana Weber var. azul, is {{the only}} one variety {{permitted}} by federal law in México to be used for tequila production which is the most popular contemporary alcoholic beverage made from agave and recognized worldwide. Despite the economic, genetic, and ornamental value of the plant, it has not been subjected to detailed cytogenetic research, which could lead {{to a better understanding of}} its reproduction for future genetic improvement. The objective of this work was to study the meiotic behavior in pollen mother cells and its implications on the pollen viability in Agave tequilana Weber var. azul. Results The analysis of Pollen Mother Cells in anaphase I (A-I) showed 82. 56 % of cells with a normal anaphase and, 17. 44 % with an irregular anaphase. In which 5. 28 % corresponded to cells with side arm bridges (SAB); 3. 68 % cells with one bridge and one fragment; 2. 58 % of irregular anaphase showed cells with one or two lagging chromosomes and 2. 95 % showed one acentric fragment; cells with two bridges and cells with two bridges and one acentric fragment were observed in frequencies of 1. 60 % and 1. 35 % respectively. In anaphase II some cells showed bridges and fragments too. Aberrant A-I cells had many shrunken or empty pollen grains (42. 00 %) and 58. 00 % viable pollen. Conclusion The observed meiotic irregularities suggest that structural chromosome aberrations have occurred, such as heterozygous inversions, sister <b>chromatid</b> exchanges, <b>deletions</b> and duplications which in turn are reflected in a low pollen viability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sister {{chromatid}} cohesion {{is essential}} for cell viability. We have isolated a novel temperature-sensitive lethal mutant named eso 1 -H 17 that displays spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic delay and abnormal chromosome segregation. At the permissive temperature, the eso 1 -H 17 mutant shows mild sensitivity to UV irradiation and DNA-damaging chemicals. At the nonpermissive temperature, the mutant is arrested in M phase with a viability loss due to a failure to establish sister chromatid cohesion during S phase. The lethal M-phase arrest phenotype, however, is suppressed by inactivation of a spindle checkpoint. The eso 1 � gene is not essential for the onset and progression of DNA replication but has remarkable genetic interactions with those genes regulating the G 1 -S transition and DNA replication. The N-terminal two-thirds of Eso 1 p is highly homologous to DNA polymerase � of budding yeast and humans, and the C-terminal one-third is homologous to budding yeast Eco 1 p (also called Ctf 7 p), which {{is required for the}} establishment of sister <b>chromatid</b> cohesion. <b>Deletion</b> analysis and determination of the mutation site reveal that the function of the Eco 1 p/Ctf 7 phomologous domain is necessary and sufficient for sister chromatid cohesion. On the other hand, deletion of the DNA polymerase � domain in Eso 1 p increases sensitivity to UV irradiation. These results indicate that Eso 1 p plays a dual role during DNA replication.

40|$|Abstract The Immunodeficiency, Centromeric region instability, Facial {{anomalies}} syndrome (ICF) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disease described in about 50 patients worldwide and characterized by immunodeficiency, although B cells are present, and by characteristic rearrangements {{in the vicinity of}} the centromeres (the juxtacentromeric heterochromatin) of chromosomes 1 and 16 and sometimes 9. Other variable symptoms of this probably under-diagnosed syndrome include mild facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, failure to thrive, and psychomotor retardation. Serum levels of IgG, IgM, IgE, and/or IgA are low, although the type of immunoglobulin deficiency is variable. Recurrent infections are the presenting symptom, usually in early childhood. ICF always involves limited hypomethylation of DNA and often arises from mutations in one of the DNA methyltransferase genes (DNMT 3 B). Much of this DNA hypomethylation is in 1 qh, 9 qh, and 16 qh, regions that are the site of whole-arm <b>deletions,</b> <b>chromatid</b> and chromosome breaks, stretching (decondensation), and multiradial chromosome junctions in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. By an unknown mechanism, the DNMT 3 B deficiency that causes ICF interferes with lymphogenesis (at a step after class switching) or lymphocyte activation. With the identification of DNMT 3 B as the affected gene in a majority of ICF patients, prenatal diagnosis of ICF is possible. However, given the variety of DNMT 3 B mutations, a first-degree affected relative should first have both alleles of this gene sequenced. Treatment almost always includes regular infusions of immunoglobulins, mostly intravenously. Recently, bone marrow transplantation has been tried. </p...|$|R

Ochratoxin A {{has been shown to}} be negative in many genetic toxicology test in vitro. However, the potential of OTA to induce genotoxic effects has not been investigated in male rats, the most sensitive species for OTA-induced tumor formation. In this study, male F 344 rats were repeatedly administered OTA (0, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 íg/kg of body wt) or the non-chlorinated analogue ochratoxin B (OTB; 2000 íg/kg of body wt) for 2 weeks (5 days/week), and DNA breakage was analyzed in target and nontarget tissues using the comet assay both in the absence and presence of formamidopyrimidine-DNA (Fpg) glycosylase. Potential DNA-adduct formation was also analyzed in the target organ kidney by 32 P-postlabeling using two different solvent systems. DNA-strand breaks were evident in liver, kidney, and spleen of animals treated with OTA, and a similar degree of DNA damage was observed in rats treated with OTB, despite the lower toxicity of OTB. Moreover, the presence of DNA damage did not correlate with histopathological alterations, which were evident in the kidney but not in the liver. In liver and kidney, the extent of DNA damage was further enhanced in the presence of Fpg glycosylase, which is known to convert oxidative DNA damage into strand breaks, suggesting the presence of oxidative DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damage as a mechanism of OTA-dependent DNA damage is consistent with the absence of lipophilic DNA adducts as assessed by 32 P-postlabeling analysis. No spots indicative of OTA-related DNA adducts were observed in kidney DNA extracted from OTA-treated animals by 32 P-postlabeling analysis, despite the use of synthetic standard for postulated adducts. A small, but not significant, increase in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations (essentially <b>chromatid</b> and chromosome-type <b>deletions)</b> was observed in splenocytes from rats treated with OTA in vivo and subsequently cultured in vitro to express chromosomal damage. These aberrations are also compatible with oxidative DNA lesions since they are not typically caused by chemical carcinogens which form covalent DNA adducts. Together, with the lack of evidence for formation of lipophilic DNA adducts as assessed by postlabeling, these data suggest that OTA may cause genetic damage in both target and nontarget tissues independent of direct covalent binding to DNA.
