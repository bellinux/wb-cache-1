The {{traditional}} alphabet {{has always been}} used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split.

5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese {{in their}} daily discourse, and Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> along with Japanese, and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan {{in their daily}} discourse in favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E

25|$|Historically, English was {{the sole}} {{official}} language of Hong Kong from 1883 to 1974. Only after demonstrations and petitions from Hong Kong people demanding equal status for Chinese did the language become official in Hong Kong from 1974 onward. In March 1987, the Official Languages Ordinance was amended to require all new legislation to be enacted bilingually in both English and Chinese. In 1990, the Hong Kong Basic Law declared English's <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> status with Chinese after the 1997 handover.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1860s, under Tsar Alexander II, {{it was decided}} that legal {{equality}} between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher estates of the realm were abolished, a modern parliament based on universal suffrage was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.|$|E

25|$|The Cherokee {{language}} {{remains an}} integral part of the Cherokee history and cultural identity, and both dialects of the Cherokee language have been tenaciously preserved. Cherokee has been the <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> of the Cherokee Nation alongside English since a 1991 legislation proclaimed this under the Act Relating to the Tribal Policy for the Promotion and Preservation of Cherokee Language, History, and Culture. Cherokee is also recognized as the official language of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. As Cherokee is official, the entire constitution of the United Keetoowah Band is available in both English and Cherokee. As an official language, any tribal member may communicate with the tribal government in Cherokee or English, English translation services are provided for Cherokee speakers, and both Cherokee and English are used when the tribe provides services, resources, and information to tribal members or when communicating with the tribal council. By sanctioning the Cherokee language, the 1991 legislation allows the political branch of the nation to maintain Cherokee as a living language. Because they are within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area, hospitals and health centers such as the Three Rivers Health Center in Muscogee, Oklahoma provide Cherokee language translation services. The Cherokee Nation sponsors a language preservation project, offering online classes for Cherokee language levels I, II, and III. Participants can test their knowledge of the language online at the Cherokee Learning Center, also sponsored by the Cherokee Nation. Classes for adults who do not yet speak the language are offered in many locations. On the national level, the federal election voter guide is now available in the four most commonly spoken Native American/Alaska Native languages, of which Cherokee is one.|$|E
500|$|English {{is spoken}} widely in South Africa {{and is an}} {{official}} or <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers. Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels. Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [...] rather than as [...] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [...] instead of as the more common fricative.|$|E

500|$|English is {{the third}} most {{widespread}} native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language {{or one of the}} official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. English is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia. It is <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> of the United Nations, of the European Union and of many other world and regional international organisations.

500|$|Throughout Venice's old possessions, {{but above}} all in the Ionian islands, {{the memory of the}} Republic is deeply rooted in the population, who recall it with a shade of nostalgia even after so much time and so many events. Because of the long Venetian period, the manners and traditions of the {{inhabitants}} of the Ionian Islands are a mixture of Greek and Italian. The Venetian influence is illustrated in all aspects of culture and everyday life. In 1800 the Septinsular Republic was established; its flag design was based on the flag of the Republic of Venice. In addition, Italian was the <b>co-official</b> <b>language</b> of both the Septinsular Republic and the United States of the Ionian Islands. Because of its status, Italian was also taught at schools along with Greek and English (Ionian Islands were a protectorate of the United Kingdom from 1815 until 1864). In the First Year of the secondary education, for instance, Greek was taught four times a week, Italian three times and English twice. In the Greek Census of 1907, 4,675 people from the Ionian Islands stated Catholicism as their denomination, about 1.8% of the total population (254,494), while 2,541 (1%) Ionians stated Italian as their mother tongue, making it the second language by number of speakers. The Italian language remains popular on the islands. The Hellenic Union of Eptanisians, a civil non-profit company working for the promotion of the Heptanesian Culture, objected to the decision of the Ministry to abolish the teaching of Italian in schools, saying that [...] "especially for the Ionian Islands the selection of the Italian language has become a tradition for their schools, but also a necessary language because of the many tourists from Italy and other relations e.g. cultural, commercial, etc., of the islands with the country" [...] and they propose [...] "respect for the choice of the children and recognition of their right to learn the language they want and especially the Italian as it's the language with the greatest preference on the Ionian Islands".|$|E

Maltese has evolved independently of Literary Arabic and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation. Maltese is therefore considered an exceptional branch of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic. Maltese is also unique among Semitic languages since its morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian.|$|E
