5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she would rule the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} almost instantly. Sharp's wife Eliza {{witnessed}} the entire {{scene from the}} top of the stairs in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured. Returning to the site where he had buried a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River.

5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used}} as the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E

5000|$|The scenery of {{the stage}} {{consisted}} of a huge screen with tri-dimensional images and videos from space, light, and nature. A raising platform at center {{of the stage}} was used by Brightman on several stages of the show.

During the show, Brightman made ten <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian {{newspaper}} al-Ayyam {{reported that}} Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds {{at his home}} in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes.</b> Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E
5|$|Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for {{an answer}} from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness {{protection}} with him. He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the old {{opera in}} Copenhagen, the artists {{are allowed to}} take the {{elevator}} from their dressing room to the stage, because of their reliability. However, the dressing rooms are farther from the stage, making {{it almost impossible to}} return for quick costume changes. Designers did not account for this, but stagehands have solved this problem by constructing temporary dressing rooms near the main stage for quick <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> or makeup.|$|R
5000|$|Upon searching it, police {{described}} Bremer's car as a [...] "hotel on wheels".

25|$|Zook and {{her mother}} reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 911. Roberts and the boys carried lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools and a small bag. Also brought into the {{classroom}} was a length of wooden board with multiple sets of metal eye-hooks.

25|$|Ireland {{said he was}} heterosexual– he {{had been}} married twice– and that he pretended to be gay only to befriend {{potential}} victims. Ireland claimed that his motives were not sexually motivated. He was highly organised, and carried a full murder kit of rope and handcuffs and a full <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> to each murder. After killing his victim he cleaned the flat of any forensic evidence linking him to the scene and stayed in the flat until morning {{in order to avoid}} arousing suspicion from leaving {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|E
25|$|The miners sank their shafts in {{turns of}} up to , each turn being {{a few yards away}} {{from the bottom of the}} {{preceding}} one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These climbing shafts were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|E
50|$|López {{described}} his jail cell in Ramo Verde, saying:I am now {{in solitary confinement}} in a 7-by-10-foot cell that has {{nothing more than a}} single bed, a toilet and a small shelf for my few <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes.</b> I am not allowed writing materials, and the only book permitted is the Bible. I don’t even have a light or candle for when it gets dark outside. While this has all been hard for my family, they understand that great causes require great sacrifices.|$|R
5000|$|In the Harry Potter {{series by}} J.K. Rowling {{there are many}} {{examples}} of things larger on the inside than the outside but the most obvious example is a literal magic satchel that Hermione uses in the final book. The [...] "beaded handbag" [...] carries, among other things, <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> a library <b>of</b> books, spell ingredients, a full-sized wall portrait, and a tent (which, when assembled, is also larger on the inside than out) but is also small enough {{to hide in the}} sock she is wearing.|$|R
500|$|Investigators {{examined}} {{the body for}} several days before burying it on November 11 in a local church cemetery. Returning to search the area again, authorities found several <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> and other accoutrements, all with marks identifying the owner cut out. Also located were several pieces of paper [...] one with the name [...] "Baker" [...] written on it [...] a hat, a pocketbook {{similar to the one}} Desha was known to carry, and lead and a cap from a riding whip, which Desha was also known to use.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the power}} of the secret police {{officials}} continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors Ren Zhigu, Di Renjie, Pei Xingben, and other officials Cui Xuanli (崔宣禮), Lu Xian (盧獻), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen (李嗣眞) executed, as Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan (狄光遠). The seven still were exiled, but after this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, Zhu Jingze, and Zhou Ju (周矩), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do anything to him. Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him to take a bath and have a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan was very surprised and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as a hypocrite if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of Storm Coaster has been positive. Shaya Laughlin of the Gold Coast Bulletin described the air-time hill and indoor splashdown as more thrilling {{than the rest}} of the ride. Laughlin concluded that the [...] "Storm Coaster was definitely worth every cent Sea World spent". Michelle Tapper of Seven News stated the ride was [...] "really fun, but not as scary as [...] thought it would be". Tapper suggested riders might want a spare <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> due to the extent of the final splashdown.|$|E

5000|$|Louis XIV envisaged Versailles as a {{seat for}} all the Bourbons, {{as well as his}} {{troublesome}} nobles. These nobles were, so to say, placed within a [...] "gilded cage". Many of the apartments were far from luxurious with many nobles having to make do with one or two room apartments, forcing many of them to build or buy town-houses in Versailles proper while keeping their palace rooms for <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> or entertaining guests, rarely sleeping there. Rooms at Versailles were immensely useful for ambitious courtiers, as they allowed palace residents easy access to the monarch.|$|R

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's cry for help. When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

In her deposition, Churchill had discussed at length her criticisms of how cross-training had been implemented, and her concerns that the policy requiring a shower and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> for nurses returning to the obstetric ward from another department was a possible violation of state regulations. [...] "She was undoubtedly speaking about {{a matter of public}} concern", the judge concluded. He chastised the hospital for its apparent violations, quoting from and discussing at length the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations on cross-training to demonstrate that this was a matter of public concern.

60|$|They were expected, {{otherwise}} the household {{would have been}} asleep. Mr. Jervoise had, {{as soon as he}} determined upon their going there, sent off a man on horseback, who, riding fast, had arrived before night set in. There was, therefore, a great turf fire glowing on the hearth when they arrived, and a hearty welcome awaiting them from the farmer, his wife, and daughters. Harry had, by his father's advice, brought two <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> in a valise, but they were so completely soaked to the skin that they decided they would, after drinking a horn of hot-spiced ale that had been prepared for them, go at once to bed, where, in spite of the stirring events of the day, both went off to sleep, as soon as their heads touched the pillows.|$|R
25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes.</b> Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|R

He made a [...] rope out of twine, torn bedsheets, and copper wire, which friends had smuggled into the prison for him. Using a simple code embedded in his letters home, he informed his family of his plans to escape. On 17 April 1942, he lowered himself down the cliff of the mountain fortress. He had shaved off his moustache and wearing a Tyrolean hat, travelled to Schandau to meet his Special Operations Executive (SOE) contact who provided him with a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> cash and identity papers. Through various ruses, he reached the Swiss border by train. To avoid border guards who were on the alert for him, he walked through the mountains until he was stopped by two Swiss soldiers, who took him to Basel. Giraud eventually slipped into Vichy France, where he made his identity known. He tried to convince Marshal Pétain that Germany would lose, and that France must resist the German occupation. His views were rejected but the Vichy government refused to return Giraud to the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes</b> and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, at {{the next}} town they passed through, Sidi and Edgar went {{together}} to the bazaar, and the latter purchased, after the usual amount <b>of</b> bargaining, <b>clothes</b> similar to those worn by his friend. The expense was but small, for the costume of an Arab chief differed but little from those of his followers, except that his burnoose was of finer cotton, and his silken sash of brilliant colours, richer and more showy. With this exception the whole costume was white, and {{although some of the}} Arab sheiks wore coloured burnooses, Edgar chose a white one, as both his friend and his father wore that colour. He bought two or three <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothes,</b> for he knew that water was often scarce, and that washing of garments could not be indulged in frequently. That night when the camp was pitched he donned his new costume, and placed his pistols in his sash in Arab fashion. Sidi wound his turban for him, and gave him instructions how the clothes were to be worn. Those he had taken off were made into a bundle so that they could be resumed if necessary. He felt rather awkward as with his friend he sallied out from the tent which they now shared between them.|$|R
