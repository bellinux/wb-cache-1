From the 1920s, the Soviet Union had offered different non-aggression pacts with Finland {{but they were}} all rejected. Now the offer was renewed as part of a series of agreements with the <b>countries</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union's western border. In 1932, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Finland, re-affirmed in 1934 for ten years.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} present in 18 <b>countries</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American continents, ranging from the {{southern}} United States to northern Argentina. Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the Southern Cone region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the more than 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the natural reservoirs of T. cruzi.|$|E

China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. Russia has also endorsed India's candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council.|$|E

5|$|On 21 August 2013, rockets {{containing}} the chemical agent sarin struck several opposition-controlled or disputed {{areas of the}} Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, resulting {{in the death of}} more than 300 people and injury to thousands in the Ghouta chemical attack. The United States and other Western countries blamed the Syrian government for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened air strikes on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of <b>countries</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of carrying out air strikes on Syria.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{component}} of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz-class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy. Its establishment was {{not supported by the}} King's College study team, the UN, or East Timor's other donor <b>countries</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that East Timor could not afford to operate a naval force. The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and border protection patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the Oecussi enclave remains open. All of the force's warships are based at Hera Harbour, which is located a few kilometres east of Dili. Under the Force 2020 plan the naval component may eventually be expanded to a light patrol force equipped with corvette-sized ships and landing craft.|$|E
