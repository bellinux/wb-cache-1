40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} reported that treatment of mice with a neutralizing mAb against listeriolysin O (LLO), the pore-forming toxin of Listeria monocytogenes, provided resistance to this intracellular bacterium. We evaluated whether anti-LLO mAb would affect Listeria handling by macrophages, essential cells in Listeria resistance. Macrophages infected {{in the presence}} of anti-LLO mAb showed a marked reduction in intracellular Listeria growth, with a concomitant block in LLO-dependent Listeria passage from phagosome to cytosol. Anti-LLO mAb did not opsonize Listeria but, rather, acted within macrophages to neutralize LLO. Importantly, anti-LLO mAb effects on Listeria growth were independent of Fcγ receptor expression, IFNγ signaling, and production of nitric oxide and superoxide.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effectiveness}} of bacteriophage P 100, nisin and sodium lactate, individually and in combination, in inhibiting Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat pork ham slices was assessed. The antimicrobials {{were applied to}} the surfaces of ready-to-eat pork ham slices, which were inoculated {{with a mixture of}} L. monocytogenes. Among the individual antimicrobial treatments, bacteriophage P 100 was the most effective, decreasing L. monocytogenes to undetectable levels at zero and 72 h post-infection. Sodium lactate was the least effective treatment. Treatment with nisin at zero h significantly reduced initial cell density (p < 0. 05). However, this pattern was not observed at 72 h of storage. A significant difference (p < 0. 05) existed between the results of separate bacteriophage and nisin treatments after refrigerated storage, but not immediately upon inoculation of the bacteria.

40|$|Bacteria easily acquire {{resistance}} to antimicrobial agents; this reduces {{the number of}} effective antibiotics available to treat bacterial infections. Food contamination by bacteria also generates important economic losses and health risks.

Several studies have evaluated and demonstrated their effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria; currently, there are private companies dedicated to the development of new products based on phage cocktails, to control some bacterial infections.

40|$|Certain {{bacteria}} have motility {{and can be}} made non-toxic, {{and using}} them for drug delivery has been proposed. For example, using bacteria with flagella motion in multiple spin actuators in drug delivery microrobots has been suggested. This paper investigates various adhesion enhancement methods for attaching bacteria on preferred surfaces of cubic polymeric microstructures to achieve the directional control of motion. Serratia marcescens which has an excellent swimming behavior and 50 -μm sized cubic structures made of biodegradable poly-capro-lactone (PCL) are used. Three treatment methods are investigated and compared to the untreated control case. The first method is retarding bacterial attachments by coating certain surfaces with bovine serum albumin (BSA) which makes those surfaces anti-adherent to bacteria. The second and third methods are roughening the surfaces with X-ray irradiation and plasma respectively to purposely increase bacterial attachments on the roughened surfaces. The measured motilities of bacteria-tethered PCL microactuators are 1. 40 μm/s for the BSA coating method, 0. 82 μm/s for the X-ray irradiation, and 3. 89 μm/s for the plasma treatment method.

40|$|Aquaculture {{has only}} started to develop {{rapidly in the}} past few decades, due to better {{knowledge}} of culture species, improved methodologies and techniques in breeding, nutrition and increasing demand for food fish of high-value species such as shrimps, sea bass and groupers.

For semi-intensive and intensive shrimp culture, the number of wild caught spawners may decrease because wild shrimp populations also use mangrove swamps as its feeding ground. Other negative effects of mangrove destruction to make way to shrimp ponds, include water pollution from pond effluents, sedimentation from the release of solid materials from pond, interruption of the tidal water flow, dwindling natural shrimp and fish stock due to increased pollution or product contamination due to indiscriminate use of chemicals.

Aminoglycosides are commonly supplemented {{to aid in}} the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria.</b> As bacterial resistance is increasing worldwide, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) received lively interest as alternatives to overcome multi-drug resistant bacteria. We investigated, whether synthetic cationic AMPs might be a suitable alternative for conventional antibiotics in liquid boar sperm preservation. The antibacterial activity of two cyclic AMPs (c-WWW, c-WFW) and a helical magainin II amide analog (MK 5 E) was studied in vitro against two Gram-positive and eleven Gram-negative bacteria. Isolates included ATCC reference strains, multi-resistant E. coli and bacteria cultured from boar semen. Using broth microdilution, minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for all AMPs. All AMPs revealed activity towards the majority of bacteria but not against Proteus spp. (all AMPs) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MK 5 E). We could also demonstrate that c-WWW and c-WFW were effective against bacterial growth in liquid preserved boar semen in situ, especially when combined {{with a small amount of}} gentamicin.

40|$|The {{detection}} and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{is extremely important}} {{in the safety of}} food products and health systems. The conventional microbiological methods based on culture enrichment techniques and plating procedures are highly sensitive and selective for bacterial detection but are expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming. Here we report the development of a simple and sensitive bioassay to detect Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria by using self assembled pH-responsive polymeric micelles that have been bioconjugated to anti-E. coli (capturing agent). Poly(ethylene glycol-b-trimethylsilyl methacrylate), containing silicon moieties that can be cleaved under mildly acidic conditions, was synthesized and selfassembled into micelles, that were loaded with a fluorescent dye (1 -methylpyrene). The polymer silicon protecting groups are used as a tool to remotely activate the dye release by means of pH. The high sensitivity of the newly developed bioassay, which is capable of detecting 15 bacteria per milliliter of solution, is due to an amplification effect generated by the optical signal of millions of fluorophores released from a single micelle upon attachment to a bacterium. Fluorescence probing involves the measurements of changes in the emission spectra, through the disappearance of the excimer band, which only occurs when the dye molecules are trapped within the polymeric micelles...|$|E

Using this device, we demonstrate the dynamic position <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>bacteria</b> by introducing the sequential directional change of chemical gradients. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) -expressing bacterial cells, allowing quantitative monitoring, show not only tracking motion according to the directional control of chemical gradients, but also the gradual loss of sensitivity when exposed to the sequential attractants because of receptor saturation. In addition, the proposed system {{can be used to}} study the preferential chemotaxis assay of bacteria toward multiple chemical sources, since it is possible to produce multiple chemical gradients in the main chamber; aspartate induces the most preferential chemotaxis over galactose and ribose. The microfluidic device can be easily fabricated with a simple and cost effective process based on capillary pressure and evaporation for particle assembly. The assembled particles create uniform porous membranes in microchannels and its porosity can be easily controlled with different size particles. Moreover, the membrane is biocompatible and more robust than hydrogel-based porous membranes.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the abundance and distribution of unicellular eukaryotes in Ponta Porã stream and in its main tributary streams, as well as possible relationships between their presence and water quality on the sampled sites. We selected six sites (locals), considering headwaters (L 1 and L 2), downstreams (L 5 and L 6) and the main pollution source (L 3). We used similarity and canonical correspondence analysis to evaluate relationships between microorganism abundance and distribution to abiotic variables (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity and conductivity). Abundance was related to the increase of organic and inorganic sediment due to decomposition and erosion. We had a variation on the genera distribution, with slight predominance of ciliates, and some genera used as eutrophicated environmental indicators. The presence of Vorticella, Saprodinium, Paramecium, Metopus and Chilodonella suggests an environment ranging from polysaprobic to olygosaprobic. Urostyla, that has been used as water quality indicators, the flagellate Cercomonas, that has broad dispersion in aquatic environments, Didinium, a ciliate predator widely dispersed, Synura, a chrysophyte sensitive to basic pH and high temperatures, and Amoeba, frequently found in clean or in depuration process waters, may suggest a recuperating environment, since they are also found on lesser impacted sites...|$|E
