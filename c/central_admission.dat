50|$|On {{graduating from}} high school, {{students}} need to pass the CUAS (Central University Admission System) which contains 50% of O-NET and A-NET results {{and the other half}} of the fourth level GPA (grade point average). Many changes and experiments in the university admissions system have taken place since 2001, but by late 2007 a nationwide system had yet to be accepted by the students, the universities, and the government. In 2008, the newly formed coalition led by the People's Power Party (a party formed by the remnants of deposed Taksin Shinwatra's Thai Rak Tai party) announced more changes to the national curriculum and university entrance system. At present, state-run universities screen 70% of their students directly, with the remaining 30% coming from the <b>central</b> <b>admission</b> system. The new system gives 20% weight to cumulative grade point average, which varies upon a school's standard. Some students have voiced distrust of the new system and fear it will encounter score counting problems as happened with the A-NET in its first year. The new aptitude test, to be held for the first time in March 2009 and which will be supervised by NIETS, will replace the Advanced National Education Test (A-net). Students may sit for the aptitude test a maximum of three times, with their best scores counted. After the first tests in March 2009, the next two are scheduled for July and October.

Amongst various proposed nanophotonic architectures, optical crossbars {{have been shown to}} provide high performance in terms of bandwidth and latency. In general, optical crossbars provide a vast volume of network resources that are shared among all the cores within the chip. In this paper, we present a fair and efficient admission control mechanism for shared wavelengths and buffer space in optical crossbars. We model buffer management and wavelength assignment as a utility-based convex optimization problem, whose solution determines the admission control policy. Thanks to efficient convex optimization techniques, we obtain the globally optimal solution of the admission control optimization problem by using simple and yet efficient iterative algorithms. We cast our solution procedure as an iterative algorithm to be implemented a <b>central</b> <b>admission</b> controller. Our experimental results corroborate the gain that can be obtained by using such an admission controller to manage the shared resources of the system.

40|$|Improving the {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} healthcare services under certain quality requirements and cost restrictions is the main challenge for decision makers in hospital management. This entails ensuring that the required patients are available at each point of care while taking qualitative criteria and economic aspects into consideration. Hospital decision makers have certain priorities regarding patient flow to and through the different departments of a hospital. And the question is: What relevant levers can sustainably positively influence and control patient flow in the complex hospital system with its division of labor? Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} identify the different perspectives and needs of the relevant stakeholders (e. g. the patients, the health professionals, the management, and the hospital). In addition, important factors for the design of patient flow need to be identified and possible further developments considered. Under a modified analytic hierarchy process framework, individual and subjective cause-and-effect assessments of Austrian hospital decision makers and patient logistic service providers were carried out as part of an expert workshop in 2012. The demands, aims, and strategies of health professionals, management experts, and patients were a particular focus. It was found that the wide range of different influential factors have different impacts on the complex system and the overall objectives. It became clear that, in particular, <b>central</b> <b>admission</b> (e. g. central emergency department including patient administration), case management, and patient discharge management are seen by the respondents as the most important levers to improve patient flow logistics in Austrian hospitals...|$|E

40|$|Background & Objective : Assessing students’ {{grades in}} their courses and in {{national}} comprehensive exams may {{help us in}} the assessment of educational status of different departments indirectly. In this study, the internal consistency of medical students’ scores in Kerman University of Medical Sciences was assessed. Methods : In a historical cohort study, students’ grades and other information for entrance years between 1995 and 2003 were extracted from the <b>central</b> <b>admission</b> office and 10 indicators for educational achievement were defined for each student. Having used Cronbach's alpha and linear regression, we checked the internal consistency of scores. Also, we used factorial analysis and related graphs (Dendrogram) to evaluate the consistency between factors of students’ educational achievement. Results : Females were more successful in all series of students except for national comprehensive exams. Although internal consistency in males’ scores was more than females’, males’ scores in specific courses of basic sciences were more related to the scores of their basic sciences comprehensive exams. In addition, internal consistency in males’ scores was more than females’ especially in clinical courses. Higher age at entering university could cause a decrease in educational success. Students’ grades in various courses had slight consistency with national comprehensive exams. Moreover, the internal consistency of scores during clerkship and internship were significantly lower than the other phases. Conclusion : Lower consistency of scores in clinical courses may imply lower validity of these scores. Unlike higher educational success in females, it seems that stability in males’ scores was greater in most indicators.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to answer the {{following}} central research question: what are the influences, challenges, benefits and costs of the <b>Central</b> <b>Admission</b> System (CAS) as an e-Governance initiative in improving undergraduates’ admissions service delivery and quality assurance in Tanzania’s higher education institutions?’ In answering this key question, three sub-questions were explored: (1) To what extent and in what ways does the implementation of the CAS influence the organisation of admissions work and workplace relations in higher education institutions? (2) What are the sociotechnical challenges of implementing the CAS? (3) What are the advantages of the CAS in improving admissions service delivery and quality assurance in higher education institutions? The sociotechnical theoretical framework is an ideal for exploring these issues as it accommodates the understanding of dual relationship between social and technological aspects of the CAS in line with the contextual issues in its implementation. The focus of the thesis is on Tanzania’s higher education institutions where the CAS is being implemented. The study is informed by data collected through interviews and documentary analysis. Data organization and analysis was done using NVivo 10 QSR software. The study demonstrates that, notwithstanding the fast development and uptake of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the implementation of the CAS in Tanzania is hampered by {{the fact that most of}} the end-users of CAS (particularly applicants) have relatively low access to the ICT infrastructure. Several factors continue to have a significant effect on the implementation of CAS, which in turn lead to implications for the uptake of improved admissions service delivery and quality assurance. A digital divide, resistance to change by some higher education institutions (HEIs), poor ICT skills among applicants, the costs of internet services, unreliable electricity supply, and inadequate IT experts continue to frustrate the objective of improved admissions service delivery and quality assurance. As a technological innovation in the workplace, the CAS has led to a restructuring of admissions work tasks among admissions officers, a need to review job descriptions, introduced tighter controls over admission work processes, and has shaped admission workers’ professional identities and self-presentations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Admission to {{undergraduate}} {{medical training}} in Germany occurs by central and local pathways. <b>Central</b> <b>admission</b> includes two distinct groups: Students with top school-leaving grades (best-SLG group) {{and students with}} inferior school-leaving grades who are admitted with a delay of up to seven years (delayed admission group). Students with academic difficulties and early dropouts are present in both groups. Local admission at our university involves the German Test for Medical Studies (TMS) and allows the admission by merit of students {{with a wide range}} of school-leaving grades. Aims: To examine the justification of a TMS-based strategy to reduce the admission of potentially weak best school-leavers and enhance the admission of potentially able candidates with mediocre school-leaving grades. Method: The prognostic contribution of the school-leaving (SL) GPA and the TMS to academic performance and to continuity in the pre-clinical part of the undergraduate medical program was examined in two study groups: best school leavers (SL grade 1. 0, SL-GPA 823 - 900 points) and mediocre school leavers (SL grades 2. 0 - 2. 3, SL-GPA 689 - 660 points). The outcomes in both groups were compared in relation to their TMS results. The prospective study included four consecutive cohorts. Results: In each study group the TMS predicted the academic performance (β= 0. 442 - 0. 446) and the continuity of studies (OR= 0. 890 - 0. 853) better than the SL-GPA (β= 0. 238 - 0. 047; OR= 1. 009 - 0. 998). Attrition was most strongly associated with failing to take the TMS (OR= 0. 230 - 0. 380). Mediocre school leavers with TMS scores ≥ 125 performed as well as the best school leavers. Mediocre school leavers with TMS scores between 110 - 124 performed on average less well but within the required standards. Best school leavers with mediocre TMS scores and 30 % of the best school leavers who hadn't taken the TMS performed less well than most mediocre school leavers with high TMS scores. Discussion: The TMS appears to differentiate between potentially successful and less successful students in both GPA categories. Mediocre school leavers (SLG 2. 0 - 2. 3) with exceptionally high TMS results reach better pre-clinical examination results than best school leavers (SLG 1. 0) with mediocre TMS results. Thus, the present data justify the use of the TMS to facilitate the participation of mediocre school leavers in the competition for admission slots...|$|E
