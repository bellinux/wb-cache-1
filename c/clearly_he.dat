5|$|After Martel {{returned}} from his injury, he {{was placed in a}} storyline in which he blinded Jake Roberts by spraying him in the face with cologne on the Brother Love Show. Martel and Santana faced each other on the November 11 episode of Wrestling Challenge, and Roberts interfered. Unable to see <b>clearly,</b> <b>he</b> accidentally attacked Santana but vowed revenge against Martel. Bad News Brown left the WWF after SummerSlam, citing broken promises as his reason.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where <b>clearly</b> <b>he</b> has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{suffered}} a stroke on 11 July 1119 as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass. From then until his death, Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak <b>clearly.</b> <b>He</b> was still involved in decision making and, in 1120, he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland's suggestion that Eadmer become the next Bishop of St Andrew's. Ralph {{was one of the}} lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121. He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king's new marriage, over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead. Due to the damage from the stroke, Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but, when Roger made an attempt to do so, Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the officiant and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage. Ralph died on 20 October 1122, at Canterbury. He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122. His nephew, John, was a clerk under Ralph, and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury. After Ralph's death, John was elected to the see of Rochester.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room. The {{whole point of the}} thought experiment is to put someone inside the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and <b>clearly</b> <b>he</b> does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E

In 1929, when being involved in the construction of a golf course – a job which was given to En-tout-cas on Hillyard's recommendation –, he eventually disclosed that he was a director of En-tout-cas, thus obviously receiving income from the company.|$|E

Unable to see <b>clearly,</b> <b>he</b> misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.|$|E
25|$|Wetti's visions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Frankish perceptions of the afterlife, its appearance, and the punishments reserved for sinners. Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals {{a great deal about}} his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th-century Carolingian France. <b>Clearly,</b> <b>he</b> saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, {{it is also clear that}} because of his monastic training in humility, he felt all but unable to speak out against them.|$|E

He finds the woman, treed by a buffalo, and rescues her, only to realize he has now lost his way and cannot relocate the camp. The woman, Ingwamza, undertakes to lead him back to her village. When daylight comes and Cuff can finally see her <b>clearly,</b> <b>he</b> discovers Ingwamza too is a mutation; despite her generally human proportions, she has greenish-yellow hair, a short tail, and the head of a baboon.

25|$|McLane {{moved to}} the U.S. Senate and served there from March 4, 1827 until April 29, 1829, when he resigned. Leading up to the presidential {{election}} of 1828, he worked very hard in a losing effort to win Delaware for Andrew Jackson. In doing so he completely cut his ties to the Claytons and the dominant political faction in the state. <b>Clearly</b> <b>he</b> would have little hope of reelection to the U.S. Senate or any future in Delaware politics. All his considerable hopes for a prestigious position rested with an appointment from the new president. But a former Federalist from an inconsequential opposition state {{would have to wait}} until Jackson met other obligations. Having failed {{to become a part of}} the initial cabinet, as he had hoped, McLane reluctantly accepted appointment as Minister to England, arranged by his friend Martin Van Buren, now U.S. Secretary of State.|$|E

[...] Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… As we go into Ultron <b>clearly</b> <b>he</b> does come out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg, {{writing in}} the American Journal of Psychotherapy, criticized Bell et al.′s interpretation of their data. Aardweg argued that too many studies suggest that domineering mothers {{play a role in}} the development of male homosexuality for Bell et al.′s conclusion that mothers have at most a weak influence on the development of their sons' sexual orientation to be readily acceptable, that all questionnaire studies have inherent limitations, and that their data are inferior to those collected over time by psychotherapists. He suggested that homosexuals might give defensive answers due to not wanting to be labelled abnormal, that Bell et al.′s data were of poor quality, since too few questions about parental behavior had been asked and open-ended questions yielded superficial answers, and that it was unjustified to conclude that parents must have only a small influence on the development of their children's sexual orientation simply because that influence did not reveal itself <b>clearly.</b> <b>He</b> accused Bell et al. of admitting the limitations of path analysis only to then ignore those limitations, arguing that the technique had [...] "numerous dubious premises" [...] and that Bell et al. used it in a way that was open to technical objections such as its failure to [...] "distinguish between different types of psychodynamic development to homosexuality". He considered Bell et al. mistaken to treat their variables as isolated items, rather than in combination with each other. He also found the studies cited by Bell et al. as evidence that homosexuality might have a hormonal basis unconvincing.|$|E
