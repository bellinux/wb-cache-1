In tropical regions, the Givoni comfort diagram is a suitable tool for the assessment of thermal comfort. The Givoni <b>comfort</b> <b>chart</b> is based on the expected indoor temperature rather than outdoor conditions. Using Givoni’s comfort diagram on a psychometric chart, it is possible to predict the different operational periods for natural ventilation and ceiling fans. Three comfort zones can be defined according to the wind speed (Figure 7).|$|E

40|$|In the subtropics, air {{conditioning}} serves {{to maintain an}} appropriate indoor thermal environment not only in workplaces during daytime, but also at night for sleeping in bedrooms in residences or guestrooms in hotels. However, current practices in {{air conditioning}}, {{as well as the}} thermal comfort theories on which these practices are based, are primarily concerned with situations in which people are awake in workplaces at daytime. Therefore, these may not be directly applicable to air conditioning for sleeping environments. This paper, reports on a theoretical study on a thermal comfort model in sleeping environments. A comfort equation applicable to sleeping thermal environments was derived by introducing appropriate modifications to Fanger's <b>comfort</b> model. <b>Comfort</b> <b>charts</b> which were established by solving the comfort equation, and can be used for determining thermally neutral environmental conditions under a given bedding system have been developed.

40|$|Mixed mode (MM) {{buildings}} {{open up a}} {{new arena}} for energy efficient design. Zoned MM buildings are the most common, particularly {{in the developing world}} where only some areas in a building are air- conditioned (AC) based on programmatic requirements while the rest of it is naturally ventilated (NV). Occupants in the NV zone frequently visit the AC zone and are well aware of the conditions there. The unanswered question in such a MM building is whether occupants in the NV zone have similar adaptive behaviour and thermal comfort opinions as those in purely NV buildings or are they possibly influenced by higher expectations created from the AC zone visits. A transverse (cross-sectional) study was conducted between April 2011 to July 2013 in the hot and dry climate of Jaipur, India, including 2869 total survey responses, out of which 604 were from zoned type MM buildings. Mixed mode observations were available only during summer (April-August 2011). Occupants were asked about their ‘right-now’ opinion of indoor environmental quality variables such as thermal and humidity sensation, air movement and comfort. Simultaneous physical measurements of air and radiant temperature, relative humidity and air speeds were also recorded. We analyse the results examining the physical conditions and thermal comfort responses in both the zones, and adaptive actions exercised in the NV zone. We compare the observations from the NV zone to three adaptive <b>comfort</b> <b>charts</b> to evaluate whether comfort in the NV zone in a MM building can be modelled as a purely NV building...|$|R

A total of 836 subjects provided 1234 sets of questionnaire responses, each being accompanied by a full set of physical indoor climatic measurements from laboratory-grade instrumentation. In addition to the physical measurements were detailed estimates of each building occupant's metabolism and clothing insulation. The physical environmental results are compared with ASHRAE Standard 55 - 1992 prescriptions and the subjective data on thermal acceptability are compared with laboratory-based comfort models and standards. Gender and seasonal effects were minor and many of the differences from earlier San Francisco results were explicable in terms of clothing patterns.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} an extended {{exploration of the}} performance of low-energy earth–air heat exchanger (EAHE) cooling in hot and humid Malaysia from the published work of Sanusi (2013). The increasing demand of air-conditioning for cooling purposes motivates this investigation in search for better cooling alternatives. The passive technology, where soil underground was used as a heat sink to produce cooler air, has yet to be investigated further in hot and humid countries. This work, the passive technology, is tested by carrying out two interconnected field investigations: soil temperature measurement and the earth pipe cooling experiment for 1 year. In 1 year, soil temperature distribution at 1 m depth fluctuates, influenced by the different seasons in a year. However, the soil at 1 m depth is cooler than deeper soil during the wet season. Therefore, for investigating the EAHE cooling performance for 1 year, the pipe was buried at 1 m depth at the same test site. A significant temperature drop was found in the 1 -m-depth-buried pipe: up to 6. 3 and 8. 6 [*]°C, respective to the seasons of the year. Thermal comfort of air temperature at the buried pipe outlet was analyzed with Khedari thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>chart,</b> and the result has shown that the buried pipe outlet air temperatures are within the range of thermal comfort conditions for hot/humid countries. This study has showed a potential of earth pipe cooling technology in providing low-energy cooling in buildings in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 136 - 178) The {{appeal of}} California climate is typified by five California communities that claim climatic superiority; these claims and {{the climate of}} California are evaluated {{on the basis of}} the observation of comfort. Previous climatic classifications applied to California were based on vegetation patterns derived from temperature and precipitation regimes, not on the perception of comfort. The Greek geographers of antiquity used thermal sensation to describe world climatic patterns, but they lacked and objective method of temperature comparison. The first thermometers had descripts of thermal sensations associated with their scalar values. Experiments demonstrated that temperature was not the sole control of environmental temperature perception. In the early twentieth century, American technology developed ways to control air motion, temperature and humidity; the problem arose as to what were the ideal limits of these variables. A series of experiments developed ???effective temperature??? as an index of uniform thermal perception under a range of environmental conditions. Comfort has been defined in psychological terms by ASHRAE comfort standard 55 - 74 as ???that state of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment???, and in behavioral terms by several studies as a ???sensation that is neither slightly warm nor slightly cool???. The loci of the satisfaction conditions form the envelopes of the ASHRAE <b>Comfort</b> <b>Chart.</b> The frequencies with which the 1600 PST psychrometric observations fell within the comfort envelopes was determined for twenty weather stations in California and adjacent Arizona and Nevada. The greatest frequency of observation of comfort from May to September is in coastal areas; the width and location of this comfort zone changes with time of day and season, as climatic controls affect the strength of sea and breezes and insolation. The five communities with climatic claims occupy this zone; nearby first-order stations indicate that these claims could be based on a high frequency of comfortable psychrometric conditions. An extensive bibliography and time-line are included...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} airports' current {{thermal comfort}} {{temperature and humidity}} were registered in three main Brazilian international airports, other variables were local region climate characteristics and the constructive types of passenger terminal buildings. The Brazilian air transportation demand has considerably grown over the last decade, with some airports reaching their capacity. Thermal discomfort may be a key driver of passenger perceptions of airport service levels, specially under capacity overload situations. Therefore, to achieve airport thermal comfort within this new scenario, and with the imminent and future expansions of the airport system, certainly put extra work on the existing air conditioning systems, consequently increasing energy consumption and its associated costs. Collected temperature and humidity from each study case subsided {{the data for the}} psychrometric charts. The evidences showed temperatures below the international standards requirements for thermal <b>comfort</b> levels. These <b>charts</b> also indicated that adequate building types with natural air circulation, provides the best levels of thermal comfort.

40|$|Vernacular E modern {{transitions}} E thermal <b>comfort</b> E bio-climatic <b>chart</b> E climate response Sugganahalli, a rural vernacular {{community in}} a warm-humid region in South India, is under transition towards adopting modern construction practices. Ver-nacular local building elements like rubble walls and mud roofs are {{given way to}} burnt brick walls and reinforced cement concrete (RCC) /tin roofs. Over 60 % of Indian population is rural, and implications of such transitions on thermal comfort and energy in buildings are crucial to understand. Vernacular architecture evolves adopting local resources {{in response to the}} local climate adopting passive solar designs. This paper investigates the effectiveness of passive solar elements on the indoor thermal comfort by adopting modern climate-respon-sive design strategies. Dynamic simulation models validated by measured data have also been adopted to determine the impact of the transition from verna-cular to modern material-configurations. Age-old tradi-tional design considerations were found to concur with modern understanding into bio-climatic response and climate-responsiveness. Modern transitions were found to increase the average indoor temperatures in excess of 78 C. Such transformations tend to shift the indoor conditions to a psychrometric zone that is likely to require active air-conditioning. Also, the surveyed thermal sensation votes were found to lie outside the extended thermal comfort boundary for hot developing countries provided by Givoni in the bio-climatic chart...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{research}} is to observe the variance of energy efficiency of a typical multi-story office building under the exposure of different climatic conditions. Energy efficiency requirements in building codes or energy standards {{are among the most}} important single measures for buildings’ energy efficiency. Therefore, this study can be set up for {{a better understanding of how}} energy efficiency of a building changes under the effect of adverse to moderate climatic conditions which possess a mentionable effect on the operation of a building. This thesis is structured in three balanced and conceptual steps. Following the aim of the project, the virtual building model is to be analyzed under the effect of seven distinct climatic conditions namely work environment of New Delhi, Mumbai, Berlin, Lisbon, Copenhagen, Dubai and Montreal. Firstly, the task is to do a complete literature research based on the scope of similar researches and studying the problems in detail along with the theoritical background all the concepts which are implemented to get the numerical results. This chapter also comprises a detailed study of the climatic conditions of the above-mentioned cities. Different climatic traits like temperature variations, count of heating and cooling degree days, relative humidity, temperature range and <b>comfort</b> zonal <b>charts</b> for the specified cities are studied in detail. This study helps to understand the effect of these adverse to moderate climates on the operation of the building. On the second step, the virtual building model is prepared on a software platform named Revit Structures. This virtual building model is not necessarily a complete building, but it has the relevant functionalities of a real building. We perform the energy analysis and the heating and cooling analysis on this virtual building model to study the operational outcome of the building under different climatic conditions in detail. By the end of these above two tasks, two scenarios are observed. On one hand, we have a literature research and on the other hand we have the numerical results. Therefore, finally we present a comparative scenario based on the energy efficient performances of the building under such variant climatic conditions. This is followed by the prediction of thermal comfort level inside the building and it based on Fanger’s PMV Model. Understanding the literature and the numerical values in detail helps us to predict the index thermal comfort level inside the building. The conclusion of this master thesis focuses mainly on the scopes of improvement of energy efficiency requirements in energy codes if any, differentiated according to specific locations. The initial aim of my hypothesis which is to study the impacts of climatic variations on the energy efficient performances of a building is fulfilled but as such topics have very deep and broad roots, the scope of further improvements is always predominant...|$|R
