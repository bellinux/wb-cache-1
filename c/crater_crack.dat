The choice of the EDM parameters depends on workpieceelectrode material combination. So, the selection of parameters becomes intricate. This manuscript presents the surface characteristics of the machined surface in EDM on Ti- 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn titanium alloy. The surface roughness and the microstructure of the machined surface are explored for different EDM parameters and electrode materials. Experimentation was accomplished using negative polarity of copper, copper-tungsten and graphite electrode. In this study, peak current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time and servo-voltage are taken into consideration as process variables. The surface roughness is greatly influenced by peak current and pulse-on time among the selected electrical parameters. Among the three electrodes, the copper electrode produces the lowest surface roughness whilst graphite electrode gives the highest surface roughness. The surface characteristics (<b>crater,</b> <b>crack</b> and globule) are distorted on account of discharge energy. In context of fine surface characteristics, the copper can become as first choice electrode materials...|$|E

The performance {{characteristics such as}} surface roughness and microstructure of the machined face are influenced by numerous parameters. The selection of parameters becomes complicated.

In this study, the PT-GMAW process was used in pulse-pulse mode to butt joint weld 5 -mm DH 36, 8 -mm HSLA 65, 9. 5 -mm 350 WT, and 11 -mm HSLA 65 steel plate with ER 70 S- 6 wire in order to assess its suitability as a replacement for submerged arc welding (SAW) and {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW) in panel lines of Australian naval shipyards. In the pulse-pulse mode, the wire feed rates for the leading and trailing welding wires are set independently and they alternately transfer metal into a single molten weld pool at deposition rates almost comparable with single-wire SAW. Radiographic inspection and subsequent analyses of the 8 -, 9. 5 -, and 11 -mm single-bead butt joint welds unexpectedly showed varying degrees of weld-end solidification cracking, which occurred within ∼ 30 mm from the run-off tab and was different than weld <b>crater</b> <b>cracking.</b> The percentage of plates with solidification cracking was greater at larger plate thicknesses due mainly to increases in both the weld bead depth:width ratio and joint restraint as plate thickness is increased.

This study aimed to evaluate Nd:YAG laser treatment effects on dental enamel surfaces, irradiated at different energy levels, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and surface micro-hardness tests to evaluate if caries prevention {{can be achieved by}} laser treatment. Forty human teeth were divided in four groups of 10 specimens each: in three groups the enamel surface was treated with three different laser beam energy levels, 60, 120 and 160 mJ, in one group the enamel was not lased. Five samples from each group were subjected to the Vickers microhardness test and five samples underwent SEM investigation. Results of the microhardness test demonstrated no significant differences between treated and non-treated dental enamel samples. SEM observation demonstrated a rougher enamel surface in all treated groups: the 60 mJ treated group showed tooth surfaces with vertical scratches, the 120 mJ treated group showed the enamel surface covered by <b>craters</b> and <b>cracks,</b> and the 160 mJ treated group showed a completely changed enamel structure with columns separated by voids and with a glass-like surface. These investigations demonstrated that dental enamel laser treatment at low energy levels (not > 60 mJ) produces a protective glass-like surface, without the loss of its integrity and could be an advisable technique to prevent caries.

Included among these potential effects are the following: erosion and surface degradation due to atomic oxygen impingement; ultraviolet exposure embrittlement; and delamination, pitting, cratering, and ring formation due to micrometeoroid and debris impacts.

Targeting the quantitative evaluation of this sort of damage (multitudinous damage within a singular inspection region), a characterization strategy, associating linear with nonlinear features of guided ultrasonic waves, is developed. Linear-wise, changes in the signal features in the time domain (e. g., time-of-flight and energy dissipation) are extracted, for detecting gross damage whose characteristic dimensions are comparable to the wavelength of the probing wave; nonlinear-wise, changes in the signal features in the frequency domain (e. g., second harmonic generation), which are proven to be more sensitive than their linear counterparts to small-scale damage, are explored to characterize HVI-induced pitting damage scattered in the inner layer.

It can {{be noted that}} {{in an increase in}} the discharge current, surface irregularities also increase resulting into deeper and larger craters. This is imputable to the fact that as the electric current increases with pulse on-time, machined material will melt with the most amount of high temperature transfer to the machined surface (Kumar et al. 2013). The longer pulse on-time and current results more thermal energy that vaporizes and melt the workpiece. This results in big craters left {{on the surface of the}} workpiece material (Mohnty et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2015 a, 2015 b). With the growth in current high discharge, energy is transmitted to the machining zone, so that melting and evaporation take place, resulting in the establishment of a small crater along the surface (Hascalik and Caydas 2007; Kolli and Kumar 2015). Further, due to high discharge energy, the impulsive force also increases, which leads to the formation of deeper and larger crater size which causes rough finish. SEM micrographs of machined surface, machining condition at Ip[*]=[*] 8 A, Ton[*]=[*] 90 μs, Toff[*]=[*] 60 μs graphite electrode in boron carbide powder mixed dielectric are shown in Fig.  6 (c, f and me). It can be seen that at the same discharge current the pulse on-time increases resulting in the formation of sub-surface <b>cracks,</b> deep <b>craters.</b> The magnification scale of Fig.  6 (g, h and i) is taken as 2000 times, so that <b>craters,</b> micro <b>cracks</b> and sub- surface crack can be well understood.|$|R
