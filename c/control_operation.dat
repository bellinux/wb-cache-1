On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German <b>control</b> (<b>Operation</b> Manna). On 5 May 1945, Generaloberst Blaskowitz agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, signing the surrender to Canadian general Charles Foulkes at Wageningen. (The fifth of May is now celebrated annually in the Netherlands as Liberation Day.) Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E
25|$|Waterpump {{gained a}} new {{responsibility}} in March 1968. A forward air <b>control</b> <b>operation</b> named Raven FACs {{was formed in}} Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at Waterpump before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14. The expanded AOC would have an instructor pilot in command, additional Raven FACs as needed, a senior enlisted flight line chief, a medic, a radio operator, an aircraft ordnance specialist, an avionics specialist, a ground support equipment specialist, and two engine mechanics. The latter were assigned to six month TDYs from Waterpump. The AOC expansion was codified as Palace Dog; many experienced Waterpump veterans would return for repeat tours under this program.|$|E
40|$|In Australian law {{there are}} few law {{enforcement}} powers as controversial as the <b>controlled</b> <b>operation.</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>operations</b> involve authorised unlawful conduct by police or informers {{in the course of}} an investigation. Introduced as an apparent reaction to the High Court’s decision in Ridgeway in 1995, <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> law has evolved into a national framework that aims to authorise and regulate undercover investigation at the local, national and transnational level. This article examines the scope of <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> in Australia, and their governing doctrinal and normative principles. The article concludes with a consideration of the role that <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> law plays in shaping new forms of sovereignty and the entrenchment of Richard Ericson’s counterlaw thesis...|$|R

Assigned to the flight operations division, Kraft became NASA's first flight director. He was on duty during such historic missions as America's first manned spaceflight, first manned orbital flight, and first spacewalk.|$|E

[...] In a change to the original plan to head west, the division was given a new mission known as Operation Cleanser and moved north to secure towns between Arnhem and the IJsselmeer. A large German force counterattacked the 5th Division on the night of the 16th at Otterlo, hoping to break out to the West, but were beaten back after heavy losses. [...] On 17 April the 49th Division attacked Ede, occupied by the Dutch SS, and liberated the town in 24 hours. [...] On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German <b>control</b> (<b>Operation</b> Manna), and on 5 May Generaloberst Blaskowitz agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} a Post-Foucauldian analysis of Australian <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> law. The {{purpose was to}} extend current doctrinal scholarship by exploring the discursive forces that shape this highly invasive and controversial investigative power. This thesis contends that the present doctrinal understanding is incomplete, and largely unaware of the epistemological forces operating within law and policy. By deploying a Post-Foucauldian analytic we can extend {{our understanding of the}} complex relationship between knowledge systems, discourse, power and law. Through the deployment of a nomadic, grounded genealogy in the analysis of <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> Second Reading Speeches, this research found that the governing rationalities of <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> law and policy is linked to an imperative logic dominated by discourses of risk, audit and exceptions. This dynamic explains why <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> legal architecture and policy is in its current form. Far from being a reaction to the decision in Ridgeway, <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> law is part of a legal and cultural shift in law enforcement, characterised by complex relationships between risk, rights, law and citizenship. The <b>controlled</b> <b>operation</b> is revealed as a form of apparatus: a technology of truth and power, facilitated by law. This insight allows us to reimagine the relationship between law, rights, citizenship and sovereignty in late modernity. In this environment the investigative apparatus of the <b>controlled</b> <b>operation</b> creates a field of governance within the private space of liberal citizenship, revealing the true character of citizenship in late modernity as a zone of impeachment – a location in which rights are fragile and open to perpetual potential derogation and modification. In this zone the rights attached to liberal conceptions of citizenship are increasingly the subject of subordination to a risk imperative and a logic of exception...|$|R

Overall, the majority of <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> records held by the AFP and the ACC during 2009 - 10 demonstrated compliance with Part 1 AB of the Act. Both agencies made progress towards addressing this office’s previous recommendations, including: • improved compliance in relation to the AFP’s annual reporting to the Minister. All of the details required by the Act were included in the AFP’s annual report and where information was excluded an explanation was provided, as required by ss 15 T(3) and (4) • improved access at inspections to documentation which verifies information contained in the ACC’s quarterly reports to the Minister • improved internal management of <b>controlled</b> <b>operations</b> by the ACC, including changes to the types of conditions placed on operations.
