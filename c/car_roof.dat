"You see there's {{always a}} breeze here," [...] said Hooper, {{opening the door}} as the engine left us in the siding on the sand, and the strong south-easter {{buffeting}} under Elsie's Peak dusted sand into our tickey beer. Presently he sat down to a file full of spiked documents. He had returned from a long trip up-country, {{where he had been}} reporting on damaged rolling- stock, as far away as Rhodesia. The weight of the bland wind on my eyelids; the song of it under the <b>car</b> <b>roof,</b> and high up among the rocks; the drift of fine grains chasing each other musically ashore; the tramp of the surf; the voices of the picnickers; the rustle of Hooper's file, and the presence of the assured sun, joined with the beer to cast me into magical slumber.
