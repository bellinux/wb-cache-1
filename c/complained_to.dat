5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience.

Eventually, the others <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization.
