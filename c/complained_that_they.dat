5|$|At the time, several princes <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were being}} betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position {{as head of the}} Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} little {{opposition}} during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to {{the reduction of the}} water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before the change was gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.|$|E

She took the waters at Aachen in Germany on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|Some of Hendrix's {{unfinished}} {{material was}} released as the 1971 title The Cry of Love. Although the album reached number {{three in the}} U.S. and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unable {{to make use of}} all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971's Rainbow Bridge; still others were issued on 1972's War Heroes. Material from The Cry of Love was re-released in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun, along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the {{predominantly}} Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were underrepresented by the Kingdom's system of government, where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5million people, while {{an equal number}} of Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E

5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about {{living under the}} government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had only received one ration {{of food and}} water within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the manor}} was {{passed on to}} William Dyer in 1444, who was a trustee of a lord named Robert Lee. Ownership was then {{transferred}} in 1485 to Maud, Anne, Elizabeth, Jane, and Ellen, daughters of John Lee, who had claimed {{the issues of the}} manor was under the will of their father, and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been prevented from enjoying them by Reginald Sandes and Robert Norton, who were also trustees. In 1567, William Lee sold the manor to Anne Twynne, and in 1591 Richard Miller sold it to Sir William of Kingswll. It was sold again in 1628 by Sir William's son and successor Edward Kingswell to Sir Richard Young of Weybridge, of whom it was purchased in 1632 by Sir Humphrey Benett. Benett then compounded his estate in 1649, and sold the manor of Shalden in 1653 to Anne Mynne.|$|E
5|$|Larrea {{did not get}} on {{well with}} Brown, who blamed him for {{disagreements}} and supply shortages, and even for discontent among the sailors. Buenos Aires {{did not have a}} naval tradition, and therefore most of the people involved in the naval campaign were foreigners. As a result, their commitment to the war was often limited. After the capture of Montevideo, Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war, and not correspond with himself. Nevertheless, the disagreements continued. Due to the economic crisis caused by the war, Larrea sold the captured ships, decommissioned the navy and sold off the government's own ships, but the sailors <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not received their wages, their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships. Larrea and White were blamed for this. Larrea resigned {{by the end of the}} year, after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes. Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors' wages, declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages. Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas, and all the members of his administration were put on trial. Larrea was accused of abuse of power, administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury. All his properties were confiscated, and he was exiled.|$|E
