The United States government recognizes the interconnected information technology and the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures operating across this medium as part of the US national critical infrastructure. Amongst individuals on cyberspace, there is believed to be a code of shared rules and ethics mutually beneficial for all to follow, referred to as <b>cyberethics.</b> Many view the right to privacy as most important to a functional code of <b>cyberethics.</b> [...] Such moral responsibilities go hand in hand when working online with global networks, specifically, when opinions are involved with online social experiences.|$|E

50|$|Accessibility, {{censorship}} and filtering bring up many ethical {{issues that have}} several branches in <b>cyberethics.</b> Many questions have arisen which continue to challenge our understanding of privacy, security and our participation in society. Throughout the centuries mechanisms have been constructed {{in the name of}} protection and security. Today the applications are in the form of software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention or on a personal and business level through free or content-control software. Internet {{censorship and}} filtering are used to control or suppress the publishing or accessing of information. The legal issues are similar to offline censorship and filtering. The same arguments that apply to offline censorship and filtering apply to online censorship and filtering; whether people are better off with free access to information or should be protected from what is considered by a governing body as harmful, indecent or illicit. The fear of access by minors drives much of the concern and many online advocate groups have sprung up to raise awareness and of controlling the accessibility of minors to the internet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The task of {{this paper}} is to ground the notion of <b>cyberethics</b> of co-operation. The {{evolution}} of modern society has resulted in a shift from industrial society towards informational capitalism. This transformation is a multidimensional shift that affects all aspects of society. Hence also the ethical system of society is penetrated by the emergence of the knowledge society and ethical guidelines for the information age are needed. Ethical issues and conflicts in the knowledge society are connected to topics of ecological and social sustain-ability. For information ethics and <b>cyberethics,</b> the sustainable design of society, social, and socio-technological systems is important. In this context the notions of sustainability and co-operation are discussed. Based on these categories, the approach of <b>cyberethics</b> of co-operation can be theoretically grounded...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cyberethics</b> {{contains}} includes {{morality and}} law in cyberspace. There {{are two main}} ideas concerning cyberethics: one suggests that <b>cyberethics</b> can simply be modeled on the same codes of practice as professional ethics for other technologies. The other asserts that unlike most previous technologies, cybertechnology can be shaped and modeled to perform a variety of functions and therefore requires a new paradigm for applied ethics. This paper supports the latter assertion and by examining a series of ethical issues in cyberspace tries to show that these ethical problems can be so complicated that they are impossible to consider and understand from outside of cyberspace...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we argue}} that the web is a poietically- {{enabling}} environment, which both enhances and requires {{the development of a}} "constructionist ethics". We begin by explaining the appropriate concept of "constructionist ethics", and analysing virtue ethics as the primary example. We then show why <b>CyberEthics</b> (or Computer Ethics, as it is also called) cannot be based on virtue ethics, yet needs to retain a constructionist approach. After providing evidence for significant poietic uses of the web, {{we argue that}} ethical constructionism is not only facilitated by the web, but is also what the web requires as an ethics of the digital environment. In conclusion, we relate the present discussion to standard positions in <b>CyberEthics</b> and to a broader project for Information Ethics...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} in progress is a {{qualitative and quantitative}} case study that is exploring {{the need for the}} integration of <b>cyberethics</b> into the curriculum for the middle school years 6 through 8. The broader research question in the study investigates: ‘Is there a problem with how school students in the middle years use the Internet in and out of school?’ The study has been exploring the level of understanding the group of students have of ethical behaviour on the Internet. This research helps identify areas where an understanding of <b>cyberethics</b> will increase students’ current and future understanding {{in the use of the}} Internet and their interaction with other aspects of the Internet and its environment. If a student encounters unsafe behaviour on the Internet, the student will be able to behave and act appropriately. The research is also investigating teachers and parents perceptions of the evidence of problems associated with their students/children’s access to the Internet. This area was chosen for research because of the significant impact computers have had in education in the last decade. Since the advent of personal computers and networking the Education Departments in many developed nations have taken the opportunity to promote the technology’s educational benefits. There have been several studies on the educational value of computers in schools and the research thus far describes some of the ethical changes that have emerged as a result of the technology as well as the benefits and shortcomings of the use of this technology within the Australian environment as compared to its usage in other Western nations, namely the U. S. and U. K. Identifying the problems in the use of the Internet by middle school students is a part of this investigation and it will make recommendations with regard to the integration of <b>cyberethics</b> into the middle school curriculum. This approach will help prompt students, teachers and parents to re-examine their decision framework with regard to Internet usage and hence move them to reflect and consider the use of the technology ethically. Further the research is examining students’, parents’ and teachers’ need for the introduction of <b>cyberethics</b> into the curriculum. The case study is drawing data from individual surveys of parents, teachers and students. The questionnaires consist of relevant scenarios so that it may identify the general understanding and use of the Internet by students, teachers and parents. During the study, any modification to the curriculum for the integration of <b>cyberethics</b> is to be identified and these findings should be of interest to the wider educational community in Australia and New Zealand. The questions raised in this research may affect teacher education and help demonstrate the importance of the parents’ role in their children’s Internet usage. The research will cover current issues of <b>cyberethics</b> and its effects on middle school students. <br /...|$|E

Please access the article on the official website of the journal via the DOI link {{at the top of}} the record. The purpose of this paper is to explore the differences and similarities between computer ethics, internet ethics and <b>cyberethics</b> as reflected in the contents of the published literature as well as the search trends on Google. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for an informetrics approach, and more specifically content analysis, to investigate the inter-relationships between computer ethics, internet ethics and <b>cyberethics.</b> The data sources for this study included Google Trends, Google Scholar and the Web of Science citation indexes. Different search queries were used, depending on the structure of each data source, to extract the relevant data sets. Findings: Using different methods and techniques to analyse the data, the paper provides an alternative means of investigating relationships among concepts. The findings indicate that there is still no clear distinction between the concepts in terms of subject and title terms used to describe the published literature on the three concepts, as well as the research areas where the three concepts are applied. Going by the current trend, the paper envisages that <b>cyberethics</b> may, in the future, become a broader term to include computer ethics and internet ethics. Research limitations/implications â€“ The data sources that were selected for the study might have not been comprehensive in the coverage of the published literature on the three concepts and therefore there is need for further research, which will expand the scope of the data sources. Practical implications â€“ The paperâ€™s findings may apply in the practice of indexing and abstracting as well as thesaurus construction as far as the three terms are concerned. Originality/value â€“ The paper offers an alternative technique that can be used to investigate relationships among concepts. The value of the paper could include curriculum development of programmes dealing with ethical issues that arise when developing and using computers and related technologies.

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} technology, Internet and computers in society raise new ethical questions which computer engineering students and professionals {{should be aware}} of. Nowadays it seems reasonable and necessary to include computer ethics in the engineering curriculum, and when planning a course {{there are two main}} issues that should be addressed; ethical questions concerning a profession in computing, and wider questions such as social, economical, legal, philosophical and political implications of the new technology. In a course specific laws and responsibilities connected to the profession should be taught as extensively as possible,-but the issues are continuously and rapidly changing and a second aim should be to provide a frame of reference and perspective, to teach the students reasoning and reflection on the topics. When planning a course in computer ethics, laws and regulations appear to be good material for traditional lecturing, while reasoning and reflection on various topics demands group work, gathering of information, and student presentations. This paper discusses the topics and organisation of such a course. Index Terms — Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, <b>CyberEthics,</b> Internet...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{developed a}} {{valid and reliable}} instrument that measures online moral reasoning. This instrument {{is referred to as}} the <b>Cyberethics</b> Scale (CES). The dissertation examines theoretical basis of CES and describes the process of developing the CES. Cognitive-developmental theories of moral judgment generally explain diverse ways that individuals advance their moral judgment. The study adapted concepts of several theories-particularly those ofKolhberg (1984) and Gibbs, Basinger, and Fuller (1992) -and applied them to identify states of moral reasoning specifically in an online environment. Evidence to confirm the validity and reliability ofthe CES during this process derived from a pilot study, understandability study, expert review panel, and statistical analysis. The psychometric properties were assessed with data from 243 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) website. The CES is a short answer survey that can be group-administrable as a paper-pencil format and online format and requires an average of 10 minutes to complete 10 -item survey. The scoring is self-trained. An estimated time to complete scoring a protocol is 20 minutes, which is equivalent to the SRM-SF scoring time. The psychometric properties of the CES are acceptable (r =. 604, n = 243). This reliability measure is comparable to the Chronbach Alpha of the Sociomoral Reflection Measure-Short Form when assessed with adult sample (r =. 5762, n= 48) ...|$|E
