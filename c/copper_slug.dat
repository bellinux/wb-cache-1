This 350 -MHz RFQ is split into four 2 -meter-long-RFQ’s. Then they are joined with resonant coupling to form an 8 -meter-long RFQ[3]. This improves both the longitudinal stability and the transverse stability of this long RFQ. The frequencies of the modes near the RFQ mode are measured. We show the effect on the RF fields of an error in the temperature of each one of the 2 -meter-long RFQ’s. Water-cooled <b>copper</b> <b>slugs</b> distributed along the outer walls tune the RFQ.

Thus, this paper reports a simulation analysis done on single chip high power LED package to evalute the effects of heat slug material on the heat dissipation of the LED package. The heat dissipation of two types of heat slug material, aluminum (Al) and copper (Cu) were compared in terms of junction temperature, von Mises stress and thermal resistance of the LED chip at varied input power of 0. 1 W and 1 W.

The US military has experimented with replacing lead with <b>copper</b> as a <b>slug</b> in their green bullets which reduces the dangers posed by lead in the environment {{as a result of}} artillery.

40|$|Results of {{simulations}} of flow of an arc-heated stream around a 14 -inch diameter 45 sphere-cone configuration are presented. Computations are first benchmarked against pressure and heat flux measurements made using <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> calorimeters of different shapes and sizes. The influence of catalycity of copper on computed results is investigated. Good agreements between predictions and measurements are obtained by assuming the <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> to be partially catalytic to atomic recombination. With total enthalpy estimates obtained from these preliminary computations, calculations are then performed {{for the test}} article, with the nozzle and test article considered as an integrated whole the same procedure adopted for calorimeter simulations. The resulting heat fluxes at select points on the test article (points at which fully instrumented plugs were placed) are used in material thermal response code calculations. Predicted time histories of temperature are compared against thermocouple data from the instrumented plugs, and recession determined. Good agreement is obtained for in-depth thermocouples...|$|E
40|$|Procedures {{to obtain}} {{accurate}} heat flux measurements from a 50 mm diameter gas-fueled burner using a diluent fuel gas mixture were examined that required following steps. Local heat flux measurements {{on the surface}} of a thick porous copper plate burner were corrected with a pure convective burning assumption and stagnant layer solution. Calibration procedures for thermopile-type heat flux gauge was developed and compared with NIST BFRL heat flux gauge calibration system. Calibration of gauges has found to be possible without controlling the temperature. The absorptivity and emissivity of the coating used on the burner and heat flux gauges were measured via calibrated heat flux gauges and <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> calorimeter. Independently, an apparatus was designed, built, and calibrated to measure burner flame radiant fraction. The heat flux distribution at the burner was measured.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model, {{termed the}} Slug Loss Model, {{has been developed}} for describing thermal capacitance (slug) calorimeter behavior when heat losses and other decaying processes are not negligible. This model results in the temperature time slope taking the mathematical form of exponential decay.

The model was applied to the data from a <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> calorimeter inserted during a particularly severe high heating rate arc jet run to illustrate its use. The Slug Loss Model gave a cold wall heat flux 15 % higher than the value of 2, 250 W/sq cm obtained from the conventional approach to processing the data (where no correction is made for losses). For comparison, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model was created and applied to the same data, where conduction heat losses from the slug were simulated.

50|$|For general issue, the U.S. Army {{adopted the}} M855A1 round in 2010 {{to replace the}} M855. The primary reason was {{pressure}} to use non-lead bullets. The lead slug {{is replaced by a}} <b>copper</b> alloy <b>slug</b> in a reverse-drawn jacket, with a hardened steel penetrator extending beyond the jacket, reducing lead contamination to the environment. The M855A1 offers several improvements other than being lead-free. It is slightly more accurate, has better consistency of effect in regards to wounding ability, and has an increased penetrating capability. The round can better penetrate steel, brick, concrete, and masonry walls, as well as body armor and sheet metal. It penetrates 3/8 in of mild steel at 350 meters, which the M855 can only do at 160 meters. The propellant burns faster, which decreases the muzzle flash and gives a higher muzzle velocity, an important feature when fired from a short barreled M4 carbine. Though the M855A1 is more expensive to produce, its performance is considered to compensate. One possible danger is that it generates much greater pressure in the chamber when fired, decreasing service life of parts, and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure of the weapon, though this has yet to occur.|$|R
40|$|Most White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Illinois are {{harvested}} with firearms that use lead or <b>copper</b> shotgun <b>slugs</b> or muzzleloader bullets, which may fragment when they strike bone. Lead is a neurotoxin to both {{humans and animals}} that scavenge deer that have escaped from hunters, and excess amounts of copper ingestion can impair lipid and DNA function. In a preliminary study in 2014, packets of ground venison from firearm and bow hunters in Illinois were x-rayed, and six out of ten firearm-harvested packets contained possible metal fragments. The {{purpose of this study}} is to utilize Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV) and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy to identify the presence and concentration of lead and copper in ground venison meat meant for human consumption. Current research and manipulation of test parameters and solutions has yielded ASV standard addition curves for both lead and copper solutions. Using this method we have been able detect lead in solution at levels of 300 µg/L, with predicted detections limits of 50 - 100 µg/L.

30|$|Water {{conveyance}} through canal {{systems is}} critical for delivery to irrigated crops as well as flood control (Getsinger et al. 2014). There are over 62, 000 miles of irrigation canals throughout the 17 conterminous Western USA (Sytsma and Parker 1999) that are the primary water source to support over 40 million acres of irrigated crops (Maupin et al. 2014). Nuisance algal growths commonly impede water flow through canal systems as well as clog discharge devices, gate valves, and irrigation intakes (Getsinger et al. 2014). Copper algaecides {{are one of the}} few USEPA registered chemistries that have been widely used in canals for decades to control algae and pose no irrigation restrictions (USEPA 2009). Recent label language on a 28.2 % active copper ethanolamine complex algaecide (SePRO 2014) has specific allowable use instructions for a pulse (i.e., <b>slug)</b> <b>copper</b> application method to flowing canals. This allows for ease of application (decreased application time and equipment needs) compared with continuous drip or injection applications as well as potential increased effectiveness. Limited data exist on copper exposures achieved in moving water following pulse applications. By modeling copper concentrations down canal systems, improved predictions of distance of target algal control can be made based on the exposure, and subsequently guide application sites along a canal system to achieve desired control. Additionally, modeling the dissipation of maximum copper concentrations or peak concentration can inform water resource managers of predicted copper discharge levels at downstream sites in order to comply with regulatory standards (if applicable) to receiving waters (example: WADOE 2016).|$|R
40|$|A {{lithium ion}} battery (LIB) {{subjected}} to external heat may fail irreversibly. Manifestation of this failure include venting of potentially combustible gases and aerosols {{followed by a}} rapid self-heating accompanied by ejection of the battery materials. Quantification and simulation of the dynamics and energetics of this process are important to ensure LIBs’ safety. Here we report on {{development of a new}} experimental technique for measuring the energetics of the thermally-induced failure of LIBs as well as a new thermo-kinetic model to predict battery failure behaviors. The newly developed experimental technique, <b>Copper</b> <b>Slug</b> Battery Calorimetry (CSBC), was employed to investigate a widely utilized form factor of LIB (i. e. 18650) with 3 different battery chemistries: lithium cobalt oxide (T-Energy ICR 18650, LCO), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (Panasonic CGR 18650 CG, NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (K 2 18650 E, LFP), at various states of charge (SOCs). This technique can yield time resolved data on the rate of heat production inside the failing battery. The heat capacity of these LIBs was evaluated to be 1. 1 ± 0. 1 J g- 1 K- 1 for all three cathode types. It was shown that the total heat generated inside the batteries increases with increasing amount of electrical energy stored. The maximum total internal heat generated by fully-charged LIBs was found to be 37. 3 ± 3. 3, 34. 0 ± 1. 8 and 13. 7 ± 0. 4 kJ/cell for LCO, NMC and LFP LIBs, respectively. Additionally, experiments were carried out in which the CSBC technique was combined with cone calorimetry to measure the heat produced in flaming combustion of vented battery materials. The released combustion heat did not show a clear dependence on the stored electrical energy; this heat varied between 35 and 63 kJ/cell for LCO LIBs, 27 and 81 kJ/cell for NMC LIBs, and 36 and 50 kJ/cell for LFP LIBs. Beyond the experimental work, detailed modeling of heat transfer in the CSBC experiments was carried out, by utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software, to evaluate thermal conductivities of the LIBs and demonstrate the satisfactory accuracy of CSBC experimental analysis in the determination of the battery failure energetics for all examined battery types. Moreover, it is presented in this study a general methodology to develop a thermo-kinetic model of thermally-induced failure of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), using COMSOL and experimental data collected by CSBC. This methodology is demonstrated specifically on LCO LIBs (T-Energy ICR 18650), but it can be easily extended to other battery types. The model was parameterized based on Arrhenius’ Law and via an iterative inverse modeling analysis of CSBC test results using COMSOL. These model parameters are dependent on the cells’ states of charge (SOCs) and they can effectively represent the tested cells’ heat production energetics during failure. The fully-parameterized thermo-kinetic model was then validated against CSBC tests that were not utilized in the model parameterization: CSBC tests on 100 % SOC LIB cell with non-standard heating rates ranging from 40 W to 100 W; and CSBC tests on 75 % SOC LIB cell with a standard heating rate of 20 W. The agreements between the experimentally measured and the simulated <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> temperature histories in these tests were found within in 5 % on average. Last but not least, this model was applied to predict the thermally-induced failure of LIB cells in a more complex scenario – cascading LIB failure of 6 LIB cells in a billiard battery pack. The simulated onset time of thermal runaway of each LIB cell in the battery pack were found of excellent agreements with experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering (Thermal and Fluid Systems)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{ability to}} {{identify}} heat sources and predict their temperatures {{across a variety of}} operating conditions is key in the design of a reliable electronic system such as a computer, a server, or any other system containing a printed circuit board assembly (PCA). The goal of this thesis is to explore a process on how one should approach thermal design to improve the probability to design a reliable electronic system. During the process, one should be able to define system requirements, understand operational environment conditions, choose an appropriate cooling method, and understand how the system will behave with these defined constraints. Using these constraints, one can perform an initial study with hand calculations to help determine a high-level feasibility of the design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can then be used to create a more complex study that will provide detailed results. Finally, a thermal mock-up should be built to compare experimental results to CFD results or to check how well the empirical data correlates to the theoretical data. Improvements to the CFD model can increase the accuracy of the correlated data and increase the confidence of results for future optimization studies. A natural convection study of a heat sink was used to demonstrate this thermal design process. Multiple fin heights of a heat sink at different ambient temperatures were analyzed by hand calculations, CFD simulations were performed using ANSYS Icepak 14. 0, and a mock-up was built using a <b>copper</b> <b>slug</b> with a Minco heater attached to simulate a processor on a PCA. Results from this experiment demonstrate how by using known correlated data to future investigations one can improve the accuracy of results. That is why it is always a benefit to assist CFD simulations with empirical data. Empirical data helps improve the accuracy of a CFD model and adds credibility to the theoretical results. This allows for improved optimization studies and helps reduce design cycle time. Mechanical Engineering (Thermal and Fluid Systems...|$|E
