40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila embryo {{undergoes}} a developmental transition in the blastoderm stage switching from syncytial to cellular development. <b>The</b> cleavage <b>furrow,</b> which encloses nuclei into cells, is a prominent morphological {{feature of this}} transition.

A key to these questions is provided by the gene slam, which has been previously implicated in controlling furrow invagination. Here we investigate <b>the</b> null phenotype <b>of</b> slam, <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> Slam protein, and its control by the recycling endosome. We find that slam is essential for furrow invagination during cellularisation and together with nullo, for specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>furrow.</b> During cellularisation, Slam marks first <b>the</b> <b>furrow,</b> which is derived from <b>the</b> metaphase <b>furrow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous mitosis.

In mononucleate cells, nuclear localization of GFP-Pav-KLP is mediated through NLS elements in its C-terminal domain.

The {{carapace}} is smooth except for some small items. Crangon allmani can be distinguished from the North Sea shrimp Crangon crangon by a longitudinal <b>furrow</b> along <b>the</b> back on the sixth and hindmost pleon segment. A ridge occurs along each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>furrow.</b> Two pairs <b>of</b> small thorns are on the telson.|$|R
25|$|Due to Hunter's {{dominance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern Catskills, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{peaks in}} that region can be seen. <b>The</b> distinctive <b>comb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blackhead Range, the third through fifth highest Catskill peaks, {{can be seen to}} the north, and to the northeast Kaaterskill High Peak adds another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catskills' most recognizable shapes. Less recognizable from this angle are the Devil's Path peaks to the east.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{universal}} broadband multi-resonator quantum memory (MR-QM) based on <b>the</b> spatial-frequency <b>combs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microresonators {{coupled with a}} common waveguide. Here we found new Bragg-type impedance matching condition for <b>the</b> coupling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microresonators with a waveguide field which provides an efficient broadband quantum storage. The obtained analytical solution for the microresonator fields enables sustainable parametric control <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> memory characteristics...|$|R
40|$|We used {{antibodies}} against alpha-actinin and myosin labeled {{directly with}} contrasting fluorochromes to localize these contractile proteins simultaneously in dividing chick embryo cells. During mitosis anti- alpha-actinin stains diffusely the entire cytoplasm including the mitotic spindle, {{while in the}} same cells intense antimyosin staining delineates the spindle. During cytokinesis both antibodies stain <b>the</b> cleavage <b>furrow</b> intensely, and until the midbody forms the two staining patterns in the same cell are identical at <b>the</b> resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light microscope. Thereafter <b>the</b> anti-alpha-actinin staining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>furrow</b> remains strong, but the antimyosin staining diminishes. These observations suggest that alpha-actinin participates along with actin and myosin in the membrane movements associated with cytokinesis...|$|R
