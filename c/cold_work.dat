The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by Sadi Carnot in 1824 as a heat engine.|$|E

Photoacoustic (PA) {{technique}} is {{applied for the}} first time as a nondestructive tool to characterize microstructures in Ti modified and <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> 316 type austenitic stainless steel. PA measurements were carried out on samples under solution annealed, <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> and heat treated conditions. Results indicate that there is a striking difference in the photoacoustic signal patterns in case of solution annealed and <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> samples whereas there is only a change in the amplitude of the photoacoustic spectrum observed in case of <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> and heat treated sample. From the measured photoacoustic amplitudes, thermal diffusivity and conductivity were calculated. Results of the PA measurements correlate well with the ultrasonic velocity measurements made earlier on the similar <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> and heat treated Ti modified stainless steel samples...|$|R

25|$|Electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper, a high-purity copper that {{contains}} oxygen as an alloying agent, represents {{the bulk of}} electrical conductor applications because of its high electrical conductivity and improved annealability. ETP copper is used for power transmission, power distribution, and telecommunications. Common applications include building wire, motor windings, electrical cables, and busbars. Oxygen-free coppers are used to resist hydrogen embrittlement when extensive amounts of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> is needed, and for applications requiring higher ductility (e.g., telecommunications cable). When hydrogen embrittlement is a concern and low electrical resistivity is not required, phosphorus may be added to copper.|$|E
500|$|A typical implant {{consists}} of a titanium screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained. <b>Cold</b> <b>work</b> hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N [...]05 percent, C [...]10 percent, H [...]015 percent, Fe [...]50 percent, and O [...]40 percent) is {{the most commonly used}} titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, Titanium 6AL-4V, (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments. Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, anodic oxidation or various-media blasting) to increase the surface area and osseointegration potential of the implant.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E

40|$|Copper was {{subjected}} to sliding against 440 C in liquid methane. The normal load range was from 1 / 4 to 2 kilograms, and the sliding velocity range was from 3. 1 to 25 meters per second.

Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the dislocation structure in the copper very near the wear scar surface. It was found that near the wear scar surface, the microstructure was characterized by a fine-cell recrystallized zone in which individual dislocations could be distinguished in the cell walls. The interiors of the cells, about 0. 5 micrometer in diameter, were nearly dislocation free.
