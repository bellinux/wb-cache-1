5|$|On December 21, 1918, Baker {{received}} {{orders to}} return to the United States. Reluctant to leave France and return to his life in America, he decided to take a final flight at his squadron's airfield in Toul. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a test flight. The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> anyone else test the aircraft.|$|E

As with previous fines, Cuban confirmed that he will match the fine with a donation to charity, however, with a condition that he reaches two million followers on his Twitter account. Cuban also jokingly commented that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> Stern leave without a proper farewell.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the rest}} of Oostergo and in Westergo {{resistance}} against the Hollanders flared up in many places. Officials appointed by the count were in fear of their life and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> their guard down anywhere, as is shown by the fate of Simon van Zaanden, the steward of Oostergo and Westergo, who was murdered in the monastery (!) of Klaarkamp, shortly after the relief of Dokkum. But the matter did not end with a few violent incidents. Around the middle of June there was open insurrection in the area surrounding the city of Leeuwarden, the capital of Oostergo, and in the area directly inland from Staveren. From there it spread like an oil spill over the rest of Oostergo and Westergo.|$|E

25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they {{figure out what to do}} with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E
500|$|Spivey {{made his}} final public {{appearance}} in 1991, at a reunion of the 1951 Kentucky Wildcats team in Lexington. Writer Greg Doyel says that [...] "he was a recluse" [...] at the time. According to his wife, Audrey Spivey, [...] "He never got over [...] Bill <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> that go. He was just devastated." [...] Then living in Daytona Beach, Florida, {{he was later}} hurt in an automobile accident, which aggravated a lower-back injury. Spivey's son, Cashton, said that [...] "He never made a full recovery from that. It affected his posture, and he had chronic pain from that." [...] In a post-accident bone grafting operation, {{a piece of equipment}} became lodged in Spivey's lower back; according to Cashton, he won a small amount from the hospital in a lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from {{those used by}} the Greeks. Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this, the Romans <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go of the reins in a crash, so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves. In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident, they carried a falx, a curved knife. They also wore helmets and other protective gear. In any given race, {{there might be a}} number of teams put up by each faction, who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by ganging up on opponents, forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and [...] expose themselves to accident and injury. Spectators could also play a part as there is evidence they threw lead [...] "curse" [...] amulets studded with nails at teams opposing their favourite.|$|E

2500|$|The {{imperial}} treasury was bankrupted {{by rising}} state debt and falling revenues. Alexander {{was aware of}} the crisis but never tackled its root cause, the oversized peacetime army of 800,000 men. Alexander expected future wars in Southern Europe and the Middle East, and feared that mass dismissal of veteran soldiers would cause insurrection. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> them go: they were not needed in their native villages, and there were no jobs in the cities. Instead of reducing the army to an affordable peacetime size, Alexander tried to cut spending through the establishment of self-sustaining military settlements, which failed [...] "from start to finish". He replaced expensive field maneuvers with drill exercise and parades, alienating experienced commanders and contributing to dissatisfaction of the nobility.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the world}} record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said “When we {{introduced}} the Vitesse, we established the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h. Still, we <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go {{of the idea of}} reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well. The fact that we have succeeded in reaching 408.84 km/h is a thrill for me, and it reaffirms once again that Bugatti is the leader when it comes to technology in the international automotive industry." [...] The driver, Anthony Liu, claimed [...] "Even at such high speeds it remained incredibly comfortable and stable. With an open top, you can really experience the sound of the engine and yet even at higher speeds I did not get compromised by the wind at all.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 913, Former Shu's then-crown prince Wang Yuanying, who {{was locked}} in a power {{struggle}} against the director of palace communications Tang Daoxi, killed Tang in an armed confrontation, but shortly after was himself killed by his own soldiers. [...] Wang Jian initially mourned Wang Yuanying deeply and suspected his adoptive son, the general Wang Zonghan (王宗翰), of killing Wang Yuanying without first receiving his approval, and there were fears that Wang Jian would carry out wide-scale reprisals. [...] However, at that time, Zhang, who was drafting Wang Jian's declaration to the people regarding the incident, submitted his draft, and the draft contained language that read, [...] "Without carrying out the execution by the axe, the imperial shrine would be severely harmed." [...] Wang Jian realized that despite his love for Wang Yuanying, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> it damage the state's foundations, and therefore ordered that Wang Yuanying be posthumously demoted to commoner rank; no reprisals occurred for Wang Yuanying's death besides {{the execution of the}} actual killer and some executions or exiles of Wang Yuanying's staff members.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005's Infinite Crisis miniseries, it was {{revealed}} that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.|$|E
