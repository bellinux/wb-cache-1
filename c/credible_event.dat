Even though structures are designed for <b>credible</b> <b>events</b> that can happen during a lifetime of the structure, extreme events do happen and cause catastrophic failures. Understanding the causes and effects of structural collapse {{is now at the}} core of critical areas of national need. One factor that makes studying structural collapse difficult is the lack of full-scale structural collapse experimental test results against which researchers could validate their proposed collapse modeling approaches. The goal of this work is the creation of an element deletion strategy based on fracture models for use in validated prediction of collapse of steel structures. The current work reviews the state-of-the-art of finite element deletion strategies for use in collapse modeling of structures. It is shown that current approaches to element deletion in collapse modeling do not take into account stress triaxiality in vulnerable areas of the structure, which is important for proper fracture and element deletion modeling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to identify the preliminary design basis events (DBEs) for consideration {{in the design of}} the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR). For external events and natural phenomena (e. g., earthquake), the objective is to identify those initiating events that the MGR will be designed to withstand. Design criteria will ensure that radiological release scenarios resulting from these initiating events are beyond design basis (i. e., have a scenario frequency less than once per million years).

An integrated tool to identify these aberrations {{is essential in}} understanding diseases and in designing clinical interventions. Previous discovery methods based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) require very high depth of coverage on the whole genome scale, and are cost-wise inefficient. Another approach, whole exome genome sequencing (WEGS), is limited to discovering variations within exons.

Previous research has shown thatfor tall buildings the current code requirement is not sucient to prevent these undesirableplastic mechanisms from forming and leading to collapse of the structure. Furthermore,nonlinear analyses of structures greater than four stories with strength ratios of 2 : 0 or greaterhave shown story mechanisms to still occur. It is unclear whether complete prevention ofstory mechanisms is possible or even necessary in tall buildings. To achieve a completebuilding mechanism, the required SCWB ratio would lead to dimensions that would bedeemed unacceptable to project sponsors. To determine the eects that SCWB strength ratios have on collapse mechanisms andcollapse capacities of buildings, several structures with diering SCWB ratios and heightswere analyzed: namely, 12 -, 18 - and 24 -story structures each with 1 : 2, 1 : 4, 1 : 6, 1 : 8, and 2 : 0 SCWB ratios, for a total of 15 structures.

The performance goals of the HPM are to reduce encumbered land and improve operational efficiency. By dividing the HPM into storage pits separated by nonpropagation walls, the maximum <b>credible</b> <b>event</b> can be substantially reduced. A critical component of the HPM is the pit cover. The {{primary purpose of the}} pit cover is to prevent sympathetic detonation in the storage pit caused by fragments coming from an accidental explosion during ordnance transport. The pit cover must be constructed such that sympathetic detonation is prevented when the pit cover impacts an acceptor ordnance. An arena test which examined the fragment penetration resistance of candidate cross sections was conducted. Lightweight concrete specimens constructed with and without steel face plates were subjected to the detonation loads from a MK- 84 bomb (945 lb. TNT) at a standoff distance of eight feet. The results show that a twelve inch lightweight concrete section is sufficient to stop the worst case donor fragments. The finite element program DYNA 3 D was used to examine the response of the critical thick case acceptor (MK- 82 bomb) subjected to pit cover impact. Predicted case deformation and peak pressure in the explosive fill were compared with sympathetic detonation criteria to determine the feasibility of using lightweight concrete as the pit cover material.

40|$|A mass {{detonation}} of stored ammunition {{may lead}} to devastating injury, material damage, and asset loss. Such a scenario can be initiated by an external (fragment or bullet) impact, or the detonation of nearby ammunition articles, leading to sympathetic reaction/detonation. At a military base, sympathetic reactions between storage modules are normally prevented by applying Inter Magazine Distances (IMD), such as those given in AASTP- 1. In the research program Sustainable Ammunition Safety, funded by the Dutch MoD, the possibility is being investigated to prevent a sympathetic reaction within a storage module. For this purpose the effect of alternative packaging materials between articles or between pallets is studied. This paper describes the results obtained so far. For some specific high value munitions commercial packaging solutions with mitigation measures are already available today. In our research program we study the application of packaging materials to bulk stored ammunition or munitions storage in a platform in general. Experiments have been performed to illustrate the reducing effects of mitigating materials such as porous aluminium and PUR foam between 60 mm mortar rounds. The results clearly show mitigation phenomena. These phenomena can also be understood physically by applying numerical modelling techniques such as Autodyn. Furthermore we are developing a methodology for cost-benefit analysis of packaging materials. Besides acquisition costs, the application of these materials has logistic consequences. On the other hand, {{the reduction of the}} Maximum <b>Credible</b> <b>Event</b> (MCE) reduces the required size of the ammunition area, and the required distance to a military camp or third parties.

40|$|The {{recent events}} of the Indian Ocean 2004 and the Tohoku-Oki 2011 have brought to the fore the {{hazardous}} nature of the tsunami phenomenon. Consequently, understanding and quantifying the tsunami hazard have gained a significant interest from researchers worldwide. Traditionally, deterministic approach, based on the maximum <b>credible</b> <b>event</b> or the worst-case scenario, {{has been used to}} assess the tsunami hazard. However, the absence of a single comprehensive way to define this scenario makes the usefulness of the deterministic method limited (Geist and Lynett 2014). Probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA), on the other hand, takes into consideration the contribution of multiple tsunamigenic sources to elaborate tsunami hazard maps. PTHA is now widely used in different tsunami-prone areas of the globe (Annaka et al. 2007; Thio et al. 2007; Sørensen et al. 2012; Yadav et al. 2013; Roshan et al. 2016). In the NE Atlantic, many efforts have been conducted {{in the aftermath of the}} Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 to assess hazard posed by tsunamis. They mainly addressed the tsunami hazard through the deterministic approach with a particular focus on the coastal impact from the 1755 -like event (Omira et al. 2010, 2011, 2013; Baptista et al. 2011). Alternatively, Omira et al. (2015) and, more recently, Omira et al. (2016) introduced the probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment in the NE Atlantic from sources of tectonic origin. We welcome the comment by Fonseca (2016) as it gives us the opportunity to better discuss the progress in the PTHA in the NE Atlantic.

40|$|The {{power system}} in many {{countries}} around world has been shifting from a regulated system to a deregulated and uncertain, competitive market environment. This exerts unprecedented and severe pressures on the existing transmission system by worsening flow congestion and decreasing security margins. On the other hand, maintaining system reliability is still {{the basis for the}} proper planning and operation of the bulk electric power system. The traditional deterministic security assessment approaches tend to be conservative by emphasizing the most severe, <b>credible</b> <b>event.</b> With the increased competition, engineers face more pressure, from economic imperatives in the market places, to operate the system closer to or even beyond the traditional deterministic limits. Therefore, more refined methods are needed to provide improved security assessment results, which should be able {{to take into account the}} probabilistic nature of many uncertain variables in the decision-making environment.

Impact assessment for risk based security assessment provides a method to measure the cost consequence of different insecurity problems in the power system.

40|$|Disconnecting the {{criticality}} alarm permanently in June 1996 signified that the hazards in the PUREX (plutonium-uranium extraction) plant {{had been so}} removed and reduced that criticality {{was no longer a}} <b>credible</b> <b>event.</b> Turning off the PUREX {{criticality alarm}} also marked a salient point in a historic deactivation project, 1 year before its anticipated conclusion. The PUREX/UO 3 Deactivation Project began in October 1993 as a 5 -year, $ 222. 5 - million project. As a result of innovations implemented during 1994 and 1995, the project schedule was shortened by over a year, with concomitant savings. In 1994, the innovations included arranging to send contaminated nitric acid from the PUREX Plant to British Nuclear Fuels, Limited (BNFL) for reuse and sending metal solutions containing plutonium and uranium from PUREX to the Hanford Site tank farms. These two steps saved the project $ 36. 9 - million. In 1995, reductions in overhead rate, work scope, and budget, along with curtailed capital equipment expenditures, reduced the cost another $ 25. 6 million. These savings were achieved by using activity-based cost estimating and applying technical schedule enhancements. In 1996, a series of changes brought about under the general concept of ``reengineering`` reduced the cost approximately another $ 15 million, and moved the completion date to May 1997. With the total savings projected at about $ 75 million, or 33. 7 percent of the originally projected cost, understanding how the changes came about, what decisions were made, and why they were made becomes important. At the same time sweeping changes in the cultural of the Hanford Site were taking place. These changes included shifting employee relations and work structures, introducing new philosophies and methods in maintaining safety and complying with regulations, using electronic technology to manage information, and, adopting new methods and bases for evaluating progress. Because these changes helped generate cost savings and were accompanied by and were an integral part of sweeping ``culture changes,`` the story of the lessons learned during the PUREX Deactivation Project are worth recounting. Foremost among the lessons is recognizing the benefits of ``right to left`` project planning. A deactivation project must start by identifying its end points, then make every task, budget, and organizational decision based on reaching those end points. Along with this key lesson is the knowledge that project planning and scheduling should be tied directly to costing, and the project status should be checked often (more often than needed to meet mandated reporting requirements) to reflect real-time work. People working on a successful project should never be guessing about its schedule or living with a paper schedule that does not represent the actual state of work. Other salient lessons were learned in the PUREX/UO 3 Deactivation Project that support these guiding principles. They include recognizing the value of independent review, teamwork, and reengineering concepts; the need and value of cooperation between the DOE, its contractors, regulators, and stakeholders; and the essential nature of early and ongoing communication. Managing a successful project also requires being willing to take a fresh look at safety requirements and to apply them in a streamlined and sensible manner to deactivating facilities; draw on the enormous value of resident knowledge acquired by people over years and sometimes decades of working in old plants; and recognize the value of bringing in outside expertise for certain specialized tasks. This approach makes possible discovering the savings that can come when many creative options are pursued persistently and the wisdom of leaving some decisions to the future. The essential job of a deactivation project is to place a facility in a safe, stable, low-maintenance mode, for an interim period. Specific end points are identified to recognize and document this state. Keeping the limited objectives of the project in mind can guide decisions that reduce risks with minimal manipulation of physical materials, minimal waste generation, streamline regulations and safety requirements where possible, and separate the facility from ongoing entanglements with operating systems. Thus, the ``parked car`` state is achieved quickly and directly. The PUREX Deactivation Lessons Learned History was first issued in January 1995. Since then, several key changes have occurred in the project, making it advisable to revise and update the document. This document is organized with the significant lessons learned captured {{at the end of each}} section, and then recounted in Section 11. 0, ``Lessons Consolidated. `` It is hoped and believed that the lessons learned on the PUREX Deactivation Project will have value to other facilities both inside and outside the DOE complex...|$|E

Particularly, a novel online support vector regression (OSVR) algorithm is developed to approach the problem of discovering the abnormalities from multiple correlated time series for accuracy and real-time efficiency. We also utilize historical data streams to optimize the precision of the OSVR algorithm. Moreover, this system comprises a friendly user interface by integrating multiple physiological data streams and visualizing alarms of abnormalities. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} response of axially loaded concrete filled steel tube (CFST) columns under lateral impact loading using explicit non-linear finite element techniques. The aims of this paper are to evaluate the vulnerability of existing columns to <b>credible</b> impact <b>events</b> {{as well as to}} contribute new information towards the safe design of such vulnerable columns. The model incorporates concrete confinement, strain rate effects of steel and concrete, contact between the steel tube and concrete and dynamic relaxation for pre-loading, which is a relatively recent method for applying a pre-loading in the explicit solver. The finite element model was first verified by comparing results with existing experimental results and then employed to conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis. The effects of various structural and load parameters on the impact response of the CFST column were evaluated to identify the key controlling factors. Overall, the major parameters which influence the impact response of the column are the steel tube thickness to diameter ratio, the slenderness ratio and the impact velocity. The findings of this study will enhance the current state of knowledge in this area and can serve as a benchmark reference for future analysis and design of CFST columns under lateral impact...|$|R
40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a Department of Energy, accelerator-based {{neutron source}} {{proposed}} for construction at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project is currently {{nearing the end}} of the conceptual design stage. The objective of the target facility is to provide beams of pulsed thermal and sub-thermal neutrons for research purposes. The neutrons are created by the action of highly energetic protons ({approximately} 1 GeV) on a mercury target. The proton beam power will be 1 MW with planned upgrades to 2 MW and, eventually, to 4 MW. Over the course of facility life, significant inventories of spallation and activation products will build up in the target mercury. Accordingly, the facility is being designed to prevent or minimize potential environmental source terms. The results of calculations of the SNS target mercury radionuclide inventories and the characteristics of the dominant radionuclides are presented. The effect of the activation/spallation product chemical and physical characteristics on dispersability is discussed. Energy sources that could drive potential releases, <b>credible</b> initiating <b>events</b> and facility preventive and mitigative features are described. The source term for the limiting extremely unlikely mercury spill accident scenario is presented. These results support the conclusion that the facility has a low hazard profile with regard to the accidental release of radioactive material...|$|R

Language, together with visual images, is an indispensable tool for characterisation {{and the creation of}} models that, on one hand, have the purpose of representing reality through the construction of a plausible world {{but on the other hand}} stray from real life in that they represent stereotypes that make the models instantly <b>credible</b> and the <b>events</b> predictable. Starting from this premise, in order to analyse the female models depicted by Italian television we have focused our observations on a few very successful fictional TV series: Un medico in famiglia (1998), Commesse (1999), Il bello delle donne (2000); the first is a family drama, while the other two are dramas with predominantly female casts...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliable}} operation of protection systems {{depends on the}} correct setting of protective devices. Due to the increasing network complexity and {{the large number of}} protective devices (and their associated setting parameters), it is extremely laborious for engineers to manually validate the settings. Existing model-based (MB) systems that are capable of performing the validation task require significant manual input for network models creation, relay models configuration, simulation result analysis, etc., which is both time consuming and subject to human errors. This paper presents a methodology that adopts the principle of model-based reasoning (MBR) for automated validation of protection settings. Such a methodology is demonstrated through the design and implementation of a prototype tool Model-Based protection setting Smart Tool (MBST), which is capable of automatically populating network models, configuring relay models with settings to be validated, creating <b>credible</b> system <b>events,</b> and simulating the relays’ behaviour under these events. The automated process is achieved by an interface layer within MBST that allows interaction with a commercially available simulation engine to leverage its internal data and functions for the settings validation task. The simulated results are automatically analysed using a rule-based (RB) approach. The key advantage of the work is the mechanism to automate the entire settings validation process. The design of the interface layer to interact with existing simulation engine and models also demonstrates a solution for rapid prototyping of intelligent systems dedicated to validation of protection settings...|$|R

While noting that the built environment on Istanbul’s shorelines exposed to tsunami inundation comprises residential, commercial, industrial, public buildings (governmental/municipal, schools, hospitals, sports, and religious), infrastructure (car parks, garages, fuel stations, electricity transformer buildings), and military buildings, as well as piers and ports, gas tanks and stations, and other urban elements (e.g., recreational facilities), he further argued that along the Marmara Sea shore, Tuzla (Fig.  1) shipyards and important port and petrochemical facilities at Ambarlı (Fig.  1) are expected to be exposed to tsunami hazard. Hancilar (2012) also stated that significant lifeline systems of the city of Istanbul such as natural gas, electricity, telecommunication, and sanitary and waste-water transmission are also under the threat of tsunamis and in terms of social risk, and he estimated that there are about 32, 000 inhabitants exposed to tsunami hazard. It should be emphasized, however, that Hancilar (2012) considered only seismic sources and as himself pointed out, that while it could be said that the eastern coasts of Istanbul are more hazardous than the western coastlines, numerical modeling and hazard assessment considering submarine landslides might result in different inundations on the shorelines of the city. In other words, his conclusions could be considered as corresponding to the best-case tsunami scenario and the risk would be considerably higher {{in the case of a}} tsunami due to coseismic submarine landslide.|$|R
40|$|In the Bayesian {{statistical}} paradigm, {{uncertainty in}} the parameters of a physical system {{is characterized by a}} probability distribution. Information from observations is incorporated by updating this distribution from prior to posterior. Quantities of interest, such as <b>credible</b> regions, <b>event</b> probabilities, and other expectations can then be obtained from the posterior distribution. One major task in Bayesian inference is then to characterize the posterior distribution, for example, through sampling. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are often used to sample from posterior distributions using only unnormalized evaluations of the posterior density. However, high dimensional Bayesian inference problems are challenging for MCMC-type sampling algorithms, because accurate proposal distributions are needed in order for the sampling to be efficient. One method to obtain efficient proposal samples is an optimization-based algorithm titled 'Randomize-then-Optimize' (RTO). We build upon RTO by developing a new geometric interpretation that describes the samples as projections of Gaussian-distributed points, in the joint data and parameter space, onto a nonlinear manifold defined by the forward model. This interpretation reveals generalizations of RTO that can be used. We use this interpretation to draw connections between RTO and two other sampling techniques, transport map based MCMC and implicit sampling. In addition, we motivate and propose an adaptive version of RTO designed to be more robust and efficient. Finally, we introduce a variable transformation to apply RTO to problems with non-Gaussian priors, such as Bayesian inverse problems with Li-type priors. We demonstrate several orders of magnitude in computational savings from this strategy on a high-dimensional inverse problem. by Zheng Wang. Thesis: S.

40|$|Background: Dupuytren’s disease {{encompasses}} {{a spectrum of}} fibroblastic disorders from the presence of 1 – 2 nodules {{in the palm of}} a hand with no joint contracture to grotesque, crippling and disabling deformities of hands. Over the last 50 years, many enlightening studies have been forthcoming, which, through techniques of histopathology, biochemistry, tissue culture, and electron microscopy, have shed pearls of light on various aspects of the disease process. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature on Dupuytren’s disease was undertaken, stringing together results from numerous studies to establish a table of events and their location {{in the development of the}} disease. Results: What will be seen is a <b>credible</b> scenario of <b>events</b> which will enable the clinician to be more proactive in the earlier treatment of the disease and more aware of factors that increase or decrease recurrence rates postoperatively. Conclusions: The most effective management of Dupuytren’s disease is early recognition and treatment of the nodule, before the development of a joint contracture, particularly of a proximal interphalangeal joint. As there is evidence of a significant inflammatory role in the development of the nodule, the process of fibroplasia can be minimized by altering the macrophage > fibroblast > collagen cascade by the intralesional injection of a potent anti-inflammatory agent such as triamcinolone, which also blocks tissue inhibitors of collagenase, thus enhancing the action of native collagenase, and reduces the size and firmness of nodules and, at least temporarily, arrests their progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: In Australia, {{there is}} growing use of {{technology}} supported knowledge translation (KT) strategies such as social media and mobile apps in health promotion and in Indigenous health. However, {{little is known about}} how individuals use technologies and the evidence base for the impact of these health interventions on health behavior change is meager. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine how Facebook is used to promote health messages to Indigenous people and discuss how KT can support planning and implementing health messages to ensure chosen strategies are fit for the purpose and achieve impact. Methods: A desktop audit of health promotion campaigns on smoking prevention and cessation for Australian Indigenous people using Facebook was conducted. Results: Our audit identified 13 out of 21 eligible campaigns that used Facebook. Facebook pages with the highest number of likes (more than 5000) were linked to a website and to other social media applications and demonstrated stickiness characteristics by posting frequently (triggers and unexpected), recruiting sporting or public personalities to promote campaigns (social currency and public), recruiting Indigenous people from the local region (stories and emotion), and sharing stories and experiences based on real-life <b>events</b> (<b>credible</b> and practical value). Conclusions: KT planning may support campaigns to identify and select KT strategies that are best suited and well-aligned to the campaign’s goals, messages, and target audiences. KT planning can also help mitigate unforeseen and expected risks, reduce unwarranted costs and expenses, achieve goals, and limit the peer pressure of using strategies that may not be fit for purpose. One of the main challenges in using KT systems and processes involves coming to an adequate conceptualization of the KT process itself...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} of pile foundations affected by earthquakes {{around the world}} since the 1960 ’s indicate that pile foundations are susceptible to damage {{to such a degree}} that the serviceability and integrity of the superstructure may be affected. Although numerous cases of seismically damaged piles are reported, the detailed mechanisms causing the damage are not yet fully understood. As a consequence, an effective seismic design of pile foundations has not been yet established in practice. Many road bridge structures supported on piles exist in southern Indiana. This is a region where the risk of occurrence of a dangerous earthquake is high due to its proximity to two major seismic sources: (1) the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ); and (2) the Wabash Valley Fault System (WVFS). The present study is a first step towards the assessment of potential earthquake-induced damage to pile foundations in southern Indiana. Credible earthquake magnitudes for each of the two potential seismic sources, NMSZ and WVFS, are assessed for a return period of 1000 years. SHAKE analyses are performed at nine selected sites in southwestern Indiana to estimate the potential of ground shaking and liquefaction susceptibility. The soil profile and soil properties at each site are obtained from the archives of the Indiana Department of Transportation. The amplitude of the rock outcrop motion is estimated using attenuation relationships appropriate to the region, and estimated values are compared with predictions from USGS. SHAKE analyses are performed for two earthquake scenarios: (1) a NMSZ earthquake; and (2) a WVFS earthquake. Two sets of input motions are considered for each scenario. The liquefaction potential at those nine sites is assessed based on the Seed et al. (1975) method. Data from a total of 59 real cases of earthquake-induced damage to piles have been gathered through an extensive literature survey. The collected and compiled data have been used to identify the causes and types of pile damage, and the severity of damage. Based on the survey, damage is usually located near the pile head, at the interfaces between soft and stiff layers, and between liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers. Large inertial loads from the superstructure can cause crushing of the head of concrete piles. Imposed deformations due to the response of the surrounding soil can produce small to large cracks on concrete piles depending on the soil profile. In contrast, large inertial loads, liquefaction and lateral spreading can cause wide cracks. Few cases of steel piles are found in the literature. Steel casing seems to improve the performance of concrete piles. Numerical simulations of a concrete pile at a selected road bridge site with and without steel casing are used to investigate the effect of steel casing on the performance of concrete piles. Results from this work suggest that major <b>credible</b> seismic <b>events</b> can generate accelerations high enough to produce damage to concrete piles in southern Indiana. The potential of liquefaction and lateral spreading increase the likelihood of damage in both concrete and steel piles; this may pose a special risk to those bridges crossing the Wabash and Ohio rivers. However, further examination and analysis is required for existing bridge structures, as well as for future bridges. Existing structures may be retrofitted by placing a steel jacket on the upper portion of the piles or by installing additional steel encased concrete piles, or large diameter concrete piles...|$|R
