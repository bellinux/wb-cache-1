5000|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of CPCs in the U.S. are run by pro-life Christians according to a conservative Christian philosophy. [...] , two Christian charities, Care Net and Heartbeat International, accounted for three quarters of CPCs in the United States. Care Net, the largest <b>CPC</b> <b>network</b> in the United States, is explicitly evangelistic in nature, and says that its [...] "ultimate aim...is to share the love and truth of Jesus Christ in both word and deed" [...] and that its [...] "pregnancy centers are committed to sharing the love of Jesus Christ with every person who walks through their doors." [...] Heartbeat International, {{one of the largest}} CPC networks in the United States and also the largest <b>CPC</b> <b>network</b> in the world, runs [...] "Christian crisis-pregnancy centers" [...] and describes itself as a [...] "Christian association of faith-based pregnancy resource centers" [...] whose materials are [...] "consistent with Biblical principles." [...] The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), which works with CPCs on legal issues, [...] "strongly believes that sharing the Gospel {{is an essential part of}} counseling women in pregnancy help medical clinics". Some CPCs are run by the Catholic Church or by other church groups. Unaffiliated CPCs, or CPCs affiliated with other organizations, may provide a religious perspective in their counseling.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Boothby {{founded the}} Care and Protection of Children (CPC) Interagency Learning Network—now a {{constellation}} of more than 75 agencies working worldwide {{on the development of}} an evidence base for efficacious child protection programming in war, disaster and post crises settings. Currently, <b>CPC</b> <b>Network</b> Program Learning Groups are undertaking long term research in eight countries: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Uganda, Palestine, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. Within this context, Boothby helped to create academic centers at the University of Indonesia (Center on Child Protection) and Makerere University (Center for the Study of the African Child).|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the overt Christian perspective of most <b>CPC</b> <b>networks,</b> Birthright International has a stated philosophy of non-evangelism. [...] A Jewish CPC organization, called In Shifra's Arms, also exists.|$|R
50|$|CPC is {{coordinated by}} a {{national}} office and guided by a volunteer board of trustees and the experts of the CPC Science Advisory Council. By developing standards and protocols and conducting conservation programs in horticulture, research, restoration, and raising awareness, <b>CPC’s</b> <b>network</b> is striving to save America’s rarest plants from being lost forever.|$|R
50|$|Most crisis {{pregnancy}} {{centers are}} affiliated with several major pro-life organizations that fund CPCs; these are Care Net, Heartbeat International, Birthright International, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA). A CPC may be affiliated {{with more than}} one network. US based Care Net and Heartbeat International are the world's two largest <b>CPC</b> <b>networks</b> with about 3,000 associated centers between them in the United States and abroad. The largest UK organisations are CareConfidential and LIFE, while the largest Canadian one is the Canadian Association of Pregnancy Support Services (CAPSS). Human Life International, a Catholic group opposed to abortion, also runs CPCs outside the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Heartbeat International is an {{international}} Christian association of 1,800 crisis pregnancy centers, providing assistance in education, training, support services like legal advice, and networking with other centers. It does not [...] "offer, recommend, or refer for abortions or abortifacients." [...] It is the largest <b>CPC</b> <b>network</b> in the world. Heartbeat International teaches its affiliated staff members who run pregnancy centers throughout the country to make their advertising {{look as though they}} are full-servive clinics that provide referrals for contraception or abortion. Staff are also trained on how to discourage pregnant women from accessing abortion, and how to discourage young women from using emergency contraception, birth control pills, or IUDs. Heartbeat staff are also encouraged to create two websites, one that has an explictly Christian message, and one that looks like Planned Parenthood. Many pregnancy centers have the ultimate goal of converting women through a born-again experience to [...] "save the mother, save the baby." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to counseling clients against abortion, Care Net affiliated centers may provide clients with {{services such as}} temporary shelter, help with jobs, debt and welfare applications, Bible study, and baby supplies such as used clothing, diapers and formula. Care Net, like other <b>CPC</b> <b>networks,</b> touts medically disputed or discredited information about the supposed health risks of abortion; it sometimes locates its centers near Planned Parenthood clinics and uses signs that read [...] "Pregnant? Considering abortion? Free services," [...] or otherwise advertises them {{as though they were}} medical clinics. Some Care Net affiliated clinics offer ultrasounds. [...] Care Net pregnancy centers have been honored by at least fifteen state legislatures, according to advocacy organization Americans United for Life.|$|R

40|$|Indirect development, {{in which}} {{embryogenesis}} {{gives rise to}} a larval form, requires that some cells retain developmental potency until they contribute to the different tissues in the adult, including the germ line, in a later, post-embryonic phase. In sea urchins, the coelomic pouches are the major contributor to the adult, but how coelomic pouch cells (CPCs) are specified during embryogenesis is unknown. Here we identify the key signaling inputs into the <b>CPC</b> specification <b>network</b> and show that the forkhead factor foxY is the first transcription factor specifically expressed in CPC progenitors. Through dissection of its cis-regulatory apparatus we determine that the foxY expression pattern is the result of two signaling inputs: first, Delta/Notch signaling activates foxY in CPC progenitors; second, Nodal signaling restricts its expression to the left side, where the adult rudiment will form, through direct repression by the Nodal target pitx 2. A third signal, Hedgehog, is required for coelomic pouch morphogenesis and institution of laterality, but does not directly affect foxY transcription. Knockdown of foxY results in a failure to form coelomic pouches and disrupts the expression of virtually all transcription factors known to be expressed in this cell type. Our experiments place foxY {{at the top of the}} regulatory hierarchy underlying the specification of a cell type that maintains developmental potency...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) interwar surveillance, harassment and {{repression of the}} Communist Party of Canada (CPC), primarily in Toronto from RCMP "O" Division, but also extends the discussion to include features of counter-subversion operations elsewhere, particularly in southwestern Ontario. These counter-subversion operations traversed three periods of activity: the early years 1920 - 28 : an interlude/ intelligence crisis {{which led to a}} debacle in 1931; and a period of reestablishing the intelligence network and an intensification of its countersubversion work from 1932 - 1939. Each period in question was characterized by specific types of intelligence network 'organization' and 'operation'. [...] My study of the rise, fall, and recovery of "'O" Division's core inter-war Toronto <b>CPC</b> intelligence <b>network,</b> examines {{the context in which the}} transformation took place linking it to the region's industrial and political order. I explain why intelligence networks, like the organizations they seek to infiltrate and the individuals whose activities they try to monitor, are anything but static and instead function as a part of the communities in which they live and face similar constraints. Intelligence networks expand and contract and shift both their investigative and operational focus. Their field investigations are malleable; their size, scope, and activities change for economic reasons and to meet both 'real' and 'perceived' threats. As local constructs intelligence networks are often best studied as a series of interactions established at the Divisional level. [...] The expansion, contraction, and transformation of "O" Division's key Toronto intelligence network influenced the types and quality of the information they secured. How intelligence networks functioned and how effective they were reflected the extent to which intelligence personnel adapted. Through much of the inter-war period "O'' Division relied heavily upon the work of secret/ special agents. Sometimes, however, less obtrusive and more distant forms of surveillance activity best suited the needs of intelligence personnel. A great deal depended upon their abilities. Success was also dictated by many other factors such as the abilities of CPC stalwarts and their subsidiary organizations. Only by paying close attention to these issues can we gain a more complete and accurate historical record of Canada’s intelligence past...|$|R
