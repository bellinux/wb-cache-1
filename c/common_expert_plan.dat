40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) The {{evaluation}} of strategic market {{information with the}} aid of an <b>expert</b> marketing <b>planning</b> system. Market information {{is one of the key}} inputs to a strategic marketing plan. The display of the market information {{with the aid of}} an <b>expert</b> marketing <b>planning</b> system will be discussed in this thesis. Market information was obtained by means of a questionnaire. The information was analysed and the marketing <b>planning</b> <b>expert</b> system was used to evaluate the marketing opportunities. The {{evaluation of}} the <b>expert</b> marketing <b>planning</b> system was done against ten points for a marketing planning process. The conclusion of this thesis is that an <b>expert</b> marketing <b>planning</b> system can aid the marketing planner in the evaluation of the strategic market information.

40|$|Background: A {{knowledge-based}} {{radiation therapy}} (KBRT) treatment planning algorithm was recently developed. The {{purpose of this}} work is to investigate how plans that are generated with the objective KBRT approach compare to those that rely on {{the judgment of the}} experienced planner. Methods: Thirty volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were randomly selected from a database of prostate plans that were generated by experienced planners (<b>expert</b> <b>plans).</b> The anatomical data (CT scan and delineation of organs) of these patients and the KBRT algorithm were given to a novice with no prior treatment planning experience. The inexperienced planner used the knowledge-based algorithm to predict the dose that the OARs receive based on their proximity to the treated volume. The population-based OAR constraints were changed to the predicted doses. A KBRT plan was subsequently generated. The KBRT and <b>expert</b> <b>plans</b> were compared for the achieved target coverage and OAR sparing. The target coverages were compared using the Uniformity Index (UI), while 5 dose-volume points (D 10, D 30, D 50, D 70 and D 90) were used to compare the OARs (bladder and rectum) doses. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to check for significant differences (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) between both datasets. Results: The KBRT and <b>expert</b> <b>plans</b> achieved mean UI values of 1. 10 [*]±[*] 0. 03 and 1. 10 [*]±[*] 0. 04, respectively. The Wilcoxon test showed no statistically significant difference between both results. The D 90, D 70, D 50, D 30 and D 10 values of the two planning strategies, and the Wilcoxon test results suggests that the KBRT plans achieved a statistically significant lower bladder dose (at D 30), while the <b>expert</b> <b>plans</b> achieved a statistically significant lower rectal dose (at D 10 and D 30). Conclusions: The results of this study show that the KBRT treatment planning approach is a promising method to objectively incorporate patient anatomical variations in radiotherapy treatment planning...|$|R

40|$|Ineffective public {{participation}} in land-use planning {{contributes to the}} lack of communication and understanding between the public and experts, acting as a barrier to successful planning outcomes. In this study, we assess whether Participatory GIS (PGIS) is a suitable method to bridge the communication gap between the public and <b>expert</b> knowledge for <b>planning</b> in the developing country context of Malaysia. Through a mixed methods approach, we investigate whether expert knowledge converges or diverges with the public 2 ̆ 7 s perceived knowledge obtained through a PGIS process and assess the potential benefits of PGIS from public and <b>expert</b> <b>planning</b> perspectives. The results indicate more convergence than divergence in knowledge and perspective, indicating that a PGIS process can communicate local knowledge to planning authorities to inform land use and development planning in Malaysia. Both the public and <b>planning</b> <b>experts</b> recognize the potential benefits of PGIS, but successful implementation will require major changes in traditional Malaysian {{public participation}} processes...|$|R

Finally, we analyze the implications of non-exclusivity in financial advice on investment behavior and welfare, and highlight a set of novel testable implications...|$|R

40|$|Acquiring {{knowledge}} from <b>experts</b> for <b>planning</b> systems {{is a difficult}} task, but is essential for any applications of planning systems. This work addresses the issue of automatic acquisition of planning operators. Operators are learned by observing the solution traces of experts agents and by subsequently refining knowledge in a learning-by-doing paradigm. Our approach is domain-independent and assumes minimal requiremerits for aprioriknowledge and expert involvement {{in order to reduce}} the burden on the knowledge engineerer and domain <b>experts.</b> <b>Planning</b> operators are learned from these observation sequences in an incremental fashion utilizing a conservative specific-to-general inductive generalization process. In order to refine the acquired operators to make them correct and complete, the system uses these operators to solve practice problems, analyzing and learning from the execution traces of the resulting solutions or execution failures. We describe techniques for planning and plan repair with incorrect and incomplete domain knowledge, and for operator refinementhrough a process which integrates planning, execution, and plan repair. Our learning method is implemented on top of the PRODIGY architecture(Carbonell, Knoblock, & Minton 1990; Carbonell et al. 1992) and is demonstrated in the extended-strips domain(Minton 1988) and a subset the process planning domain(Gil 1991) ...|$|R
