5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> <b>down</b> on a baking sheet. It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{atherosclerotic}} lesion Tissue preparation. After 12 {{weeks on}} atherogenic or control diet, mice were anesthetised and euthanized. Mouse hearts were perfused with 10 ml of {{phosphate buffered saline}} (PBS) and 10 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde. The heart and common arteries were removed, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for at least 24 hours. Hearts with the attached ascending aorta (1 - 2 mm) were cut open along the line connecting {{the tips of the}} atria. The upper part of the heart was processed and embedded in paraffin with the <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> <b>down.</b> Serial sections were cut at 4 µm thickness through the aortic root. The section at the confluence of the aortic valve leaflets and three more sections spaced at 80 microns apart along the aortic root were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The consecutive sections were used for immunohistochemistry. 1, 2 Immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinizing and blocking the endogenous peroxidase with 0. 5 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol, the antigen retrieval using rice steamer was performed. Sections were blocked with 5 % normal serum of the species in which the secondary antibody was raised, for 10 minutes, and incubated with rat anti-Mac- 3 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) diluted in the blocking serum for 1 hour followed b...|$|E

30|$|Recently, we {{developed}} a heterojunction solar cell by combining carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and bulk Si wafer [10]. The CNT/Si heterojunction solar cell has aroused great interests because of its simple process and relatively high efficiency [11 – 17]. We have successfully improved {{the efficiency of the}} solar cells from an initial value of approximately 6 % to 13.8 % by HNO 3 doping and further to 15 % by coating with a thin layer of nano-TiO 2 particles [11 – 13]. The CNT/Si solar cells with high efficiency above 10 % were also fabricated in other groups, showing the promising photovoltaic devices with a simple structure [14 – 18]. Most of these researches focused on improving the efficiency by chemical doping, improving the alignment of CNTs, or using p-type semiconducting tubes. Amorphous Si thin films were also used to construct CNT/Si cells in order to cut down the materials cost [19]. Due to the high recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs within the amorphous Si thin film, the CNT/Si cells made from amorphous Si have very poor efficiency. In order to reduce the electron transport distance and recombination rate of electron-hole pairs within Si <b>side,</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> the materials cost, as well as meet the future demands of flexible energy devices, we fabricate flexible CNT/Si solar cells with moderate efficiency from ultrathin mono-crystalline Si films.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{direction}} of the orientation at which objects and characters are most easily recognized, the perceived upright has been modelled as a weighted vector sum of the directions defined by the body's long axis (egocentric), gravity, and visible cues (Dyde et al. 2006, Exp. Brain Res.). This model predicts symmetrical responses such that subjects lying left or right <b>side</b> <b>down</b> relative to gravity should exhibit mirror symmetric patterns of responses. Such symmetry is also expected if torsional eye orientation dependent upon body orientation relative to gravity or visual orientation relative to the body {{is included in the}} model. METHODS Nineteen subjects drawn from researchers and students at York University participated. The Oriented Character Recognition Test (OCHART - described in Dyde et al. 2006) was administered while subjects viewed several orientations of visual background while either upright, left <b>side</b> <b>down,</b> or right <b>side</b> <b>down</b> relative to gravity. OCHART identifies the perceptual upright using the perceived identity of letters. RESULTS Responses revealed a systematic difference between the response pattern when lying left <b>side</b> <b>down</b> and lying right <b>side</b> <b>down.</b> This asymmetry can be modelled by a leftwise bias in the perceived orientation of the body relative to its actual orientation. DISCUSSION The asymmetry in the effect of body orientation is reminiscent of the left-leaning asymmetry in determining the {{direction of}} light coming from above (Mamassian Goutcher 2001 Cognition 81 :B 1). The asymmetry might reflect a similar tendency to perceive the body as tilted...|$|R
