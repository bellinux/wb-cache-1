Ben saw his way into those puzzles with no more difficulty than whetted his appetite, worked out sum after sum, and explained them to his brother, to the admiration of both his elders, till frowns of despair and long sighs from Stead brought Patience to declare he was mazing himself, and insist on putting out the light.|$|E
60|$|The {{history was}} then given. The present {{lord of the}} manor had been {{the son of a}} land surveyor. He was a stunted, sickly, {{slightly}} deformed lad, noted chiefly for skill in <b>cyphering,</b> and therefore had been placed in a clerkship. Here a successful lottery ticket had been the foundation of his fortunes; he had invested it in the mahogany trade, and had been one of those men with whom everything turned up a prize. When a little over thirty, he had returned to his own neighbourhood, looking any imaginable age. He had then purchased Belforest, furnished it sumptuously, and laid out magnificent gardens in preparation for his bride, a charming young lady of quality. But she had had a young Lochinvar, and even in her wedding dress, favoured by sympathising servants, had escaped down the back stairs of a London hotel, and been married at the nearest Church, leaving poor Mr. Barnes {{in the case of the}} poor craven bridegroom, into whose feelings no one ever inquired.|$|E

If {{it had not been}} for those infallible figures which proved that Arthur, instead of pining in imprisonment, ought to be promenading in a carriage and pair, and that Mr Pancks, instead of being restricted to his clerkly wages, ought to have from three to five thousand pounds of his own at his immediate disposal, that unhappy arithmetician would probably have taken to his bed, and there have made one of the many obscure persons who turned their faces to the wall and died, as a last sacrifice to the late Mr Merdle's greatness. Solely supported by his unimpugnable calculations, Mr Pancks led an unhappy and restless life; constantly carrying his figures about with him in his hat, and not only going over them himself on every possible occasion, but entreating every human being he could lay hold of to go over them with him, and observe what a clear case it was. Down in Bleeding Heart Yard there was scarcely an inhabitant of note to whom Mr Pancks had not imparted his demonstration, and, as figures are catching, a kind of <b>cyphering</b> measles broke out in that locality, under the influence of which the whole Yard was light-headed.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian <b>CYPHER</b> (Oracle, KIA 0613), {{a member}} of the PDZ-LIM family of {{proteins}} (Enigma/LMP- 1, ENH, ZASP/Cypher, RIL, ALP, and CLP- 36), has been associated with cardiac and muscular myopathies. Targeted deletion of <b>Cypher</b> in mice is neonatal lethal possibly caused by myopathies. To further investigate the role of <b>cypher</b> in development, we have cloned the zebrafish orthologue. We present here the gene, domain structure, and expression pattern of zebrafish <b>cypher</b> during development. <b>Cypher</b> was not present as a maternal mRNA and was absent during early development. <b>Cypher</b> mRNA was first detected at the 3 -somite stage in adaxial somites, and as somites matured, <b>cypher</b> expression gradually enveloped the whole somite. Later, <b>cypher</b> expression was also found in the heart, in head and jaw musculature, and in the brain. We further identified 13 alternative spliced forms of <b>cypher</b> from zebrafish heart and skeletal muscle tissue, among them a very short form containing the PDZ domain but lacking the ZM (ZASP-like) motif and the LIM domains. Targeted gene knock-down experiments using <b>cypher</b> antisense morpholinos led to severe defects, including truncation of the embryo, deformation of somites, dilatation of the pericardium, and thinning of the ventricular wall. The phenotype could be rescued by a <b>cypher</b> form, which contains the PDZ domain and the ZM motif, but lacks all three LIM domains. These findings indicate that a PDZ domain protein is important for normal somite formation and in normal heart development. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with cyclopamine, which disrupts hedgehog signaling, abolished <b>cypher</b> expression in 9 somite and 15 -somite stage embryos. Taken together, our data suggest that <b>cypher</b> may play a role downstream of sonic hedgehog, in a late stage of somite development, when slow muscle fibers differentiate and migrate from the adaxial cells...|$|R

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} my lord dwelled in his decent mansion, {{immersed in}} farming; a popular {{man with his}} intimates, and careless or unconscious of the rest. He laid on flesh; had a bright, busy face; even the heat seemed to prosper with him; and my lady - in despite of her own annoyances - daily blessed Heaven her father should have left her such a paradise. She had looked on from a window upon the Master's humiliation; and from that hour appeared to feel at ease. I was not so sure myself; as time went on, there seemed to me a something not quite wholesome in my lord's condition. Happy he was, beyond a doubt, but the grounds of this felicity were wont; even in the bosom of his family he brooded with manifest delight upon some private thought; and I conceived at last the suspicion (quite unworthy of us both) that he kept a mistress somewhere in the town. Yet he went little abroad, and his day was very fully occupied; indeed, there was but a single period, and that pretty early in the morning, while Mr. Alexander was at his lesson-book, of which I was not certain of the disposition. It should be borne in mind, in the defence of that which I now did, that I was always in some fear my lord was not quite justly in his reason; and with our enemy sitting so still in the same town with us, I did well to be upon my guard. Accordingly I made a pretext, had the hour changed at which I taught Mr. Alexander the foundation of <b>cyphering</b> and the mathematic, and set myself instead to dog my master's footsteps.|$|E

6000|$|Of {{the heavy}} {{sickness}} which declared itself next morning I can think with equanimity, {{as of the}} last unmingled trouble that befell my master; and even that was perhaps a mercy in disguise; for what pains of the body could equal the miseries of his mind? Mrs. Henry and I had the watching by the bed. My old lord called {{from time to time}} to take the news, but would not usually pass the door. Once, I remember, when hope was nigh gone, he stepped to the bedside, looked awhile in his son's face, and turned away with a gesture of the head and hand thrown up, that remains upon my mind as something tragic; such grief and such a scorn of sublunary things were there expressed. But the most of the time Mrs. Henry and I had the room to ourselves, taking turns by night, and bearing each other company by day, for it was dreary watching. Mr. Henry, his shaven head bound in a napkin, tossed fro without remission, beating the bed with his hands. His tongue never lay; his voice ran continuously like a river, so that my heart was weary with the sound of it. It was notable, and to me inexpressibly mortifying, that he spoke all the while on matters of no import: comings and goings, horses - which he was ever calling to have saddled, thinking perhaps (the poor soul!) that he might ride away from his discomfort - matters of the garden, the salmon nets, and (what I particularly raged to hear) continually of his affairs, <b>cyphering</b> figures and holding disputation with the tenantry. Never a word of his father or his wife, nor of the Master, save only for a day or two, when his mind dwelled entirely in the past, and he supposed himself a boy again and upon some innocent child's play with his brother. What made this the more affecting: it appeared the Master had then run some peril of his life, for there was a cry - [...] "Oh! Jamie will be drowned - Oh, save Jamie!" [...] which he came over and over with a great deal of passion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Petri nets with name {{creation}} and management have been recently introduced {{so as to}} make Petri nets able to model the dynamics of (distributed) systems equipped with channels, <b>cyphering</b> keys, or computing boundaries. While traditional formal properties such as boundedness, coverability, and reachability, have been thoroughly studied for this class of Petri nets, formal verification against rich temporal properties has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we attack this verification problem. We introduce sophisticated variants of first-order µ-calculus to specify rich properties that simultaneously account for the system dynamics and the names present in its states. We then analyse the (un) decidability boundaries for the verification of such logics, by considering different notions of boundedness. Notably, our decidability results are obtained via a translation to data-centric dynamic systems, a recently devised framework for the formal specification and verification of business processes working over relational database with constraints. In this light, our results contribute to the cross-fertilization between areas that have not been extensively related so far. ...|$|E
