40|$|Despite current {{advances}} in multimedia environments, tracing the geometrical struc-tures of graphical images using force feedback remains an important research issue. In this paper, {{the development and}} implementation of a Multi-Modal Display Sys-tem (MMDs) for tracing 2 D boundaries in graphic images are discussed. A method is proposed that provides a type of haptic feedback designed to assist a user to trace the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> objects <b>seen</b> in images. This method is an example of a family of haptic synthesis methods whereby the force field explored by the user is dynamic in the sense that it depends both on movement as well as on the object being hap-tically represented. The proposed performance-based method provides users with a movement guidance through an active haptic sense rather than common impedance technique. The tracing effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimen-tally...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a technique for region-based pose tracking {{without the need}} to explicitly compute contours. We assume a surface model of a rigid object {{and at least one}} calibrated camera view. The goal is to find the pose parameters that optimally fit the model surface to the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> the object <b>seen</b> in the image. In contrast to conventional contour-based techniques, which acquire the contour to be extracted explicitly from the image, our approach optimizes an energy directly defined on the pose parameters. We show experimental results for rather challenging scenes observed with a monocular and a stereo camera system. ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{technique}} for region-based pose tracking that uses a surface model of the object to be tracked {{and at least one}} calibrated camera view. The proposed algorithm can follow the movement of rigid objects or kinematic chains without explicitly computing contours in the image. The aim to match the model surface to the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> the object <b>seen</b> in the image is achieved by optimizing an energy with respect to the pose parameters. We explain how kinematic chains can be included, and how using knowledge from the previous frame can help to track objects that move with a high speed or accelerate strongly. We present experimental results for complex scenes observed with one, two, or four cameras...|$|R
25|$|In 1900, {{an attempt}} to {{introduce}} moose into the Hokitika area failed; then in 1910 ten moose (four bulls and six cows) were introduced into Fiordland. This area is considered a less than suitable habitat, and subsequent low numbers of sightings and kills have led to some presumption of this population's failure. The last proven sighting of a moose in New Zealand was in 1952. However, a moose antler was found in 1972, and DNA tests showed that hair collected in 2002 was from a moose. There has been extensive searching, and while automated cameras failed to capture photographs, evidence was <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> spots, browsing and antler marks.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{recognize}} plant species from their shapes, shapes <b>of</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> leaves can be used. However, <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> leaves are complicated and have variations. In order {{to deal with}} the complexities and variations <b>of</b> <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> leaves, a hierarchical representation of leaves is presented in this paper. First, global structures and shapes of leaves are represented by polygons whose vertices are critical points of curvature <b>of</b> smoothed <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> leaves. Second, detailed shapes of mid-most pieces are represented by linear approximation <b>of</b> the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> pieces. Last, teeth on the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> leaves are represented by triangles. Such triangles are detected from contours that are not smoothed enough to remove teeth. Features at each hierarchy are represented statistically. Such a hierarchical representation is more powerful than previous methods that represent only global structures of leaves. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{dominant}} {{explanation of}} the postwar development of the German welfare regime is that it rests on {{a long period of}} consensus among political economic and societal actors about the basic <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> social provision (<b>see,</b> for example, Von Winter 1997). Christian Democratic dominance in legislative politics after WWII was accompanied both by the necessity of forming coalitions with the Liberal Party (FDP) or the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the potential for veto in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of parliament. Social policy was thus forged by competitive appeals by the CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union) and the SPD for the “pro-welfare vote”, and by several compromises between the CDU/CSU and SPD {{at the expense of the}} FDP. These conditions ensured that social policy would not be based on radical redistribution or efforts to reshape society (as in Scandinavia). Instead, the development of social provision after WWII was marked by the resurrection of central principles of social policy developed in the late nineteenth century: Bismarckian social insurance for wage earners, special schemes for tenured civil servants, and an important role for civil society associations in the administration of social services like health care and education (Alber 1989; Esping-Andersen 1990).|$|R

50|$|In {{a general}} axonometry of a sphere the image contour is an ellipse. The <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle only in an {{orthogonal}} axonometry. But, as the engineer projection {{and the standard}} isometry are scaled orthograhic projections, the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere {{is part of an}} object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.|$|R
30|$|Paths of a ray in a {{three-dimensional}} scene should be computed {{because they are}} required for the reconstruction. The three-dimensional coordinates of the points at which a ray enters and exits are determined as follows. The point at which a ray enters is determined by calculating {{the intersection of the}} ray from the light source and a <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> the target. Similarly, the point at which a ray exits is determined by calculating the intersection of the ray from the camera and a <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> the target. To uniquely determine these intersections of the ray and the <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> the target, all the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> the target must not be occluded from the light source or the camera. Therefore, the shape of the object need to be convex in our measurement.|$|R
