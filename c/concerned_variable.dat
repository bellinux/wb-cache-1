40|$|A {{suspension}} encapsulates everything {{needed to}} execute a piece of code {{many times in the}} same context: the need for this feature exists in constraint solver programming, where (part of) a predicate checking the satisfiability of a set of a constraints needs to be re-executed every time the domain of a <b>concerned</b> <b>variable</b> changes. Traditional extensions of the WAM support a heap term and metacall based approach to this issue. The most efficient implementation of suspensions in the context of Prolog exists in B-Prolog. B-Prolog is based on the TOAM and suspension frames are put in the execution stack. They are notorioulsy cheap to re-enter. It is clear that the WAM could be adapted to allow suspension frames on the local stack. However, it is worth exploring a scheme that puts suspension frames on the WAM global stack (the heap). We describe in detail the few additions to a traditional WAM system to achieve this. Together with attributed variables that is enough to compile B-Prolog’s Action Rules to almost plain Prolog. We have enhanced hProlog with the required features to support suspension frames on the heap. We compare the performance of our Action Rules implementation with B-Prolog on a set of benchmarks previously used b...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the linkages among economic growth, energy consumption, financial development, trade openness and CO 2 emissions {{over the period}} of 1975 Q 1 - 2011 Q 4 {{in the case of}} Indonesia. The stationary analysis is performed by using Zivot-Andrews structural break unit root test and the ARDL bounds testing approach for a long run relationship between the series in the presence of structural breaks. The causal relation between the <b>concerned</b> <b>variable</b> is examined by the VECM Granger causality technique and robustness of causal analysis is tested by innovative accounting approach (IAA). Our results confirm that the variables are cointegrated; it means that the long run relationship exists in the presence of structural break stemming in the series. The empirical findings indicate that economic growth and energy consumption increases CO 2 emissions, while financial development and trade openness compact it. The VECM causality analysis has shown the feedback hypothesis between energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. Economic growth and CO 2 emissions are also interrelated i. e. bidirectional causality. Financial development Granger causes CO 2 emissions. The study opens up a new policy insights to control the environment from degradation by using energy efficient technologies. Financial development and trade openness can also play their role in improving the environmental quality. ...|$|E

Using KLD's measures of environmental performance 13 of their variables were subject to factor analysis. Factor analysis is used to investigate how variables would cluster together into factors (based on the joint variations between variables) and then {{we investigate}}d the association between this constructed factor and the firms' annual return. The factor analysis yielded three factors, non-chemical <b>concern</b> <b>variables,</b> strength <b>variables</b> and chemical <b>concerns</b> <b>variable.</b> Results point out that only the chemical concern factor is significantly associated with the firms' annual return. The results indicate that individual variables combined into an index measure may not necessarily improve or strengthen the association. Insignificant variables may dilute the significance of other variables leading to an insignificant index measure, or maybe positively (negatively) correlated variables may dominate the direction of association in a particular factor by outweighing negatively (positively) correlated variable respectively, However it highlights the true variables/factors that would better represent the construct addressed in the association. environmental performance; factor analysis; financial performance; KLD; index measures; variables...|$|R

40|$|The Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{classical}} macroeconomic models that explain the relationship between the quantity of money in an economy and the level of prices of goods and services. This study investigates this relationship for Nigeria economy over the period of 1960 to 2009. To check the stationarity properties, we employed Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test and found all the <b>concerned</b> <b>variables</b> are stationary only in the first differenced form. Using Johansen cointegration method, the empirical findings indicate that there exists long run cointegrating relationship among the <b>concerned</b> <b>variables.</b> Then applying the Granger causality test, we found a unidirectional causal relationship running from money supply to inflation which provides evidence in support for monetarist‟s view. In addition, this study does not provide evidence in supporting the well known fisher effect for Nigeria. Causality does not strictly run from inflation to interest rates as suggested by the Fisher hypothesis, instead a reversed causality between the variables is found. We finally used Wald test to verify the restrictions imposed on money aggregates and output, and we concluded and confirmed the proposition of quantity theory of money that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were: (1) to determine relationships between psychometric death <b>concern</b> <b>variables,</b> (2) to determine if the use of a personal death fantasy exercise would significantly reduce death anxiety, (3) to ascertain the experimental effect of fantasy process variables, and, (4) to describe relationships with avoidance-confrontation continuum. Templer 2 ̆ 7 s (1970) Death Anxiety Scale, Ray and Najman 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) Death Acceptance, Thauberger 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) Avoidance of the Ontological Confrontation of death, and Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) Vivia, Death Transcendence and Meditative Awareness subtests were administered pre-, immediately following, and two weeks after subjects engaged in two visually imagined fantasy experiences. Experimental Treatment Low Death Anxious (n = 20) and High Death Anxious (n = 20) Groups engaged in an innocuous fantasy involving an imagined walk in a meadow, followed by the personal death fantasy which involved imagining a simulated cardiac arrest during which the subject dies. The control group comprised of low death anxious (n = 10) and high death anxious (n = 10) subjects engaged in the same initial innocuous fantasy as the experimental treatment groups, however, the control groups 2 ̆ 7 second fantasy involved a second innocuous fantasy. The process variables were time fantasizing, number of interventions, death associated words, and four vocal quality categories. The expected relationships between the psychometric variables were supported for all death concern relationships except the death anxiety and vivia relationship which was non-significant. The expected reduction in death anxiety following confrontation experience was not found. There was a significant multivariate effect accounted for by the meditative awareness variable over all groups. The process variables of time spent, focused and externalizing thought units were significantly related to the death <b>concern</b> <b>variables.</b> Avoidance-confrontation was significantly related to each of the other death <b>concern</b> <b>variables.</b> Observed changes on the avoidance-confrontation measure indicated that low death anxious individuals could be either confronters or avoiders, however, high scorers on the death anxiety scale were avoiders. Experimental differences for the high and low ranges of the death anxiety as well as the relationship between death anxiety and the avoidance-confrontation measure were also observed; however, the high-low death anxiety differential effects were obscured by statistical design inadequacies of the study.
