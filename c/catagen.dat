5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter <b>catagen</b> (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

50|$|Cat fur {{length is}} governed by the Long hair gene in which the {{dominant}} form, L, codes for short hair, and the recessive l codes for long hair. In the longhaired cat, the transition from anagen (hair growth) to <b>catagen</b> (cessation of hair growth) is delayed due to this mutation. A rare recessive shorthair gene has been observed in some lines of Persian cat (silvers) where two longhaired parents have produced shorthaired offspring.|$|E
50|$|Anagen is {{the active}} growth phase of hair follicles {{during which the}} root of the hair is {{dividing}} rapidly, adding to the hair shaft. During this phase the hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days. Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for 2-7 years; this period is genetically determined. At the end of the anagen phase an unknown signal causes the follicle to go into the <b>catagen</b> phase.|$|E
50|$|The only {{described}} {{function of}} FGF5 in adults {{is in the}} regulation of the hair cycle. FGF5 performs {{a critical role in}} the hair cycle, where it acts as the key signalling molecule in initiating the transition from the anagen (growth) phase to the <b>catagen</b> (regression) phase.,, Evidence of this activity was initially gathered via targeted disruption of the homolog of the FGF5 gene in mice, which resulted in a phenotype with abnormally long hair.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{grows in}} cycles of various phases: anagen is the growth phase; <b>catagen</b> is the involuting or regressing phase; and telogen, the resting or {{quiescent}} phase (names derived using the Greek prefixes ana-, kata-, and telos- meaning up, down, and end respectively). Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub-phases. Prior {{to the start}} of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis (formation of the follicle). There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one or several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase, while 10-14% are in telogen and 1-2% in <b>catagen.</b> The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3-4 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hair have a much shorter length limit compared to hair on the head. Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor. DLX3 is a crucial regulator of hair follicle differentiation and cycling. Specifically, colocalization of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 complex and DLX3 regulate role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis in animal models.|$|E
50|$|Affenpinschers {{often appear}} on lists of dogs that {{allegedly}} do not shed (moult). Every {{hair in the}} dog coat grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals.

At {{the end of the}} telegen phase, the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by breed, age, and by whether the dog is an inside or outside dog.|$|E

It {{is true that}} these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; <b>catagen</b> growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair fall off—is shed. At {{the end of the}} telegen phase, the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by age and other factors. There {{is no such thing as}} a completely non-shedding breed.|$|E
50|$|Hair loss or {{known as}} {{alopecia}} is caused from {{the changing of}} hair follicle morphology and hair follicle cycling in an abnormal fashion. The cycles of hair follicles are that of growth, or anagen, regression or <b>catagen,</b> and rest or telogen. In mammals reciprocal epithelial and mesynchymal interactions control the development of hair. Genes such as BMP4 and BMP2 are both active within the precursors of the hair shaft. Specifically BMP4 {{is found in the}} dermal papilla. BMP4 is part of the signaling network which controls the development of hair. It is needed for the induction of biochemical pathways and signaling for regulating the differentiation of the hair shaft in the anagen hair follicle. This is done through controlling the expression of the transcription factors which regulate hair differentiation. It is still unclear however where BMPs act within the genetic network. The signaling of bmp4 may potentially control expression of terminal differentiation molecules such as keratins. Other regulators have been shown to control hair follicle development as well. HOXC13 and FOXN1 are considered important regulators because loss-of-function experiments show impaired hair shaft differentiation that doesn’t interfere in the hair follicle formation.|$|E
40|$|Most {{cases of}} hair loss {{are based on}} {{premature}} induction of follicle regression (<b>catagen).</b> Deciphering the unknown regulation of <b>catagen</b> is therefore clinically important, but <b>catagen</b> is also an excellent model for organ involution by rapid terminal differentiation and for epithelial cell death (apoptosis). We here report an assay for the controlled pharmacologic induction and manipulation of <b>catagen</b> follicles. Dexamethasone- 21 -acetate (0. 1 %) was applied once daily to depilation-induced, growing follicles (anagen VI) {{on the backs of}} C 57 B 1 - 6 mice. Characteristic catagen-associated changes in skin color were photodocumented and assessed by morphometric histology. Topical dexamethasone induced catagen-like follicles significantly earlier, more homogeneously, and also more extensively than vehicle. This process was inhibited by high intraperitoneal doses of cyclosporin A. In addition to its clinical relevance as a screening assay for catagen-blocking drugs, this simple murine model is an attractive tool for dissecting the molecular, cellular, and developmental biology of <b>catagen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nervous {{system and}} hair {{follicle}} epithelium {{share a common}} ectodermal origin, and some neurotrophins (NTs) can modulate keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} ask whether NTs are also involved in hair growth control. Here, we show that the expression of NT- 3 and its high-affinity receptor, tyrosine kinase C, in the skin of C 57 BL/ 6 mice is strikingly hair cycle-dependent, with maximal transcript and protein expression seen during spontaneous hair follicle regression (<b>catagen).</b> During <b>catagen,</b> NT- 3 and tyrosine kinase C are co-expressed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated in situ nick end labeling-positive keratinocytes in the club hair and secondary germ. NT- 3 -overexpressing transgenic mice show precocious <b>catagen</b> development during the postnatal initiation of hair follicle cycling, whereas heterozygous NT- 3 knockout (+/−) mice display a significant <b>catagen</b> retardation. Finally, NT- 3 stimulates <b>catagen</b> development in organ culture of normal C 57 BL/ 6 mouse skin. These observations suggest that the hair follicle is both a source and target of NT- 3 and that NT- 3 /tyrosine kinase C signaling is functionally important in the control of hair follicle regression. Therefore, tyrosine kinase C agonists and antagonists deserve systematic exploration for the management of hair growth disorders that are related to premature (alopecia/effluvium) or retarded <b>catagen</b> (hirsutism/hypertrichosis) ...|$|E
40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{is central to}} hair biology, as the hair {{follicle}} undergoes cycles of growth (anagen), regression (<b>catagen),</b> and rest (teIogen). During <b>catagen,</b> the hair follicle shortens via a pathway of programmed cell death and apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms involved in this process have not been elucidated yet. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we examined in tins study the expression in total skin, throughout one hair cycle, {{of a series of}} regulatory genes associated with apoptosis. We show that gene expression within skin is hair- cycle-dependent. Transforming growth factor-β was expressed immediately before catagen; therefore, it might be involved in the early signaling of this process. Tumor necrosis factor-β was expressed during <b>catagen</b> and might be involved in follicular apoptosis. Several proto-oncogenes and transcription factors have been described in the regulation of apoptosis in other systems. Here we show that the transcript levels of c-myc, c-myb, and c-jun changed immediately before or during early <b>catagen</b> and thus could be involved in the signaling or regulation of <b>catagen.</b> Levels of p 53 remained constant throughout anagen and <b>catagen,</b> suggesting that p 53 is not involved in the developmentally induced apoptosis of the hair follicle.

40|$|During {{the hair}} cycle of adult male Walter Reed Swiss mice, autoradiographic studies of RNA {{metabolism}} {{were made in}} conjunction with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of DNA-directed RNA synthesis. In control animals, the synthesis of RNA reaches its maximum in mid-anagen, and decreases after the 17 th day to nil on the 18 th and 19 th day of the hair cycle. Subsequently, there is a sharp rise in RNA synthesis {{at the end of}} <b>Catagen</b> without a corresponding increase in DNA synthesis. When administered in early anagen, actinomycin D has the greatest inhibitory effect upon RNA synthesis. In mid-anagen, the effect is less and it is least when given after the induction of <b>catagen.</b> Although actinomycin D blocks keratinization of hair in early anagen, it does not block the formation at the <b>catagen</b> follicle with its encapsulated club hair, club hair formation occurs in the hypodermis as the upward movement of the <b>catagen</b> follicle is suppressed. These findings suggest that the production of hair in mid-anagen and club hair formation in <b>catagen.</b> Short-lived m-RNA molecules appear to be responsible for the upward movement of the <b>catagen</b> follicle. Furthermore, RNA molecules responsible for the downward growth of the follicles appear to be produced around the 3 rd day. The long-lived mRNA molecules responsible for keratinization in mid anagen appear to be produced between the fifth and 8 th day after plucking while those responsible for club hair formation in <b>catagen</b> appear to be produced around the 16 th day of the hair cycle. Long lived m- 4 NA molecules are produced in the residual bub matrix cells of the <b>catagen</b> follicle between the 17 th and 18 th day of the hair cycle. It is suggested that these molecules remain in the residual bulb matrix cells of the telogen follicle throughout its quiescence, and may be responsible for hair growth induction in the subsequent wave.

Here we exploit the cyclic growth and regression {{activity of the}} murine hair follicle to explore potential nonneuronal functions of neurotrophins in the skin, and analyze the follicular expression and hair growth-modulatory function of BDNF, NT- 4, and their high-affinity receptor, TrkB. The cutaneous expression of BDNF and NT- 4 mRNA was strikingly hair cycle dependent and peaked during the spontaneous, apoptosis-driven hair follicle regression (<b>catagen).</b> During <b>catagen,</b> BDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity, as well as NT- 4 -immunoreactivity, were expressed in the regressing hair follicle compartments, whereas TrkB mRNA and immunoreactivity were seen in dermal papilla fibroblasts, epithelial strand, and hair germ. BDNF or NT- 4 knockout mice showed significant <b>catagen</b> retardation, whereas BDNF-overexpressing mice displayed acceleration of <b>catagen</b> and significant shortening of hair length. Finally, BDNF and NT- 4 accelerated <b>catagen</b> development in murine skin organ culture. Together, our data suggest that BDNF and NT- 4 play a previously unrecognized role in skin physiology as agents of hair growth control.

40|$|Treatment {{of cancer}} {{patients}} with chemotherapeutics like cyclophosphamide often causes alopecia {{as a result}} of premature and aberrant <b>catagen.</b> Because the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signals anagen hair follicles to enter <b>catagen,</b> we hypothesized that EGFR signaling may be involved in cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. To test this hypothesis, skin-targeted Egfr mutant mice were generated by crossing floxed Egfr and Keratin 14 promoter-driven Cre recombinase mice. Cyclophosphamide treatment of control mice resulted in alopecia while Egfr mutant skin was resistant to cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. Egfr mutant skin entered <b>catagen</b> normally, as indicated by dermal papilla condensation and decreased follicular proliferation, but did not progress to telogen as did Egfr wild type follicles. Egfr mutant follicles responded with less proliferation, apoptosis, and fewer p 53 -positive cells after cyclophosphamide. Treatment of control mice with the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib similarly suppressed alopecia and <b>catagen</b> progression by cyclophosphamide. Secondary analysis of clinical trials utilizing EGFR-targeted therapies and alopecia-inducing chemotherapy also revealed evidence for involvement of EGFR in chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Taken together, our results demonstrated the involvement of EGFR signaling in chemotherapy-induced alopecia, which will help in the design of novel therapeutic regimens to minimize chemotherapy-induced alopecia...|$|E

Objective: To analyze {{the differences in the}} extracted DNA quantity from various hair root phases. Methods: The study was an observational study with cross sectional design using samples of hair roots (n = 15) that includes three phases of hair root growth, namely the anagen phase (n = 5), the <b>catagen</b> phase (n = 5), and the telogen phase (n = 5). The classification of the hair root phases is done through microscopic examination. All samples were extracted with Chelex, the DNA was quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The statistical test used is One-way Anova and Post Hoc Tamhane to see the differences between groups. Results: The average quantity of DNA extracted from each hair root phases are 28. 78 ng/μl for anagen phase, 7. 35 ng/μl for <b>catagen</b> phase, and 3. 84 ng/μl for telogen phase.

40|$|Neurotrophins are {{important}} modulators of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. Previously, we {{had shown that}} brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) are prominently involved in the control of murine hair follicle cycling.

As functional evidence for an involvement of BDNF/TrkB in human hair growth control, we show in organ-cultured human anagen hair follicles that 50 ng per mL BDNF significantly inhibit hair shaft elongation, induce premature <b>catagen</b> development, and inhibit keratinocyte proliferation. Quantitative real-time rtPCR analysis demonstrates upregulation of the potent <b>catagen</b> inducer, transforming growth factor β 2 (TGFβ 2) by BDNF, whereas <b>catagen</b> induction by BDNF was partially reversible through co-administration of TGFβ-neutralizing antibody. This suggests that TrkB-mediated signaling promotes the switch between anagen and <b>catagen</b> at least in part via upregulation of TGFβ 2. Thus, human scalp hair follicles are both a source and target of bioregulation by BDNF, which invites to target TrkB-mediated signaling for therapeutic hair growth modulation...|$|E
40|$|Hair {{follicle}} {{formation and}} maintenance involve intimate interactions between follicular epithelial cells {{and a group}} of specialized mesenchymal cells known as the dermal papilla. Using the random primer polymerase chain reaction, we have identified an ≈ 1. 4 kb osteopontin mRNA that is present in large quantities in cultured rat vibrissa dermal papilla cells but undetectable in cultured rat skin fibroblasts. In situ hybridization showed that the osteopontin gene is expressed in dermal papilla cells of pelage follicles during <b>catagen</b> but not in anagen or telogen. As an acidic glycosylated RGD-containing extracellular matrix protein, osteopontin can function both as a cell attachment protein and as a soluble cytokine playing roles in signaling, cell migration, tissue survival, anti-inflammation, and T-cell-mediated cellular immunity. Our results indicate that the comparison of the mRNA of cultured dermal papilla cells and fibroblasts can lead to the identification of not only anagen-specific genes (e. g., nexin 1), but also a catagen-specific gene. We have thus provided evidence that specific genes are turned on during <b>catagen,</b> which is therefore not simply a passive “degenerative” phase.
