40|$|Surface {{eddy current}} probes {{are widely used}} for {{measuring}} crack depth, coating thickness and corrosion effects in metals. In most applications, single (absolute) coils are used, and the coil impedance is monitored. Information concerning inhomogeneities is extracted from changes in the <b>coils</b> impedance. Double <b>probes</b> consist of a driving coil and a smaller concentric pickup coil. In this case the induced voltage in the pickup coil is measured. This work describes {{the application of the}} finite element method to the analysis and design of both single and double <b>coil</b> surface <b>probes.</b> Double <b>coil</b> <b>probes</b> are shown to be superior for the applications mentioned above because of better linearity of the lift off curve and wider useful range. The rate of change of the induced voltage in a double <b>coil</b> <b>probe</b> is shown to be larger than the rate of change of the impedance in single <b>coil</b> <b>probes</b> for given parameter changes. This clearly indicates a higher sensitivity. Moreover, in the case of corrosion depth measurement, the noise generated by lift off changes can be suppressed by use of an appropriate double coil. The results presented are also verified experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed {{eddy current}} (PEC) testing {{technology}} {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} large area corrosion detection. According to the material attributes of detected objects, there are mainly two fields in which PEC technology is used: Non-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic material testing. When the testing object is ferromagnetic, the decaying speed of the received signal differs according to the difference of the material’s electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability and thickness. This paper states the realization of a type of PEC testing system and its application in ferromagnetic pipe testing from inside and outside of the pipe. The system consists of an exciting module, a signal receiving module, <b>coil</b> <b>probes</b> and a personal computer (PC). The exciting signal is generated by Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) integrated circuit and the exciting coil is powered by an integrated power operational amplifier. The received signal is filtered and amplified by low noise wide dynamic range amplifying circuit. The signal is then digitized by USB data acquisition system. A PC is used for signal processing and analysis. Experiments were taken with two kinds of <b>coil</b> structure <b>probes</b> to test ferromagnetic pipe from outside and inside of the pipe respectively. One type of <b>coil</b> <b>probe</b> which has the advantage of eliminating vibration effect during the well logging process in oil industry is employed to find the coupling part of casing from the inside. Another type of <b>coil</b> <b>probe</b> is used to test the wall thickness loss through coatings from the outside of the pipe and it is able to detect 10 % wall thickness loss with probe lift-off up to 80 mm so it can be employed to test high temperature parts without removal of coatings...|$|R

The springlike properties of the coil minimize strain-gauge effects, and allow to use a higher length-to-diameter ratio for a given flow. In addition, the coil is more rugged for sudden flow changes, and since it can be mounted straight across the support tips, there is less support interference in cross flows. In addition to measuring fluctuating quantities in a boundary layer, the probes were used with a constant temperature anemometer for measuring mean mass flow profiles, and with a constant current anemometer for measuring mean total temperature profiles...|$|R
