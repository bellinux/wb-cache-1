50|$|<b>Constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> {{keeps the}} {{distance}} {{covered by the}} heads per unit time fixed. Thus the disk has to slow down as the arm moves to the outer tracks. This method is typical for CD drives.|$|E
50|$|The {{write time}} may vary (± 30 s) between writer and media used. For high speed, the write {{strategy}} changes from <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> to {{constant angular velocity}} (CAV), or zoned constant linear velocity (ZCLV). The table below largely assumes CAV.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reading and}} writing process may not happen at a steady speed.

50|$|LD-ROMs {{owe their}} greater {{capacity}} to a design for <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> playback. Like magnetic tape, the playback speed corresponds with picture quality and audio definition of analog audio-video streams. Since Pioneer intended LD-ROMs primarily for computer software, they chose CLV technology {{to increase the}} file storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|In optical storage, {{constant}} {{angular velocity}} (CAV) is a qualifier for the rated speed of an optical disc drive, and may also {{be applied to the}} writing speed of recordable discs. A drive or disc operating in CAV mode maintains a {{constant angular velocity}}, contrasted with a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV).</b>|$|E
50|$|Recordings {{made on a}} {{cylinder}} remain at a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> for {{the entirety of the}} recording, while those made on a disc have a higher <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> at the outer portion of the groove compared to the inner portion.|$|R
5000|$|Some other ZBR drives, {{such as the}} 800 {{kilobyte}} 3.5" [...] floppy {{drives in}} the Apple IIGS and older Macintosh computers, don't change the data rate but rather spin the medium slower when reading or writing outer tracks, thus approximating the performance of <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> drives.|$|R
5000|$|A motor {{within the}} CD player spins the disc to a {{scanning}} velocity of 1.2-1.4 m/s (<b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity)</b> - equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at {{the inside of}} the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{factors that}} affect data storage density include: the {{existence}} of multiple layers of data on the disc, the method of rotation (<b>Constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV),</b> Constant angular velocity (CAV), or zoned-CAV), the composition of lands and pits, and how much margin is unused {{is at the center}} and the edge of the disc.|$|E
50|$|In optical storage, <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> is a {{qualifier}} for the {{rated speed}} of an optical disc drive, {{and may also}} {{be applied to the}} writing speed of recordable discs. CLV implies that the angular velocity (i.e. rpm) varies during an operation, as contrasted with CAV modes. The concept of constant linear velocity was patented in 1886 by phonograph pioneers Chichester Bell and Charles Tainter.|$|E
50|$|The {{spindle motor}} speed can {{use one of}} two types of disk {{rotation}} methods: 1) <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV),</b> used mainly in optical storage, varies the rotational speed of the optical disc depending upon {{the position of the}} head, and 2) constant angular velocity (CAV), used in HDDs, standard FDDs, a few optical disc systems, and vinyl audio records, spins the media at one constant speed regardless of where the head is positioned.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{keeping a}} {{constant}} transfer {{rate for the}} whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the zoned <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity.</b> A Z-CLV recorder rated at [...] "52×", for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove, but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|Zoned <b>Constant</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Velocity</b> (ZCLV) is a {{modification}} of CLV for high speed CD and DVD recorders. Early model recorders were CLV drives. The recording speed on such drives was rated in multiples of 150 KiB/s; a 4X drive, for instance, would write steadily at around 600 KiB/s. The transfer rate was kept constant by having the spindle motor in the drive vary in speed and run about 2.5 times as fast when recording at the inner rim of the disc as on the outer rim. Some high-speed recorders use the zoned CLV method (ZCLV), which divides the disc into stepped zones, {{each of which has}} its own <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity.</b> At higher speeds, ZCLV offers a compromise between CAV, which enables faster seek times, and CLV, which enables greater storage capacity. A ZCLV recorder rated at [...] "52X", for example, would write at 20X on the innermost zone and then progressively step up to 52X at the outer rim.|$|R
50|$|Laserdiscs, {{the first}} {{consumer}} optical discs, used <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> to double playback time (CLV disc can hold 1 hour per side; CAV disc only 30 minutes). As the motor's speed decreases from 1,800 to 600 rpm when the read head {{moves away from}} the center (which is the start of the recording), the disc constantly moves past the read head at a constant speed.|$|R
5000|$|The average LP {{has about}} 1,500 feet (460 m or {{about a third}} of a mile) of groove on each side. The average {{tangential}} needle speed relative to the disc surface is approximately 1 mph, 1.4 km/h or 0.4 m/s. It travels fastest on the outside edge, unlike audio CDs, which change their speed of rotation to provide <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV).</b> (By contrast, CDs play from the inner radius outward, the reverse of phonograph records.) ...|$|E
50|$|The GD-ROM in the Dreamcast {{works in}} {{constant}} angular velocity (CAV) mode, like the majority of modern optical drives. Very old CD-ROM drives read with a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> design, however (usually 12× or slower). Sega achieved the higher density by decreasing {{the speed of the}} disc to half and by letting the standard CD-ROM components read at the normal rate thus nearly doubling the disc's data density. This method allowed Sega to use cheaper off-the-shelf components when building the Dreamcast.|$|E
50|$|Faster 12× drives {{were common}} {{beginning}} in early 1997. Above 12× speed, {{there are problems}} with vibration and heat. CAV drives give speeds up to 30× at {{the outer edge of the}} disc with the same rotational speed as a standard <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> 12×, or 32× with a slight increase. However, due to the nature of CAV (linear speed at the inner edge is still only 12×, increasing smoothly in-between) the actual throughput increase is less than 30/12: in fact, roughly 20× average for a completely full disc, and even less for a partially filled one.|$|E
50|$|The Audograph {{recorded}} on thin vinyl discs, recording {{from the inside}} to the outside, the opposite of conventional gramophone records. Unlike conventional records, the disc was driven by a surface-mounted wheel. This meant that its recording and playback speed decreased {{toward the edge of}} the disc (like the Compact Disc and other digital formats), to keep a more <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> and to improve playing time.|$|R
40|$|New {{rotation}} {{laws have}} been recently found for general-relativistic self-gravitating stationary fluids. It was not clear whether they apply to systems rotating with a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity.</b> In this paper we fill this gap. The answer is positive. That means, in particular, that these systems should exhibit the recently discovered general-relativistic weak-field effects within rotating tori: the dynamic anti-dragging and the deviation from the Keplerian motion induced by the fluid selfgravity...|$|R
25|$|One early {{attempt at}} {{lengthening}} the playing {{time should be}} mentioned. At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity,</b> controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device. As these were played from the outside to the inside, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed. This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the Philips Laser Disc.|$|R
50|$|Up until recently, {{the only}} {{recordings}} were a VHS of a televised production {{presented by the}} Metropolitan Opera in 1992 and a <b>Constant</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> LaserDisc of the same performance. The LaserDisc, published by Deutsche Grammophon, also includes a monochrome printed libretto. The LaserDisc version of the opera provides a digital sound track plus enhanced video resolution over the VHS recording. Graham Clark was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as Bégearss in this video. This recording was re-released on DVD on September 21, 2010, {{as part of the}} James Levine 40th anniversary DVD box set. It, like the other DVDs in the set, is now available separately.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, optical drives were {{developed}} with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 KiB/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend {{to require a}} constant bit rate. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives—until recently—operating with a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV).</b> The spiral groove of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200 RPM on the outer rim and 500 RPM on the inner.|$|E
40|$|Our {{goal with}} {{this paper is}} to {{contribute}} a common theoretical framework for studying the performance of disk-storage devices. Understanding the performance behavior of these devices will allow the prediction of the I/O cost in modern applications. Current disk technologies differ in terms of the fundamental modeling characteristics which include the magnetic/optical nature, the angular and linear velocities, the storage capacities and the transfer rates. Angular and linear velocities, storage capacities and transfer rates are made constant or variable in different existing disk products. Related work in this area has studied Constant Angular Velocity (CAV) magnetic disks and <b>Constant</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> optical disks.

The <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> scan solves the sampling problem but introduces significant distortion in the center.

40|$|Abstract. Camshaft {{is one of}} the key {{components}} of vehicle engines. In this paper, an independent optimization and simulation module for camshaft grinding was developed. First an optimization algorithm based on the least square method was proposed according to the <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> mathematical model of the camshaft. The algorithm can be used to smooth speed curves and improve machining efficiency and accuracy. Then the real time dynamic simulation of the camshaft grinding process was finished to perform the machining status according to the optimized motion path of the process system components...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an alternative method to the widely-used raster-scan technique for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). In this method, {{the sample is}} scanned in a spiral pattern instead of the well established raster trajectory. A spiral pattern is produced by applying cosine and sine signals with slowly varying amplitudes to the x-axis and y-axis of an AFM scanner respectively. In {{order to ensure that}} the spiral trajectory travels at a <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV),</b> frequency and amplitude of the input signals are varied simultaneously {{in a way that the}} linear velocity of the scanner is kept constant.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{retrieval}} performance of disk storage devices. In general, the fundamental modeling characteristics of disk device technologies are their magnetic/optical nature, the angular and linear velocities, their storage capacities and their transfer rates.

40|$|Periodic {{disturbance}} {{occurs in}} various applications {{on the control}} of the rotational mechanical systems. For optical disk drives, the spirally shaped tracks are usually not perfectly circular and the assembly of the disk and spindle motor is unavoidably eccentric. The resulting periodic disturbance is, therefore, synchronous with the disk rotation, and becomes particularly noticeable for the track following and focusing servo system. This paper applies a novel adaptive controller, namely Frequency Adaptive Control Technique (FACT), for rejecting the periodic runout and wobble effects in the optical disk drive with dual actuators. The control objective is to attenuate adaptively the specific frequency contents of periodic disturbances without amplifying its rest harmonics. FACT is implemented in a plug-in manner and provides a suitable framework for periodic disturbance rejection in the cases where the fundamental frequencies of the disturbance are alterable. It is shown that the convergence property of parameters in the proposed adaptive algorithm is exponentially stable. It is applicable to both the spindle modes of <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CLV)</b> and constant angular velocity (CAV) for various operation speeds. The experiments showed that the proposed FACT has successful improvement on the tracking and focusing performance of the CD-ROM, and is extended to various compact disk drives...|$|E
50|$|Optical discs {{with the}} {{exception}} of the DVD-RAM have their data encoded on a single spiral, or a groove, which covers the surface of the disc. In the case of recordable media, this spiral contains a slight sinusoidal deviation from a perfect spiral. The period of this sine curve corresponds to the wobble frequency. First of all, it is used as a synchronization source to achieve <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> while writing a disc. The frequencies quoted all assume that the disc is being written at the 'x1' speed. The frequencies are appropriately higher for faster writing speeds.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cylinder}} {{system had}} certain advantages. As noted, wax cylinders {{could be used}} for home recordings, and [...] "indestructible" [...] types could be played over and over many more times than the disc. Cylinders usually rotated twice as fast as contemporary discs, but the <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> was comparable to the innermost grooves of the disc. In theory, this would provide generally poorer audio fidelity. Furthermore, since constant angular <b>velocity</b> translates into <b>constant</b> <b>linear</b> <b>velocity</b> (the radius of the helical track is constant), cylinders were also free from inner groove problems suffered by disc recordings. Around 1900, cylinders were, on average, indeed of notably higher audio quality than contemporary discs, but as disc makers improved their technology by 1910 the fidelity differences between better discs and cylinders became minimal.|$|R
