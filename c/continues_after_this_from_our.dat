30|$|While {{focusing}} on the four sectors of cleanup, agriculture, electric power systems and the rail network, we attempt to combine our findings with measures of exposure to tephra fall. In this way, by relating consequences to hazard magnitude, we may help to better inform future risk analyses. In doing this, we consider only the major tephra deposition phase. Although eruptive activity <b>continued</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> period, tephra accumulation to the southeast and northeast was small and did not contribute greatly to observed impacts.|$|R

50|$|The year 1270 {{has been}} established, mistakenly for many historians, {{as the last}} step of a process {{initiated}} {{at the end of}} the 11th century. The judgment is hasty because the transfer of crusaders or mercenaries from the harbour of Aigues-Mortes <b>continued</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> year. The order given in 1275 to Sir Guillaume de Roussillon by Philip III the Bold and Pope Gregory X after the Council of Lyons in 1274 to reinforce Saint-Jean d'Acre in the East shows that maritime activity continued for a ninth crusade which never took place.|$|R
