40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> {{has been recognized}} as the most significant sediment response to the highly trained Mississippi River (MR). However, no quantitative study exists on the dynamics of emerged <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> and associated sediment accumulation in the last 500 -kilometer reach of the MR from the Gulf of Mexico outlet, {{also known as the}} lowermost Mississippi River. Such knowledge is especially critical for riverine sediment management to impede coastal land loss in the Mississippi River Delta. In this study, we utilized a series of satellite images taken from August 2010 to January 2012 to assess the changes in surface area and volume of three large emerged <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> in the lowermost MR following an unprecedented spring flood in 2011. River stage data were collected to develop a rating curve of surface areas detected by satellite images with flow conditions {{for each of the three}} bars. A uniform geometry associated with the areal change was assumed to estimate the bar volume changes. Our study reveals that the 2011 spring flood increased the surface area of the bars by 3. 5 % to 11. 1 %, resulting in a total surface increase of 7. 3 %, or 424, 000 m 2. Based on the surface area change, we estimated a total bar volume increase of 4. 4 %, or 1, 219, 900 m 3. This volume increase would be equivalent to a sediment trapping of approximately 1. 0 million metric tons, assuming a sediment bulk density of 1. 2 metric tons per cubic meter. This large quantity of sediment is likely an underestimation because of the neglect of subaqueous bar area change and the assumption of a uniform geometry in volume estimation. Nonetheless, the results imply that <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> in the lowermost MR are capable of capturing a substantial amount of sediment during floods, and that a thorough assessment of their long-term change can provide important insights into sediment trapping in the lowermost MR as well as the feasibility of proposed river sediment diversions...|$|R

40|$|Tidal bars in {{estuaries}} {{are poorly}} understood compared to fluvial bars. There is limited theory that predicts tidal bar dimensions. Moreover, where fluvial <b>channels</b> bifurcate around <b>bars,</b> tidal <b>channels</b> around <b>bars</b> often develop either flood- or ebb-dominance which remains unexplained. Tidal experiments are rare {{and have not}} reproduced these phenomena to date because these are usually highly ebb-dominated. Here we report preliminary experiments in a novel setup that produce tidal bars from an initial situation with flat bed and exactly symmetrical ebb- and flood-related sediment mobility. The bars initially develop in a saw-tooth pattern with mutually evasive ebb- and flood channels. The tips of the bars evolve further into lobate bars built up from sediment from excavating <b>channels.</b> The <b>bar</b> tips form steep and high obstructions for the opposing flow direction, which then diverges into evasive <b>channels.</b> The <b>bars</b> develop into a diamond shape as channels bifurcate and deepen around it. We further found that bar height correlates well to bar width but not with bar length, whilst bar length correlates well to the tidal excursion length. As the experiment progressed scour holes developed that affected the <b>channel</b> and <b>bar</b> pattern and are considered artifacts of the experiment. We conclude that the mutually evasive ebb- and flood-dominance of channels emerges simultaneously {{with the onset of}} tidal bar formation, and that these preliminary data confirm results from linear stability analyses.

Architecture elements of channel, overbank and floodplain facies of braided channel deposits were identified through an outcrops survey, and their proportion of channel facies have been quantitatively estimated from well logging. Characteristics of architecture elements, such as sand thickness, bounding surfaces and lithofacies were investigated through outcrops and core. Petrology of Shihezi sandstone has also been studied in detail. Analysis on sandstone components shows that monocrystalline quartz with approximately 76 % bulk volume, and lithic up to 5 %– 45 % bulk volume, are the two main components. Litharenite and lithic quartz sandstone are the main rock types. Compaction is concluded by former researchers as the control factor of low permeability.

40|$|The late-Holocene Mahakam delta, {{located along}} the {{tropical}} eastern shore of Kalimantan, Indonesia, {{is considered to}} be a textbook example of a mixed tide-fluvial dominated delta system. The delta prograded about 60 km during the past 5000 years, which led to the development of a distinct network of distributary and tidal channels. Wave action is low due the limited fetch in the narrow strait of Makassar. Mahakam River discharge is about a quarter of the Mississippi River discharge and is characterized by absence of flood surges. Therefore, natural levees, crevasse splays and avulsions are absent in the delta plain. For the past four decennia, both modern and ancient Mahakam delta deposits have been studied in detail in order to better understand subsurface Miocene and Tertiary Mahakam deposits, which host large volumes of hydrocarbons. This study focuses on the dynamics and stratal patterns of delta plain, delta-front platform deposits and suspended sediments. Due to the predominance of semi-diurnal tides and the associated flow reversals, depositional patterns are highly variable which has resulted in the formation of characteristic sand-mud couplets. The distribution of the sand-mud couplets found in this study differs from previously proposed conceptual models. They are limited to the fluvial domain and form in the distributary channels (lateral <b>channel</b> <b>bar)</b> or at the fluvial dominated delta-front platform, which flanks the mouth bar deposits in offshore direction. The sand-mud couplets which formed as delta-front platform and lateral <b>channel</b> <b>bar</b> deposits are similar and can only be identified based on their 14 C age. The sand content decreases significantly towards the tidal dominated areas due to limitation in transport capacity. Turbidity measurements taken in front of the river mouth also show rapid settlement of river plume sediments. Some 22 new AMS 14 C dates show that late Holocene sea level history resembles the eustatic sea level curve giving a first approximation of the Late Holocene sea level history for East Kalimantan. The dates suggest that the progradational delta system evolved under conditions of slowly rising sea level, which compares well to the eustatic sea level curve. In addition, calculated averaged deposition rates of the sand-mud couplets indicate that deposition is driven by the spring-neap tide cycles instead of the daily tidal cycl...|$|E

In this study, we analyzed 3 -decadal morphological changes of the 10 -km river channel and the three bars to elucidate {{the long-term effects of}} river engineering including diversion, revetment and dike constructions. Satellite images captured between 1985 and 2015 in approximate 5 -year intervals were selected to estimate the change of <b>channel</b> morphology and <b>bar</b> surface area. The images were chosen based on river stage heights at the time when they were captured to exclude the temporal water height effect on <b>channel</b> and <b>bar</b> morphology. Using a set of the satellite images captured during the period of 1984 – 1986 and of 2013 – 2014, we developed rating curves of emerged bar surface area with the corresponding river stage height for determining the change in bar volume from 1985 to 2013. Two of the three bars have grown substantially in the past 30 years, while one bar has become braided and its surface area has shrunken. As a whole, there were a net gain of 4, 107, 000  m 2 in surface area and a net gain of 30, 271, 000  m 3 in volume, an equivalent of approximately 36 million metric tons of sediment assuming a bulk density of 1. 2  t/m 3. Sediment trapping on the bars was prevalent during the spring floods, especially during the period of 1990 – 1995 and of 2007 – 2011 when large floods occurred.

40|$|Abstract: The Brahmaputra {{is one of}} the world's {{greatest}} rivers, ranking {{fifth in}} terms of discharge and eleventh in terms of drainage area. It also has a very high sediment discharge, ranking third in the world. The river is braided with meta-stable islands and nodal reaches, mobile sand bars, shifting anabranches and severe bank erosion. The dominant discharge is about 38 000 cumecs, which is a high in-bank flow. Islands have top elevations that are adjusted to bankfull discharge, with a spacing scaled on the width of the primary <b>channel.</b> <b>Bar</b> top elevations are adjusted to the dominant discharge and bars are scaled on the width of the major anabranches. The dominant bedforms are large dunes caled on the third order sub-channels of the major anabranches. Sustained right bank erosion has occurred uring the last 35 years, with average rates of about 90 m per year.

40|$|Cueva Antón is a Middle Paleolithic rockshelter {{located in}} {{the valley of the}} River Mula (Murcia, Spain). The archeological {{investigation}} of the site, which began with salvage work in 1991, resumed in 2006 and is still ongoing, uncovered a succession spanning most of MIS 3 and MIS 4 (ca. 75 e 36 ka) and featuring a well preserved human occupation record. This paper presents the first information about site stratigraphy and site formation processes. Geoarcheological data collected in the field and through micromorphological observation show that the archeological succession at Cueva Antón is mainly composed of alluvial sediments, with thin intercalations of gravitational and slope material. The sedimentary characteristics of the alluvial succession are well preserved {{as the result of a}} rapid accumulation rate and the protective effect of the rockshelter. Several sedimentary facies produced by the shifting of distinct fluvial sub-environments (<b>channel,</b> <b>bar</b> and floodplain) are recognized. With the exception of a few units (II-u, a thin buried alluvial soil, and the archeologically richest units at the base of the succession), postdepositional modification is rare. The site was occupied within a framework of infrequent, short-term visits, resulting in a relatively low overall density of finds and the formation of well-defined archeological lenses that correspond to synchronous paleosurfaces preserving the spatial distribution of finds and features. This pattern explains the limited anthropogenic evidence observed in thin sections, even those from units where archeological excavation uncovered significant remains of human occupation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{thickness}} {{and lateral}} distribution {{of sand and}} mud beds and bedsets on <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> from the tidally influenced Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, are quantitatively assessed. Fifty-six vibracores totalling ca 114 m of vertical section are used to tabulate bed thicknesses. Statistical calculations are undertaken for nine <b>channel</b> <b>bars</b> ranging from the freshwater and tidal zone, to the sustained brackish water and tidal zone. The data reveal that thickness trends can be organized into three groups that broadly correspond to time-averaged hydrodynamic and salinity conditions in the various distributary channels. Thick sand beds (up to 30 cm) and thin mud beds (up to 5 cm) characterize the freshwater tidal zone. The tidal and freshwater to brackish-water transition zone comprises thin sands (up to 10 cm) and thicker muds (up to 19 cm), and the sustained brackish water tidal zone consists of thin muds (up to 6 cm) with relatively thicker sands (up to 25 cm). The {{results suggest that the}} locus of mud deposition occurs in the tidal freshwater to brackish-water zone, probably reflecting mud flocculation and deposition at the turbidity maximum. Landward of the turbidity maximum, mud deposition is linked to tidal influence (tidal backwater effect and reverse eddy currents on channel margins) as mud beds thin in the landward direction. These results support the hypothesis that mud deposition is greatest at the turbidity maximum and decreases in both the seaward and landward direction. This study also showcases that mud-bed thicknesses are greatest towards the turbidity maximum and thin in both the landward and seaward direction.
