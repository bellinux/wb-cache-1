2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and <b>centerless</b> thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the <b>centerless</b> thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as <b>centerless</b> grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common <b>centerless</b> thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

50|$|<b>Centerless</b> {{grinding}} is {{when the}} workpiece {{is supported by a}} blade instead of by centers or chucks. Two wheels are used. The larger one is used to grind the surface of the workpiece and the smaller wheel is used to regulate the axial movement of the workpiece. Types of <b>centerless</b> grinding include through-feed grinding, in-feed/plunge grinding, and internal <b>centerless</b> grinding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Centerless</b> {{grinding}} is a {{machining process}} that uses abrasive cutting to remove material from a workpiece. <b>Centerless</b> grinding differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture {{is used to}} locate and secure the workpiece; the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels, and the speed of their rotation relative to each other determines {{the rate at which}} material is removed from the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Every simple Lie algebra has {{a unique}} real form whose {{corresponding}} <b>centerless</b> Lie group is compact.
