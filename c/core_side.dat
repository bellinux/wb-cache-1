In fact, the incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the bicalutamide and placebo groups (6.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively) in the [...] trial, whereas diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with flutamide. The rate of nausea and vomiting appears to be lower with bicalutamide and flutamide than with nilutamide (approximately 30% incidence of nausea with nilutamide, usually rated as mild-to-moderate). In addition, bicalutamide (and flutamide) is not associated with alcohol intolerance, visual disturbances, or a high rate of interstitial pneumonitis. In terms of toxicity and rare reactions, as described above, bicalutamide appears to have the lowest relative risks of hepatotoxicity and interstitial pneumonitis, with respective incidences far below those of flutamide and nilutamide.

The structure of Ala 2 Ile 2 - 6 reveals a completely new fold formed by a conformational “flip ” of the two protomers around the dimeric interface. The free-energy profile of Ala 2 Ile 2 - 6 is also {{very different from that}} of wild-type Rop. Ala 2 Ile 2 - 6 has a higher melting temperature than Rop, but undergoes a slightly smaller free-energy change on unfolding. Conclusions: The structure of Ala 2 Ile 2 - 6, along with molecular modeling results, demonstrate the importance of tight packing of core residues and the adoption of favorable <b>core</b> <b>side</b> chain rotamer values in determining helix-helix interactions in the four-helix bundle fold.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{its small}} size, chicken villin {{headpiece}} subdomain HP 36 folds into the native structure with a stable hydrophobic core within several microseconds. How {{such a small}} protein keeps up its conformational stability and fast folding in solution {{is an important issue}} for understanding molecular mechanisms of protein folding. In this study, we performed multicanonical replica-exchange simulations of HP 36 in explicit water, starting from a fully extended conformation. We observed at least five events of HP 36 folding into nativelike conformations. The smallest backbone root mean-square deviation from the crystal structure was 1. 1 Å. In the nativelike conformations, the stably formed hydrophobic core was fully dehydrated. Statistical analyses of the simulation trajectories show the following sequential events in folding of HP 36 : 1), Helix 3 is formed at the earliest stage; 2), the backbone and the side chains near the loop between Helices 2 and 3 take nativelike conformations; and 3), the side-chain packing at the hydrophobic core and the dehydration of the <b>core</b> <b>side</b> chains take place simultaneously at the later stage of folding. This sequence suggests that the initial folding nucleus is not necessarily the same as the hydrophobic core, consistent with a recent experimental ϕ-value analysis...|$|E

By increasing the temperature or pressure difference and by feeding reducing gases like methane or ethane to the permeate side to consume the permeated oxygen, hydrogen production rate or N 2 O conversion could be enhanced. A hydrogen production rate of 3. 1 cm(3) min(- 1) cm(- 2) was obtained at 950 degrees C. When methane {{was used as the}} reducing gas on the shell side, the oxygen concentration on the N 2 O side can be kept at a low level, thus avoiding the inhibition of the N 2 O decomposition by adsorbed surface oxygen species.
