40|$|IBISCA-Panama ("Investigating the BIodiversity of Soil and Canopy Arthropods", Panama module) {{represents}} a large-scale research initiative {{to quantify the}} spatial distribution of arthropod biodiversity in a Neotropical forest, {{using a combination of}} (1) international collaboration, (2) a set of common research questions, and (3) an integrated experimental design. Here, we present the rationale of the programme, describe the study sites, and outline field protocols. In the San Lorenzo Protected Area of Panama, twelve 20 x 20 m sites, all less than 2 km apart, were surveyed for plants and arthropods, from the ground to the upper canopy. Access to the canopy and its fauna was facilitated by fogging, single-rope techniques and a variety of devices such as a canopy crane, the "SolVin-Bretzel" <b>canopy</b> <b>raft,</b> the canopy bubble and Ikos. IBISCA-Panama represented the first attempt to combine these complementary techniques of canopy access in a large-scale investigation. Such techniques provided spatial replication during initial field work performed in September-October 2003. Temporal replication across seasons consisted of subsequent field work of varying intensity during dry, early wet and late wet periods in 2004. Arthropods were surveyed using 14 different protocols targeting the soil, litter, understorey, mid-canopy and upper canopy habitats. These protocols included: WINKLER sifting; BERLESE-TULLGREN; hand-collecting of galls and social insects; fogging; beating; woodrearing; baits; and various types of traps such as pitfall, small and large flight-interception, sticky, light, and Malaise traps. Currently, analyses of arthropod distribution in this forest concentrate on a set of 63 focal taxa representing different phylogenies and lifehistories. IBISCA-Panama may be considered as a model for largescale research programmes targeting invertebrate biodiversity. Its collaborative modus operandi can be applied to answer a variety of pressing ecological questions related to forest biodiversity, as evidenced by the recent development of further IBISCA programmes {{in other parts of the}} world.

Used by ski patrol to protect a skier shaken by a fall, the blanket retains up to 80 % of user's body heat preventing post accident shock or chills. Carried by many types of emergency teams, blanket is large when unfolded, but folds into a package {{no larger than a}} deck of cards.

40|$|Executive {{summary of}} {{certification}} marketing lessons learned Costa Rica has become positioned {{in the world}} tourist market as a nature-based and ecotourism destination, with a large component of complementary offerings in beaches and adventure tourism (<b>canopy</b> activities, <b>rafting,</b> surfing, etc.). There is an additional component of all-inclusive beach resorts, golf, and congresses and conventions. The country’s comparative advantage has been ecotourism, {{but some of the}} market is shifting to more traditional resort tourism. In order to preserve the country’s positioning, the Costa Rican Tourist Board (Instituto Costarricense de Turismo – ICT) developed a sustainable tourism certification scheme for lodging enterprises, called Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST). This system was explicitly designed to certify all lodging sectors, not just ecotourism, in order to motivate all of the industry, including large beach and urban hotels, into exemplary environmental and sociocultural practices and protect the country’s image as nature-friendly and conservationist. CST became a prestigious program within the small world of certification and it was proposed and accepted as possible system for all of Central America, but has now been restricted to Costa Rica and the border areas of Panama and Nicaragua. There has been a strong desire expressed b...|$|R
50|$|The Cacao Route {{consists}} of various cacao haciendas, where guides give lessons {{on how the}} plant is cultivated and the cacao bean is harvested, then processed into chocolate. It also includes {{a visit to the}} Comalcalco archeological site. The Cacao Route focuses on the municipalities of Nacajuca, Jalpa de Méndez, Comalcalco and Paraíso. In Nacajuca, located on the river of the same name, the main attractions are its boardwalk area, handcrafts and surrounding Chontal villages such as Tucta, Mazateupa, Oxiacaque, Tecoluta and Guatacalca, where many customs and the Chontal language are preserved. In Jalpa de Méndez, the main attractions are its gourd handcrafts, the San Remo cigar factory, the La Encantada Turtle Farm and the Pomposú Juliva Wetlands on the Mezcalapa River. In Comalcalco, attractions include the Comalcalco archeological site, cacao haciendas such as La Luz with its Cacao Museum, Jesús María, La Chonita and Cholula. Paraíso is a small port with beaches and some resort facilities. The River Route is based in the interior portion of the state, between the Grijalva and Usumacinta Rivers. This is an ecotourism route with activities such as <b>canopy</b> climbing, <b>rafting</b> and rappelling. There is also an option to visit the Ponomá archeological site. The River Route is on the interior portion of the state. It includes the Cascadas de Reforma Ecological Reserve, the Reforma Mayan archeological site, the Dr. José Gómez Pánaco Museum, the El Popalillo Lake and the Ribera de Acallán lookout point.|$|R
